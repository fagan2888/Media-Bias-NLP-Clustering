The flatness of scripted Trump (and perhaps weak writing by the \u201cSNL\u201d team) makes the anticipation and fear seem a bit strange in retrospect. This man who is often so unintentionally funny in the purportedly serious setting of national politics was, one on of the funniest shows on TV, rarely even amusing.\n\nBut a stranger development has now appeared: The other GOP candidates may be able to appeal to a similar length of exposure on NBC \u2013 12 minutes and five seconds, it turns out. The FCC\u2019s \u201cEqual Time\u201d rule means \u2013 as the Hollywood Reporter explains:\n\n\u2026 if a broadcast station gives one candidate airtime in anything other than a newscast or news interview program, the other candidates shall be afforded equal opportunity. This potentially means that Trump\u2019s rivals from Marco Rubio and Ben Carson to Lindsay Graham and George Pataki can request an equal opportunity to appear on-air for free to deliver their own message to voters.\n\nThe candidates have seven days from Trump\u2019s appearance to file for their equal time. This seems at the very least a bit scary for those of us who watch television. The candidates are not likely to get a stint hosting \u201cSNL\u201d \u2014 they\u2019d probably end up on a news program \u2014 but makes you wonder how a few of the candidates might spend their allotted airtime on Lorne Michaels\u2019s show.\n\nBen Carson:\n\nThe neurosurgeon has arisen from obscurity to become almost overexposed, which puts him in an odd position. As a comedy figure, he\u2019s a wildcard: Low-key to the point of comatose, he also opens up about his outrageous beliefs about slavery, the Holocaust, the pyramids, and who knows what else is coming.\n\nAn \u201cSNL\u201d cold open could offer more comedy than anything Trump offered by simply having Carson revisit some of his classic assertions (\u201cYou know Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d will be hard to beat as the race\u2019s greatest punchline) with a drowsy delivery that is the opposite of Trump\u2019s pumped-up emptiness. Maybe set him in a New York bar \u2013 closing time, just him and an oddball bartender, a la Kate McKinnon and Hillary Clinton \u2014 and watch the sparks fly?\n\nOr how about a skit based on this hilarious post by Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas, in which Ben Carson and the \u201cBlack Klingon Jesus\u201d from Carson\u2019s own portrait hang out at a YMCA sauna?\n\nJeb Bush:\n\nIn some ways, Bush is the opposite of Trump. He\u2019s a straight-up-the-middle establishment candidate to Trump\u2019s belligerent wildman, but it\u2019s hard to imagine his \u201cSNL\u201d appearance coming off any better. His recent book of collected emails makes clear that whatever his good qualities, he may be the least funny political candidate in decades. Please, keep this man off the air \u2013 for everyone\u2019s sake.\n\nMarco Rubio:\n\nYoung, genial, handsome, Rubio does not have much to say when he is not attacking the liberal media. Twelve minutes of this guy could very likely be as bad as Bush. What\u2019s the matter with Florida? The only entertaining outcome here is Rubio slipping into a right-of-center 12-minute freestyle rap inspired by his heroes Eminem and Tupac.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just imagine the low-grade disasters if these guys demand their 12 minutes and 5 seconds on the network VIDEO", "title": "Thanks for nothing, \u201cSNL\u201d and Donald Trump: Welcome to the nightmare of \u201cequal time\u201d for these GOP candidates", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Just imagine the low-grade disasters if these guys demand their 12 minutes and 5 seconds on the network VIDEO", "title": "Thanks for nothing, \u201cSNL\u201d and Donald Trump: Welcome to the nightmare of \u201cequal time\u201d for these GOP candidates", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/09/thanks_for_nothing_snl_and_donald_trump_welcome_to_the_nightmare_of_equal_time_for_these_gop_candidates/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/christie_carson_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just imagine the low-grade disasters if these guys demand their 12 minutes and 5 seconds on the network VIDEO", "title": "Thanks for nothing, \u201cSNL\u201d and Donald Trump: Welcome to the nightmare of \u201cequal time\u201d for these GOP candidates", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/christie_carson_paul.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Saturday Night Live, SNL, TV, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s a straight-up-the-middle establishment candidate to Trump\u2019s belligerent wildman, but it\u2019s hard to imagine his \u201cSNL\u201d appearance coming off any better.\nThe candidates have seven days from Trump\u2019s appearance to file for their equal time.\nThe flatness of scripted Trump (and perhaps weak writing by the \u201cSNL\u201d team) makes the anticipation and fear seem a bit strange in retrospect.\nThose who feared Trump\u2019s appearance were bracing for a demagogue, or at least someone funny or charming enough that he would persuade people to take him seriously, maybe even vote for him.\nThe only entertaining outcome here is Rubio slipping into a right-of-center 12-minute freestyle rap inspired by his heroes Eminem and Tupac."}
