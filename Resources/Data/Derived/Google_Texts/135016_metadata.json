I see this in some respects as refining my craft,\u201d he says. \u201cReagan did it the other way, right?\u201d\n\nBelow are excerpts of the conversation, condensed and edited for clarity:\n\nHave you gotten the itch to get back into politics?\n\nAbsolutely. I can\u2019t sit here and watch our country decline in stature as dramatically as it has in the last five years and not be concerned about the future of America. I just look at the overall culture of the country and see a lot of people who are fearful, don\u2019t believe that good times are coming, feel like there are people out there left behind. That\u2019s a very dangerous thing for a democracy.\n\nWith regard to Crimea, what would you do differently than Obama?\n\nIt\u2019s really important to understand this situation didn\u2019t happen overnight. This was five years in the making. Year one, we pull our missile defense system out of Poland and the Czech Republic. So we send a signal: we\u2019re going to reset with Russia, and Putin is going to work with us. What do we get for that? Virtually nothing.\n\nSo you go through a whole variety of other things\u2014from what we did in Iran during the revolution, which was nothing; turning our back on Mubarak; what we did in Syria. I would not have drawn a red line on chemical weapons. I thought it was a mistake to do it. But he did. And he didn\u2019t follow through. He punted to Putin. What we\u2019ve seen over time is the President serially deferring, backing away from red lines or lines in the sand, saying that the US needs not to be involved in all these things. You send a signal.\n\nThis president has singlehandedly elevated Vladimir Putin from a babysitter over a bunch of oligarchs to a world leader who\u2019s now grabbing territory with no consequence. What can you do now given this? Well, you can try to repair an image, to show you mean what you say and you will stand by the countries that we have promised to stand by. We have not done so in Ukraine. So now what do you think if you\u2019re Lithuania, Estonia, Poland? What do you think if you\u2019re Georgia? You think the U.S.\u2019s commitments aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re printed on. And as a result of that, you start having to make deals with the devil. And then things really get out of hand.\n\nHere\u2019s a president whose main goal is stopping nuclear proliferation, to get a deal with the Russians, which was a bad deal that gave the Russians a decided edge in nuclear weapons \u2013 that was his big thing, START II. And what he\u2019s done is start a nuclear arms race because the U.S. is not standing by its commitments.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Barack Obama who has been advocating a more cautious foreign policy. It\u2019s also Republicans.\n\nAgreed. You\u2019ve seen me out there taking on the Paul faction. I did during the campaign. I took on Ron Paul at debate after debate on Iran, on Pakistan. I see the Rand Paul wing of the Republican Party for what it is: allied with Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy. I think that\u2019s a very serious threat to our own security.\n\nHow do you convince the young voters this faction is reaching out to that this is the wrong course?\n\nWhat we have to do is have the people who believe in the conservative message go out and articulate a positive vision for the country based on those principles. You can deliver a positive message for the country on national security without saying we need to be in a war in every country. Which of course we can\u2019t do, and we wouldn\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t mean we need to disengage. There\u2019s a cost to disengagement.\n\nThere was a lot of soul-searching within the party after Romney lost. What\u2019s the best thing the GOP has done since, and what has been the worst?\n\nIn both cases, Obamacare. The objective of focusing on Obamacare is the right thing; the tactics [that led to the shutdown] were not well thought-out. And the problem is it created a division within the Republican Party that doesn\u2019t do us any good. It created a black hole right before their black hole, which was the implementation of Obamacare. Why would you create that moment right before it becomes apparent to the American public that you were right?\n\nDo you think you would have beaten Obama?\n\nWithout a doubt.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I would have been able to attract the voters in the states that mattered. Romney would probably do better than me in New Jersey and California and New York. But I\u2019d do better in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia\u2014in the states that were going to decide the election. Look at how we did in Ohio in the primary. We got outspent by huge amounts. I didn\u2019t run a single ad in the Cleveland market, and we still almost beat him in Ohio.\n\nIf you ran again in two years, how would you do things differently?\n\nI\u2019d raise a lot more money. We\u2019d have to have a stronger team, and a stronger fundraising base. [In 2012,] I had to establish myself in the conservative world as sort of the authentic conservative across the board, including moral and cultural issues. A lot of people didn\u2019t know that much about me and my positions on those issues. So I had to, on occasion, talk about it. And of course any time I did, there\u2019s Santorum out there talking about social issues.\n\nBy the time it got down to me and Romney, I talked mostly about Obamacare on the campaign trail. But I was able to talk more about the blue-collar stuff, energy and manufacturing. Things like that really started to create some momentum for us. But by then, I was the social conservative candidate, the alternative to Romney. And what I said and the policies that I put forward, they just didn\u2019t get any coverage. This time around I don\u2019t have to go out and prove by bona fides on being a conservative. I can focus in on how I differentiate myself from the rest of the field and how I think we can develop a winning message for the fall.\n\nWhat\u2019s your sense of the 2016 field?\n\nI\u2019m the guy that sat there last time and watched seven people go to the top of the pack and fall.\n\nThere might be twelve this time.\n\nYou know what, they can get to the top of the pack and fall too. One of the things I know is that when I got to the top of the pack I didn\u2019t fall. I ran out of money, and I ran out of time. And the forces were against me. It\u2019s tough running against City Hall.\n\nThe amazing thing, here we are looking at 2016, and many of the national polls don\u2019t even put my name on the list. They review the candidates, and I\u2019m not included on the list of people who they look at, which I sort of get a kick out of. It\u2019s sort of been my strength over the course of my political career that I\u2019m always underestimated. Always. The Democrats did that for a long time and I won four straight races. And now it\u2019s happening on the Republican side.\n\nWhat lessons does Pope Francis offer to conservatives?\n\nThere have been a lot of people who have been led astray, doctrinally and otherwise, by the liberalism of the Church, the scandals within the Church. And what Francis is saying is look, what they just need to hear is the good news. They need to hear that God loves them, and that here\u2019s the Gospel and the Gospel\u2019s for you. And so he\u2019s tried to focus his message on the average guy. And so I think that\u2019s a good message for Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Pennsylvania senator is considering another shot at the White House", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In an interview with TIME, the former Pennsylvania senator who finished second to Romney in 2012 says he's sure he would have defeated Obama had he won the GOP nomination.
