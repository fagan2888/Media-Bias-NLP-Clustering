CHARLES CITY, Iowa- Neurosurgeon and Republican Presidential Candidate Dr. Ben Carson spoke to a standing room only crowd at Dave’s Restaurant in Charles City where about 300 onlookers listened to what Carson stands for.

Many of the candidates have a strong focus on gun control, and national security, and spend a large portion of the time speaking about what needs to be done; Carson, however spoke on other issues that stand out to him, such as strengthening the private sector to cut down on federal hand outs, something that resonates strongly with Tiffany Mustard.

Mustard says Carson’s religious beliefs are what draw her to the candidate, enough so to bring her out to her first caucus.

“I just think it’s really important that people want to protect children and the right to be born and I really believe that he stands for. That’s really important to me,” says Mustard, a Charles City resident.

Carson says by strengthening the private sector and eliminating federal hand outs, issues like Mustard’s concerns would be handled.

“One of the reasons that the government has mushroomed is because of the the way it’s taken on a lot of the responsibilities that used to be the private sector responsibilities,” says Dr. Ben Carson. ‘It’s relationships that actually solve our problems. It is not bureaucracy that solves our problems.”

While Mustard says she is not sure what to expect during her first ever caucus, her and her kids are looking for a change in America.

“We really wanted, they really want to see our countrythat we would change for the better and really love to see people bringing good moral values back into this country.” says Mustard. “That’s something that’s important to both of them.”
