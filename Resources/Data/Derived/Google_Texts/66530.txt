SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California lawmakers of both parties are calling for a ban on Confederate flags displayed on federal property and state capitols.

Democratic Assemblywoman Shirley Weber of San Diego says confederate flags shouldn’t be displayed in honor but should instead be presented as a reminder of the country’s dark days.

The joint resolution calls on Congress to enact restrictions on the flag. The California Assembly unanimously approved AJR26 with 74 votes.

The Confederate flag has come under scrutiny nationwide after the killings of nine parishioners at a historically black church in South Carolina by an alleged white supremacist.

South Carolina has since removed the flag from its state capitol. Other states are now revisiting where it’s displayed.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation last year banning Confederate Flag images from California property.
