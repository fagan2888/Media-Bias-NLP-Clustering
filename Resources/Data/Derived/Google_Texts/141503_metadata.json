(NYSE: VTR) in mid-2015 as a pure-play REIT focused on the skilled nursing facility market. Lewis said the transition went well.\n\n\u201cWe were very well prepared, and the spin couldn\u2019t have gone smoother,\u201d Lewis observed.\n\nMarket reception toward the new REIT has been \u201cexcellent,\u201d he added. Lewis noted that Care Capital\u2019s investment-grade balance sheet puts the company in a position to capitalize on a large, fragmented market. He noted that the market currently provides \u201cexcellent\u201d external investment opportunities.\n\nLewis pointed out that as Care Capital meets with its new investors, one theme the company has emphasized is that skilled nursing is going to be a beneficiary of the Affordable Care Act, which will emphasize quality, low-cost care. \u201cOur operators are extremely well-positioned to provide that,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Lewis commented on the lessons he has learned from working with Debra Cafaro, Ventas\u2019 chairman and CEO.
