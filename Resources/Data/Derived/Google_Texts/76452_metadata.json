Ad Policy\n\nAlabama is one of 20 states that have refused to accept federal money to expand their Medicaid programs through the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s left more than 3 million people across the country, including at least 185,000 Alabamans, stranded in a coverage gap\u2014not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, but too poor to afford insurance on their own. A disproportionate number of those are people of color, and they\u2019re concentrated in Southern states.\n\nBut in a few parts of the Deep South, ideological pettiness is starting to give way to practical considerations. Dial\u2019s comments came at the final meeting of a task force appointed by Governor Robert Bentley to study the state\u2019s health challenges, which, to put it mildly, are daunting. Alabama ranks near the bottom of the country in rates of diabetes, sexually transmitted infections, infant mortality, and premature death. More than 13 percent of the population is uninsured, in part because the state has a stringent limit for Medicaid eligibility: parents making over 18 percent of the poverty level, or $3,616 for a family of three, don\u2019t qualify.\n\nBentley\u2019s task force concluded that that the \u201cmost serious obstacle\u201d to addressing all of those problems is the \u201ccoverage gap that makes health insurance inaccessible to hundreds of thousands of Alabamians.\u201d The panel voted, with no opposition, to recommend an \u201cAlabama-driven solution\u201d for expanding Medicaid. (A handful of states, including Arkansas, have developed state-specific alternatives for the expansion.) Doing so would extend insurance coverage to about 290,000 people, including 185,000 working Alabamans, the task force said. It would also pump $1.7 billion into the state\u2019s health infrastructure, and another $1.2 billion throughout the local economy. The tax revenues should offset the state\u2019s share of the cost, which peaks at 10 percent in 2020.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alabama_healthcare_protest_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Zo\u00eb Carpenter", "description": "Gerald Dial, a Republican state senator from Alabama, expressed something of an unlikely opinion last week. \u201cSomebody is going to have to pay some more taxes,\u201d Dial said, so that Alabama can boost health insurance coverage for the poor.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Gerald Dial, a Republican state senator from Alabama, expressed something of an unlikely opinion last week. \u201cSomebody is going to have to pay some more taxes,\u201d Dial said, so that Alabama can boost health insurance coverage for the poor.", "title": "Is a Medicaid Turnabout Coming to the Deep South?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/is-a-medicaid-turnabout-coming-to-the-deep-south/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alabama_healthcare_protest_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2015-11-24T15:51:44+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gerald Dial, a Republican state senator from Alabama, expressed something of an unlikely opinion last week. \u201cSomebody is going to have to pay some more taxes,\u201d Dial said, so that Alabama can boost health insurance coverage for the poor.", "title": "Is a Medicaid Turnabout Coming to the Deep South?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/is-a-medicaid-turnabout-coming-to-the-deep-south/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alabama_healthcare_protest_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alabama_healthcare_protest_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "November 24th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "Is a Medicaid Turnabout Coming to the Deep South?", "keywords": "campaigns and elections, healthcare policy, poverty, states, affordable care act, health insurance, medicaid", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 195201, "sailthru.tags": "Campaigns and Elections,Healthcare Policy,Poverty,States,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "medicaid", "published_time": "2015-11-24T15:10:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T15:51:44+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/zcarpenter/"}, "sailthru.description": "An election in Louisiana and a surprising recommendation from an Alabama task force are the latest cracks in\u00a0red-state resistance to insuring the poor.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alabama_healthcare_protest_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It would also pump $1.7 billion into the state\u2019s health infrastructure, and another $1.2 billion throughout the local economy.\n\u201cSomebody is going to have to pay some more taxes,\u201d Dial said, so that Alabama can boost health insurance coverage for the poor.\nDoing so would extend insurance coverage to about 290,000 people, including 185,000 working Alabamans, the task force said.\n(A handful of states, including Arkansas, have developed state-specific alternatives for the expansion.)\nBut in a few parts of the Deep South, ideological pettiness is starting to give way to practical considerations."}
