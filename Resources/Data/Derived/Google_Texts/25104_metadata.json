To win GOP primaries, they have to bash government health care programs as bad.\n\nAccording to former Texas Medical Association executive Kim Ross, the physician-lawmakers may sincerely hold such views, even though health care accounts for about one-third of all state spending and government is a huge player in their economic sector.\n\n\u201cMost physicians are at best apolitical, and tend to vote their zip code rather than their professional interests,\u201d said Ross, who was the doctor group\u2019s vice president of public affairs and top lobbyist from 1986 through 2002. \u201cThey are not concentrated in the 5th Ward [in inner-city Houston] or a South Texas colonia.\u201d\n\nFormer Sen. Bob Deuell of Greenville, who lost to tea party-backed insurgent Bob Hall in last year\u2019s GOP primary, said that a few years ago, there was only \u201ca little hope\u201d the Republican-controlled Legislature would consider coverage-expansion proposals, even those stressing recipients\u2019 personal responsibility and private insurers\u2019 involvement.\n\nAlthough Texas leads the nation in the share of its population lacking coverage, such debates have died, he said.\n\n\u201cThe newer people can\u2019t really discuss the ins and outs of health care,\u201d said Deuell, a family doctor. \u201cThey just say they\u2019re against it.\u201d\n\nJohn Davidson, health care analyst for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said doctors\u2019 views vary widely on the merits of Obamacare\u2019s proposed Medicaid expansion, which state GOP leaders have fiercely resisted.\n\nMany are skeptical of the state\u2019s Medicaid program and disillusioned with how the Affordable Care Act has spawned purchases of doctors\u2019 practices by hospital chains and mergers of huge national health insurance companies, he said.\n\n\u201cIndividual physicians are a lot more ambivalent about the [act] than, say, people who run managed-care companies or hospital system administrators, who generally tend to be for it because it benefits them and what they do,\u201d he said.\n\nRichmond GOP Rep. John Zerwas, an ally of Speaker Joe Straus, is an anesthesiologist who has experience as a hospital administrator. Zerwas has advocated trying to negotiate a \u201cTexas solution\u201d with the Obama administration that would allow the state to draw down scores of billions in federal Medicaid funds but make demands of the newly covered adults, who would have private coverage and health savings accounts.\n\n\u201cWe ought to have a real vibrant conversation about that and consider what the pros and cons of doing it are,\u201d he said.\n\nZerwas acknowledged, though, that he\u2019s outnumbered \u2013 not just in the GOP caucus but the \u201cwhite coat\u201d caucus.\n\nThrough the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, the Texas Legislature had, at most, one or two doctor members, Ross said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper\u2019s review of a 2014 compilation by the American Medical Association, which included assistance by the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, 17 states have no doctors in their legislatures.\n\nTexas has two in the Senate, four in the House. The Texas Legislature ranks third in its percentage of doctor-lawmakers \u2013 3.3 percent. Only in Nevada and Utah did docs wield a bigger presence \u2014 4.8 percent in each. However, Utah has only five doctor-lawmakers; and Nevada, three. Their legislatures have 104 and 63 members, respectively, compared with 181 in Texas.\n\nMore doctors may head to Austin for the 2017 session. None of the current six has drawn major opposition. In recent weeks, three Republican doctors announced that in next year\u2019s elections, they\u2019ll run in districts with open seats. Two are seeking to replace retiring Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, while the third wants the House seat of retiring Rep. Allen Fletcher, R-Cypress.\n\nThough there are big decisions to be made about whether $6.2 billion a year in special federal Medicaid \u201cwaiver\u201d money will continue to flow to Texas and whether the state should seek a \u201cwaiver for state innovation\u201d in 2017, two experts said they don\u2019t expect much to happen.\n\nDeuell, the former senator, cited uncertainty over who will succeed President Barack Obama \u2013 a Democrat or a Republican. If it\u2019s a Republican, much will depend on \u201cwhether you have a Cruz or a Kasich in the White House,\u201d he said, referring to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Cruz has vowed to repeal every syllable of Obamacare, while Kasich expanded Medicaid in his state.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s just putting it off until they see who the new president is,\u201d Deuell said of Texas lawmakers.\n\nRoss, the former doctor\u2019s association lobbyist, said state Republicans must constantly watch their right flank.\n\n\u201cOur bootstrap, \u2018it\u2019s your own damn fault you got sick\u2019 political culture tends to work against clinically motivated proposals like expanding coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care spending is viewed as a social welfare program wasted on the unworthy poor rather than an investment in local community infrastructure to assure population health.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS93aGlsZS10ZXhhcy1sZWdpc2xhdHVyZS1zZWF0cy10aGUtbW9zdC1kb2N0b3JzLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXN0aWxsLW9uLWJhY2stYnVybmVyLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
