And it covers all health-care practices of such entities, not just specific areas where federal funds are involved.\n\nLawyers for the U.S. bishops voiced several deep concerns with the regulations. They were joined by representatives of other religious organizations like the National Association of Evangelicals, the National Catholic Bioethics Center and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nIn a letter to the HHS Office of Civil Rights, they argued that where the proposed regulations prohibit \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of termination of pregnancy,\u201d this could be interpreted \u201cincorrectly\u201d as an abortion-access mandate for health-care providers and insurers.\n\n\u201cTo prevent such a misreading, it is important that OCR [HHS Office for Civil Rights] state explicitly in the regulations that neither Section 1557 nor the regulations impose such a requirement,\u201d their letter stated.\n\nMandatory access to abortion is not found in the Affordable Care Act, which instead left the decision of covering abortions up to the insurers themselves, the letter argued. Such a mandate would also be prohibited under existing law \u2014 the Weldon Amendment \u2014 they said.\n\nBy expanding the definition of sex discrimination in health care, the regulations present other problems, the letter argued. For instance, requiring \u201cequal access\u201d to health care for persons of any \u201cgender identity\u201d \u2014 defined in the regulations as the gender someone internally identifies with and not the gender they were born as \u2014 could affect the privacy of patients and the \u201ceffective delivery\u201d of health care.\n\n\u201cFor example, the residents of a health-care facility such as a nursing home have a privacy interest in not being required to share a bedroom with a member of the opposite sex to whom they are not married,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nOr, in another example they gave, \u201ca psychologist providing group therapy to female rape victims should not be required to admit as a patient into those group therapy sessions an individual who is male but \u2018identifies\u2019 as female. Otherwise therapeutic outcomes that are achieved by limiting such sessions to biological women would be compromised.\u201d\n\nAnother concern the letter\u2019s authors presented is that the regulations mandate health-care providers and insurers to cover services for \u201cgender transition.\u201d Such providers might include \u201ca religiously affiliated hospital or nursing home that participates in Medicaid\u201d and one that religiously objects to providing for such services.\n\nAlso, the regulations do not include an exemption for religious organizations that object to providing certain medical services or coverage under the rule, they added.\n\nThere is a legal basis for this, they explained. The health-care law\u2019s original anti-discrimination provision was written on the \u201cgrounds\u201d of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. Title IX prohibits discrimination in a number of areas, including race and sex, but it includes an exemption for religiously affiliated educational institutions in cases of sex discrimination.\n\nSo where a religiously affiliated organization would not accommodate an individual\u2019s request on the basis of sex because the request \u201cwould not be consistent with [their] religious tenets,\u201d they would qualify for an exemption under Title IX. Thus, the regulations must include at the very least a similar exemption for a religious organization.\n\n\u201cThe [current] regulations proposed by OCR will substantially burden religious exercise,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cThe burden is not justified by a compelling interest, and any legitimate government interest, if there is one, can be furthered by less restrictive alternatives.\u201d\n\nThe HHS did float the possibility of a religious exemption to the rules and asked for comments. The agency stated that the rule does not change existing religious protections like health-care conscience laws, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and \u201cprovisions in the Affordable Care Act related to abortion services or regulations issued under the Affordable Care Act with regard to preventive health services.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rule comes just days after the Supreme Court agreed to hear multiple challenges to the health-care law\u2019s contraception mandate that requires employers to provide coverage for contraceptives, sterilizations and drugs that can cause early abortions.\n\nAlthough the administration amended the rule for religiously affiliated organizations that object to complying with the mandate, groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor argue that the revised rule still forced them to violate their consciences.\n\nUnder the new rules, they must notify the government of their objections, which will direct their insurers to provide the mandated coverage. Critics of the mandate argued that the cost for the objectionable drugs and procedures is still passed on to the religious groups that wanted to opt out of providing for them altogether.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proposed rule, introduced in September by the Department of Health and Human Services, is a set\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "The proposed rule, introduced in September by the Department of Health and Human Services, is a set of regulations that implement and cla...", "title": "New Health-Care Nondiscrimination Rule Threatens Religious Liberty, Critics Say", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/new-health-care-nondiscrimination-rule-threatens-religious-liberty-critics/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Stethoscope.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/new-health-care-nondiscrimination-rule-threatens-religious-liberty-critics/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Stethoscope.jpg", "description": "The proposed rule, introduced in September by the Department of Health and Human Services, is a set of regulations that implement and cla...", "card": "summary", "title": "New Health-Care Nondiscrimination Rule Threatens Religious Liberty, Critics Say"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, health care, matt hadro, religious freedom, u.s. conference of catholic bishops", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "The rule applies to any health-care program or activity that receives federal funding, like hospitals that accept Medicaid patients.\n\u201cThe [current] regulations proposed by OCR will substantially burden religious exercise,\u201d the letter stated.\nBy expanding the definition of sex discrimination in health care, the regulations present other problems, the letter argued.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Proposed federal anti-discrimination rules could threaten the religious liberty of health-care providers and also infringe on the privacy of patients, lawyers for the U.S. Catholic Bishops have warned.\nAnd it covers all health-care practices of such entities, not just specific areas where federal funds are involved."}
