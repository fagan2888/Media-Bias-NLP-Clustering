(AP) - Katie Lee is known around the world as the glamorous and witty co-host of the Food Network\u2019s \u201cThe Kitchen.\u201d But to fans in her home state of West Virginia, the 33-year-old prefers to be known as \u201cKatie,\u201d the farm girl who learned at home the true meaning of farm-to-table cooking.\n\n\u201cI grew up in my grandma\u2019s kitchen, and she was always cooking something delicious. My family was always really into food and what we were eating. We ate simple food - whatever was in season, and whatever my grandfather was growing in his garden. I learned about farm-to-table eating before it was a trend,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee grew up in Milton and graduated from Cabell Midland High School in 1999.\n\nCooking was a way of life as she was growing up.\n\n\u201cMy biggest cooking influence, my No. 1, is my grandma. Then it\u2019s the farmers. When I go to the farm stand and see what\u2019s available - that\u2019s where I get most of my inspiration,\u201d Lee said of her grandmother, Dora Harshbarger.\n\nIn the foreword to her first cookbook, \u201cThe Comfort Table,\u201d released in 2008, Lee writes: \u201cWhen I look back on my childhood, my fondest memories are those surrounding the dinner table. I come from a family of great cooks and big eaters. I grew up in a small town in West Virginia and most of my family lived in our neighborhood or very close by. I had my grandparents down the street, my great-grandmother next door, and my great-aunt and great-uncle one door down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Comfort Table: Recipes for Everyday Occasions\u201d quickly followed for the budding culinary star in 2009.\n\nSome of her favorite Mountain State holiday memories are close to the family comfort table as well.\n\n\u201cWe always went to my grandmother\u2019s for the holidays. She would make such an amazing meal and make it seem effortless, of course. No matter how many pounds of mashed potatoes she made, we always ate it all. It was also a tradition that my great-aunt would have a punch and cookies party - some traditional punch with sherbet and soda and a lot of great holiday cookies,\u201d Lee said.\n\nMaking - and eating - Christmas cookies with her family was something she treasured too.\n\n\u201cMy two favorite holiday cookies are the Mexican wedding cookies and the chocolate peanut butter balls. My Aunt Pat always made these for the holidays. They last for about two weeks in an airtight container - I remember being a little girl and running over to her house after school, peeking into her cookie jar and stealing a cookie. I knew around the holidays she\u2019d always have them on hand,\u201d Lee said.\n\nMany West Virginians tune in to watch Lee on \u201cThe Kitchen,\u201d which airs Saturdays at 11 a.m. on the Food Network. Along with Lee, the show is co-hosted by Sunny Anderson, Jeff Mauro, Marcela Valladolid and Geoffrey Zakarian.\n\nThe fun one-hour series focuses on all things culinary and features recipes written by Lee and the show\u2019s other chefs.\n\n\u201cThe show keeps me really busy because I\u2019m writing new recipes every week,\u201d Lee said.\n\nEach episode takes place in the show\u2019s casual set, where the five co-hosts come together for recipe demonstrations, guest interviews and lively discussions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all friends outside of the show - there\u2019s a real camaraderie. When we\u2019re making the show, we\u2019re usually having so much fun that the producers need to remind us that we\u2019re filming a TV show and have to stop laughing and joking around,\u201d Lee said.\n\nShe has even had her mom, Kim Becker, on as a guest.\n\n\u201cI want everyone to know that West Virginia has so many gifts to offer - the food that\u2019s indigenous to the area, like corn bread, collard greens, pinto beans . they should be celebrated because they are so good.\n\n\u201cMy mom actually just started volunteering at a farmers market in Huntington called The Wild Ramp. All of these farmers from around the area bring stuff to sell. My mom is making baked products and selling them there, too. I hope everyone seeks out West Virginia farmers,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAs we approach the long winter, West Virginia foodies can think about Lee\u2019s new cookbook on summertime foods. It will be released in the spring.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Endless Summer Cookbook\u2019 is inspired by my love of summer. It\u2019s filled with tons of fun, easy, fresh recipes. Lots of recipes use the grill - like barbecue ribs, grilled chicken dishes. Lots of yummy salads and easy desserts too. Right now, I\u2019m really focused on my cookbook. We\u2019re in the final stages of editing,\u201d Lee said.\n\nShe also writes a column for Self magazine and published her first novel, \u201cGroundswell,\u201d in 2011. She is a graduate of Miami University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and journalism.\n\nAlthough she resides in the Hamptons, visiting her family is high on her priority list for the holidays.\n\n\u201cYes, my family still lives there. I visit a couple times a year - I wish there was a direct flight,\u201d Lee said.\n\nEven though she has dined all over the world in some of the greatest restaurants, \u201cGrandma\u2019s kitchen is still my favorite.\u201d\n\nFor additional information about Katie Lee and \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d visit www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/katie-lee.html .\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Charleston Gazette, http://www.wvgazette.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Katie Lee is known around the world as the glamorous and witty co-host of the Food Network's \"The Kitchen.\" But to fans in her home state of West Virginia, the 33-year-old prefers to be known as \"Katie,\" the farm girl who learned at home the true meaning of farm-to-table cooking.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/wva-native-katie-lee-becomes-culinary-star/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Katie Lee is known around the world as the glamorous and witty co-host of the Food Network\u2019s \u201cThe Kitchen.\u201d But to fans in her home state of West Virginia, the 33-year-old prefers to be known as \u201cKatie,\u201d the farm girl who learned at home the true meaning of farm-to-table cooking.", "title": "W.Va. native Katie Lee becomes culinary star"}, "twitter": {"description": "Katie Lee is known around the world as the glamorous and witty co-host of the Food Network's \"The Kitchen.\" But to fans in her home state of West Virginia, the 33-year-old prefers to be known as \"Kati", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "W.Va. native Katie Lee becomes culinary star"}, "Author": "JUDY E.
