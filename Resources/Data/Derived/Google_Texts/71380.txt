In the wake of the healthcare-reform law, cost shifting of non-work-related injuries to the workers’ compensation remains a potential issue, and potential stress on the healthcare system could lead to delays and drive workers’ comp costs up, says broker Marsh in a briefing.

But the law’s focus on improvements in standards of care could reduce the use of costly procedures that produce questionable results, and employers could see premium refunds if they maintain better-than-expected performance in their healthcare programs, Marsh says.
