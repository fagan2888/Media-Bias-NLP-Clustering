If the party wants to be competitive in the 21st century, Reed and his fellow-travelers argue, it\u2019ll have to appeal to at least some Latino voters. Allowing immigration reform to pass the GOP-controlled House is not about helping them (immigrants), the pro-reform wing claims, it\u2019s about saving us (Republicans).\n\nKeeping in mind how limiting was the choice to ignore the Tea Party\u2019s xenophobia, the establishment\u2019s argument is pretty decent. But as it should have learned after its failed 2013 rebrand attempt, the establishment strategy of citing the party\u2019s future as reason to countenance reform in the present will always fail to persuade the Tea Party. Not because the strategy is wrong, but because it assumes, incorrectly, that Tea Partyers care if the GOP is competitive on the national level, and seek influence beyond the borders of their respective states.\n\nIn American politics, it can be hard to specify exactly how you tell the difference between a national party and one with a more parochial vision. The U.S. system has always primarily been a contest between two large, shifting coalitions; and for more than 150 years, American politics has orbited around the twin behemoths of the Democratic Party (which is arguably the oldest political party in the world) and the GOP. This means that on paper, at least, the big two are always national parties in their nature.\n\nThe historical record, however, shows things have been considerably more fluid. For much of the century separating the Civil War and the civil rights movement, for example, the so-called Solid South was a major reality of American politics, one that functioned as a blessing and a curse for the Democratic Party. The blessing was the near-guarantee that the party\u2019s control over the region\u2019s many de facto dictatorships would give it influence in many states and the House. The curse was that this power came at a heavy price, requiring as it did that the party defend apartheid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By using xenophobia to motivate supporters before November, GOP is acting like a faction -- not a national party", "title": "The irony of Scott Brown: How his campaign proves GOP is no national party", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "By using xenophobia to motivate supporters before November, GOP is acting like a faction -- not a national party", "title": "The irony of Scott Brown: How his campaign proves GOP is no national party", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/21/the_irony_of_scott_brown_how_his_campaign_proves_gop_is_no_national_party/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/scott_brown_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By using xenophobia to motivate supporters before November, GOP is acting like a faction -- not a national party", "title": "The irony of Scott Brown: How his campaign proves GOP is no national party", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/scott_brown_rect.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Election 2014, faction, GOP, GOP Civil War, national party, New Deal, New Hampshire, Ralph Reed, Tea Party, The New York Times", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Keeping in mind how limiting was the choice to ignore the Tea Party\u2019s xenophobia, the establishment\u2019s argument is pretty decent.\nIn American politics, it can be hard to specify exactly how you tell the difference between a national party and one with a more parochial vision.\nThe curse was that this power came at a heavy price, requiring as it did that the party defend apartheid.\nLike many Republican supporters of immigration reform, including most members of the GOP establishment, Reed tries to sidestep the xenophobia issue and make his case instead in pragmatic, self-interested terms.\nThis means that on paper, at least, the big two are always national parties in their nature."}
