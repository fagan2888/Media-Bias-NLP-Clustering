Some 900 children \u2014 one out of three in town \u2014 currently train in one of the programs the Winter Sports Club offers (alpine, nordic, freestyle, snowboarding, freeskiing). When school gets out they flock to Howelsen by the hundreds to train into the evening on floodlit slopes.\n\nCity Council president Walter Magill calls it \u201cthe heart of the community.\u201d But Howelsen in its current form is threatened.\n\nThe ground is sliding, threatening much of the hill including what lies underneath the two biggest ski jumps. Other maintenance at the city-owned facility has been put off for years. The council wants to know what Howelsen needs and what its options are. A 29-year-old agreement between the city and the Winter Sports Club, which expires next year, may be rewritten.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got infrastructure rotting in the ground, and there\u2019s no plan to fix it,\u201d said Jim Boyne, the club\u2019s executive director who oversees a $3 million budget. \u201cNow we\u2019re in a dialogue with the City Council, looking at capital planning, looking at capital reserves and what we need to sustain Howelsen for the future. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nThere have been mudslides the past two years. Last year, an area the size of two football fields slid 8 feet, damaging a lift tower and forcing the club to remove an alpine slide which attracts tourism dollars. It cost the club about $100,000 in revenue.\n\n\u201cThis place is something that\u2019s got to be preserved,\u201d said Boyne. \u201cThe next 100 years isn\u2019t guaranteed. You\u2019ve got to be proactive. This is eroding every day. If we don\u2019t get after it, it\u2019s just going to get worse and worse.\u201d\n\nShould big jumps be saved?\n\nThe town suffered a blow in 2002 when the U.S. Ski Team relocated the nordic combined program to Park City, Utah, where modern ski jumps were built for the Salt Lake Olympics. That also ended a run of seven years when Howelsen hosted annual nordic combined World Cups to the delight of Steamboat children who would file out of school on a Friday morning by the hundreds to watch, squealing and waving American flags.\n\nNow some are wondering if it makes sense to save the two largest jumps where those events were held. Kids who want to be ski jumpers can learn on four smaller jumps, and if they get good at it, they can travel to Park City six hours away for training stints on bigger jumps. Nobody wants to lose the big jumps, but it probably would cost $1 million to $2 million to stabilize the ground underneath them.\n\n\u201cNot every kid in Steamboat can learn how to jump these hills and is brave enough and adventurous enough,\u201d Magill said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if we want them to collapse into the ground. If they\u2019re going to be repaired, let\u2019s say it\u2019s going to be a million-dollar price tag. Is it in the city\u2019s best interest to repair a 120K or 90K jump that 30 people in town can go off, and we still don\u2019t get FIS races because they\u2019re going to Park City instead of coming here?\u201d\n\nSteamboat, Park City and Lake Placid, N.Y., are the only places in the U.S. that have full-sized ski jumps. Magill believes the jumps on Howelsen can be saved through private fundraising, but the city also must decide what to do about deferred maintenance and other costs of the facility. Currently the city is subsidizing Howelsen by about $500,000 a year.\n\nInterim city manager Gary Suiter says the word \u201cimperiled\u201d is too strong to describe Howelsen\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cThis is an iconic facility, the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club is a venerable institution, and both are more than a century old,\u201d Suiter said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either one is going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot go away\u201d\n\nStill, there are real concerns about the future of Howelsen \u2014 Colorado\u2019s smallest ski area, but also its oldest.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just look at what it is today,\u201d said Kyrill Kretzschmar, the city\u2019s recreation and enterprise manager who will make a presentation to the council this week. \u201cWhat was it 100 years ago? How has it evolved? Why do we have the situation we have today? If you want to continue, what do we have to do the next 10 years \u2014 council wants to know that \u2014 just to make it a viable operation?\n\n\u201cOne thing is for sure: It cannot go away. This is the heart and soul of Steamboat. I hope everybody understands that.\u201d\n\nKretzschmar said the value of a legacy asset that has a huge impact on the city\u2019s children is immeasurable.\n\n\u201cYou impact a thousand kids each year, you\u2019ve done that for decades, you\u2019ve changed the lives of each of these kids in a positive way,\u201d Kretzschmar said. \u201cHow are you going to measure that? It\u2019s enormous.\u201d\n\nBoyne believes the club and the city will be able to work something out.\n\n\u201cThis community can\u2019t afford not to make it work,\u201d Boyne said. \u201cThis is what Steamboat is all about. Whether it is the winter or the summer, Howelsen is a gathering place for kids. You turn your kids loose and you just feel good.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Howelsen Hill slip, sliding away", "title": "Howelsen Hill slip, sliding away", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/howelsen-hill-slip-sliding-away/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_CC3_BNSP17SKIHOWELSEN1p2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_CC3_BNSP17SKIHOWELSEN1p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T18:12:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:57:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The ground is sliding, threatening much of the hill including what lies underneath the two biggest ski jumps.\nCity Council president Walter Magill calls it \u201cthe heart of the community.\u201d But Howelsen in its current form is threatened.\nSki Team relocated the nordic combined program to Park City, Utah, where modern ski jumps were built for the Salt Lake Olympics.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re in a dialogue with the City Council, looking at capital planning, looking at capital reserves and what we need to sustain Howelsen for the future.\nFor generations, tiny Howelsen Hill has been the focal point of life in Ski Town USA."}
