Like millions of people across the country, George W. Bush took a cold splash for charity.

With the help of his daughter, Jenna Bush Hager, and wife, former First Lady Laura Bush, Bush accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge. However, it did not come without a short-lived protest.

Bush first acknowledged his challengers — Woody Johnson, Jenna Bush Hager, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh and Rory McIlroy — and then questioned whether the cold shower is “presidential.”

“To you all that challenged me, I do not think it’s presidential for me to be splashed with ice water,” Bush said in the video. “So I’m simply going to write you a check.”

However, Laura had other plans. While Bush was writing the check, Laura dumped a bucket of cold water on his head.

Bush’s protest was an obvious nod to President Obama who declined to take the chilly shower after he was challenged by the Kennedy family.

“His contribution to this effort will be monetary,” the White House said in a statement on Aug. 13.

Bush then took the opportunity to challenge a close friend.

“Now it’s my privilege to challenge my friend Bill Clinton to the ALS challenge. Yesterday was Bill’s birthday and my gift to Bill is a bucket of cold water,” Bush said in the video.

The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has raised $24 million for ALS research.
