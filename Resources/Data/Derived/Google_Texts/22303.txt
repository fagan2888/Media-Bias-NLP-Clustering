A wave of Black Friday protestors gathered across the United States, including a large group at the Walmart in Mishawaka.

The group is protesting the way the corporation treats its employees.

Opponents say employees don't make enough money to feed their families and aren't given enough hours.

Protestors say Walmart needs to set an example by raising employee wages and share its mult-million dollar profits.

“Half of their workforce is below $25,000, which means half of them don't meet what is considered the definition of a traditional American family,” Tony Flora, a protestor, told NewsCenter 16.

“What we are saying to the manager is that he can make difference here locally,” Joe Carbone, another protestor, said. “Make sure that he does schedule 40 hours work weeks, that's something he can do.”

This isn't the first year for the protests.

After a few years of country-wide demonstrations, organizers say the company started to listen and decided to start paying their employees more than just minimum wage.
