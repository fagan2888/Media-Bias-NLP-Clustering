John Cornyn, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Arizona Sen. John McCain, and Boehner \u201care all the Sheriff of Nottingham. It would be the end of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nBeck has been pushing the hashtag #DefundTheGOP and is urging Americans to stop giving money to the party at large; instead he\u2019s suggesting support for individual candidates they trust.\n\nGohmert and Beck also discussed the latest on the \u201cgovernment shutdown,\u201d and how it\u2019s being portrayed.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want the government shutdown, but good night, the president stood there and he said you\u2019re not going to use a gun [to negotiate] \u2014 are you kidding?\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cAnd I heard [White House press secretary Jay] Carney say yesterday, we\u2019re not going to allow the Republican Congress to force us to pay them to do their job. He\u2019s got it exactly backward!\u201d\n\nRather, the congressman said: \u201cThey\u2019re holding a gun to America\u2019s head and saying, \u2018Republicans, give us all the money in the Treasury \u2014 plus more than our children can ever pay for \u2014 and if you don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to burn down the country. We\u2019re going to make it hard on veterans. We\u2019re going to make it hard on disabled, people with cancer. We\u2019re going to make the country miserable until you give us all the money.\u2019\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
