By 2013, a quarter of all immigrants and their children were on Medicaid; in contrast, 16 percent of natural-born Americans and their children are on the health program for those with low incomes.\n\n\u201cIt seems almost certain that immigrants and their children will continue to benefit disproportionately from Obamacare, as they remain much more likely than natives to be uninsured or poor,\u201d the report concludes, adding that \u201cavailable evidence indicates that Medicaid growth associated with immigrants is largely among those legally in the country.\u201d\n\nImmigrants are more likely to participate in Medicaid because they are also more likely to be uninsured or poor, according to the report\u2019s author Steven Camarota, CIS\u2019s director of research.\n\nWhile both immigrants and natural-born citizens had a decline in the uninsured rate between 2011 and 2013 (before Obamacare exchanges opened), immigrants made larger strides \u2014 a five percentage point decrease compared to native citizens\u2019 two percentage point decline. But a larger proportion of that was due to Medicaid: it accounts for 41 percent of the fall of uninsured immigrants, according to CIS.\n\n\u201cThe high rate and significant growth in Medicaid associated with immigrants is mainly the result of a legal immigration system that admits large numbers of immigrants with relatively low-levels of education, many of whom end up poor and uninsured,\u201d Camarota said in a statement.\n\nEight of the 10 states with the largest immigrant populations in 2012, according to Pew research, have implemented Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and are likely seeing even larger number of immigrants in their systems.\n\nFlorida and Texas, however, both have largely immigrant populations and have foregone the Medicaid expansion. GOP electoral victories in both states makes it unlikely that state officials will attempt to approve a Medicaid expansion anytime soon.\n\nSome groups are pushing to extend Medicaid \u2014 and Obamacare \u2014 benefits even further. Just Tuesday evening, Health and Human Services chief Sylvia Burwell pushed for Obamacare benefits, Medicaid and all, to be extended to DREAM-eligible illegal immigrants \u2014 those who first came to the U.S. as children.
