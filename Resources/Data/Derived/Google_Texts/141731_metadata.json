Plus, the sea lions' bark is noisy and residents hear their cries all day.\n\nThe growing number of sea lions has shocked the area's residents. Mike Graham, who is from a nearby city, visited the docks on Monday. He counted about 500 sea lions on the docks, he said.\n\n\"I have not seen this many sea lions before in one place,\" he said. \"I am worried about the damages they are making, I've been told they already damaged one of the docks.\"\n\nThe city is working to prevent the sea lions from populating the dock, Rainier City Manager Debbie Dudley told CNN affiliate KOIN.\n\n\"Right now our workers are trying to put up some temporary-type fencing,\" Dudley said. \"The animals are so large that they do significant damage coming on and off the docks.\"\n\nMany locals are flocking to the river to see the growing sea lion herd, but city officials warn the creatures can be aggressive.\n\n\u00a9 LAKANA", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2016/03/08/Sea-lion-Portland-dock_2393815_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "description": "This small city in Oregon has a sea lion problem.
