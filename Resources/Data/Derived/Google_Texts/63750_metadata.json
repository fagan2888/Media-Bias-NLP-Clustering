Cartwright\u2019s diagnosis of the desire for freedom amongst enslaved Africans as a form of psychosis exposes two important realities about mental health in the United States.\n\nFirst, the mental health of people of color in the United States, specifically Black people, is not a neutral arena. It is a critical battleground where racist ideologies have leveraged medical justifications for restricting Black people\u2019s freedom.\n\nSecondly, the mental health infrastructure in the United States, and lack thereof, is an expression of the historical agenda that Dr. Cartwright\u2019s claim to fame represents. Promoting \u201cdrapetomania\u201d as a clinical diagnosis only a year before the Emancipation Proclamation was signed posed strategic value to the Confederacy, which was being threatened by a civil war and needing to refine its justifications for chattel slavery in the United States.\n\nThe current crisis of criminalizing and incarcerating Black people with mental health conditions across the country is an extension of these two historical trends.\n\nOn Aug. 12, Dignity and Power Now launched its report, titled, \u201cImpact of Disproportionate Incarceration and Abuse of Black People with Mental Health Conditions in World\u2019s Largest Jail System.\u201d We submitted the report in Geneva, Switzerland, to the United Nations as part of a two-day review of United States compliance with the International Convention to Eliminate all forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD).\n\nOver a period of two days, the United States was questioned and challenged by 18 U.N. committee experts who critiqued the nation\u2019s deficiencies in addressing racial disparities. Our shadow report was an intervention not only in the local county conversation, but also on an international stage to expose a national crisis of criminalizing Black people\u2019s mental health in the United States.\n\nWhat does this crisis look like?\n\nOn any given day, Black people are six times more likely than White people to be incarcerated in the United States, and 63 percent of those Black people in local jails across the country have some form of a mental health condition (2006). Los Angeles makes key contributions to this trend, as Black people are 9 percent of the county population and 43.7 percent of its jail population diagnosed with \u201cserious mental illness.\u201d\n\nThe factors that account for this disproportionate impact are numerous. Black people, for example, are more likely to be misdiagnosed and at the same time less likely to receive the most effective treatments. Black people with mental health conditions are two to three times more likely than people of other races to be incarcerated as limited access to services increases the risk of incarceration.\n\nThe lack of community services, barriers to accessing them and lack of quality treatment upon access results in a systemic equation whereby \u201ctreatment\u201d for Black people means incarceration.\n\nLos Angeles is the largest jail system in the world. Additionally, the three largest mental health \u201ctreatment\u201d facilities in the country \u2013 Los Angeles\u2019 Twin Towers, Chicago\u2019s Cook County Jail, and Rikers Island in New York \u2013 are all jail facilities.\n\nIn fact the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that California needed to reduce its overcrowding that was exposing prisoners to greater risks of violence, medical neglect and abuse, lack of mental health care, and death. The realization that jails operate as de facto mental health facilities has gained more traction in recent years; however, the response has not been comprehensive or substantial enough to remedy the problem.\n\nThe situation of the mentally ill in jail is so dangerous and oppressive that the Department of Justice found unconstitutional conditions for the mental health population in LA County Jail system (May 2014) and a high level of physical abuse and the violations of rights for adolescents in New York\u2019s Rikers Island Jail \u2013 particularly those with mental health conditions (August 2014). That tells us that the crisis persists.\n\nIn fact, since the Civil Rights of Incarcerated Peoples Act was passed in 1997, the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division has found violations of the constitutional rights of people with mental health conditions in 35 correctional facilities across 25 states. Los Angeles is just one of the more recent exposures.\n\nDespite these conditions, the Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics has no mechanism for the regular collecting of intersectional data based on the race and gender of incarcerated people with mental health conditions across the country. This creates serious barriers to monitoring the local and national trends.\n\nWhy is Los Angeles relevant?\n\nAs Los Angeles County develops plans for the diversion of people with mental health needs from the jails, it is also expanding jail capacity. It continues to stay the course despite the copious evidence and stories from our loved ones leaving the jails, that incarceration exacerbates mental health conditions.\n\nIn fact, in recent years there has been a movement for specialized detention facilities that are being couched as more responsive to the needs of prisoners. Californians United for a Responsible Budget (CURB) has been pushing back against the county and state push for \u201cgender responsive\u201d prisons and jails \u2013 the tagline for women\u2019s facilities.\n\nThough Los Angeles County claims to be planning to divert many mentally ill people from jail, its new jail plan is to tear down Men\u2019s Central and erect a new \u201cmental health jail\u201d for the high number of mentally ill in the jail now.\n\nGuest commentary in the LA Daily News by Patrisse Cullors-Brignac of Dignity and Power Now (DPN) and Diana Zu\u00f1iga of CURB explains why those of us fighting jail expansion think \u201cA mental health jail is an oxymoron; diversion is what\u2019s needed.\u201c\n\nThe push for category specific incarceration further entrenches our loved ones into a system that cannot protect their rights, safety or humanity. In fact, Assistant Sheriff Terri McDonald recently reported to the Board of Supervisors that there has been a 47 percent increase in use of force at Century Regional Detention Facility, Los Angeles County\u2019s dedicated women\u2019s jail facility.\n\nShe attributed this increase to the rise in the mental health population at the facility. The pursuit of both mental health diversion and jail expansion undermines any comprehensive effort to address the crisis at its root.\n\nA comprehensive diversion program would make use of services that have already proven to be effective, including Full Service Partnerships and Aggressive Community Treatment. Additionally, it is important that we are imaginative in how we envision the services our people deserve.\n\nJob training and permanent job placement, permanent housing, and supportive services that include the intimate networks of those directly impacted are key to the long-term sustainability of mental health diversion.\n\nThe logic underlying the continuation and funding of the mass incarceration of the disproportionately Black mentally ill and Dr. Cartwright\u2019s medical breakthroughs is the same: Black people\u2019s mental health cannot be achieved, so society has to maintain extreme and inhumane restrictions on their freedom.\n\nMark-Anthony Johnson is a member of Dignity and Power Now (DPN) (www.endsheriffviolence.org). DPN, a multi-racial grassroots organization in Los Angeles and a member organization of Californians United for a Responsible Budget (CURB), fights for the dignity and power of incarcerated people and survivors of sheriff violence and their families with the goal of ending state violence and mass incarceration.

Box 73688, LA CA 90003.\n\nSeven reasons why mental health advocates should fight prison and jail expansion\n\nPeople with mental illness are disproportionately criminalized\n\nMore than 50 percent of people in jail or prison have a history or symptoms of mental illness, compared with 6 percent in the general population.\n\nOver 450,000 Americans with mental illness are incarcerated.\n\nLocal jails have the highest symptoms levels, with about 24 percent of prisoners displaying psychosis, 54 percent exhibiting mania, and 30 percent with major depression.\n\n65 percent of incarcerated individuals meet criteria for a substance abuse disorder.\n\nSuicide is the No. 1 cause of death in local jails and in the top five for prisons.\n\nIncarceration further damages mental health\n\nPeople with mental illness do not get better behind bars; they get worse! Being locked up means they are trapped without control or safety, often creating conditions for violence, hypervigilance and hopelessness.\n\nImprisonment exposes people to threat of violence, rape and trauma; disconnection from loved ones; loss of purpose and dignity; and extreme racism. All of these factors exacerbate, and sometimes entirely cause, mental illness.\n\nSolitary confinement is used with greater frequency in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. Experts suggest that it fits the \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d conditions required for an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\nLocking people up cuts off their access to benefits; when they get out, they don\u2019t have proper meds and may end up with costly emergency room visits, homeless, unemployed, and at high risk for recidivism and/or deterioration. They also have a criminal record, causing more barriers and then symptom exacerbation.\n\nJails and prisons are ill-equipped to treat mental illness\n\nPeople with mental illness receive inadequate treatment or none at all behind bars, yet politicians use this to justify increasing spending for mental health services in prisons and jails. People should not have to get locked up to get treatment!\n\nOnly approximately 1 in 3 state prisoners, 1 in 4 federal prisoners, and 1 in 6 people in local jails who had a mental health problem received any treatment behind bars.\n\nIndividuals with mental illness are too often incarcerated while awaiting trial before even being convicted, rather than referred to hospitals or treatment centers.\n\nTreating mental illness in prison is not cost effective either. One report in Michigan found that the annual cost of community case management for mentally ill people is $2,165 per person and a more intensive program costs the state $9,029 per person per year. In contrast, the average Michigan inmate costs the state over $34,000.\n\nJails are becoming de facto mental health providers\n\nThe nation\u2019s penal system has become the largest provider of mental health services and their treatment protocols are neither effective nor humane. People need treatment, not punishment!\n\nThe deinstitutionalization of psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s, originally designed to expand community mental health, has instead resulted in thousands of people with mental illness being locked up through prison and jail expansion. Now people with mental illness are three times more likely to be incarcerated than hospitalized.\n\nLos Angeles Sheriff is proposing to build a $1.74 to $2.32 billion Integrated Inmate Treatment Center, or a \u201cmental health jail.\u201d This facility would have 4,860-5,860 beds for people with mental illness. This project promotes false solutions that the penal system can and should be responsible for mental health services. Research shows that, even with \u201cgood\u201d treatment, people with mental illness don\u2019t get better while locked up.\n\nWe need to increase community programs, not incarceration\n\nCommunity treatment, unlike imprisonment, helps people maintain social supports known to be an essential factor in recovery. These agencies work from a prevention model and address issues that lead to crime, such as homelessness and unemployment.\n\nFewer than half of incarcerated people with mental illness ever received treatment prior to their arrest, showing that we need to improve meeting community needs.\n\nThe new Affordable Care Act requires parity for mental health and substance use disorder treatment in all insurance plans. We have no excuse for restricting these services to people in need.\n\nThere are alternatives to incarceration\n\nThousands of successful community alternative programs exist. Two California examples:\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Behavioral Health Court, started in 2002, aims to divert individuals with mental illness from incarceration by connecting them to outside treatment and wraparound services.\n\nThe Integrated Recovery Network in Los Angeles, which aims to help homeless people with co-occurring disorders find housing, treatment and income, has shown that their services cost $12,000 one time per client versus $96,000 per year in public costs to re-incarcerate repeatedly.\n\nPeople with mental illness deserve better\n\nMental Illness is not a choice and its symptoms can lead people to engage in behaviors they otherwise would not do. Violent crimes are not excusable, but our society needs a better system for treating mental illness than simply locking people up!\n\nThe Social Work Code of Ethics states that social workers \u201cshould advocate for changes in policy and legislation to improve social conditions in order to meet basic human needs and promote social justice.\u201d The Marriage and Family Therapy code also mandates public advocacy.\n\nFor more information, contact Emily Harris at info@curbprisonspending.org, 510-435-1176, or CURB, 1322 Webster St., Suite 210, Oakland, CA 94612.
