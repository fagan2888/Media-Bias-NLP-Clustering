A Phoenix homeowner shot and killed an intruder Friday morning after dealing with another attempted burglary the day before.

Phoenix police Sgt. Tommy Thompson told local ABC news reporters that police arrived at the home around 3:20 a.m. Police have identified the suspect as 30-year-old William Thomas Mackey.

The 77-year-old homeowner told police that this was the second night in a row that his home had been burglarized. Police are investigating whether or not the incidents are related, the local station reported.

The homeowner said someone had broken into his house the day before and he was awakened Friday night by an intruder.

He said he realized the intruder was not a family member and, fearing for his life, got his shotgun and fired one shot at the suspect who was struck and fell to the ground.

The house, located near 43rd Avenue and Bethany Home Road in Phoenix, is not known to be a safe area.

A neighbor, Sandi Corbin, told local ABC news reporters that she had been robbed six times.

Another neighbor, Jeffrey Gabriel, was at the scene when Mr. Mackey’s father arrived to take the suspect’s pick-up truck away.

“My attitude is it happened, I feel bad for the family that lost him. I feel bad for my neighbor because he’s got to live with himself but was protecting his stuff. I can’t judge him for that,” Mr. Gabriel said.

Mr. Thompson said police are still investigating if the two burglaries at the home were related and said that the scene and interview with the homeowner were consistent with self-defense. The case will go to the Maricopa County Attorney’s office for review.
