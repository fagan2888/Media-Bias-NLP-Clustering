Douglas Laycock is one of the country’s foremost experts on, and defenders of, religious liberty, so it was surprising to see that he got it wrong in his commentary on Zubik v. Burwell, the Supreme Court case involving the challenges of religious organizations to the Obamacare abortifacient/contraception mandate [“A case that puts religious liberty at risk,” op-ed, March 21].

Under the Affordable Care Act, employers, including religious employers, are required under pain of heavy penalties to provide health-care programs for their employees. Under the administration’s mandate, such plans must include abortifacients and contraceptives. If a religious organization protests, its insurer must provide these benefits, forcing the religious organization to facilitate abortions and contraception, which it considers immoral. But for this legally required action — the establishment of a health-care plan — the abortifacients and contraceptives would not be provided. How does this not constitute a “substantial burden” on religious liberty, the threshold issue in the Supreme Court case? In saying it does not, Mr. Laycock recast the organizations’ arguments, asserting that they would object even if the government required insurers to provide the contraceptives and abortifacients and the organizations “were not required to provide insurance.” A religious organization might advance such a sweeping argument if the occasion were to arise, but it has not.

The more difficult issues are whether the mandate advances a compelling public interest and, if so, in the least intrusive way.
