Bruce Braley, a Democrat running for U.S. Senate in Iowa, a major headache.\n\nIn his first official faceoff with Republican Joni Ernst last night, Braley found himself in an uncomfortable situation when asked about reports that he threatened to sue his neighbor over chickens that had wandered onto his lawn.\n\nErnst asked:\n\n\u201cCongressman, you threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto your property. You\u2019re talking about bipartisanship\u2014how do we expect as Iowans that you will work across the aisle when you can\u2019t walk across your yard?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not true, I never threatened to sue anyone,\u201d Braley responded.\n\n\n\nIowa features one of the closest U.S. Senate races in the country, pinning Braley, a four-term congressman from Waterloo, against Joni Ernst, an Iowa state senator.\n\n>>> 9 Senate Races That Could Tip the Balance of Power\n\nBraley, who received a law degree from the University of Iowa, admitted that he issued a formal complaint against his neighbor, but continues to deny that he threatened a lawsuit.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Braley emailed a lawyer for his neighborhood board of directors demanding action against the neighbor to \u201cavoid a litigious situation.\u201d\n\nBut chickens weren\u2019t the only source of contention at last night\u2019s debate held at Simpson College in Indianola. Braley attacked Ernst for supporting a \u201cradical Tea Party agenda that\u2019s going to take us backwards,\u201d while Ernst took issue with Braley\u2019s support for Obamacare.\n\nBraley, 56, also criticized Ernst, 44, for connections to the Koch brothers, billionaires who support libertarian and conservative-minded candidates. Ernst shot back, accusing Braley of being a hypocrite.\n\n\u201cCongressman Braley, you\u2019re not running against these other people, you\u2019re running against me,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cI am a mother, I am a soldier and I am an independent leader. You are being funded by Tom Steyer, who is a California billionaire extreme environmentalist.\u201d\n\nWatch the video for the heated exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At Iowa's first Senate debate, Joni Ernst confronted reports that her opponent threatened to sue his neighbor over chickens that wandered onto her lawn.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "At Iowa's first Senate debate, Joni Ernst confronted reports that her opponent threatened to sue his neighbor over chickens that wandered onto her lawn.", "title": "Could 4 Chickens Sway Iowa Senate Race?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/8600645783_df3f7bb6bd_k.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-29T14:08:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1rnIO7p"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "At Iowa's first Senate debate, Joni Ernst confronted reports that her opponent threatened to sue his neighbor over chickens that wandered onto her lawn.", "title": "Could 4 Chickens Sway Iowa Senate Race?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/8600645783_df3f7bb6bd_k.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,law,politics", "published_time": "2014-09-29T13:41:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T14:08:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bruce Braley, iowa debate, Iowa senate debate, Joni Ernst, Braley chickens, elections, senate elections, iowa senate race"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe15\"", "article_summary": "Four pet chickens are causing Rep.
