Mitch Daniels\u2019 signature job-creation initiative.\n\nThe ad accuses that group of \u201chiding how it spent taxpayer dollars.\u201d Actually, it was criticized for puffing up the number of jobs created, not for hiding any misuse of tax money.\n\nTom is a multimillionaire corporate farm executive from Northeast Indiana\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. His stated policy positions are far from liberal: He supports gun rights, term limits, paying down the federal debt, cutting funding for Planned Parenthood and repealing the Affordable Care Act, for example.\n\nClub for Growth has endorsed one of Tom\u2019s five opponents in the May 3 GOP primary, state Sen. Jim Banks. All are vying for the GOP nomination to fill a House seat being vacated by GOP Rep. Marlin Stutzman, who is running for the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u2018Donates to Liberals\u2019\n\nThe ad, announced April 19, sandwiches Tom\u2019s photo between photos of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, as though they were three peas in a pod.\n\nThe narrator says Tom is on the board of a \u201ccorporate group\u201d that donated to them and other liberals.\n\nThat\u2019s true as far as it goes. The ad identifies the group in graphics as \u201cGrowth Energy.\u201d It\u2019s not obvious from the ad, but this group promotes the use of ethanol as a fuel, and like many business lobbying groups, its political action committee donates heavily to incumbents of both parties.\n\nSince its formation in the 2010 election cycle, the Growth Energy PAC has donated $3,000 to Pelosi, according to tallies by OpenSecrets.org. But it has also donated $7,000 to Republican Rep. John Boehner, who retired last year as House speaker and resigned from his House seat.\n\nDuring the same period, the PAC gave $4,400 to Reid. But it also gave $5,500 to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nOverall, counting donations to all federal candidates and to party committees and partisan PACs, the Growth Energy PAC has given $241,400 to Democrats and $225,000 to Republicans (including $5,000 to Tom\u2019s current campaign for the House).\n\nSo we\u2019re not exactly looking at MoveOn.org here.\n\n\u2018Corporate Welfare\u2019\n\nThe ad\u2019s claim about \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d refers to Tom\u2019s service on the board of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation from its formation in 2005 until last year.\n\nThat public-private partnership was created by Republican Mitch Daniels soon after he took office as Indiana\u2019s governor. It replaced the state\u2019s former Department of Commerce, and its mission is to attract and support new business investment to create jobs. The corporation has continued under Republican Gov. Mike Pence, who succeeded Daniels in 2013.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the IEDC uses incentives including job-training grants and tax credits to businesses agreeing to create new jobs in Indiana. Whether that\u2019s \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d or \u201cjob creation\u201d is a matter of opinion.\n\n\u2018Hiding \u2026 Tax Dollars\u2019\n\nThe ad also accuses the IEDC of \u201chiding how it actually spent tax dollars.\u201d And the ad shows on screen an editorial that appeared in Indiana\u2019s Madison Courier Dec. 29, 2012, under the headline \u201cMore IEDC oversight is needed.\u201d\n\nThe issue raised by the editorial, however, was whether the IEDC has supported as much job creation as the Daniels administration was claiming, not whether tax dollars were being misused.\n\nThe editorial was a follow-up to a 2010 investigative story by an Indianapolis TV station that found \u201cas many as 40% of statewide jobs listed [by IEDC] as so-called economic successes have not happened \u2014 and most of them never will.\u201d\n\nBut no misuse of money was alleged. The story quoted Indiana Secretary of Commerce Mitch Roob as saying companies didn\u2019t get tax money for jobs that failed to materialize. \u201cIf a company commits to create 100 jobs and it only creates 80, it gets 80 percent of its incentives,\u201d Roob said. \u201cWe audit every company before we give out a dime of taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nNeither the 2012 editorial nor the 2010 investigative story made any mention of Tom, who was one of a dozen members of a board chaired by Daniels, and later by Pence. As a board member, Tom had no control over the corporation\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\nSo does serving on the boards of the ethanol lobby and a Republican governor\u2019s job-creation initiative make Tom a \u201cliberal insider\u201d? We think not.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "So does serving on the boards of the ethanol lobby and a Republican governor\u2019s job-creation initiative make Tom a \u201cliberal insider\u201d?\nThe anti-tax group Club for Growth Action is attacking an Indiana Republican candidate for the House, Kip Tom, as a \u201cliberal insider.\u201d We find the evidence doesn\u2019t support that claim.\nThat public-private partnership was created by Republican Mitch Daniels soon after he took office as Indiana\u2019s governor.\nThe ad also says Tom \u201csat on a quasi-governmental board that doled out corporate welfare.\u201d The board oversaw Republican Indiana Gov.\nThe narrator says Tom is on the board of a \u201ccorporate group\u201d that donated to them and other liberals."}
