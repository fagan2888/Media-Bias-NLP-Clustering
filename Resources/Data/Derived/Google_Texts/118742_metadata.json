(AP) \u2014 Curt Schilling is headed back to TV for ESPN.\n\nSchilling said Sunday at New Hampshire Motor Speedway he would return to work for the sports network as part of its baseball postseason coverage team. ESPN confirmed that Schilling would return to the studio for \u201cBaseball Tonight\u201d following its coverage of the American League wild-card game.\n\nSchilling was benched earlier this month from on telecasts for the rest of the regular season and the wild-card game on Oct. 6. in the wake of his anti-Muslim tweet.\n\nThe former star pitcher and \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d analyst was pulled by ESPN from a major league game and the network\u2019s coverage of the Little League World Series last month after he retweeted a post that compared Muslims and Nazi-era Germans. He has one year left on his contract.\n\nAt the time, Schilling said he\u2019d made a \u201cbad decision.\u201d\n\nSchilling later sent an email to a sports media site about his Twitter post, causing a further uproar.\n\nESPN said at the time of his punishment \u201cCurt\u2019s actions have not been consistent with his contractual obligations nor have they been professionally handled; they have obviously not reflected well on the company.\u201d\n\nSchilling, who also has used Twitter to defended his family over personal attacks, said social media has become \u201cthe new 30-second commercial\u201d and too many people want to go viral \u201cfor all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people have told me in the past, you tell it like it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to explain to people that I don\u2019t. I tell it like I think it is.\u201d\n\nSchilling, who has been treated for mouth cancer, is a three-time World Series champion with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Red Sox. He played from 2004-07 with the Red Sox, who won the World Series in his first and last seasons with them.\n\nHe delivered the prayer before Sunday\u2019s NASCAR race.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Curt Schilling set to return to ESPN for postseason coverage", "title": "Curt Schilling set to return to ESPN for postseason coverage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/curt-schilling-set-to-return-to-espn-for-postseason-coverage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__curt-schilling-espnp1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__curt-schilling-espnp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T10:46:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:48:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe212e\"", "article_summary": "ESPN confirmed that Schilling would return to the studio for \u201cBaseball Tonight\u201d following its coverage of the American League wild-card game.\nSchilling said Sunday at New Hampshire Motor Speedway he would return to work for the sports network as part of its baseball postseason coverage team.\nHe played from 2004-07 with the Red Sox, who won the World Series in his first and last seasons with them.\nLOUDON, N.H.
