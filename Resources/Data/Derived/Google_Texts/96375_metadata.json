Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said: \u201cWe took this action to make sure that all pregnant and postpartum women can receive the full treatment services to which they are entitled.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHealth insurers have an obligation to cover charges for essential preventative services, and our administration will not hesitate to hold them accountable to that responsibility.\u201d\n\nBefore the latest federal task force recommendations, specific coverage requirements for depression screening were limited to adults who aren\u2019t pregnant, where depression care supports were in place, the DFS said. If care supports weren\u2019t in place, the department said, screening was recommended based upon professional judgment.\n\nIn the guidance, the DFS said it strongly urges that health insurance issuers start providing coverage for the expanded maternal depression screening as soon as possible and no later than within six months.\n\nConsumer Choice\n\nThe department also said that insurers, when providing coverage for maternal depression screening, must allow consumers direct access to a specialist of their own choosing. It further reminded insurers of legal requirements that mental health services be offered on par with other health services.\n\nThe DFS accompanied the announcement with statements of support from representatives of the American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute for Reproductive Health and other groups.\n\nLois Uttley, director of Raising Women\u2019s Voices-NY, called the requirement \u201cgreat news for pregnant women and new mothers across New York State.\u201d\n\nShe said in a statement that \u201cfamilies will benefit tremendously from early detection of pregnancy-related depression and initiation of treatment.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: John Herzfeld in New York at jherzfeld@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janey Cohen at jcohen@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/ny-mandates-coverage-n57982070366/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The New York agency that regulates health insurance plans issued\u00a0guidance\u00a0April 25 requiring coverage of preventive screening for maternal depression without copayments, coinsurance or...", "title": "N.Y.
