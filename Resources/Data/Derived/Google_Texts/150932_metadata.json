But little attention has gone to the hypocrisy of the ex-vice president accepting expensive government-funded surgeries while endorsing the Tea Party\u2019s campaign to deny health coverage to millions of Americans, writes Robert Parry.\n\nBy Robert Parry\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney, out promoting his new book Heart about how his life was saved by very expensive heart-transplant surgery, is simultaneously praising the Tea Party, which is hard at work trying to prevent less fortunate Americans from getting anything close to the government-financed care that spared Cheney.\n\nIn an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, Cheney called the Tea Party and its fierce opposition to government spending a \u201cgood thing.\u201d He also noted how the Tea Party made possible the insurgent Wyoming Senate campaign of his daughter Liz because she was \u201cpartly motivated\u201d by the same concerns about high taxes, high national debt and the cost of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOut of that zeal to repeal Obamacare, the Tea Party and its congressional adherents provoked this month\u2019s government shutdown and near credit default. Yet, Cheney declared, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for what the people are doing.\u201d\n\nBut what the Tea Party has been doing is trying to prevent the federal government from implementing reforms in the health-insurance system that would enable some 30 million Americans, including many with pre-existing conditions, to obtain insurance often at reduced or subsidized prices. The Tea Party is also fighting expansion of Medicaid for poor families in states controlled by Republicans.\n\nIn other words, the Tea Party wants to force Americans with pre-existing medical conditions like, say, a diseased heart to remain at the mercy of greedy insurance companies that have made a lucrative business plan out of denying coverage to the people who need it most.\n\nSuch a victim of America\u2019s perverse health-care system would have been Dick Cheney, who has had at least five heart attacks dating back to when he was 37. But Cheney was lucky enough to qualify for government-funded health care as a federal employee for most of his adult life, including his time in the Nixon administration, his service in Congress, and his eight years as vice president. As a retired official who is now over 65, he further qualifies for Medicare and other health benefits.\n\nThe cost of the heart transplant alone over the first year is estimated at $1 million, and the 72-year-old Cheney has received a variety of other expensive heart procedures over the decades.\n\nSaving the Cheney Family\n\nBut Cheney\u2019s personal hypocrisy regarding the federal government\u2019s role to \u201cprovide for the general Welfare\u201d when it comes to less fortunate Americans did not start with the life-saving gift of a new heart. It traces back to the Cheney family\u2019s rise from the hard-scrabble life that confronted many hard-working Americans who were buffeted by the periodic financial crises of unrestrained capitalism, the system idealized by the Tea Party.\n\nIn Cheney\u2019s 2011 memoir, In My Time, he acknowledges that his personal success was made possible by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and the fact that Cheney\u2019s father managed to land a steady job with the federal government. \u201cI\u2019ve often reflected on how different was the utterly stable environment he provided for his family and wondered if because of that I have been able to take risks, to change directions, and to leave one career path for another with hardly a second thought,\u201d Cheney wrote.\n\nIn that sense, Cheney\u2019s self-assuredness may be as much a product of the New Deal as the many bridges, dams and other public works that Roosevelt commissioned in the 1930s to get Americans back to work. By contrast, the insecurity that afflicted Cheney\u2019s father was a byproduct of the vicissitudes from laissez-faire capitalism.\n\nIn sketching his family\u2019s history, Cheney depicted the struggles of farmers and small businessmen scratching out a living in the American Midwest and suffering devastating reversals whenever the titans of Wall Street stumbled into a financial crisis and the bankers cut off credit.\n\nAfter his ancestors would make some modest headway from their hard work, they would find themselves back at square one, again and again, because of some \u201cmarket\u201d crisis or a negative weather pattern. Whenever there was a financial panic or a drought, everything was lost.\n\n\u201cIn 1883, as the country struggled through a long economic depression, the sash and door factory that [Civil War veteran Samuel Fletcher Cheney] co-owned [in Defiance, Ohio] had to be sold to pay its debts,\u201d Cheney wrote. \u201cAt the age of fifty-four, Samuel Cheney had to start over,\u201d moving to Nebraska.\n\nThere, Samuel Cheney built a sod house and began a farm, enjoying some success until a drought hit, again forcing him to the edge. Despite a solid credit record, he noted that \u201cthe banks will not loan to anyone at present\u201d and, in 1896, he had to watch all his possessions auctioned off at the Kearney County Courthouse. Samuel Cheney started another homestead in 1904 and kept working until he died in 1911 at the age of 82.\n\nHis third son, Thomas, who was nicknamed Bert (and who would become Dick Cheney\u2019s grandfather), tried to build a different life as a cashier and part owner of a Sumner, Kansas, bank, named Farmers and Merchants Bank. But he still suffered when the economy crashed.\n\n\u201cDespite all his plans and success, Bert Cheney found that, like his father, he couldn\u2019t escape the terrible power of nature,\u201d Dick Cheney wrote. \u201cWhen drought struck in the early 1930s, farmers couldn\u2019t pay their debts, storekeepers had to close their doors, and Farmers and Merchants Bank went under. My grandparents lost everything except for the house in which they lived.\u201d\n\nBert Cheney\u2019s son, Richard, ventured off in a different direction, working his way through Kearney State Teachers College and taking the civil service exam. He landed a job as a typist with the Veterans Administration in Lincoln, Nebraska. \u201cAfter scraping by for so long, he found the prospect of a $120 monthly salary and the security of a government job too good to turn down,\u201d his son, Dick Cheney, wrote. \u201cBefore long he was offered a job with another federal agency, the Soil Conservation Service.\n\n\u201cThe SCS taught farmers about crop rotation, terraced planting, contour plowing, and using \u2018shelter belts\u2019 of trees as windbreaks techniques that would prevent the soil from blowing away, as it had in the dust storms of the Great Depression. My dad stayed with the SCS for more than thirty years, doing work of which he was immensely proud. He was also proud of the pension that came with federal employment a pride that I didn\u2019t understand until as an adult I learned about the economic catastrophes that his parents and grandparents had experienced and that had shadowed his own youth.\u201d\n\nLike many Americans, the Cheney family felt it had been pulled from the depths of the Great Depression by the New Deal efforts of Franklin Roosevelt, cementing the family\u2019s support for the Democratic president and his party. \u201cWhen I was born [on Jan. 30, 1941] my granddad wanted to send a telegram to the president,\u201d Cheney wrote in his memoir. \u201cBoth sides of my family were staunch New Deal Democrats, and Granddad was sure that FDR would want to know about the \u2018little stranger\u2019 with whom he now had a birthday in common.\u201d\n\nAfter growing up in the relative comfort of middle-class, post-World War II America, Dick Cheney would take advantage of the many opportunities that presented themselves, attaching himself to powerful Republican politicians, most notably an ambitious congressman from Illinois named Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nWhen Rumsfeld left Congress for posts in the Nixon administration, he brought the hard-working Cheney along. Eventually Rumsfeld became White House chief of staff to President Gerald Ford and when Rumsfeld was tapped to become Defense Secretary in 1975 he recommended his young aide, Dick Cheney, to succeed him.\n\nCheney\u2019s career path through the ranks of Republican national politics, with occasional trips through the revolving door into lucrative private-sector jobs, was set. He would become a major player within the GOP Establishment, establishing for himself a reputation as one of the most conservative members of Congress and a foreign policy hawk.\n\nCheney is now recognized as a right-wing Republican icon, inspiring a new generation of conservatives to dismantle what\u2019s left of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and shrink the federal government so it won\u2019t be there to help some other struggling family trying to make it into the middle class and achieve the American Dream.\n\nIndeed, if the father in that struggling family suffers from heart disease and if the family is denied affordable health insurance due to that pre-existing condition Cheney\u2019s right-wing Tea Party policies would coldly calculate that the father\u2019s life would not be worth saving.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.
