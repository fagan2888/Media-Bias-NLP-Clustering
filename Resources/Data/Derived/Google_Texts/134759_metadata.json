That shift in topic gave way for Marco Rubio and Rand Paul to have an explosive exchange over defense spending.\n\nI know that Rand is a \u201ccommitted isolationist,\u201d Rubio pointedly said to his GOP opponent.\n\n\u201cMarco, how is it conservative to add $1 trillion in military expenditures?\u201d Paul countered.\n\nRubio insisted we build up our military because we have radical enemies around the world. Radical jihadists in the Middle East, radical Shia clerics in Iran, the Chinese taking over the South China Sea, just to name a few.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even have an economy if we\u2019re not safe,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul, who believes being a small government conservative includes being conservative on defense spending, said we should limit military expenditures.\n\n\u201cI want a strong national defense, but I don\u2019t want us to be bankrupt,\u201d he said.\n\nAs some of my colleagues noted, we may be seeing this exchange in campaign ads in the coming days, considering it occurred the night before Veteran\u2019s Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio and Rand Paul had an explosive exchange over defense spending at tonights Fox Business debate. .05/26/2016 18:38:17PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio and Rand Paul had an explosive exchange over defense spending at tonights Fox Business debate.", "title": "Getting Defensive: Rubio Hits Rand For Being a 'Committed Isolationist'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/10/rubio-hits-rand-for-being-a-committed-isolationist-n2078943", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/10/47.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Marco Rubio and Rand Paul had an explosive exchange over defense spending at tonights Fox Business debate.", "title": "Getting Defensive: Rubio Hits Rand For Being a 'Committed Isolationist'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/10/rubio-hits-rand-for-being-a-committed-isolationist-n2078943", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/10/47.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Getting Defensive: Rubio Hits Rand For Being a 'Committed Isolationist', Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "That shift in topic gave way for Marco Rubio and Rand Paul to have an explosive exchange over defense spending.\nI know that Rand is a \u201ccommitted isolationist,\u201d Rubio pointedly said to his GOP opponent.\nPaul, who believes being a small government conservative includes being conservative on defense spending, said we should limit military expenditures.\nRubio insisted we build up our military because we have radical enemies around the world.\n\u201cMarco, how is it conservative to add $1 trillion in military expenditures?\u201d Paul countered."}
