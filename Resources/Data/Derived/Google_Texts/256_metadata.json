His street sushi is just as good as the real thing, right? Now, replace sushi with medical marijuana.\n\nThe website MarijuanaDoctors.com has graced the TV airwaves with what might be the first commercial promoting weed \u2014 medical marijuana, that is. The commercial, which will be aired by Comcast\u2019s late-night TV throughout New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Chicago, is a comically stupid take on the drug-free spots that aired during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nMeet sushi guy. He\u2019s suspicious and jumpy, but \u201cYo, you want sushi, I got sushi. I got the best sushi\u201d he says. Sushi, aka weed, just can\u2019t be as good when bought from the street when compared to a real shop \u2014 it\u2019s still pretty hard to find good sushi, even at real restaurants. Nevertheless, the commercial\u2019s intention is to connect patients with real doctors who can refer them to medical marijuana dispensaries.\n\n\u201cWe felt the viewing public would agree that in the states providing safe access, continuing to obtain medicine illegally is as absurd as purchasing raw fish from a drug dealer,\u201d the site\u2019s CEO Jason Draizin said in a statement.\n\nComcast already began airing the commercial on CNN, Comedy Central, The History Channel, and A&E. If you want to check out sushi guy\u2019s sales pitch \u2014 though I wouldn\u2019t trust it \u2014 watch the commercial below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical marijuana commercial, medical marijuana ad, medical marijuana advertisement, marijuana commercial, sushi and marijuana, marijuanadoctors.com, marijuana doctors", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Meet sushi guy.
