While the statistical effects of these reforms are hard to pin down, patients have expressed appreciation, he said.\n\nSome research has quantified the benefits. A 2010 study published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine found a 49 percent drop in use of sedatives to help patients sleep when hospitals rescheduled nighttime check-ins and medication administration. This approach reduced the risk of side effects associated with sedative use.\n\nSimilarly, New York's Mount Sinai hospital is developing a system to identify which patients would actually benefit from around-the-clock check-ins, according to CNN. Patients with complex conditions or at risk for serious infections should have their vitals checked regularly, even at night, but others can wait until morning, according to Mount Sinai's Rosanne Leipzig, a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine. The hospital has also looked at widening the intervals for some medication administration from four hours to six, which allows them to schedule four doses a day and avoid waking patients.\n\nA 2013 study found more natural light could improve patient sleeping patterns as well as reduce pain levels, FierceHealthcare previously reported, but factors that have nothing to do with the hospital routine, such as post-operative pain, can also affect sleep.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare industry can't get no (patient) satisfaction\n\nStudy: Better lighting could improve patient sleep, comfort\n\nPost-operative pain leads to less sleep, longer hospital stays\n\n3 keys to unlock the patient satisfaction puzzle\n\nBe a better CEO: The chief empathy officer\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "To improve patients' sleep patterns, many providers are working to reduce or reschedule activities that interfere with a full night's rest.
