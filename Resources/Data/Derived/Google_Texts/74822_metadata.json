Peter Farrell (R-56th) that he said would make workers\u2019 compensation more fair and transparent.\n\nThe bill, HB378, would establish fee schedules for medical services. Farrell said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill\u2019s future, as reported by Capital News Service\n\n\u201cFor at least four or five years now, we\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to come up with a more transparent reimbursement system in our workers\u2019 compensation world in Virginia,\u201d he said.\n\nFarrell said the bipartisan bill aimed to be fair to both employers and physicians. Fee schedules would determine the amount of money an employer is liable for an injured employee. The Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, with the help of a consulting firm, will use averaged data from 2014 and 2015 to show employers exactly where prices come from.\n\nA fee schedule will not, however, cut the reimbursement rates for doctors. Farrell said 45 other states already had fee schedules, and they often tried to cut these reimbursements.\n\nThe only opposition Farrell said he has heard of is from people who make money from the absence of a fee schedule.\n\nThe bill unanimously passed the Committee on Commerce and Labor, and is currently awaiting discussion by the Committee on Appropriations since it could have fiscal impact.\n\nThere is an emergency clause so that if the bill is passed, the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission can begin work immediately. The next steps for the commission would be to begin collecting data and establishing the fee schedules, which would become effective on January 1, 2018, Farrell said.\n\nThe Commission would need two full time employees to handle the fee schedule work, according to its chief deputy commissioner.\n\nRead the full story in the Henrico Citizen: House committee to weigh Farrell\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation reform bill \u2013 Henrico Citizen", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Virginia House of Delegates' committee plans to review a bill that Henrico Del.
