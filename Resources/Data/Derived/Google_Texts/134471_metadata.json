That's ahead of where the exchange was at the midpoint of the first open enrollment and similar to where it finished in April.\n\nOverall, the state said 228,766 people have newly enrolled in a private health plan from Nov. 15 to Jan. 12, and 88% have qualified for federal premium subsidies based on their income. Open enrollment ends Feb. 15.\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, credited the strong response among Latinos thus far to increased Spanish-language advertising and an emphasis on in-person help through insurance agents or storefronts.\n\nAnd Lee said there are signs that even more Latinos are waiting in the wings. Half of the 311,000 people who have been determined eligible for coverage but haven't yet picked a health plan identify as Latino, according to state figures.\n\n\"It tells us our marketing and outreach is working,\" Lee said. \"We still need to get these people across the finish line.\"\n\nCovered California has also made a more concerted effort this time to assure people that residency information about family members who are not applying won't be shared with immigration authorities.\n\nThe state has partnered with leading immigrant-rights groups to help spread that message.\n\nThe rate of sign-ups among Asians and African Americans through Jan. 12 was largely in line with the first open enrollment, according to state figures. The breakdown by age wasn't significantly different either.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California: Latino enrollment in Obamacare opens strong", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's health exchange said it has seen a strong turnout among Latinos for Obamacare coverage after nearly two months of open enrollment.", "title": "California: Latino enrollment in Obamacare opens strong", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-covered-california-latinos-20150115-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54b8217d/turbine/la-fi-covered-california-latinos-20150115", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, latinos, covered california, affordable care act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82541470", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-15", "Description": "California's health exchange said it has seen a strong turnout among Latinos for Obamacare coverage after nearly two months of open enrollment.
