A spokesperson for Al Jazeera said she could not discuss personnel issues.\n\nAl Jazeera investigative unit chief Clayton Swisher, who has spearheaded the network\u2019s promotion of the Arafat assassination theory, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSilverstein\u2019s story (co-bylined with David Poort) reported on a Swiss lab study that found \u201cmoderate support\u201d for the claim that Arafat may have died from a lethal dose of polonium and dominated the international press for several days in November.\n\nThe article was released in conjunction with Swisher\u2019s Al Jazeera documentary that heavily pushed the assassination narrative.\n\nSilverstein, a veteran Washington reporter who frequently writes about the intersection of money and politics, left his long-term perch at Harper\u2019s in October.\n\nThe Swiss study published in November bolstered a theory, promoted by some Arafat supporters, that the late Palestinian leader was assassinated by either the Israeli government or by turncoat members of his own inner circle.\n\nThe study also backed up a 2012 report by the same Swiss lab, obtained exclusively by Al Jazeera, that claimed there were unusual traces of radioactive substances on the late Palestinian leader\u2019s clothing and personal belongings.\n\nBut two studies conducted by French and Russian labs and released after the Swiss report in November, did not find evidence to support the assassination theory.\n\nAl Jazeera launched a broadside against the Russian study after it was released.\n\nThe outlet quoted an anonymous source who called the Russian report \u201cinferior\u201d to the Swiss study and claimed the Russian Foreign Ministry instructed the research team to spin the results.\n\nSwisher has been closely involved with the Swiss forensic investigation and with Suha Arafat.\n\nSwisher helped Arafat\u2019s widow commission the Swiss study at the University Centre of Legal Medicine in Lausanne (CURML), according to the lab. He said last month that he believed the CURML conducted the investigations pro bono.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for CURML told the Free Beacon that Suha Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority paid for the studies.\n\nThe lab said that Swisher was informed of this financial arrangement in early 2013.\n\n\u201cMr. Swisher knew early 2013 that this would be our policy,\u201d said CURML spokesman Darcy Christen in an email to the Free Beacon and Swisher. \u201cAs our experts were mandated by both Mrs. Arafat and the PNA, it was [decided] that all costs from the beginning be equally distributed among them.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Al Jazeera reporters have allegedly raised concerns about bias. Twenty-two members of the network\u2019s Egypt staff reportedly resigned in July because they said its coverage of the Cairo demonstrations that led to Mohammad Morsi\u2019s ouster had a pro-Muslim Brotherhood slant.\n\nThe Israel Project\u2019s Omri Ceren, whose organization has criticized the accuracy of the Swiss report, said the circumstances surrounding Silverstein\u2019s dismissal are problematic for the network.\n\n\u201cThese are exactly the kinds of stories that have the potential to do real additional damage to Al Jazeera and other outlets positioning themselves in the new media landscape,\u201d said Ceren.\n\n\u201cIt has all the makings of a perfect storm: they look like they have an agenda that puts them on the side of some really bad actors, and that they\u2019re so committed to their agenda they\u2019re willing to sacrifice not just good reporting but even famous reporters.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed reported last week that the network\u2019s Arafat coverage has generated internal criticism and sparked concerns of bias amongst news staff.\n\nIn one internal email obtained by BuzzFeed, an Al Jazeera journalist worried that the network\u2019s heavy reliance on analyst David Barclay to interpret the Swiss lab report \u201cis going to look biased.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should be bringing in another independent investigator,\u201d wrote the reporter.\n\nAnother email reportedly discussed compensation to be paid to Suha Arafat for her cooperation with the story. A spokesperson for Al Jazeera denied she was paid.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "An Al Jazeera investigative reporter who worked on the network\u2019s high-profile probe into Yasser Arafat\u2019s death was fired last Monday after raising concerns about the objectivity of the network\u2019s", "title": "Al Jazeera Fires Reporter Who Questioned Objectivity of Arafat Coverage", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/al-jazeera-fires-reporter-who-questioned-objectivity-of-arafat-coverage/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP120619112580-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Al Jazeera investigative reporter who worked on the network\u2019s high-profile probe into Yasser Ar", "creator": "@alanagoodman", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP120619112580-150x150.jpg", "title": "Al Jazeera Fires Reporter Who Questioned Objectivity of Arafat Coverage", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda02d\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @alanagoodmanAn Al Jazeera investigative reporter who worked on the network\u2019s high-profile probe into Yasser Arafat\u2019s death was fired last Monday after raising concerns about the objectivity of the network\u2019s Arafat coverage.\nThe article was released in conjunction with Swisher\u2019s Al Jazeera documentary that heavily pushed the assassination narrative.\nA spokesperson for Al Jazeera said she could not discuss personnel issues.\nSince 2012, Al Jazeera has aggressively promoted the controversial theory that Arafat was assassinated with polonium in 2004 and did not die of natural causes.\nAl Jazeera launched a broadside against the Russian study after it was released."}
