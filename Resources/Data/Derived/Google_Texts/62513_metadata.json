You\u2019ve got to get them to like you, you\u2019ve got to get them to feel invested in you, you\u2019ve got to get them to, like, lay awake at night and worry about you.\u201d\n\nYip-Williams, 39, was diagnosed with colon cancer 18 months ago. Developing a rapport with your doctors is crucial, she explains, because most oncologists are working with hundreds, if not thousands, of patients and there is simply no reason for them to take extra time for any one unless they genuinely like that patient on a personal level. For a moment, Yip-Williams wonders aloud how someone might go about getting a doctor to like them, and then she quickly answers her own question: \u201cYou find whatever it is that is charming about yourself, or ingratiating or, you know, but you\u2019ve got to work your way in there.\u201d\n\nHaving previously discussed her diagnosis and her attitude with Medical Daily, Yip-Williams is now open to discussing her treatment and care. She is at NYU, she says, because she likes her oncologist, Dr. Abraham Chachoua, but also she prefers the hospital\u2019s general approach which is preferable to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\u2019s \u201cextremely conservative\u201d methods. \u201cYou know, no vitamins, no supplements,\u201d Yip-Williams says. This is extremely restrictive, she believes, yet she also thinks a strict, evidence-based approach is not very fair to patients.\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s not fair because you\u2019re talking about a community that is so desperate to stay alive and they want to do whatever they can, and you\u2019ve got to give people a little bit of power over their treatment,\u201d she says. So although NYU is ranked number 50 among cancer hospitals, she prefers it to the stringent and top-ranked Sloan Kettering. She prefers her easy-going relationship with Chachoua, who is not only open to alternative treatments but even allows her to break out her pillbox during their sessions so that they can discuss each supplement in turn. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t negatively impact your liver enzymes, he\u2019s fine with it,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce, she even mentioned cannabis to him.\n\nMedical Marijuana\n\nMedical marijuana only recently became legal in the state of New York, but the Department of Health has not yet put into place all the necessary regulations and no licensed dispensaries exist so far so it remains, as of this date, out of reach for most patients. Chachoua told Yip-Williams he has never known cannabis to work for his own patients \u2014 he says they \u201cjust get lethargic\u201d \u2014 still, he went out of his way to email her links about hemp oil and how it can be purchased online. (Hemp oil is not the same thing as cannabis oil, though it is derived from the same plant.) The fact that her doctor would conduct his own online research on her behalf both amused and touched her. \u201cHe\u2019s a great oncologist,\u201d Yip-Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate.\u201d\n\nCannabis Oil Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.\n\nWhile she is at the beginning stages of exploring cannabis oil, she has been using for some time vitamins and supplements recommended by another doctor, Dr. Raymond Chang, author of Beyond the Magic Bullet. (Chang\u2019s recommendations are specific to her cancer and her case and so cannot be repeated here.) Naturally, all of these additional treatments and services add up to quite a bit of money and time. Asked why she doesn\u2019t just go with the program outlined by her oncologist, why not save her precious time and energy for other matters, Yip-Williams\u2019s answer is immediate and precise.\n\n\u201cConventional standard of care fails people at stage 4,\u201d she says. Judging by statistics alone, most people would have to agree.\n\nStaging Cancer\n\nScientists currently divide cancer into four stages, based on tumor size, spread throughout the body, and aggressiveness, with the lower numbers being the better case scenario. While stage 3 colorectal cancer would include infected lymph nodes, stage 4 denotes some level of metastasis to another organ. \u201cChemo seems to treat stage 3 pretty well\u2026 but for stage 4 the stats are terrible,\u201d says Yip-Williams, adding that the dismal 11 percent five-year survival rate for stage 4 tells her the usual arsenal of drugs simply don\u2019t work once cancer has metastasized. Comparatively, more than half of people diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer reach the five-year survival mark as do 92 percent of stage 1 patients (early screening helps).\n\n\u201cI feel like when the standard of care for stage 4 sucks, we\u2019ve got to do something about it. We can\u2019t just sit here and wait to die, right?\u201d Surprisingly, she is laughing while saying this. Many patients stop eating sugar or meat, but both of these attempts at stemming the tide strike Yip-Williams as \u201cludicrous.\u201d However, she understands why people might attempt anything whatsoever to take control of their disease. She even admits the alternative cures she\u2019s tried so far have not made much of a difference and ultimately, she really doesn\u2019t believe anything will work. Still, she finds some psychological benefit in exploring, through Chang and online.\n\nHow, then, does Yip-Williams go about finding these non-standard cures? Essentially, she explores patient chat rooms and blogs and reads what different patients say, and once she finds a consistent recommendation she will try it. Generally, she finds the amount of information available is phenomenal and the sharing of experiences is vital.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what people did before people had access to the Internet and online support groups,\u201d Yip-Williams says. \u201cI think it really does increase your odds of survival,\u201d she tells Medical Daily. While she doesn\u2019t know by how much \u2014 \u201cI mean not like more than five percent\u201d she says \u2014 still she is convinced it has increased her own odds of survival. In the end, she recommends cultivating a relationship with your doctors, exploring on your own, and being as open with other people about your diagnosis as possible. \u201cTry to share your experience, it will help you get information,\u201d Yip-Williams tells Medical Daily. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of advocating for yourself.\u201d\n\nColorectal Cancer by State Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nIn the final article in this series, which will appear next week, Yip-Williams discusses what she is doing to help find a cure.\n\nPart 2 in a Series of 3\n\nCorrection: a previous version of this article stated that medical marijuana was not yet legal in the state of New York, however on July 5, 2014, Governor Cuomo signed a limited medical marijuana bill into law.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colon cancer, colorectal cancer, julie yip-williams, patient advocacy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Julie Yip-Williams, colorectal cancer advocate, suggests patients develop a rapport with their doctors, explore alternative treatments, and share their experiences.", "title": "Cancer Patient Recommends Medical Marijuana And Other Alternative Treatments", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/advice-cancer-patients-julie-yip-williams-get-your-doctor-care-explore-medical-322878", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/20/julie-yip-williams.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Julie Yip-Williams, colorectal cancer advocate, suggests patients develop a rapport with their doctors, explore alternative treatments, and share their experiences.", "title": "Cancer Patient Recommends Medical Marijuana And Other Alternative Treatments", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/advice-cancer-patients-julie-yip-williams-get-your-doctor-care-explore-medical-322878", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/20/julie-yip-williams.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/20/julie-yip-williams.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-20T11:27:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-20T12:46:26-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Julie Yip-Williams, colorectal cancer advocate, suggests patients develop a rapport with their doctors, explore alternative treatments, and share their experiences."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is one of my biggest pieces of advice for people just starting their cancer journey,\u201d Julie Yip-Williams, a cancer patient, tells Medical Daily.\n\u201cTry to share your experience, it will help you get information,\u201d Yip-Williams tells Medical Daily.\n\u201cI think it really does increase your odds of survival,\u201d she tells Medical Daily.\nWhile stage 3 colorectal cancer would include infected lymph nodes, stage 4 denotes some level of metastasis to another organ.\nThis is extremely restrictive, she believes, yet she also thinks a strict, evidence-based approach is not very fair to patients."}
