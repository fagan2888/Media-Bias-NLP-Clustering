Job expansion proceeded at a healthy pace in July in Colorado, hitting 69.5 percent on the AIM WorkForce Index, but wages aren’t keeping pace with inflation.

The WFI index, which ranges between 0 and 100, is a ratio of unique online job postings and the number of unemployed in Colorado. A WFI below 50 indicates a short-term job contraction while an index above 50 indicates job expansion.

The WFI for Colorado dipped slightly from 71.3 in June, but the state’s economy “is healthy and improving,” said Creighton University College of Business MacAllister Chair and economics Prof. Ernie Goss.

The index is produced monthly by Creighton University and Applied Information Management, a non-profit based in Omaha with an office in Denver.

In July, the largest number of online postings in Colorado were for sales jobs, followed by openings in management and customer service.

As a share of state employment, the largest number of job openings in descending order were finance, engineering and customer service.

Nationwide, Colorado moved up to No. 16 from No. 17 in June.

North Dakota ranked No. 1, followed by Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Kansas and Iowa. Goss attributed their high rankings to energy and agriculture.

Mississippi was at the bottom, followed by Maine at No. 49, Georgia, No. 48, New York, No. 47, and California at No. 46.

Goss sounded a note of caution when it came to wages in Colorado.

He said weekly earnings in Colorado rose 1.4 percent year-over-year, which he said is not keeping up with inflation, which rose 2 percent year-over-year.

“You don’t need to be an economist to know that is not good,” Goss said. “You’re moving backwards, folks. If you’re getting a 1.4 percent raise — not enough to keep up with inflation.”
