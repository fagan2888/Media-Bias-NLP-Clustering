U.S. Senate candidate Dwayne Stovall stole some attention Thursday from Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) in the Republican primary against Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

In a new ad, Stovall sits in the bed of a pick-up truck with a golden retriever and equates Cornyn with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

"As a U.S. senator from Texas, you vote for Texans, you don't stab her in the back by voting for cloture on Obamacare. You don't enslave it's children with unconstitutional laws and overwhelming debt. And you certainly don't do all this to please some guy that looks and fights like a turtle," Stovall says.

McConnell and Cornyn came under fire from conservatives for voting Wednesday to move forward legislation increasing the nationâ€™s borrowing limit.

"I'm a Texan. We Texans don't need a Beltway turtle telling us how to fight," Stovall continues, suggesting that Cornyn's votes have been influenced by McConnell.

The golden retriever then adds an opinion.

"I like turtle soup," a voiceover says, speaking on behalf of the dog.

"Really?" says Stovall.

The dog, named Major, stars in another campaign ad Stovall released Friday which criticizes Cornyn for voting with "progressives" in the Senate.

The Texas Senate primary will be held on March 4.
