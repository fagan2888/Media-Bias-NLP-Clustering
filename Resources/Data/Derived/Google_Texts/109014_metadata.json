EBay agreed to make former AT&T Inc. Chief Executive David Dorman a director, and Mr. Icahn dropped support for two men he had nominated for eBay\u2019s board.\n\nThe activist investor also raised his stake in Apple and decreased his stake in Netflix.\n\nMr. Icahn raised his holdings in Apple by 2.8 million shares to more than 7.5 million shares, increasing his bullish bet on the iPhone maker.\n\nIn April, Apple increased its share-repurchase authorization to $90 billion from the $60 billion level announced last year. The company also increased its quarterly dividend by about 8% and said it will split its stock 7-for-1 in June.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Icahn said he agreed completely with Apple\u2019s plans to boost its buyback plan and said he is \u201cextremely pleased\u201d with the company\u2019s quarterly results. He also said the stock \u201cremains meaningfully undervalued\u201d and that \u201cmany analysts fail to understand the company.\u201d\n\nMr. Icahn gave up his fight in February to force Apple to boost its share-repurchase program by $50 billion. Before that, he had retreated from a demand that the consumer-technology giant load up on debt to fund a buyback three times that size.\n\nAs for Netflix, the filing showed that Mr. Icahn continued to decrease his holdings, leaving him with 2.2 million shares at the end of March. High-growth and momentum stocks such as Netflix have tumbled in recent weeks. Shares of Netflix have declined around 21% over the past three months.\n\nMr. Icahn also increased his stake in Herbalife by 33,515 shares to 17 million shares. Mr. Icahn has taken a big bet on the nutritional-supplement company, whose shares have declined around 22% so far this year. Herbalife was accused by hedge-fund manager William Ackman of being a pyramid scheme. In March, the Federal Trade Commission launched a civil investigation into Herbalife\u2019s practices. The company said in response that it will cooperate fully with the FTC and that it\u2019s confident it\u2019s in compliance with the law.\n\nIn late April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman made up after clashing publicly over Herbalife and trading insults on national television. The two also \u201cagreed to disagree\u201d on Herbalife, with Mr. Icahn holding a huge bullish bet and Mr. Ackman holding a huge bearish bet.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a new stake in EBay Inc., according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.
