The fund backs lower middle-market companies, primarily in the consumer goods and manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe San Francisco PE firm has received commitments from college endowments, insurance companies, family offices, pension funds and high net-worth individuals. The fund is investing $25 million to $75 million of equity in businesses with up to $25 million in Ebitda, and will look to partner with management teams. Main Post has already begun backing companies, such as gym operator Chuze Fitness and motorcycle rental service EagleRider. The fund exceeded its initial target of $250 million.\n\n\u201cThe lower middle market is less susceptible to economic movement. You can find pockets of growth,\u201d says managing partner Jeff Mills. \u201cWe think there are more opportunities with new business formations,\u201d adds managing partner Sean Honey.\n\nMain Post was founded in 2014 by a group of former Weston Presidio partners. Some of the team\u2019s past notable investments at Weston Presidio include stakes in restaurant chain Jimmy John\u2019s and Too Faced Cosmetics. The latter was sold to General Atlantic in 2015.\n\nPE Firms have been actively raising funds recently. CVC raised a $1 billion fund to back mid-market technology companies; Thoma Bravo raised a lower middle-market software fund; and Waud Capital Partners closed its fourth fund.\n\nRopes & Gray represented Main Post. M20 Private Fund Advisors LLC served as the placement agent.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"status": "open", "domain": "Mergers & Acquisitions", "sailthru.author": "Demitri Diakantonis", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-08 12:41:00", "og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_sponsors/main-post-bets-on-lower-middle-market-with-debut-fund-260083-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/eaglerider.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Main Post Bets on Lower Middle Market with Debut Fund"}, "type": "Article", "brand": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-08 12:41:00", "wordcount": 232, "sailthru.title": "Main Post Bets on Lower Middle Market with Debut Fund", "featured": 0, "sailthru.tags": "News, Consumer Goods/Retail, Transportation, Private Equity, Private Equity, Main Post Bets on Lower Middle Market Businesses with Debut Fund, private equity, lower middle market, fund raising, EagleRider, Chuze Fitness, consumer, transportation, Ropes & Gray, CVC, Thoma Bravo, Jimmy John s, Too Faced Cosmetics, General Atlantic, Weston Presidio, Article", "sailthru.description": "The San Francisco PE firm has already invested in gym operator Chuze Fitness and motorcycle renter EagleRider", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/eaglerider.jpeg"}, "article_summary": "Main Post Bets on Lower Middle Market with Debut FundThe PE firm has invested in gym operator Chuze Fitness and motorcycle renter EagleRiderMain Post Partners has raised its first fund, Main Post Growth Capital LP, with $400 million in capital.\nMain Post has already begun backing companies, such as gym operator Chuze Fitness and motorcycle rental service EagleRider.\nCVC raised a $1 billion fund to back mid-market technology companies; Thoma Bravo raised a lower middle-market software fund; and Waud Capital Partners closed its fourth fund.\nRopes & Gray represented Main Post.\nMain Post was founded in 2014 by a group of former Weston Presidio partners."}
