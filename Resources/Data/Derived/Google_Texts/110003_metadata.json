And there are still other soldiers.\u201d\n\nStaff Sgt. Lupe Maldonado\u2019s story was reported in the Killeen Daily Herald in May. He was denied a referral to get a colonoscopy, despite having blood in his stool. After going off-post without a referral, Maldonado learned he had aggressive colon cancer.\n\nMaldonado and Chandler were not only denied at the same clinic, but by the same care manager.\n\nWhile Chandler\u2019s time of service ended on Aug. 20, she said she wants to get her story out to help other enlisted soldiers get the treatment they need and deserve.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t live with myself if I don\u2019t help others,\u201d she said.\n\nChandler, 47, joined the Army at 41, because she said she always enjoyed being outdoors, and what she called \u201credneck stuff.\u201d Hiking in the mountains of North Carolina, where she\u2019s from, is one of her favorite pastimes. \u201cNow I can\u2019t go back to my life,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nToo late\n\nUnfortunately, she said, she learned of resources such as Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center\u2019s ombudsman and patient advocacy offices too late. Instead, she tried repeatedly to get help from the care managers at her assigned clinic before getting out of the Army in early August.\n\nChandler was working earlier this year and suffered the second fall of her Army career \u2014 the first occurred at an obstacle course during basic training. While patrolling the barracks one night last February, Chandler fell down about 10 feet of steps and felt pain and numbness in her limbs, reaggravating her old hip injury.\n\nA week later, she said she went to Darnall\u2019s emergency room, where she was diagnosed with compressed nerves, and they transferred her to Scott & White in Temple. Doctors ruled out cauda equina syndrome, a neurologic condition.\n\nShe followed up later with her care manager at Monroe, a female captain, who rarely saw Chandler in person during clinic visits. Instead, Chandler explained what was going on to a medic, who would then go to another room, speak to the physician\u2019s assistant, and come back with a response.\n\nDarnall officials didn\u2019t deny this is common procedure.\n\n\u201cMedics often bridge communication between patients and providers as part of the care team,\u201d Col. Roger Gallup, Darnall\u2019s deputy commander of clinical services, said in an email. Medics and nurses screen patients when they arrive for an appointment. Patients then see their assigned care manager if they are available or another provider at the clinic.\n\nThere are 27 providers supporting 15,400 active-duty soldiers at Monroe, Gallup said.\n\nChandler\u2019s referral was denied, as was an exception to participate in morning physical training and pain medication.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even want to help me a little bit,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nShort-timer\n\nIn one denied referral dated July 19, her care manager referenced Chandler\u2019s quickly approaching separation date from the Army.\n\n\u201c(A separation) date does not change the level of care provided,\u201d Gallup said.\n\nHowever, providers are always cognizant of important events such as station moves, separation dates, retirement, deployment and temporary changes of station that may impact a soldier\u2019s treatment plan availability within the standard of care, he said.\n\nGallup was not able to provide the percentage of referrals that are denied at Darnall, but cited only administrative reasons for which ones would be denied.\n\n\u201cA referral may be denied because it was entered under the incorrect clinic. It also may be returned for further information. At times, the consultant provides input for the primary care provider for further care at the primary care level before referral,\u201d Gallup said.\n\nWhen asked if care managers are ever encouraged to deny referrals for any reason, he said they are \u201cencouraged to provide care within the scope of their clinical practice following applicable clinical practice guidelines.\u201d\n\nChandler took matters into her own hands, and went directly to the orthopedic clinic at Fort Hood to ask for the prerequisites she needed to be seen, so she could then go to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.\n\nEventually, she made it to San Antonio within days of her separation date and was told they couldn\u2019t help her anymore \u2014 she now needed to start with Veterans Affairs.\n\nNow Chandler is fighting a new battle, access to the VA health care system. There, the backlog of claims is dropping, but it still hovers above 400,000.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "Angela Chandler spends most of her days lying in bed, afraid to move.", "title": "Specialty care denied in several cases at Fort Hood", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/military/specialty-care-denied-in-several-cases-at-fort-hood/article_81456db2-49c7-11e3-a12c-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/ed/ced454ee-49c7-11e3-a7ce-0019bb30f31a/527f17df272d6.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C300", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KDHmilitary"}, "description": "Angela Chandler spends most of her days lying in bed, afraid to move.", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "referral,angela chandler,fort hood,care manager,monroe clinic,lupe maldonado,carl r. darnall army medical center,army,monroe health clinic,primary care,clinical services,assigned care manager,brooke army medical center,military,top_story", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rosel.thayer"}, "news_keywords": "referral,angela chandler,fort hood,care manager,monroe clinic,lupe maldonado,carl r. darnall army medical center,army,monroe health clinic,primary care,clinical services,assigned care manager,brooke army medical center,military,top_story"}, "article_summary": "Short-timerIn one denied referral dated July 19, her care manager referenced Chandler\u2019s quickly approaching separation date from the Army.\nAt times, the consultant provides input for the primary care provider for further care at the primary care level before referral,\u201d Gallup said.\nMaldonado and Chandler were not only denied at the same clinic, but by the same care manager.\nChandler, a Killeen resident, is the second soldier to speak out about being denied a referral from the Monroe clinic.\nPatients then see their assigned care manager if they are available or another provider at the clinic."}
