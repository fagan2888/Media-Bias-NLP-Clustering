I've lived here most of my life.\n\nWhat brought you here? What has kept you here? It' pretty close to everything. It's not too big of a city. We have friends here.\n\nWhy cosmetology? I've always really been interested in it, and I really enjoy it. It's really fun to learn to style hair to make certain features more prominent. I work at Sport Clips. Cutting and styling guys' hair is really my strength in the class.\n\nWhat have you liked the most about high school and what would you change? I've really enjoyed the teachers. They have looked out for my best interests. If I could go back, I would have been less shy going into high school. I didn't know anybody when I started high school.\n\nWhat's your dream job? I really want to go into criminology. Cutting hair will be a way to help me get through college.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741361/100-alessandra-chavez", "modificationDate": "2015-03-28T19:55:50-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHAVEZ~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-03-18T22:35:48-0600", "description": "Age: 17\nOccupation: Senior at Longmont High School, in the cosmetology program at the Career Development Center\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27741361:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741361/100-alessandra-chavez", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHAVEZ~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Age: 17\nOccupation: Senior at Longmont High School, in the cosmetology program at the Career Development Center\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "title": "100: Alessandra Chavez"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Age: 17\nOccupation: Senior at Longmont High School, in the cosmetology program at the Career Development Center\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "title": "100: Alessandra Chavez", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741361/100-alessandra-chavez", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHAVEZ~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "100: Alessandra Chavez", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Community Review", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHAVEZ~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-28T19:56:48-0600", "news_keywords": "longmont, colorado, community, review, weld, county, top 100, community review, longmont times call, longmont colorado"}, "article_summary": "Alessandra ChavezAge: 17Occupation: Senior at Longmont High School, in the cosmetology program at the Career Development CenterHow many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley?\nIf I could go back, I would have been less shy going into high school.\nWhat have you liked the most about high school and what would you change?\nI've really enjoyed the teachers.\nI didn't know anybody when I started high school."}
