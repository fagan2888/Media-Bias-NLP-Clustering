They\u2019re probably not in the mood for it.\n\nGarcia is president of the National Education Association. Farrace is a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. They recently were quoted about Nevada\u2019s passage of a school-choice measure, which allows families opting out of the public education system to send their kids\u2019 share of per-pupil spending to whatever school they choose.\n\nGarcia says this leaves her \u201cterrified\u201d because so many states (27 at last count) \u201chave bought into this very dangerous idea that school is a commodity.\u201d Farrace warns that \u201cfunneling public funds to private schools means fewer teachers, fewer counselors, fewer supplemental services and, in general, fewer opportunities for the vast majority of kids who remain in public schools. It really violates the public trust when policymakers place individual benefit before the public good.\u201d\n\nThese are standard talking points in the school-choice debate\u2014and rather misleading ones. At worst, voucher programs can leave public schools with slightly less money to spend per remaining pupil. But in fact they usually leave the schools with more, because most vouchers offer less than the state\u2019s per-pupil expenditure. For example, if 10 students each leave a school with an 80 percent voucher, then the school has 10 fewer students but loses only eight students\u2019 worth of funding. Meanwhile, the state is spending only 80 percent of what it otherwise would have on the voucher students.\n\nGranted, this math doesn\u2019t work if all the kids who use vouchers would have gone to private school anyway. But the National Conference of State Legislatures reports that\u2019s almost never the case. Usually only 10 percent to 15 percent of voucher recipients fall into that category, and half of them would go back to the public schools without a voucher. Hence Florida\u2019s tax-credit scholarship program has saved the state more than $1.40 for every voucher dollar, amounting to a savings of nearly $40 million a year. Milwaukee\u2019s school-choice program has produced even bigger savings.\n\nSo the complaint about siphoning off resources from the public schools misses its mark. But what the heck, let\u2019s be sporting and assume for the sake of argument that it\u2019s true. In that case, one reasonable response might be: So what?\n\nAfter all, what is a school voucher but a kind of Obamacare subsidy?\n\nObamacare\u2019s subsidies make private medical care accessible to their recipients. With it, they can choose from among a variety of approved providers\u2014just like those who use school vouchers. The NEA, which supports Obamacare, certainly doesn\u2019t consider this \u201cdangerous.\u201d Nor does it fret that offering people a range of choices among health care providers commoditizes medicine. Nor, evidently, do public-education advocates think Obamacare\u2019s limited freedom of consumer choice places \u201cindividual benefit before the public good.\u201d After all, the public good is served when people get medical care\u2014not when they get it through one particular source only.\n\nGranted, while health care reform was being debated the NEA said it \u201cstrongly supports a public health care option.\u201d Guess what? School voucher programs include a public option, too\u2014existing public schools. Nobody is forced to use a voucher. That means a school voucher program resembles precisely the public-private hybrid arrangement the NEA sought for health care.\n\nBut what the teachers unions fought to pass in health care, they fight against in education. Go figure.\n\nCritics of vouchers always warn about the dangers of giving parents more options: private schools with low standards, lousy curricula, \u201cabhorrent discipline policies,\u201d and so on\u2014as if we didn\u2019t read about similar problems in the public schools every day. They don\u2019t bother to mention that public-school teachers send their own kids to private schools at twice the rate the general public does\u2014and, in some places, three to four times the rate.\n\nThe current education model, meanwhile, is nothing like Obamacare. It\u2019s not like Obamacare with a public option. It\u2019s not even like a single-payer system, such as a Medicare-for-all program would be. Rather, it\u2019s the equivalent of a state-run system in which the vast majority of the public is consigned to a government-run hospital or clinic, while the rich buy their way out.\n\nBut imagine for a moment that America\u2019s education system did resemble Obamacare. In each case, consumers chose from a wide array of private providers, along with a couple of public ones, and the government guaranteed financial support for those who couldn\u2019t pay. Now imagine someone coming along and suggesting that we scrap the entire free-choice system and herd everyone, except the very rich, into state schools and hospitals managed and run by government bureaucrats.\n\nHow many people would be willing to make that switch?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Why choice should trump coercion.", "title": "The Case for School Vouchers", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/06/10/the-case-for-school-vouchers", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14339507726165.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14339507726165.jpg", "description": "Why choice should trump coercion.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Case for School Vouchers"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-10T16:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/a-barton-hinkle"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1db3\"", "article_summary": "Granted, this math doesn\u2019t work if all the kids who use vouchers would have gone to private school anyway.\nSchool voucher programs include a public option, too\u2014existing public schools.\nThat means a school voucher program resembles precisely the public-private hybrid arrangement the NEA sought for health care.\nGranted, while health care reform was being debated the NEA said it \u201cstrongly supports a public health care option.\u201d Guess what?\nWith it, they can choose from among a variety of approved providers\u2014just like those who use school vouchers."}
