It was mostly a lie. The administration deliberately released to sympathetic journalists only those documents from the so-called Osama bin Laden trove that revealed worry and dissension among the terrorists. Then it nourished essays by pet journalists trumpeting the decline of al-Qaeda. Disturbing memos that confounded that narrative, as Weekly Standard journalist Steven F. Hayes recently noted, were kept back. \u201cOn the run\u201d was dropped after the 2012 election, when events on the ground made such an assertion absurd.\n\nRecent disclosures by some of the combatants about the night of the Benghazi attack remind us that almost everything Jay Carney, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, and President Obama swore in the aftermath of the debacle was knowingly false. A video did not cause the attack. The rioting was not spontaneous. A video-maker, an American resident, was soon jailed, while one of the suspected killers was giving taped interviews at a coffee house in Benghazi. There were ways of securing the consulate and the annex that were not explored, both before and during the assault. Talking points were altered. Again, the catalyst for untruth was reelection worries by an administration that believes its exalted ends of social justice allow any means necessary for reaching them.\n\nHas anything the administration said about pulling our troops out of Iraq proven true? Was it really the Iraqis\u2019 fault or George Bush\u2019s? Was our leaving proof that Iraq might be one of the administration\u2019s \u201cgreat achievements\u201d? Was the Iraq that we left without any peacekeepers really \u201cstable\u201d? On more than ten occasions the president bragged on the campaign trail that he alone had ended American involvement in Iraq. When Iraq predictably blew up after our departure, he snarled to reporters that he was angry that anyone would dare accuse him alone of being responsible for our precipitate departure.\n\nWas there any element of \u201creset\u201d with Russia that was accurate? Obama came into office lambasting the prior administration for alienating Russia \u2014 when all it had done was adopt some rather moderate measures to punish Russia for invading Georgia. Reset, in truth, was a remission of punishments \u2014 from missile defense with the Czechs and Poles to cut-offs of some high-level negotiations \u2014 and thus served as a signal to Putin and his subordinates that Obama believed America had been wrong to react to Georgia. And we know what followed from that.\n\nLIES TO HIDE WHAT WE DON\u2019T LIKE\n\nOn issues where the public is at odds with the administration, the Obama team too often makes things up to hide its isolation. Little the administration has stated about the IRS scandal has proven true. It was not a slip-up in one local office; nor were liberal groups equally targeted. There was quite a bit more than a \u201csmidgen\u201d of corruption. The administration\u2019s strategy was to make so many things up that the public got confused and the matter went away. The corruption worked to defang the Tea Party in 2012, and the cover-up \u2014 except for fall woman Lois Lerner, who took the Fifth Amendment \u2014 worked even better.\n\nHave any of the statements the administration has presented about our southern border proven true? Do we know how many people have recently crossed into the United States illegally, what exactly U.S. immigration policy is, or where exactly foreign nationals are and what are their statuses? The public polls strongly against lax borders and blanket amnesties, so the administration apparently must deceive to permit both \u2014 and in a politically disingenuous fashion of postponing the requisite executive orders until after the 2014 midterm elections, while blaming the delay on the crisis on the border that it caused.\n\nDid much of anything prove accurate about the Affordable Care Act? Costs, keeping our doctors and existing plans, the effect on the deficit, the website? Had the president in 2008 outlined honestly the ACA\u2019s provisions, he would never have gotten elected, or had he by 2012 fully implemented them, he would never have gotten reelected. Lying about Obamacare and demonizing any who objected were smart politics, but the president will never regain the trust of those whose premiums spiked, who lost their coverage and their doctors, and who still do not understand what exactly Obamacare is.\n\nMYTHOGRAPHY\n\nMost of the assertions uttered in the 2009 Cairo speech were untrue, from false claims about Islamic achievement to supposed Islamic tolerance during the Inquisition in C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 at a time when there were no Muslims in C\u00f3rdoba. Emperor Hirohito no more surrendered to General Douglas MacArthur than George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR were in office when their respective wars ended and they supposedly agreed to prisoner exchanges \u2014 or than Barack Obama\u2019s grandfather helped to free Auschwitz. Obama sees history in the same postmodernist fashion in which he looks upon his own past \u2014 details are constructed by everyone, and thus truth is a relative concept that should not be adjudicated by those with privilege against those who are using narratives to advance social justice. The result is that almost any time the president makes reference to the past, ours or his, we can assume two things: His facts are wrong, and they are wrong in a way that is meant to highlight his own godhead.\n\nAMNESIA\n\nThere are lots of things that Obama says that he knows will simply fade into oblivion. Did we ever believe that Joe Biden was going to bird-dog abuses in spending for the stimulus to ensure shovel-ready jobs? Did we really believe that Obama would halve the deficit by the end of his first term \u2014 or that he would close Guantanamo Bay? Did he really obtain congressional approval for bombing Libya, as he once promised for such operations? Did anyone believe that the Obama administration would not hire former lobbyists or that it would end the revolving door, any more than we believed Obama\u2019s assurances that those who made less than $250,000 would not have any of their taxes go up? What exactly is an Obama step-over line, red line, or deadline? Obama\u2019s serial rhetorical emphatics \u2014 Let me be perfectly clear, Make no mistake about it, In point of fact, You can take that to the bank, I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 are the usual verbal tics that warn the audience that a complete untruth is to follow.\n\nSCAPEGOATING\n\nThen there is another sort of untruth summed up best as blame-gaming \u2014 \u201cThey did it, not me!\u201d The president confessed to having no strategy to deal with the Islamic State. But that was the fault of the Pentagon for not yet formulating any. The Islamic State had crept up on us \u2014 and that was the fault of the intelligence services. The world is in chaos? The new social networking \u2014 the much-bragged-about hip keystone of Obama\u2019s two election campaigns \u2014 is to blame for making the gullible believe the world is falling apart. The president had to remove every last soldier from Iraq \u2014 but he didn\u2019t really do that; it was either Bush or Maliki. The president ignored his own red lines in Syria? But they weren\u2019t his own: The U.N., not he, made them. The president dubbed the Islamic State the jayvees? No, he actually meant an array of groups.\n\nSuch blame-gaming is simply the current foreign-policy manifestation of a long-established Obama-administration trait of blaming dismal news on something other than its own policies: ATMs were responsible for high joblessness; the stimulus failed, but House obstructionism was to blame. The Republican House also blocked immigration reform \u2014 which Obama easily could have passed when the Democrats controlled the Congress in 2009\u201310. Tsunamis and earthquakes, including a mild tremor in D.C. itself, rattled the economy and contributed to the discouraging economic statistics. Bad GDP news? The American people had gotten a bit \u201csoft\u201d and lost \u201ctheir competitive edge.\u201d\n\nREDACTED\n\nSometimes there are lies by omission. The administration is simply incapable of uttering the phrases \u201cradical Islam\u201d or \u201cIslamic terrorism,\u201d and that fact requires all sorts of lying by omission about who exactly is killing Americans and why. So we are serially told that the Muslim Brotherhood is largely secular, that workplace violence caused Fort Hood, that jihad is largely a personal journey, that the idea of terrorists creating a caliphate is absurd, and all the other euphemisms necessary to hide the apparently unpleasant truth of killing by radical Islamists.\n\nAs far as the VA, AP, IRS, NSA, and other scandals go, do not count on any confession, investigation, lawsuit, or special prosecutor to reveal the truth in the next two years. The Obama administration will lose documents, redact critical information, find e-mails only years later, and lie about evidence until most of its members are safely out of office and working for Citigroup, one of the major TV networks, or Goldman Sachs.\n\nObama\u2019s prevaricating has lost him any thought of a legacy, all the more so because for years as a candidate and as president he pontificated about his new transparency and the need for executive candor \u2014 itself an untruth at best, and at worst a cynical ploy to provide cover for a deliberate effort to enact policies that could not be honestly presented to the American people.\n\nThe two fuels that run Untruth, Inc., are, first, a realization that most of the president\u2019s policies, whether deliberately or as a result of indifference and laziness, run counter to what most Americans support, and, second, a media establishment so invested in his agenda that it will not call the administration to account. So the engine of lying keeps humming. On any given day the president of the United States can step up to the teleprompter amid the latest disaster and swear that he did not do what he just did, or insist that someone else, not he, did the dastardly deed, or simply skip over recent history and make things up. The press at first quibbles, then nods in agreement, and Obama is empowered to do it again and again. We have not seen such a disingenuous president since Richard Nixon \u2014 but he, at least, was countered rather than enabled by the media.\n\n\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Savior Generals.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Obama\u2019s Untruth, Inc.", "sailthru.author": "Victor Davis Hanson", "description": "We can usefully view the Obama administration\u2019s chronic untruthfulness as a sort of multifaceted corporation of untruth, with all sorts of subsidiaries.\n\nTHE BALD LIES OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY\nRemember the al-Qaeda-is-on-the-run 2012-election talking point?

We have not seen such a disingenuous president since Richard Nixon \u2014 but he, at least, was countered rather than enabled by the media.\n\n\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Savior Generals.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Untruth, Inc.", "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/387410/obamas-untruth-inc-victor-davis-hanson", "image": "http://c10.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_related_090914_SM_Barack-Obama-Lies-G.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/387410/obamas-untruth-inc-victor-davis-hanson", "image": "http://c2.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_giant_090914_SM_Barack-Obama-Lies-G.jpg", "description": "We can usefully view the Obama administration\u2019s chronic untruthfulness as a sort of multifaceted corporation of untruth, with all sorts of subsidiaries.\n\nTHE BALD LIES OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY\nRemember the al-Qaeda-is-on-the-run 2012-election talking point? It was mostly a lie. The administration deliberately released to sympathetic journalists only those documents from the so-called Osama bin Laden trove that revealed worry and dissension among the terrorists. Then it nourished essays by pet journalists trumpeting the decline of al-Qaeda. Disturbing memos that confounded that narrative, as Weekly Standard journalist Steven F. Hayes recently noted, were kept back. \u201cOn the run\u201d was dropped after the 2012 election, when events on the ground made such an assertion absurd.\n\n#ad#Recent disclosures by some of the combatants about the night of the Benghazi attack remind us that almost everything Jay Carney, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, and President Obama swore in the aftermath of the debacle was knowingly false. A video did not cause the attack. The rioting was not spontaneous. A video-maker, an American resident, was soon jailed, while one of the suspected killers was giving taped interviews at a coffee house in Benghazi. There were ways of securing the consulate and the annex that were not explored, both before and during the assault. Talking points were altered. Again, the catalyst for untruth was reelection worries by an administration that believes its exalted ends of social justice allow any means necessary for reaching them.\n\nHas anything the administration said about pulling our troops out of Iraq proven true? Was it really the Iraqis\u2019 fault or George Bush\u2019s? Was our leaving proof that Iraq might be one of the administration\u2019s \u201cgreat achievements\u201d? Was the Iraq that we left without any peacekeepers really \u201cstable\u201d? On more than ten occasions the president bragged on the campaign trail that he alone had ended American involvement in Iraq. When Iraq predictably blew up after our departure, he snarled to reporters that he was angry that anyone would dare accuse him alone of being responsible for our precipitate departure.\n\nWas there any element of \u201creset\u201d with Russia that was accurate? Obama came into office lambasting the prior administration for alienating Russia \u2014 when all it had done was adopt some rather moderate measures to punish Russia for invading Georgia. Reset, in truth, was a remission of punishments \u2014 from missile defense with the Czechs and Poles to cut-offs of some high-level negotiations \u2014 and thus served as a signal to Putin and his subordinates that Obama believed America had been wrong to react to Georgia. And we know what followed from that.\n\nLIES TO HIDE WHAT WE DON\u2019T LIKE\nOn issues where the public is at odds with the administration, the Obama team too often makes things up to hide its isolation. Little the administration has stated about the IRS scandal has proven true. It was not a slip-up in one local office; nor were liberal groups equally targeted. There was quite a bit more than a \u201csmidgen\u201d of corruption. The administration\u2019s strategy was to make so many things up that the public got confused and the matter went away. The corruption worked to defang the Tea Party in 2012, and the cover-up \u2014 except for fall woman Lois Lerner, who took the Fifth Amendment \u2014 worked even better.\n\nHave \u00a0any of the statements the administration has presented about our southern border proven true? Do we know how many people have recently crossed into the United States illegally, what exactly U.S. immigration policy is, or where exactly foreign nationals are and what are their statuses? The public polls strongly against lax borders and blanket amnesties, so the administration apparently must deceive to permit both \u2014 and in a politically disingenuous fashion of postponing the requisite executive orders until after the 2014 midterm elections, while blaming the delay on the crisis on the border that it caused.\n\nDid much of anything prove accurate about the Affordable Care Act? Costs, keeping our doctors and existing plans, the effect on the deficit, the website? Had the president in 2008 outlined honestly the ACA\u2019s provisions, he would never have gotten elected, or had he by 2012 fully implemented them, he would never have gotten reelected. Lying about Obamacare and demonizing any who objected were smart politics, but the president will never regain the trust of those whose premiums spiked, who lost their coverage and their doctors, and who still do not understand what exactly Obamacare is.\n\nMYTHOGRAPHY\nMost of the assertions uttered in the 2009 Cairo speech were untrue, from false claims about Islamic achievement to supposed Islamic tolerance during the Inquisition in C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 at a time when there were no Muslims in C\u00f3rdoba. Emperor Hirohito no more surrendered to General Douglas MacArthur than George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR were in office when their respective wars ended and they supposedly agreed to prisoner exchanges \u2014 or than Barack Obama\u2019s grandfather helped to free Auschwitz. Obama sees history in the same postmodernist fashion in which he looks upon his own past \u2014 details are constructed by everyone, and thus truth is a relative concept that should not be adjudicated by those with privilege against those who are using narratives to advance social justice. The result is that almost any time the president makes reference to the past, ours or his, we can assume two things: His facts are wrong, and they are wrong in a way that is meant to highlight his own godhead.\n\n#page#AMNESIA\nThere are lots of things that Obama says that he knows will simply fade into oblivion. Did we ever believe that Joe Biden was going to bird-dog abuses in spending for the stimulus to ensure shovel-ready jobs? Did we really believe that Obama would halve the deficit by the end of his first term \u2014 or that he would close Guantanamo Bay? Did he really obtain congressional approval for bombing Libya, as he once promised for such operations? Did anyone believe that the Obama administration would not hire former lobbyists or that it would end the revolving door, any more than we believed Obama\u2019s assurances that those who made less than $250,000 would not have any of their taxes go up? What exactly is an Obama step-over line, red line, or deadline? Obama\u2019s serial rhetorical emphatics \u2014 Let me be perfectly clear, Make no mistake about it, In point of fact, You can take that to the bank, I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 are the usual verbal tics that warn the audience that a complete untruth is to follow.\n\n#ad#SCAPEGOATING\nThen there is another sort of untruth summed up best as blame-gaming \u2014 \u201cThey did it, not me!\u201d The president confessed to having no strategy to deal with the Islamic State. But that was the fault of the Pentagon for not yet formulating any. The Islamic State had crept up on us \u2014 and that was the fault of the intelligence services. The world is in chaos? The new social networking \u2014 the much-bragged-about hip keystone of Obama\u2019s two election campaigns \u2014 is to blame for making the gullible believe the world is falling apart. The president had to remove every last soldier from Iraq \u2014 but he didn\u2019t really do that; it was either Bush or Maliki. The president ignored his own red lines in Syria? But they weren\u2019t his own: The U.N., not he, made them. The president dubbed the Islamic State the jayvees? No, he actually meant an array of groups.\n\nSuch blame-gaming is simply the current foreign-policy manifestation of a long-established Obama-administration trait of blaming dismal news on something other than its own policies: ATMs were responsible for high joblessness; the stimulus failed, but House obstructionism was to blame. The Republican House also blocked immigration reform \u2014 which Obama easily could have passed when the Democrats controlled the Congress in 2009\u201310. Tsunamis and earthquakes, including a mild tremor in D.C. itself, rattled the economy and contributed to the discouraging economic statistics. Bad GDP news? The American people had gotten a bit \u201csoft\u201d and lost \u201ctheir competitive edge.\u201d\n\nREDACTED\nSometimes there are lies by omission. The administration is simply incapable of uttering the phrases \u201cradical Islam\u201d or \u201cIslamic terrorism,\u201d and that fact requires all sorts of lying by omission about who exactly is killing Americans and why. So we are serially told that the Muslim Brotherhood is largely secular, that workplace violence caused Fort Hood, that jihad is largely a personal journey, that the idea of terrorists creating a caliphate is absurd, and all the other euphemisms necessary to hide the apparently unpleasant truth of killing by radical Islamists.\n\nAs far as the VA, AP, IRS, NSA, and other scandals go, do not count on any confession, investigation, lawsuit, or special prosecutor to reveal the truth in the next two years. The Obama administration will lose documents, redact critical information, find e-mails only years later, and lie about evidence until most of its members are safely out of office and working for Citigroup, one of the major TV networks, or Goldman Sachs.\n\nObama\u2019s prevaricating has lost him any thought of a legacy, all the more so because for years as a candidate and as president he pontificated about his new transparency and the need for executive candor \u2014 itself an untruth at best, and at worst\u00a0a cynical ploy to provide cover for a deliberate effort to enact policies that could not be honestly presented to the American people.\n\nThe two fuels that run Untruth, Inc., are, first, a realization that most of the president\u2019s policies, whether deliberately or as a result of indifference and laziness, run counter to what most Americans support, and, second, a media establishment so invested in his agenda that it will not call the administration to account. So the engine of lying keeps humming. On any given day the president of the United States can step up to the teleprompter amid the latest disaster and swear that he did not do what he just did, or insist that someone else, not he, did the dastardly deed, or simply skip over recent history and make things up. The press at first quibbles, then nods in agreement, and Obama is empowered to do it again and again. We have not seen such a disingenuous president since Richard Nixon \u2014 but he, at least, was countered rather than enabled by the media.\n\n\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Savior Generals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s Untruth, Inc.    , by Victor Davis Hanson, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Tue, 2014-09-09 04:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Obama\u2019s Untruth, Inc.", "sailthru.tags": "Obama\u2019s Untruth, Inc.    , Victor Davis Hanson, National Review", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "keywords": "Victor Davis Hanson", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Victor Davis Hanson, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceafa\"", "article_summary": "Recent disclosures by some of the combatants about the night of the Benghazi attack remind us that almost everything Jay Carney, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, and President Obama swore in the aftermath of the debacle was knowingly false.\nThere were ways of securing the consulate and the annex that were not explored, both before and during the assault.\nOn more than ten occasions the president bragged on the campaign trail that he alone had ended American involvement in Iraq.\n\u201cOn the run\u201d was dropped after the 2012 election, when events on the ground made such an assertion absurd.\nAMNESIAThere are lots of things that Obama says that he knows will simply fade into oblivion."}
