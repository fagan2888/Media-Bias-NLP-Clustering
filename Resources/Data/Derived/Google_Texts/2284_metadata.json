It sounds like they\u2019re going into their dens for the winter. It\u2019s really kind of interesting, because I think from the point of view of the Republicans in the House, their approach is to \u2018do no harm,\u2019 which of course is hardly a rallying cry.\u201d\n\nFor sure, the 113th Congress would have to make a real effort to match last year\u2019s dismal performance when it was arguably one of the least productive bodies in history. Lawmakers passed just 55 substantive bills that were signed into law, according to the Pew Research Center, while getting bogged down in a partisan morass over scores of other important matters.\n\nThe \u2018New and Improved\u2019 Ted Cruz Infuriates His Colleagues Again\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that after a tumultuous week of party infighting and leadership stumbles, \u201ccongressional Republicans are focused on calming their divided ranks in the months ahead, mostly by touting proposals that have wide backing within the GOP and shelving any big ticket legislation for the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nIn that vein, The Post said, championing a handful of bills on job growth, energy and regulatory policy \u2013 \u201call targeted at courting swing voters but unlikely to win Democratic support \u2013 has become a priority.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) set the tone for the new \u201cdo-next-to-nothing\u201d approach with an article published last week by National Review Online that is high on generalities and short of specifics. Cantor lamented what he described as \u201cthe middle-class squeeze\u201d \u2013 the combination of a median household income lower today than it was in 2000, a long-term flat-lining of wages, and growing household costs for gasoline, health care, utilities and education.\n\n\u201cOur agenda for an America that works will go beyond support for small-business owners and capital formation; our platform will address the concerns of the 90 percent of Americans who don\u2019t own a business and are looking for a good-paying job to support their families,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will pursue policies that support them as they seek a secure job with a decent salary that enables them to support their families, pursue their dreams, and leave their children a little more than they have.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cantor, Ryan, Rubio, Rush--Who Speaks for the GOP?\n\nHis ideas for tackling this squeeze? Reduce household energy and health-care costs, stop regulations that reduce take-home pay, and update the tax code. \u201cWe will confront head-on the policies of the Obama administration that punish work, such as the 29-hour-work-week provision in Obamacare that is cutting hourly workers\u2019\u200b wages by as much 25 percent,\u201d Cantor declared.\n\nFor their part, the Democrats aren\u2019t promising all that much more either. During his State of the Union speech last month, President Obama declared 2014 a year of action. He said that would include new immigration laws and retirement savings, reducing the economic inequality gap and creating a pathway for cheaper college education.\n\nApart from his big push for raising the minimum wage \u2013 a proposal unlikely to get past the House this year \u2013 much of what he vowed to do entailed the use of executive orders to bypass the Congress.\n\nRelated: Tax Breaks 2014: A $63 Billion Boon to Business\n\nCongress approved new farm and food stamp legislation shortly after returning to work, which may turn out to be one of its biggest accomplishments of the year. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) vowed early on to push through an extension of unemployment insurance for 1.7 million long-term unemployed people, but so far hasn\u2019t been unable to overcome Republican opposition.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Reid and other top Democrats are vigorously opposing a major element of Obama\u2019s economic strategy \u2013 to use fast-track authority to negotiate the two largest trade deals in U.S. history, in the Pacific Rim and European Union. Obama hasn\u2019t given up hope that he can prevail in that battle, but for now it\u2019s not looking good for the president.\n\n\u201cI think the Democrats, by necessity because they are the party of the president, will have to do something,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThey can\u2019t rely on the president to be the only source of activity by issuing executive orders. I think they are going to push very hard on increasing the minimum wage. I think that\u2019s going to be their main draw card.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If the 113th Congress broke all records last year for being the biggest do-nothing legislative body in modern times, this year it may set a record for doing \u201cnext to nothing.\u201d", "title": "Get Ready for the \u2018Do-Next-to-Nothing\u2019 Congress", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/20/Get-Ready-Do-Next-Nothing-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08152012_donothing_congress2_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/20/Get-Ready-Do-Next-Nothing-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08152012_donothing_congress2_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If the 113th Congress broke all records last year for being the biggest do-nothing legislative body in modern times, this year it may set a record for doing \u201cnext to nothing.\u201d", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d57\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all finger food and no main course,\u201d Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University and an expert on Congress, said on Wednesday.\nI think they are going to push very hard on increasing the minimum wage.\nI think that\u2019s going to be their main draw card.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a new, hibernating Congress.\nInstead, they will pursue a series of safe, small-bore and feel-good measures that can in no way jeopardize their mid-term election campaign strategy."}
