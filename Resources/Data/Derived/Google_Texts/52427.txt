BAY CITY, MI — Staffing adjustments at McLaren Bay Region brought on by declining patient volume and changes in the health care industry nationwide are expected to affect 5 percent of the hospital's workforce come early January.

Magen Samyn, vice president of marketing and public relations for McLaren Bay Region, said about 2,000 people work at the hospital and about 5 percent of them will be affected by the staffing adjustments, meaning about 100 employees will see their hours cut or their positions eliminated.

“The national trend for patient volume has continued to go downward and we’re seeing that here at McLaren Bay Region, as well,” she said.



Adding, there have been other changes in the health care industry that have played a role, including the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, and changes in reimbursement as a whole.

“(We're) positioning our hospital for long-term sustainability in the face of these changes,” Samyn said.

She said other hospitals are facing similar challenges.



“Several health care companies have also been facing these issues, not only across the state of Michigan, but nationwide.”

Samyn said McLaren Bay Region's management team was notified of the adjustments this week and informed employees.

The staffing adjustments are to affect positions in both clinical and non-clinical areas, but it isn't clear how many departments or which departments will be affected, she said.

Samyn acknowledged the difficulty this restructuring will pose for affected employees.

“We're very mindful of the difficulty faced by the families in today's economy, and we reached this decision only after very careful study of the volumes that we're seeing here at McLaren Bay Region,” she said.

When asked whether these changes would affect patient care, Samyn replied, “We remain committed to our mission to provide the best value in health care to our community.”
