Past News Releases RSS Technology, Obesity Treatment...\n\nMeasurement\u2019s Meaning in Diabetes...\n\nDiabetes Care and Performance...\n\nClinical pathways in oncology have many benefits: they can ensure that patients who see different doctors at different sites get the same level of care. They can also weed out overuse of unnecessary and costly medication.\n\nBut, as some authors in the current issue of Evidence-Based Oncology (EBO) suggest, is it possible to have too much of a good thing? (For the full issue, click here.)\n\nGrowth in the number and diversity of pathways\u2014with different requirements from different payers\u2014is raising concerns about the effect on physicians, practices, and ultimately patients, according to Robin Zon, MD, FACP, FASCO, who writes about the task force and guidance on clinical pathways created by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in the current issue of EBO, a publication of The American Journal of Managed Care.\n\nWhile pathways are intended to improve care, Zon writes, they are not for every patient, and ASCO\u2019s guidance reflects that feedback. \u201cASCO members have articulated concerns regarding the current proliferation of pathways in oncology, including lack of transparency, administrative burden, and other factors that could affect patient access and care quality,\u201d she writes.\n\nPairing the need to limit variation with the goals of precision medicine\u2014in which care is tailored to the patient\u2014is a balancing act best led by providers, according to a commentary led by Alan J. Balch, PhD. Putting clinicians in charge of pathway development will ensure quality, transparency in their development, and opportunities for the patient\u2019s voice to be heard, the authors say in \u201cRecommendations for the Role of Clinical Pathways in an Era of Personalized Medicine.\u201d\n\nThe need for real-time standards and accountability in cancer care\u2014a goal of pathways\u2014is what fueled the creation of the next step, the Oncology Medical Home, an accreditation model of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. A commentary led by Commission Chair Daniel P. McKellar, MD, FACS, addresses the five goals of the model: patient engagement, expanded access, evidence-based medicine, team-based care, and quality improvement.\n\nFinally, the current issue features coverage of a panel discussion on the reasons why adoption of clinical pathways has been slow in some areas. Taking part were Robert Dubois, MD, PhD, chief science officer and executive vice president, National Pharmaceutical Council, and Blase N. Polite, MD, MPP, associate professor of medicine, chief quality officer, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago. Polite also serves on the American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s Value Task Force and their Payment Reform Working Group. The panel also included 2 experts from organizations that develop clinical pathways: Michael Fisch, MD, MPH, medical director, Medical Oncology, AIM Specialty Health (a division of Anthem), and Kathy Lokay, president and CEO, Via Oncology.\n\nAt their best, clinical pathways offer a set of \u201csystem-based tools for creating greater cohesion in cancer care,\u201d writes EBO Editor-in-Chief Joseph M. Alvarnas, MD, associate clinical professor and director of Medical Quality at City of Hope. As a new tool, they are still changing. \u201cCare pathways have the potential to evolve as medical technologies advance, so that physicians can practice effective stewardship of healthcare resources, including molecular diagnostic and imaging studies and high-cost pharmaceuticals,\u201d he writes.\n\nAbout the Journals and AJMC.com\n\nThe American Journal of Managed Care is the leading peer-reviewed journal dedicated to issues in managed care.
