Don\u2019t all candidates use family surrogates when and where they can? The Kennedys, for example, deployed a horde of kinfolk for Jack\u2019s campaign for president, then Bobby\u2019s, then Teddy\u2019s.\n\nBut when it\u2019s the first time (as this was for Clinton the younger), the surrogate should be sure whereof she speaks, and had better stick to talking about her candidate, not the opponent. Unfortunately, Chelsea Clinton misrepresented Senator Sanders\u2019 position, and her premiere performance on the stump backfired, producing a flood of political donations to Sanders.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said: \u201cSenator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance.\u201d Whew! She would have us believe that the Vermont senator is a one-man wrecking crew, an enraged King Kong \u2013 or, to be modern about it, a mendacious Darth Vader \u2013 proposing \u201cto go back to an era \u2013 before we had the Affordable Care Act \u2013 that would strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance.\u201d\n\nUh, not exactly. In fact, not even close. As Karen Tumulty noted in The Washington Post, Bernie Sanders has long been a champion of a single-payer health care system as the only way to assure that all Americans receive medical coverage. Rather than \u201cstrip\u201d millions and millions of people of their health insurance, he wants to be sure millions and millions of people actually get health insurance.\n\nThis was Sanders\u2019 position as far back as 1993 when newly-elected President Bill Clinton put First Lady Hillary Clinton in charge of reforming our disheveled and unjust health care system.\n\nHer task force huffed and puffed in secret for months, calling in legions of experts and academics, ultimately producing a plan so complicated and impenetrable \u2013 not to mention unexplainable \u2013 that it would have collapsed of its own ponderous weight even if the Republicans had not propagandized it into a laughing stock of pretensions and inefficiencies that could only make matters worse.\n\nAnd here\u2019s an ironic note: During that 1993 quest for a health care plan, Secretary Clinton sent Sanders an autographed picture of the two of them, wishing him the best and thanking the senator \u201cfor your commitment to real health care access for all Americans.\u201d\n\nAll these years later, Sanders is still fighting the battle for single payer, Medicare-like coverage for all, even as fellow Democrats capitulated to the siren songs of the health and insurance industries.\n\nPresident Obama, himself a one-time advocate of single payer coverage, buckled to the insurance companies and its lobbyists and minions in Congress and agreed to health care legislation (the Affordable Care Act) that would continue to treat healing the sick as a profit center instead of a basic human right.And look at former presidential candidate and single payer advocate Howard Dean, Bernie\u2019s fellow Vermonter, who went on MSNBC this week and said that the Sanders plan \u201cwould in fact undo people\u2019s health care\u2026 That is something people should be concerned about.\u201d\n\nWhy the change of heart? Maybe because Dean \u201cnow serves as senior advisor to the law firm Dentons, where he works with the firm\u2019s Public Policy and Regulation practice, a euphemism for Dentons\u2019 lobbying team,\u201d Lee Fang reports at The Intercept. \u201c\u2026 The Dentons Public Policy and Regulation practice lobbies on behalf of a variety of corporate health care interests, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America [PhRMA], a powerful trade group for drugmakers like Pfizer and Merck.\u201d\n\nFang notes that, \u201cIncumbent health care interests, particularly drug companies and insurers, have long viewed single-payer as a threat to their business model,\u201d and points to documents that we uncovered in 2009 on Bill Moyers Journal with the help of former health insurance executive, now whistleblower Wendell Potter. They showed a systematic plan by health insurers to discredit single payer.\n\nAs president of the Clinton Foundation, the richly endowed philanthropy that has become the family\u2019s private station for public causes, Chelsea Clinton must know this.\n\nThe cynic might think the more than $2.6 million given so far by the health industry to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and outside groups supporting her (three times that of any other candidate, Democrat or Republican) might be leading Chelsea Clinton to use the same kind of false accusations so long used against her parents. But why would any of the family, their campaign team, advisors and supporters assume that the public would accept such a wild and irresponsible distortion?\n\nPlease see NationofChange", "article_metadata": {"sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dc": {"title": "Comment: Hillary Tell the Truth about Bernie\u2019s Health Care Stand"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Rather than \u201cstrip\u201d millions and millions of people of their health insurance, he wants to be sure millions and millions of people actually get health insurance.\nThey sent Hillary and Bill Clinton\u2019s daughter Chelsea out on behalf of her mother to bash Senator Bernie Sanders on the issue of health care.\nHere\u2019s what she said: \u201cSenator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance.\u201d Whew!\nUnfortunately, Chelsea Clinton misrepresented Senator Sanders\u2019 position, and her premiere performance on the stump backfired, producing a flood of political donations to Sanders.\nThis was Sanders\u2019 position as far back as 1993 when newly-elected President Bill Clinton put First Lady Hillary Clinton in charge of reforming our disheveled and unjust health care system."}
