There\u2019s only one month left in Obamacare\u2019s inaugural open-enrollment period, which ends March 31, and Californians are still struggling with the website, including some of its basic functions.\n\nIn today\u2019s column, I\u2019m focusing on a seemingly minor technical issue that has caused countless Californians frustration, confusion and lost time.\n\nIt has to do with online passwords, the bane of 21 st century existence. If you\u2019re like me, you have signed up on dozens of online shopping, banking and news websites, trying desperately to keep track of various usernames, passwords, PINS and security questions.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I forget or lose passwords. But in almost every case, I just click the \u201cForget your password?\u201d link on most websites and reset my password online.\n\nYou can\u2019t do that on CoveredCA.com.\n\nInstead, you have to call the jammed customer service number (800-300-1506) and wait on hold until someone can help. If the customer service agents can\u2019t reset the password \u2013 which has been the rule rather than the exception \u2013 they bring in the big guns from the IT department to make the fix.\n\nAll of this can take hours, days or weeks to resolve, judging by the dozens of complaints lodged on Covered California\u2019s Facebook page and Twitter feed . And you can\u2019t sign up for a health plan online without being signed into your account.\n\nOne consumer who wrestled with the password reset is Sean Knox, 33, a San Francisco resident who also is a web engineer. That means he builds and codes websites for a living.\n\nHow appropriate.\n\nKnox gave up on CoveredCA.com in mid-February after trying, unsuccessfully, to reset his password.\n\nHe tried to reset it online, which of course led to a dead end. Then, over 11 days, he talked to multiple Covered California agents after hours on hold. Then he took his complaints to Twitter. Then to Facebook. Then he was assured the problem was fixed, though it was not. And then he went through it all again. And again.\n\nFacing the Feb. 15 deadline to buy insurance that would kick in on March 1, Knox bailed out of the health insurance exchange altogether and bought a plan on the private market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2014. I\u2019m an engineer. I know exactly what health plan I want. I have money to buy it,\u201d Knox says. \u201cAnd yet I\u2019m hamstrung by the most basic process on any website that has been rolled out in the last 15 years.\u201d\n\nThat, my fellow Californians, is what $359 million buys you.\n\nAn Accenture spokesman declined to answer questions and directed me to Covered California\u2019s press office.\n\nI went back and forth with three different Covered California spokespeople to learn that Covered California knows there\u2019s a problem and is working on improvements.\n\nBy the time this column is published, says spokesman Larry Hicks, customer service agents will have been trained on how to reset passwords and can help consumers through the process.\n\nBetter late than never.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t they just do it themselves online in the first place? \u201cOur password reset procedure was made with an abundance of caution to assure persons requesting the resets were the true holders of the accounts,\u201d Hicks says. \u201cPrivacy is paramount for us.\u201d\n\nThose banks, brokerage firms, medical groups and other businesses that allow consumers to change their passwords online? They must hate privacy.\n\nIn some ways, Knox is lucky. His income is too high for him to qualify for tax credits through Covered California, so it didn\u2019t make a financial difference for him to jump into the private market, which offers the same plans at the same prices.\n\nBut not everyone has that option. If your income qualifies you for tax credits, which reduce the cost of your monthly premiums, you can only get them by purchasing a plan through Covered California.\n\nGiven the inevitable bumps associated with the debut of any new law \u2013 not to mention a law of this size and complexity \u2013 did Covered California have to load another confusion onto consumers\u2019 shoulders?\n\nThis one is just another hassle for an already frazzled public to endure as it tries to comply with the law. One that could have been easily avoided.\n\nKnox says it well: \u201cThere are all these complex requirements to buy health insurance, and yet we can\u2019t even get our passwords reset.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd528\"", "article_summary": "I went back and forth with three different Covered California spokespeople to learn that Covered California knows there\u2019s a problem and is working on improvements.\nBut in almost every case, I just click the \u201cForget your password?\u201d link on most websites and reset my password online.\nKnox says it well: \u201cThere are all these complex requirements to buy health insurance, and yet we can\u2019t even get our passwords reset.\u201d\nOne consumer who wrestled with the password reset is Sean Knox, 33, a San Francisco resident who also is a web engineer.\n\u201cOur password reset procedure was made with an abundance of caution to assure persons requesting the resets were the true holders of the accounts,\u201d Hicks says."}
