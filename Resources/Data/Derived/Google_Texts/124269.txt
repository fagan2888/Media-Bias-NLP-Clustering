With most of the winter season now behind him, Mayor Bill de Blasio today named Kathryn Garcia to lead the city’s Department of Sanitation.

Ms. Garcia, currently the chief operating officer at the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, replaces John Doherty, a sanitation veteran who began working as a trash collector in 1960 and rose through the ranks over the decades.

Mr. Doherty, a holdover from the Bloomberg administration, agreed to stay on the job to assist Mr. de Blasio’s new administration keep the streets clear during the remainder of the winter. The past few months have had an unusually heavy series of snowstorms, however, and Mr. Doherty suffered some criticism as a result.

In a statement, Mr. de Blasio praised Mr. Doherty’s service to the city.

“We are so grateful today for the service these past two and a half months—and the 51 years prior—of our outgoing Commissioner John Doherty. His integrity, his spirit and his capacity for the superhuman have driven this department for decades. As I have time and time again this winter, I thank John for everything he’s done for this city,” said the mayor.

Capital New York first reported Mr. Doherty’s intent to resign at the end of the month.
