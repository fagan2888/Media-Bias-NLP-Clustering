His 2013 compensation from Samaritan\u2019s Purse alone made him the highest-paid CEO of any international relief agency based in the U.S., according to data provided by GuideStar, the world\u2019s largest source of information on nonprofit organizations.\n\nGraham\u2019s total compensation last year from the two charities was more than $880,000, including $258,667 from BGEA.\n\nThat total is less than the $1.2 million he received in 2008, but it\u2019s still more than some nonprofit experts consider appropriate.\n\nThe Observer delves into the level of Graham's compensation \u2014 asking how much is too much for the head of two nonprofit organizations. Moreover, the newspaper quotes experts who question the practicality of a single person holding both full-time positions.\n\nLed by veteran religion writer Tim Funk, the Observer team presents the facts, provides relevant context to help readers understand those facts and mostly allows Graham's PR gurus ample opportunity to respond.\n\nThis section of the 2,000-word report is typical:\n\nSeveral nonprofit experts, though, said Graham should have stuck with his decision to forgo pay from BGEA.\n\n\u201cIt gives the appearance that he went back on his word and can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d said Ken Berger, a nonprofit consultant and former CEO of Charity Navigator, which evaluates nonprofits for donors. \u201cIt\u2019s worrisome. It appears sneaky.\u201d\n\nPablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the Georgetown University Center for Public & Nonprofit Leadership, agreed.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that some board members wanted him to get money again,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big boy. He could have said, \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\n\n(Graham spokesman Mark) DeMoss\u2019 reply: \u201cThis organization has earned the trust and prayers of those who support it with their financial and prayer support for more than 60 years and continues to be as transparent as possible.\u201d\n\nI'm a journalist, so I'm biased, but here's my advice: If you really want to be \"as transparent as possible,\" Graham should speak to reporters himself on a story such as this. Relying on a media relations person (even one as respected and competent as DeMoss) sure doesn't scream \"transparency.\" Rather, it gives the strong impression \u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 of \"something to hide.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, most of us would consider our personal income a private matter. But in Graham's case, he's leading multimillion-dollar nonprofits that rely on private donors and substantial tax breaks, as the Observer points out. Thus, is there any doubt that Graham's compensation is fair game for journalistic treatment?\n\nTo its credit, the Observer presents a nuanced portrait of the ministries that Graham leads:\n\nSamaritan\u2019s Purse is often the first agency at the scene of natural disasters around the world. And it\u2019s demonstrated a deep commitment to serving the people of Haiti and, especially during last year\u2019s Ebola scourge, those in Liberia.\n\nAs the face and voice of the BGEA, the ministry started by his father decades ago, Franklin Graham also heads up crusade-like Christian festivals around the country and the globe. In June, he led a festival in Ukraine. Coming up: festivals in Birmingham, Ala. (Aug. 14-16); Oklahoma City (Aug. 22-23); Fortaleza, Brazil (Oct. 23-24); and Tokyo (Nov. 20-22).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he finds the energy,\u201d said Ken Barun, Graham\u2019s chief of staff at BGEA. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for some of the biggest companies in the world (including McDonald\u2019s) and I have never seen this.\u201d\n\nIf I have a criticism of the piece, it's the laundry list near the end where the Observer describes Graham as a \"polarizing figure\" in the U.S. The newspaper provides a quick list of hot-button issues but fails to offer adequate background or opportunity for Graham's supporters to defend him.\n\nBut overall, this is a model of fair, hard-hitting reporting that stops way short of \"gotcha\" journalism.\n\nImage via Shutterstock.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Usually, wherever two or three microphones are gathered, Franklin Graham \r\nseems to be there.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Graham \u2014 son of renowned\u00a0evangelist Billy Graham \u2014 is missing, \r\nthough, from\u00a0an investigative report this week by the\u00a0Charlotte Observer.\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina newspaper\u00a0reports that it made repeated requests to \r\ninterview Franklin Graham last week but that he was not available.\r\n\r\nHowever, Graham's lack of availability did not prevent the\u00a0newspaper in \r\nhis\u00a0home state from producing a fair, solid piece of journalism:\r\n\r\n    Six years ago, Franklin Graham decided to give up his pay as head of\r\n    the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.\r\n\r\n    \u201cI feel that God has called me to this ministry and that calling was\r\n    never based on compensation,\u201d he wrote then in a memo to the BGEA\r\n    staff.\r\n\r\n    But since 2011, at the urging of the Charlotte-based ministry\u2019s board\r\n    of directors, Graham has been receiving a salary again.\r\n\r\n    That\u2019s in addition to the more than $620,000 he receives for his other\r\n    full-time job, leading Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an international relief\r\n    agency based in Boone.
