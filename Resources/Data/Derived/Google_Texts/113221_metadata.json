The budget includes $100 million in capital investments meant to expand or upgrade the system\u2019s community-based health centers and clinics, and it proposes selling vacant land on hospital campuses to create affordable and supportive housing.\n\nThe report says there will be no layoffs or closings of hospitals in the system, which was known until last year as the Health and Hospitals Corporation. But it acknowledges that \u201ceven with retraining and shifting existing hospital staff to community-based health centers and clinics, there is likely to be a net loss of hospital-based jobs\u201d and some buildings \u201cwill be repurposed to house social support and other community-based services.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike what has happened in other cities, Health & Hospitals will remain a vibrant public system \u2014 it is not for sale and the city will not abandon it,\u201d the report says, promising that the \u201cunparalleled investment\u201d will help turn the 280-year-old network into a community-based model more focused on primary care that can better compete for patients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 55-page report is not the first to point to the dire financial future facing the city\u2019s health care and hospital system, which has maintained its mission of treating all patients regardless of their ability to pay or their immigration status. But the new report reflects the impact of the Affordable Care Act, and points to trends that make adaptation daunting.\n\nAs previously uninsured low-income New Yorkers have gained insurance, they also have gained new health care options. The city system has been losing those patients to other providers that are seen as more upscale or convenient to patients. At the same time, it remains the major source of care for nearly one million city residents who remain uninsured, many of them unauthorized immigrants who are ineligible for public insurance.\n\nUninsured patients and those covered by Medicaid, the federal and state program for the poor, now represent nearly 70 percent of Health & Hospitals\u2019 total hospital stays, compared with 40 percent for other hospitals in the city, the report says. Yet federal and state funding that helps cover the cost of caring for the uninsured is projected to decline by almost $1 billion \u2014 from $2.2 billion in the 2016 fiscal year to $1.4 billion in the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nAs other nonprofit hospitals consolidate, they have begun to compete for the city\u2019s Medicaid patients. While other major systems saw a 5 percent increase in managed Medicaid hospital stays, Health & Hospitals experienced a 3 percent decline between 2012 and 2014. MetroPlus, the city hospitals\u2019 own managed-care plan, grew by 17 percent over a six-year period, to 500,000 members, but still lost out to private competitors as the market grew by 27 percent.\n\nOver all, hospital stays dropped more than 5 percent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting a citywide trend. But while the busiest public hospitals, including Queens Hospital Center and Kings County Hospital Center, have few empty beds, in some, like North Central Bronx Hospital, about half of the beds are empty \u2014 which means less patient revenue covering the same fixed operating costs.\n\nThe number of independent hospitals in the city has been nearly halved, from 34 to 18 over the past 10 years, a decline likely to continue, the report says. Three out of every four hospital stays are now at hospitals affiliated with one of six major systems \u2014 systems that are increasingly competing with one another and with Health & Hospitals for a bigger share of a more diverse pool of patients, not just the sickest.\n\n\u201cHealth & Hospitals is quickly losing Medicaid patients to other hospitals as this zero-sum game unfolds,\u201d the report says, referring to sweeping changes in health care financing to a flat-rate or a so-called payment-for-value or pay-for-performance model rather than a payment-for-service one. Historically, the city system has struggled to meet the goals of a pay-for-performance model in part because its patients are generally sicker and poorer and often lack adequate housing.\n\nEach year, Health & Hospitals serves more than 1.2 million New Yorkers. It is the largest publicly financed health system in the country with more than 40,000 employees in 11 hospitals and nearly 5,000 beds; five long-term care facilities with nearly 3,000 beds; and more than 70 community-based health care centers.\n\n\u201cThis transformation plan is not a plan to close hospitals, lay off workers, or impair quality or access to Health & Hospitals health care services,\u201d the report says. \u201cWe cannot cut our way out of this problem in ways that destabilize quality and access in underserved communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news",
