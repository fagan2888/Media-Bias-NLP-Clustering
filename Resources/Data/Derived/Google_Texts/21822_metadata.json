Almost 80 percent of them hadn\u2019t been enrolled in other state health programs for the poor. And 36 percent of those enrolled in the first two months had used their insurance to visit a doctor or clinic by the end of the fourth month.\n\nThe implementation and rollout of the Healthy Michigan Plan, which expanded Medicaid at a time when both the governor and the majority of the state legislature are Republican, holds lessons for other \u201cred\u201d states, say the researchers.\n\nJohn Ayanian, M.D., MPP, director of the\n\nU-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation\n\nLed by John Ayanian, M.D., M.P.P., director of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the team poses other questions that only time will answer.\n\nFor instance, will the state save enough money from the effects of the new coverage to offset its required future spending to support the Healthy Michigan Plan when federal funding is scaled back in 2017? Will the 16 percent of early enrollees who had incomes just above the federal poverty level participate in healthy behaviors that can reduce their premiums? And will the state\u2019s health providers be able to handle the additional demand for services from new enrollees who were previously uninsured?\n\nHe and his co-authors propose a national effort to link states, universities and research groups to perform such evaluations, and inform policymakers\u2019 future decisions about health care reform.\n\n\u201cFor other states that more recently decided to expand Medicaid or are still considering this option, our initial analysis demonstrates that with appropriate planning expansion can go smoothly, and that \u2018red\u2019 states can launch an expansion with state-specified modifications, if that\u2019s what is required to build political support,\u201d says Ayanian, who led the team of three U-M researchers to analyze Healthy Michigan Plan data. \u201cThe rapid enrollment demonstrates both the ability of the state to launch the program effectively, and the pent-up demand for insurance among low income adults in Michigan.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of low-income adults stand to benefit, so we need to look fully at expansion\u2019s impact in every state where it\u2019s occurring, and the impact in states that choose not to expand,\u201d he says.\n\nThe researchers describe many of the factors that may have helped Michigan\u2019s expansion progress so quickly and enroll people in every one of the state\u2019s 83 far-flung counties, both rural and urban. Though their paper only covers the first 100 days, enrollment has continued at a steady clip, with 424,852 Michiganders enrolled as of October 20.\n\nAlthough the expansion received state and federal approvals in late 2013, the enrollment period did not begin until April 2014, several months after residents of other Medicaid-expanding states had already begun to enroll in health plans via state and federal websites including HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe massive media coverage of initial problems with the national enrollment site, and the mandate for most Americans to get insurance or pay a tax penalty, may have worked in Michigan\u2019s favor, the authors say. By the time enrollment in the Healthy Michigan Plan began, public awareness was high, which may have contributed to the rapid pace of enrollment in the first 100 days.\n\nThe time between enactment and enrollment for Michigan\u2019s program also gave state workers, insurers and community groups time to prepare a solid web-based process for individuals to enroll, and to plan and carry out a broad communication campaign that harnessed existing groups focused on serving the health needs of low-income Michiganders.\n\nSome of the distinctive components of the Healthy Michigan Plan, and permitted under a waiver granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hadn\u2019t launched by the end of the first 100 days, and so can\u2019t yet be analyzed. But, Ayanian says, these customizations \u2013 which in Michigan\u2019s case include MI Health Accounts (similar to health savings accounts) and premium-reducing incentives for completing a health risk survey and taking steps to reduce health risks such as quitting smoking \u2013 are what made the plan politically feasible in a \u2018red\u2019 state. Other states that may wish to adopt these features will be watching Michigan closely, he predicts.\n\nAccording to the new paper, the population enrolling in the new plans resembles in some ways the population that has traditionally enrolled in Medicaid. For instance, 60 percent of the enrollees are under the age of 45, and just under half live in the populous southeastern region of the state.\n\nBut where traditional Medicaid enrollees are nearly 65 percent female, 52 percent of the new program\u2019s enrollees are women. The new plans\u2019 broad eligibility criteria include all residents of Michigan between ages 19 and 64 with household incomes less than 133 percent of the poverty rate and not eligible for other programs.\n\n\u201cGridlock in Washington, D.C. doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for states and communities to continue improving health insurance coverage and health care delivery,\u201d says Ayanian. \u201cMichigan is an example of the effects of collaboration to improve health policy at a state level.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Ayanian, the paper\u2019s authors are Sarah J. Clark, M.P.H., of the U-M Department of Pediatrics and Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit, and Renuka Tipirneni, M.D., a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar at the U-M Medical School.
