Noftsinger, the payroll unit president at CBIZ, a financial services provider for businesses. \u201cThey\u2019re really trying to assess how much the 50th employee is going to cost.\u201d\n\nNearly all large companies provide health care benefits, but only 54 percent of businesses with three to 49 workers offered coverage to their workers this year, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Paying even a portion of the cost can be expensive. The average annual premium for workers at small companies currently tops $6,100 for individual insurance and $16,600 for family coverage.\n\nThat premium is typically shared between the employer and employee. Businesses that fall under the health care law\u2019s mandate are required to offer their workers \u201caffordable\u201d insurance, which the law defines as individual coverage that costs less than 9.5 percent of the employee\u2019s household income. (Because employers do not know how much money their workers\u2019 relatives make, their options for compliance include basing their calculation on only their own employees\u2019 wages.) For a full-time, minimum-wage employee making $14,500 a year, an employer offering an average-price individual plan would have to pay around $4,700 a year.\n\nAdded to that cost are the administrative requirements. Starting this year, all companies with 50 or more full-time workers \u2014 even those not yet required to offer health benefits \u2014 must file new tax forms with the Internal Revenue Service that provide details on employee head count and any health insurance offered. Gathering the data requires meticulous record-keeping.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThese are some of the most complex informational returns we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Roger Prince, a tax lawyer with the consulting firm Berry Dunn in Portland, Me.\n\nSome of his clients, even small ones, have spent months reconfiguring their human resources and financial systems to track the information that the new forms demand. The health care law defines a full-time-equivalent employee as someone who works an average of 30 or more hours a week \u2014 and the hours worked by some part-time employees count toward the calculation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor businesses that use many seasonal, variable-hour or temporary workers, like those in the hospitality industry, simply figuring out how many qualifying employees they have can be a challenge.\n\n\u201cI think companies are going to have to work with their payroll processor for the basic data, and then their accountant or attorney about what certain items mean,\u201d Mr. Prince said.\n\nThe expense and distraction of all that paperwork is one of the biggest frustrations for one business owner, Joseph P. Sergio. His industrial cleaning company, Polar Clean, which is based in South Bend, Ind., but dispatches teams nationally, has just under 50 core employees. One of its business lines is disaster restoration, and after a flood or hurricane, its temporary staff balloons.\n\nMr. Sergio offers health insurance to his permanent staff, but the premiums have risen so quickly that he had to switch to a more restrictive plan, with a higher deductible. He is reluctant to go over the 50-employee line and incur all of the new rules that come with it. That makes bidding for new jobs an arduous and risky exercise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to pull my controller and a couple of top people to sit and spend days going through this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ramp up, and it pushes you over 50, there\u2019s all these unknown costs and complicated rules. Are we really going to be able to benefit from going after that opportunity? It freezes you at a time when you need to be moving fast.\u201d\n\nTony Lamb has 700 franchisees for Kona Ice, his shaved-ice truck business, but his corporate staff in Florence, Ky., has 44 full-time-equivalent positions. It took an outside consultant to confirm that; his internal accountant put the number at 42.\n\nKona Ice offers a retirement plan, profit-sharing and other perks, but no health benefits \u2014 and one of Mr. Lamb\u2019s concerns about expanding is the salaries that he priced accordingly.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Instead of paying you $50,000 and $15,000 in health care, I\u2019ll pay you $65,000,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go back on people and change the rules. No one wants a pay cut. I think it\u2019s a very big deterrent to growth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, plenty of small-business owners offer health insurance without being required to do so. For many, especially those in white-collar fields, it\u2019s an essential part of recruiting and retaining employees. Companies with a significant number of workers making at least $58,000 a year are much more likely to offer insurance than those at which a majority of employees make less, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s study.\n\nSome owners who began offering insurance this year to comply with the new law have been surprised by how few employees purchased it. Participation rates as low as 1 or 2 percent are not uncommon in industries like restaurants and retailing, in which employees making close to the minimum wage may struggle to afford the premiums.\n\nBut Ms. Hunter, the salon owner, said that she could not afford the gamble. \u201cI\u2019m a single mom, and I\u2019ve worked really hard at what I have, wanting to build something,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating that the government has put something in place that\u2019s restricting the growth plan I\u2019ve been working toward for a decade.\u201d",
