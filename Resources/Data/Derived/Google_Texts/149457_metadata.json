A deal would likely involve the transfer of Medtronic\u2019s legal address to the UK to lower its tax liability, the sources said. The UK\u2019s 21 percent corporate income tax is significantly lower than the 35 percent federal tax rate in the U.S. Much of Medtronic\u2019s $14.2 billion in cash resides outside the U.S., so the company could benefit from moving overseas.\n\n\u201cStrategically, we do have this current problem that we have a lot of cash outside the U.S.,\u201d Omar Ishrak, Medtronic\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a previous interview with Bloomberg. \u201cWe encourage some kind of U.S. tax reform that allows us access to that cash in a more reasonable way.\u201d\n\nAnalysts present at Medtronic\u2019s recent investor day were split on the outlook of a potential deal.\n\n\u201cManagement indicated that deals would be primarily based on strategic fit, not financial reasons such as tax inversion,\u201d Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. said in an article in Investor\u2019s Business Daily. He added that an acquisition of S&N would not be a good fit for Medtronic, as the company only has 12 percent of the orthopedics market.\n\n\u201cWe believe the deal fits with [Medtronic] CEO Omar Ishrak\u2019s strategy of globalization. However, while [Smith & Nephew] may fill gaps in trauma and sports medicine, the company\u2019s presence in joint reconstruction, which is the largest part of the market, is still modest,\u201d Glenn Novarro, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets told Market Watch.\n\nCowen Group analyst Joshua Jennings was more optimistic, and was quoted by Investor\u2019s Business Daily as saying, \u201cWe believe MDT/SNN combo would have limited product overlap, create cost synergies and provide MDT with a more strategic presence in Ortho.\u201d\n\nS&N, a company that makes knee and hip joint replacements, has been the subject of recent speculative bids by larger companies wanting to expand their orthopedic portfolios. As recently reported by the Financial Times, Stryker Corporation was likewise planning a bid for its UK rival.\n\nMerger talks and takeover bids between medical device companies have heated up due to pressure from the U.S. Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare costs. Consolidation would allow companies to pool resources and offer hospitals a better-rounded portfolio of products to win contracts, according to Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Medtronic is reportedly considering a takeover of the UK-based orthopedics company Smith &amp; Nephew in a deal that could be structured as a tax inversion if Medtronic transfers its base overseas.</p>", "title": "Medtronic Mulling Takeover of Smith & Nephew", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/7b3e0509/7b3e0509-6def-4474-8e37-6eb0550441ed/medtroniclogo.jpg"}, "creator": "Jof Enriquez", "site": "meddeviceonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Medtronic is reportedly considering a takeover of the UK-based orthopedics company Smith &amp; Nephew in a deal that could be structured as a tax...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Title": "Medtronic Mulling Takeover of Smith Nephew"}, "article_summary": "Medtronic Mulling Takeover of Smith & NephewBy Jof EnriquezFollow me on Twitter @jofenriqMedtronic is reportedly considering a takeover of the UK-based orthopedics company Smith & Nephew in a deal that could be structured as a tax inversion if Medtronic transfers its base overseas.\nMedtronic is preparing a bid, but no offer is imminent, according to a Bloomberg article that cites anonymous sources privy to the plan.\nMerger talks and takeover bids between medical device companies have heated up due to pressure from the U.S.\nA deal would likely involve the transfer of Medtronic\u2019s legal address to the UK to lower its tax liability, the sources said.\n\u201cWe believe the deal fits with [Medtronic] CEO Omar Ishrak\u2019s strategy of globalization."}
