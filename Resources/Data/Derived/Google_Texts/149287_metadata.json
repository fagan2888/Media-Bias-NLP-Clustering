The volume of cheering steadily fell as subsequent splits showed him falling further behind, despite no glaring errors.\n\nAfter he crossed the finish line out of the medal count, there was dead silence \u2014 the eerie kind that falls when a racer has a bad crash. Miller\u2019s dream of becoming an Olympic downhill champion had died.\n\nMiller said the course slowed for those running in the middle of the start order \u2014 an occurrence reflected in the race analysis numbers. Miller is usually candid about admitting mistakes in his skiing when they cost him a race, so perhaps he deserved the benefit of the doubt.\n\nMayer ran 11th and Kjetil Jansrud of Norway, who took the bronze medal, ran eighth. Travis Ganong of the U.S. ran seventh and had the best result of his career, finishing fifth.\n\nThere was one exception. Silver medalist Christof Innerhofer of Italy ran 20th, but he also lost time at the bottom of the course.\n\nTemperatures were warm, humidity was high and the sky was overcast \u2014 all of which can make a course run slower than normal.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the middle section of the course was losing five-, six-tenths of a second, even more in some cases,\u201d Miller said. \u201cTwenty minutes of time (in the start order), or half an hour of time, makes a massive difference in snow conditions. I didn\u2019t really make any mistakes in the middle and bottom of the course, and lost a ton of time.\u201d\n\nMiller won two of the three training runs.\n\n\u201cThe training runs were bluebird, perfect visibility and hard snow,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat\u2019s the perfect conditions to see who\u2019s the best racer. (Sunday) the visibility went away, temperatures are warmer, the course breaks down a little bit. High humidity in that middle (section), where it\u2019s all ice, the high humidity brings the water out. The snow just gets slower.\u201d\n\nMiller hit a gate panel midway through his run but insisted it didn\u2019t slow him. Ganong thought otherwise.\n\n\u201cHe had one mistake on this pretty critical turn that goes into the flat section, and if you lose your speed there, it\u2019s just a losing battle from there to the finish,\u201d Ganong said. \u201cHe started the turn a little too early and stuck his head through the panel, kind of lost some speed.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s quest for his sixth medal, which would put him second on the all-time alpine list, hasn\u2019t ended. He figures to contend in the men\u2019s super-G on Sunday, and it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he medaled in the super combined Friday or the giant slalom Feb. 19.\n\n\u201cThis can be a tough one to swallow, having skied so well in training runs, then come in and be way out of the medals,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to win, obviously. This is the premier event, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought about quite a bit. But when it\u2019s out of your control, that kind of takes the disappointment away. I don\u2019t think I would change much, the way I skied. I skied well enough to win, but it just doesn\u2019t happen sometimes.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bode Miller blames course for 8th-place downhill finish at Sochi Olympics", "title": "Bode Miller blames course for 8th-place downhill finish at Sochi Olympics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/bode-miller-blames-course-for-8th-place-downhill-finish-at-sochi-olympics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140209_060419_bode-miller-olympic-downhill-sochi.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140209_060419_bode-miller-olympic-downhill-sochi.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-09T06:00:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T22:57:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing"}, "article_summary": "Mayer ran 11th and Kjetil Jansrud of Norway, who took the bronze medal, ran eighth.\n\u201cThe training runs were bluebird, perfect visibility and hard snow,\u201d Miller said.\nMiller said the course slowed for those running in the middle of the start order \u2014 an occurrence reflected in the race analysis numbers.\nBidding for his sixth Olympic medal, Miller finished eighth by 0.52 of a second behind gold medalist Matthias Mayer of Austria, who has never won a World Cup race.\n\u201cEveryone in the middle section of the course was losing five-, six-tenths of a second, even more in some cases,\u201d Miller said."}
