Complying with federal law Connecticuts healthcare marketplace offers plans that do not cover elective abortion (Published Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2014)

Access Health CT, the state's healthcare marketplace, offers four plans that don't include coverage for elective abortion procedures.

Open enrollment for health insurance started last month and ends Feb. 15.

The Family Institute of Connecticut supports historically socially conservative stances and applauded the exchange for having so many choices for people who have moral objections to the procedure.

“We understand that not everyone shares that opinion but at least not to be forced to subsidize that is a very big deal," said Nicole Stacy, who works on policy for the Family Institute. "Before there were no options.”

The four plans offered on Access Health CT come from two providers, Anthem and HealthyCT.

Anthem offers Gold and Silver HMO Pathway X Enhanced coverage options and Healthy CT offers Gold and Silver CO-Options Preferred PPO Plans.

All four coverage options are also offered in other states.

The state was sued by a family that wanted the health insurance options available immediately on the health insurance exchange. Access Health CT officials say plans were in the works to provide such options, since the federal healthcare law mandated it.

“The Affordable Care Act actually stipulates that the exchanges must offer these types of plans so it’s actually codified in the law," said Jason Madrak, Access Health's Chief Marketing Officer. "The ACA also says that states have until 2017 to go ahead and make these kinds of plans available.”

He added that the Affordable Care Act actually prohibits federally subsidized plans from covering elective abortion procedures.

Madrak said policymakers always had it in mind for people who opposed abortion to have choices in their healthcare coverage.

“If you do have an objection to elective abortive services, these plans do offer you some alternative.”
