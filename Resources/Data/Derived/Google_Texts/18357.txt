President of Oklahoma Wesleyan University Dr. Everett Piper endorsed Jim Bridenstine on Thursday. Bridenstine is running for a third term in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Speaking at a rally for Bridenstine at OKWU in Bartlesville on Thursday afternoon, Dr. Piper said Congressman Bridenstine is a man of integrity.



Bridenstine noted that he particularly values this endorsement because Dr. Piper has become a well known spokesman for conservative values on the national stage. The Congressman has also championed the right to life, traditional marriage, and defending First Amendment rights against Obamacare mandates.
