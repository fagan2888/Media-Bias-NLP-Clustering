Those with self-funded employer-sponsored insurance are exempt from several of the largest culprits and will have the lowest added cost at $94 in 2014, which will drop to $59 by 2016.\n\nOne is aimed at the insurance companies, forcing them to pay the federal government for the privilege of selling health insurance \u2014 an ironic touch for a law meant to make health coverage cheaper. AAF estimates that this tax alone, which will be passed onto consumers, will cost an extra $101 in 2014; in 2015 and 2016, it\u2019ll be increased to $143 on average as the federal government ups their funding requests every year.\n\nIn 2014, the total tax will amount to $8 billion; in 2015 and 2016, it\u2019ll be $11.3 billion, and the current plan comes it at $14.3 billion in 2018.\n\nA similar tax targets pharmaceutical companies, upping the cost of paying for medicine. That one piles on just $16 to existing premiums per year. This one will account for $3 billion for each of the next three years, also divided amongst pharmaceutical companies by their market share. The controversial medical device tax add $13 in 2014, $14 in 2015, and $15 in 2016.\n\nThe reinsurance fee \u2014 commonly known as bailout funding, a pool of money for insurance companies to draw from if their pool of customers on the exchanges cost more than expected to insure \u2014 raising premium prices as well. The fee gradually decreases over the next three years as the reinsurance program is scheduled to end in 2016. This year, it will cost customers an extra $63 to raise $12 billion total; in 2016 it\u2019ll add another $26 during the tax\u2019s final year to collect $5 billion.\n\nThere are several other costs as well. The risk adjustment fee, which will transfer funding from places with healthier customers to those paying for sicker individuals, will add $1 a year to premiums. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute fee, a tax collected per insured person, per month meant to fund medical research, will cost just $2 annually.\n\nExchange plans cost significantly more than those from private insurers because they\u2019re subject to the health exchange user fee, a 3.5 percent tax placed on all premiums in the federally run Obamacare exchnage. The idea is for exchanges to eventually become self-sustaining by having exchange customers pay the administrative costs themselves.\n\nIn state-run exchanges, the tax varies But customers in states with unexpectedly low enrollment will likely face tax increases soon. Many exchanges, including California, Hawaii and Minnesota, are already worried about how they\u2019ll raise enough funding from existing rates.\n\nWhile enrollment has risen in the past several months, customers in individual states with low numbers of sign-ups may see their insurance premiums rise anyway. Hawaii\u2019s exchange, notorious for already incurring the highest cost to insure each sign-up, has even considered taxing non-exchange insurers to pay for their Obamacare marketplace.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
