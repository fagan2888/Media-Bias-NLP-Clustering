You're probably going to want to zoom in!

Kim Kardashian West decided to leave absolutely nothing to the imagination in yet another see-through gown at the Vogue 100 Anniversary Gala in London on Monday night.

And her latest look begs the question, what does she have going on under there?!

Before we even go there though, let's just take a moment for Kanye West's tailored suit. It feels like forever since we saw him not wearing jeans for the red carpet!

But going back to his voluptuous wifey, the 35-year-old dressed in an olive green Cavalli Couture piece with pearl and glass bead embroideries all over.

Of course, we know what you're really staring at!

If you look really closely, Kimmy was rocking flesh-toned panties while her boobs were censored with a similar-colored fabric. Not to mention the floral embroidery covering all her bases!

Are U loving the look or definitely not?
