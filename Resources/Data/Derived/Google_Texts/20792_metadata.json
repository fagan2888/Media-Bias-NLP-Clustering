And, as one who has in the past been a part of the PC (USA) denomination, what do you think of his comments about being Presbyterian?\n\nCarmen Fowler LaBerge: For a man who readily admits that he\u2019s never asked God for forgiveness, considers wealth and national origin measures of a person\u2019s worth, and disagrees with most of his denomination\u2019s social witness positions, seeing Trump trumpet his Presbyterianism is a curious thing.\n\nHe repeated on Twitter what he said during a Q&A at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa on Saturday, \u201cPeople are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian).\u201d\n\nSome of those most surprised are Presbyterians themselves.\n\nBut when it comes to Presbyterian theology and social witness, Trump is an equal opportunity offender.\n\nEvangelical Presbyterians will find themselves offended by Trump\u2019s trivialization of the need to ask God for forgiveness.\n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s Q&A Trump was asked whether he has ever asked God for forgiveness. CNN reports that Trump answered, \u201cI am not sure I have. I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don\u2019t bring God into that picture. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor the evangelical, there is no Christian faith without the understanding that in Jesus Christ God took the sins of humanity upon himself, creating the possibility of an individual\u2019s salvation\u2014which includes asking God to exchange the sinner\u2019s sinfulness with Jesus\u2019 perfect righteousness.\n\nTheologically orthodox Presbyterians, for whom the marks of the true church include the \u201cright administration of the Lord\u2019s supper,\u201d are going to gag on Trump\u2019s trivialization of the sacrament of communion.\n\nAlthough Trump admitted having not asked God for forgiveness, he said he does participate in Holy Communion.\n\n\u201cWhen I drink my little wine\u2014which is about the only wine I drink\u2014and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness, and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed.\u201d\n\nFor Christians, including every brand of Presbyterian, the wine to which Trump so casually refers is understood to be representative of the blood of Jesus Christ. And that \u201clittle cracker\u201d is the body of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nFirst Corinthians 11:26-29 reads, \u201cFor as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord\u2019s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.\u201d\n\nBut the most offended Presbyterians will be those of whom Trump claims to be affiliated, the more liberal Presbyterian Church (USA). The PCUSA is pro-choice while Trump is pro-life. The PCUSA is pro-amnesty on immigration, Trump is not. The PCUSA is pro-progressive tax reform, Trump is not. The PCUSA is pro-gay marriage, Trump is not. The PCUSA has plans to overhaul the U.S. financial and political sectors in ways that are contrary to Trump\u2019s known business practices. The PCUSA advocates for the redistribution of wealth, Trump, well, he\u2019s not.\n\nOne wonders what it is exactly that Trump \u201cloves\u201d about his church if it\u2019s not the core theology, the sacramental practice nor its liberal social witness. With the PCUSA\u2019s current CEO vacancy and its financial management woes, if the Presidency doesn\u2019t work out for Trump maybe he could offer himself in service of his chosen church. That would amaze not only the average America but the Presbyterians as well.\n\n\u2013\u2013-", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to Presbyterian theology and social witness, Trump is an equal opportunity offender.
