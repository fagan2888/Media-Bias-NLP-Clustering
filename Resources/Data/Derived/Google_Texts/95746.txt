WASHINGTON (Gray DC) -- Both houses of Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act in January. Though President Obama vetoed the legislation, many Republicans are working to chip away at the legislation.

Congressman Rick Allen of Georgia recently introduced legislation that he says will create greater transparency within the program. Allen says taxpayers are the ones funding the Affordable Care Act and when exchanges fail, “they shouldn’t be left holding the bag.” Under his plan, states would be required to keep records and properly record how federal funds have been spent. Then, if an exchange fails, the leftover money will be transferred to the Treasury Department to help lower the national debt.

“It’s all about accountability,” said the Congressman. “It’s basically an audit process.”

The Gray DC Bureau reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services multiple times for an interview but were not granted one. They did release this statement in full:

"20 million people have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act and the uninsured rate has fallen to the lowest level on record. It's also worth noting that this year, millions of Americans again enrolled in health insurance on the Marketplaces because it is a product people like, want and need. Americans say that they want Washington to build on the progress we have made to increase access to coverage, drive down the growth of health costs and improve the quality of care. Unfortunately, partisan efforts in the House of Representatives to repeal key parts of the ACA do the opposite. We would go back to a time when people faced bankruptcy due to lifetime caps on coverage or could be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions."
