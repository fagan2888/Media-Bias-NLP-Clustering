The battery had burned through his esophagus, leaving him unable to breathe, eat, or speak.\n\nBut Emmett, now 4 years old, pulled through after months in the intensive care unit. Now, doctors at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center are planning on using the child\u2019s rib to rebuild his throat in a reconstructive surgery. \u201cThis will be a major step in helping little Emmett be a normal boy,\u201d Dr. Alessandro de Alarcon, director of the Center for Pediatric Voice Disorders at Cincinnati Children\u2019s, said in a press release. \u201cIf all goes well, the trach tube will be removed within the next year. He wants to play soccer, so we think he\u2019ll be able to do that and play other sports if he wants, which is important for his childhood development.\u201d\n\nOver 3,500 people swallow button batteries annually in the U.S., according to the National Capital Poison Center, and begin burning tissue within two hours of being ingested. When Emmett got a fever after swallowing the button battery, his parents didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him and took him to a doctor, where he was diagnosed with the flu or a reaction to a recent vaccination. But a few days later, Emmett began vomiting blood and an X-Ray showed the battery. The National Capital Poison Center notes that an electrical current can form outside the battery, creating hydroxide, which burns through tissue.\n\nEmmett has undergone many surgeries over the past few years to attempt to repair his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s undergone extensive swallow therapy to learn how to eat,\u201d Emmett\u2019s mother, Karla Rauch, said in the press release. \u201cHe is a champ now. The esophagus surgery changed his and our lives.\u201d\n\nThe rib-graft surgery will restore function to his vocal cords by spreading them apart to create an air passage. Once the procedure is completed, Emmett will be able to attend kindergarten and start voice therapy to adapt to his new vocal cords. On their website and in a video, Emmett\u2019s parents urge others to be aware of the dangers of button batteries, and hope parents can keep their children away from such devices.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "esophagus, rib graft surgery,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After swallowing a remote control button battery, 1-year-old Emmett Rauch began vomiting blood; his esophagus had been burned through, and now doctors are using his rib to repair his throat.", "title": "Surgeons To Repair Boy\u2019s Burned Esophagus With One Of His Ribs [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/surgeons-use-boys-rib-repair-his-esophagus-after-he-swallowed-remote-control-battery-300346", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/little-boy.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After swallowing a remote control button battery, 1-year-old Emmett Rauch began vomiting blood; his esophagus had been burned through, and now doctors are using his rib to repair his throat.", "title": "Surgeons To Repair Boy\u2019s Burned Esophagus With One Of His Ribs [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/surgeons-use-boys-rib-repair-his-esophagus-after-he-swallowed-remote-control-battery-300346", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/little-boy.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/little-boy.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-28T14:55:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T14:55:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After swallowing a remote control button battery, 1-year-old Emmett Rauch began vomiting blood; his esophagus had been burned through, and now doctors are using his rib to repair his throat."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc91b\"", "article_summary": "After accidentally swallowing a button battery from a remote control on his 1st birthday, Emmett Rauch suffered life-threatening injuries that physicians didn\u2019t think he\u2019d survive.\nThe battery had burned through his esophagus, leaving him unable to breathe, eat, or speak.\nEmmett has undergone many surgeries over the past few years to attempt to repair his throat.\nThe National Capital Poison Center notes that an electrical current can form outside the battery, creating hydroxide, which burns through tissue.\nNow, doctors at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center are planning on using the child\u2019s rib to rebuild his throat in a reconstructive surgery."}
