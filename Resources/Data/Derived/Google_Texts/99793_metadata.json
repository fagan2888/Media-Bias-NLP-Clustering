We have exhausted all of our time that we had to think about things and contemplate things. Changes have to be made immediately.\"\n\nBoard members sought guidance from rural hospital financial consultant James Sneed of Bonifay.\n\nSneed says growing uncertainties with the affordable care act could be contributing to the problem.\n\nThe hospital has been a staple in the Graceville community since the 1960s and these upcoming possible layoffs could affect up to 90 families.\n\nDavis says, \"We're in uncharted territory so we've never been quite so far in debt but we're hoping that we can make some aggressive changes and we can right the ship.\"\n\nIn addition to salary-cuts, board members agree they'll have to lay-off at least 30 employees, and that could be just the beginning.\n\nDavis explains, \"We're at the edge of the cliff. We need to make some changes pretty quick.\"\n\nIf the hospital board cannot find a permanent solution within the next three months, the hospital may be forced to shut down.\n\nSneed says the hospital board's priority should be to hire a new hospital administrator after theirs resigned last week without explanation.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Cambellton-Graceville hospital board members are trying to keep the hospital open, while climbing out from under a nearly $1 million debt.", "language": "english", "author": "Sanika Dange", "og": {"description": "Cambellton-Graceville hospital board members are trying to keep the hospital open, while climbing out from under a nearly $1 million debt.", "title": "Graceville Hospital Struggling Under Debt", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Graceville-Hospital-Struggling-Under-Debt-249541431.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/AB9/A8B/AB9A8B02A6214917B1F47E6EED5464DF", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/851/C34/851C345DD9E24DB2984D16C11B1214BA.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Cambellton-Graceville hospital board members are trying to keep the hospital open, while climbing out from under a nearly $1 million debt.", "title": "Graceville Hospital Struggling Under Debt", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Graceville-Hospital-Struggling-Under-Debt-249541431.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/hospital25.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Graceville Hospital Struggling Under Debt", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Graceville Hospital Struggling Under Debt"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0068\"", "article_summary": "Cambellton-Graceville hospital board members are trying to keep the hospital open, while climbing out from under a nearly $1 million debt.\nIf the hospital board cannot find a permanent solution within the next three months, the hospital may be forced to shut down.\nWithin the last 3 to 4 months, the Campbellton-Graceville hospital has totaled a nearly $1 million debt.\nHospital board chairperson Linda Wheatley began Monday afternoon's meeting with a plea to a higher authority, praying, \"With your guidance, I as well as others, know that some way will be found to keep our hospital open.\"\nSneed says the hospital board's priority should be to hire a new hospital administrator after theirs resigned last week without explanation."}
