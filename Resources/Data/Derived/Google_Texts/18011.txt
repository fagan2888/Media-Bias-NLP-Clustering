On Wednesday, Heartland Institute Senior Fellow Benjanim Domenech appeared on The Blaze TV to discuss the disastrous commencement of the Obamacare launch. Critics on the panel — including “friend of Heartland” Matt Welch of Reason — state that the massive technological problems of this program directly reflect the poor leadership and oversight of President Obama.

Ben asserts that the people who appear in the media endorsing Obamacare are so far removed from the technological implementation, that the ‘faces’ of Obamacare can not accurately comment about the set backs. In interviews, it has been found that until very recently, the task of actually making the online exchanges work had not been assigned. Obama had instilled too much faith that his presence in the matter was enough to launch such a massive and technological program.
