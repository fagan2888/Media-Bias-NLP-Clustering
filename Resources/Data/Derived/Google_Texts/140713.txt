CBS's venerable newsmagazine, 60 Minutes, will air a piece on tonight's show (airing 7p ET/8p PT) covering the tragic case of Andrew Sadek, a North Dakota college student who became a confidential informant after being threatened with 40 years in prison over the sale of a small amount of marijuana.

After Sadek turned up dead, all the agencies involved with busting him washed their hands of the case, refusing to even investigate his death as a potential murder and insisting to his grieving parents that the young man committed suicide.

I went to North Dakota earlier this year to investigate the case, which you can read here or watch in documentary form.
