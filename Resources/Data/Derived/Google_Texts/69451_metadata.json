ESPN reports that Kessler today filed a lawsuit on behalf of all men\u2019s college basketball and football players, asserting that the NCAA, its largest conferences, and its member institutions have violated antitrust laws by agreeing to cap players\u2019 compensation at the value of an athletic scholarship.\n\nAs ESPN notes, the lawsuit, which includes four college athletes as lead plaintiffs but was filed as a class action, \u201ceffectively asks for an end to NCAA-style amateurism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main objective is to strike down permanently the restrictions that prevent athletes in Division I basketball and the top tier of college football from being fairly compensated for the billions of dollars in revenues that they help generate,\u201d Kessler told ESPN. \u201cIn no other business \u2014 and college sports is big business \u2014 would it ever be suggested that the people who are providing the essential services work for free. Only in big-time college sports is that line drawn.\u201d\n\nKessler\u2019s suit is far more aggressive than the previous lawsuits filed against the NCAA, including the major case brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O\u2019Bannon that is winding its way through court right now and another antitrust suit from a former West Virginia football player.\n\nKessler\u2019s suit, according to ESPN, doesn\u2019t seek damages as those cases do. Instead, it simply asks for an end to the \u201ccartel\u201d the NCAA has set up to prevent players from having the right to earn more than the scholarships they are currently provided.\n\nIf the agreements to only offer scholarships weren\u2019t in place, the argument against the current model goes, players could earn more than they do now because the business of college athletics would function as a true labor market. That would give players more rights in the system and the ability to share in the profits they help create each year (CBS and Turner Sports agreed in 2010, for instance, to pay more than $10 billion for the broadcast rights to the NCAA Tournament).\n\n\u201cThere are good (legal) arguments that Division I football is basically a business, and that students are exploited as workers,\u201d Kessler told me in January 2013. \u201cAnd therefore schools should be free to compensate athletes in any manner that they want to, without NCAA restrictions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Prominent labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler has filed suit against the NCAA asking for an end to its amateurism rules.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Prominent labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler has filed suit against the NCAA asking for an end to its amateurism rules.", "title": "New Lawsuit Poses Direct Challenge To NCAA\u2019s Amateurism Rules", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2014/03/17/3411951/prominent-labor-attorney-files-lawsuit-challenging-ncaa-amateurism-rules/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/johnnymanzielap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prominent labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler has filed suit against the NCAA asking for an end to its amateurism rules.", "title": "New Lawsuit Poses Direct Challenge To NCAA\u2019s Amateurism Rules", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/johnnymanzielap-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Travis_Waldron", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-sports", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/johnnymanzielap.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/johnnymanzielap.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-17T10:59:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd86b\"", "article_summary": "This week, just a day before the NCAA Tournament is set to begin, Kessler took his first major action.\n\u201cThere are good (legal) arguments that Division I football is basically a business, and that students are exploited as workers,\u201d Kessler told me in January 2013.\n\u201cAnd therefore schools should be free to compensate athletes in any manner that they want to, without NCAA restrictions.\u201d\n\u201cIn no other business \u2014 and college sports is big business \u2014 would it ever be suggested that the people who are providing the essential services work for free.\nKessler\u2019s suit, according to ESPN, doesn\u2019t seek damages as those cases do."}
