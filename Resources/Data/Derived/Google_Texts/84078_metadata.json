This was at least the sixth Fox News attack on Oprah for having had the (racial) audacity to opine that she believes some of the attacks on President Obama are based on his race. Just as with her co-workers, Kelly inadvertently proved Oprah\u2019s point for her.\n\nKelly toned down her usual outrage into scorn for the discussion. I guess that was her way of showing her sensitivity about the delicacy of the subject. She said:\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to see someone as successful as Oprah Winfrey, I mean a billionaire, thanks in large part to American viewers loving her - white, black, brown, you name it, loving her - talking about racist Americans.\n\nHer guest to give her cover and help attack Oprah discuss this all-important issue was Fox News contributor Allen West. Or, as I usually refer to these kinds of discussions, West was the Kelly File\u2019s designated African American black attacker.\n\nSure enough, West\u2019s opening words were that it was \u201cabsolutely appalling and unconscionable\u201d for Winfrey to \u201ccontinually to try to use the race card.\u201d For good invite-me-back measure, he lumped President Obama in with the smear. After all, Winfrey was talking about Obama (sort of), she\u2019s friends with him, they\u2019re both black, they share the same liberal views, they must both be on the same racial page.\n\nYou may recall how Kelly excused her repeated interruptions of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, as he tried to defend the Affordable Care Act, by saying that it had to be a \u201cback and forth\u201d kind of discussion. If so, you\u2019ll note how she had no such criteria for West. She listened attentively, a half smile of approval on her face, as West echoed Kelly\u2019s suggestion that Winfrey was not grateful enough for her success (I guess nobody dared use the word \u201cuppity\u201d) and then complained that Winfrey and other black liberals are hypocrites who \u201care setting race relations back in the United States of America.\u201d Where were they, the two talking heads wondered, when Joe Biden and Harry Reid made racially suspect comments about Obama?\n\nWe could turn it around and ask where \u201cfair and balanced\u201d Kelly and West were when Glenn Beck made far more explicitly hostile racial attacks on President Obama on the Fox News airways. But that\u2019s too much to ask, apparently. So is challenging West\u2019s over-the-top assertion that Winfrey and Obama are \u201csetting race relations back.\u201d During the 6th (that I know of) FNC discussion using race to attack Oprah and Obama.\n\nKelly merely added to the one-sided opinionating: She called it \u201camazing\u201d that \u201cthe only example (Winfrey) offered of disrespect based on race\u201d was Rep. Joe Wilson calling out \u201cYou lie\u201d to President Obama during his State of the Union address. \u201cNow, in a court of law, that would not fly,\u201d Kelly announced. \u201cThere is nothing in that exchange to suggest it based on race.\u201d\n\nIf Kelly bothered to pay attention to what Oprah said, instead of just dismissing it in lockstep with everyone else on Fox, she might have noted that Oprah was talking about how the level of disrespect is higher against President Obama, at least somewhat because of his race. She was not saying that particular remark was race-based. The fact that Kelly was grasping at straws to smear Oprah (and using race to do so) spoke volumes about Kelly.\n\n\u201cWhere is the evidence that the president\u2019s critics \u2026are basing their upset on race?\u201d Kelly asked.\n\nWell, you need look no further than Megyn Kelly, herself, to answer that. She may want to forget \u2013 but we can\u2019t \u2013 her prolonged crusade to paint the Obama administration as deiberately enabling black voter intimidation against whites. Kelly even went so far as to suggest that radical black thugs would be coming to a voting precinct near you, thanks to the Obama Department of Justice. Until Kirsten Powers called her out on the air about it. And then Kelly\u2019s story \u2013 bogus from the start \u2013 fell apart completely.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t a race-based attack, then why did Kelly put so much focus on a falsehood? If it was really valid, why did she drop it like a hot potato once it was no longer of political service?\n\nThe answer is obvious. We can chalk Megyn Kelly up as another Fox News host who, while eager to use race to smear Oprah Winfrey and President Obama, is in reality a textbook case of exactly what Oprah was talking about.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "yOzP9/syZXJgeLmTIcirQkqNVE660zKpu3ycFSp7PfI=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/megyn_kelly_joins_fox_news_race_war_on_oprah_winfrey_11212013", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Megyn Kelly Joins Fox News\u2019 Race War On Oprah Winfrey"}, "Title": "Megyn Kelly Joins Fox News\u2019 Race War On Oprah Winfrey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00e3\"", "article_summary": "Megyn Kelly grabbed her racial pitchfork last night and called up Fox News contributor Allen West to enlist in Fox News\u2019 race war on Oprah Winfrey.\n\u201cWhere is the evidence that the president\u2019s critics \u2026are basing their upset on race?\u201d Kelly asked.\nWe can chalk Megyn Kelly up as another Fox News host who, while eager to use race to smear Oprah Winfrey and President Obama, is in reality a textbook case of exactly what Oprah was talking about.\nThe fact that Kelly was grasping at straws to smear Oprah (and using race to do so) spoke volumes about Kelly.\nHer guest to give her cover and help attack Oprah discuss this all-important issue was Fox News contributor Allen West."}
