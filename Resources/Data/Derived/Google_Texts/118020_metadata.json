I say so-called because I think that the convention of naming the Court after the incumbent Chief Justice often obscures more than it enlightens\u2014and because I think that the current Court is, alas, better understood as the Kennedy Court.\n\nI may be applying the soft bigotry of low expectations, but Cole\u2019s essay is much milder than I expected. Sure, he somehow manages to make his first paragraph about Bush v. Gore. Worse, in contending that the \u201cCourt\u2019s five conservatives \u2026 relied on a wholly unprecedented theory\u201d of equal protection, he conveniently omits to note that Justice Breyer and Justice Souter agreed with the majority that the Florida supreme court\u2019s recount order violated the Equal Protection Clause. Plus, he repeats the baseless canard that the majority \u201cannounced\u201d that it \u201cwould apply this [theory] one time only.\u201d And, in his closing section, he complains that the Roberts Court \u201chas been unremittingly conservative\u201d on \u201caccess to judicial remedies for legal wrongs.\u201d\n\nBut Cole agrees with Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz (authors of Uncertain Justice: The Roberts Court and the Constitution) and Mark Tushnet (author of In the Balance: Law and Politics on the Roberts Court) that, as Cole puts it, \u201cthe reason so many cases are decided 5-4 is not so much that the justices are partisan or political in any simple sense, but that the cases pose genuinely close questions of competing values on which conservatives and liberals often disagree.\u201d Indeed, contrary to the common caricature of the Court as conservative, Cole provides his own summary of cases in which the \u201cRoberts Court\u201d has \u201cissued important decisions reaching liberal outcomes\u201d:\n\nIt has affirmed the rights of married gays and lesbians to receive federal benefits, of prisoners to be free of overcrowding, of foreign detainees at Guant\u00e1namo to judicial review, and of criminal defendants to have effective assistance of counsel in negotiations over guilty pleas. The Court upheld Obamacare, and struck down Arizona\u2019s anti-immigrant law that would have imposed onerous penalties on foreign nationals here who overstayed their visas. It has protected the rights of unpopular speakers, invalidating laws prohibiting the depiction of animal cruelty, the sale of violent video games to minors, and lying about one\u2019s military honors. This past term alone, the Court required police to obtain warrants to search cell phones of arrestees, affirmed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and struck down a Florida rule that permitted execution of intellectually disabled defendants with IQ s over 70.\n\nThe third book that Cole refers to is Bruce Allen Murphy\u2019s biography of Justice Scalia. Citing the book as \u201cunderscor[ing]\u201d the \u201ccomplex dynamics of Supreme Court decision-making,\u201d Cole embraces Murphy\u2019s thesis that Scalia \u201chas had limited influence on the Court\u2019s results\u201d and has been \u201ca court of one.\u201d There is plenty of room for different views on that matter, and I haven\u2019t faulted Murphy for advancing that thesis. (Anyone doing so at length, though, ought to explore whether and when it\u2019s legitimate for a justice to compromise his legal views in order to build a consensus; as usual, Murphy is not an intelligent guide.)\n\nCole notably doesn\u2019t endorse Murphy\u2019s cartoonish account of how Scalia\u2019s politics and faith have supposedly influenced his decisionmaking. Cole\u2019s statement that the \u201cmost engaging parts of [Murphy\u2019s] book are, ironically, the many lengthy quotations from Scalia\u201d would seem to reveal his fatigue with Murphy\u2019s tedious, tendentious, and gaffe-filled screed. (Cole, I\u2019ll note, makes an error of his own when he states that Scalia\u2019s criticism of Justice O\u2019Connor in an abortion case came in \u201chis very first term on the Court\u201d; the case he quotes from was decided in 1989, at the end of Scalia\u2019s third term.)", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "David Cole on the \u201cRoberts Court\u201d", "sailthru.author": "Ed Whelan", "description": "In the New York Review of Books, left-wing Georgetown law professor David Cole uses his review of three recent books as the vehicle for providing his assessment of the so-called Roberts Court.
