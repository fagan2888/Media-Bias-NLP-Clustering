The free, family friendly event drew hundreds of people to celebrate.\n\nSix months of planning, 33 vendors and $25,000 worth of fireworks were all in preparation for the fourth.\n\n\u201cI loved it,\u201d said Jim St. Aubin, listening to the band with his wife Charlotte. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a real good job this year.\u201d\n\nThe event drew young, old, vets and pets - all there to do one thing.\n\n\u201cYeah, this is the best way to spend it,\u201d said Nathaniel Rhodes, owner of Smokin on Wheels food truck. \u201cEverybody together, come together, eat good.\u201d\n\nThe free event offered plenty of food, live music and the best seat in the house for one of Panama City\u2019s largest firework displays.\n\n\u201cSo far, the event is going fantastic,\u201d said Valerie Woods, coordinator with the Downtown Improvement Board. \u201cPeople are starting to come in and get some food and listen to the band. And there are kid\u2019s activities. Bounce houses and the children\u2019s train, so everybody seems to be having a good time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis area just gets flooded with locals pounding on the trailer for pizza,\u201d said Guillermo Dovalina, owner of Dovalina\u2019s Wood Fired Pizza. \u201cIt gets pretty intense.\u201d\n\nMusic and merriment aside, locals also wanted to honor the red, white and blue.\n\n\u201cWe decorated with some flags,\u201d said local and military member, Ramsey Blankenship, while riding a decorated golf cart. \u201cThe EOD Wounded Warrior Foundation and actually I carried this American flag in Afghanistan with me while I was deployed.\u201d\n\nWhile downtown was simmering in the July heat like a fourth of July hot dog, locals said they wouldn\u2019t have celebrated any other way.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t beat this,\u201d said St. Aubin. \u201cIn paradise? Having a good time, good food, good people, good music,\u201d\n\nWoods said the improvements board will meet this week. They will begin discussing how to make next year\u2019s event bigger and better.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Locals enjoyed live music, food and one of the largest firework displays in the area.
