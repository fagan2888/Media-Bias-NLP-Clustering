By 1982, the group was broken up.\n\nRelated: How Michael Jordan Made His $1 Billion\n\nIn 2000, amid a revival of several of their hits, a American-British consortium offered the group $1 billion to reunite for 100 shows, but they declined the offer, according to E! Online.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the group was offered more than the value of 25 different Major League Baseball teams and the GDPs of some countries. That's potentially $250 million that each member of the group refused.\n\n\"It's a hell of a lot of money to say no to, but we decided it wasn't for us,\" Andersson told Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet in 2000.\n\nAndersson and bandmate Bjorn Ulvaeus both argue that popular reincarnations of their songs (many by teen group S Club 7) have been successful because the group never reunited.\n\n\"We have never made a comeback,\" Ulvaeus told the paper. \"Almost everyone else has. I think there's a message in that.\"\n\nF\u00e4ltskog explained to Radio Times last year: \"We said no because they wanted 250 shows or something, it was incredible. No chance. We had done it.\n\nLyngstad also confirmed this year to Ireland's RTE that \"no amount of money would change our minds. Maybe we sometimes say it would be good to do a song together again, just a recording and nothing else, but I don\u2019t know if that will happen \u2014 so don\u2019t say that we will!\"\n\nRelated: Bob Dylan\u2019s \u2018Like a Rolling Stone\u2019 Lyrics Sell for Record $2M\n\nDespite the fact that the foursome recently reunited \u2014 the \"chemistry was still there\" \u2014 all members said they were not tempted to reunite.\n\nThe four founding members are doing just fine since the group's break-up 32 years ago.\n\nLast March, \"Mamma Mia,\" a stage musical based on ABBA's music, became the ninth-longest-running show in Broadway history. Over the show's 13-year run, it has been seen by 50 million people worldwide and raked in over $2 billion.\n\nA star-studded film based on the musical was released in 2008 and went on to be a $609 million hit at the box office.\n\nIn 2010, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.\n\nRead more at Business Insider:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Swedish pop group\u00a0ABBA\u00a0is responsible for hit s", "title": "Mamma Mia!
