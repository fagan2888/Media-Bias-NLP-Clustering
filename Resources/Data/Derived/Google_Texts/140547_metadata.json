This isn\u2019t about shaking down her sweet little nephew for being too excited to see her, she says, it\u2019s about getting his dad\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance to help cover medical bills that have now reached six figures after two separate surgeries on her wrist. The kid is named as the defendant in the suit only because that\u2019s what Connecticut law requires.\n\n\u201cOur client was very reluctant to pursue this case,\u201d her lawyers insist, \u201cbut in the end she had no choice but to sue the minor defendant directly to get her bills paid.\u201d Connell herself spoke to CNN about it:\n\n\u201cThis was meant to be a simple homeowners insurance case,\u201d she said. \u201cConnecticut law is such that I was advised by counsel that this is the way a suit is meant to be worded.\u201d\u2026 \u201cI adore this child. I would never want to hurt him. He would never want to hurt me,\u201d she told CNN. The boy refers to Connell as his aunt, although she said he is the son of her cousin. The family remains close. Just a few weeks ago, Connell said, she took the boy out shopping for his Halloween costume. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the power that the Internet has that something can go viral, completely out of context,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not trying to retire to some villa in the south of France. I\u2019m simply trying to pay off my medical bills.\u201d\n\nThe most heartwrenching part of the original story was the idea that Connell would gladly risk her relationship with her adoring nephew to get some cold hard cash. Assuming she\u2019s telling the truth about taking him shopping for Halloween, though, there\u2019s no truth to that part of it. They remain close. As for the legal niceties of the lawsuit, is it accurate that she had no choice but to sue her nephew in order to drag the insurance company into court? Well \u2026 yeah, according to legal experts who spoke to the Guardian:\n\nThis is \u201cperfectly plausible\u201d, said Tom Baker, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specialises in insurance law. He told the Guardian this kind of suit is a common occurrence when someone finds themselves with medical bills not covered by medical insurance, who might be able to be covered under homeowners insurance if liability could be proved. \u201cI get why this would be an internet phenomenon,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t sound to me like anything other than someone following the rules \u2026 One must question why these are the rules, but it\u2019s hard to blame her. You go into the legal system, get told what to do, all of a sudden you get flamed online. I\u2019d be upset if I were her.\u201d\u2026 The $127,000 amount that seemed at first glance so punitive might just have been an amount set by the homeowners insurance coverage, according to Professor Peter Kochenburger, a specialist in insurance and consumer law at the University of Connecticut. It is plausible, he said, that Connell\u2019s health insurance provider, if she has one, might have mandated her to sue to recoup their own costs \u2013 a process known as \u201csubrogation\u201d.\n\nOne thing that struck me as weird in the original story about the suit was how willing Connell was to note that her nephew had greeted her sweetly before the fateful hug. A plaintiff with a grudge against the defendant would be less forthcoming about him bounding towards her with excitement and exclaiming how much he loved her, if only so as not to make the jury well disposed towards the defense. She acknowledged it, though, doubtless realizing as she did that it meant her suit would be more likely to fail. Maybe she just didn\u2019t have the heart to make her beloved nephew into the bad guy, even though it wouldn\u2019t have cost him anything had she won.\n\nProbably too late to turn back the Internet lynch mob in noting all that, but here\u2019s hoping. I said \u201calmost\u201d total innocence up top, incidentally, because there remains the fact that she\u2019s accusing the kid of having done wrong. He\u2019s a sweetie and he didn\u2019t mean to do harm, she admits, but he\u2019s guilty of negligence. Is he? Should a hypothetical \u201creasonable eight-year-old\u201d have known that a leaping hug into the arms of your dear aunt is dangerous? He didn\u2019t drop-kick her. It was a hug and it ended up in a freak injury. What\u2019s negligent about that?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cI adore this child.
