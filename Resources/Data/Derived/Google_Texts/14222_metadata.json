On Tuesday night in Denver, she called him \u201cout of touch\u201d for questioning, earlier that day, how much government should spend on women\u2019s health \u2014 a quick insert into a speech in which Mrs. Clinton had already planned to hit Mr. Bush on immigration.\n\nFor Mrs. Clinton, going after Mr. Bush with such gusto offers a debate about policy instead of simply answering persistent questions about her email practices and her family\u2019s foundation, which have helped to precipitate a dip in her approval ratings.\n\nAnd attacking Mr. Bush before black leaders, on immigration and on women\u2019s health, can only help fire up Mrs. Clinton\u2019s core supporters.\n\nVideo\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton has not picked on Mr. Bush at random: Her aides, for the most part, believe he is likely to ultimately win the Republican nomination. And in a very crowded Republican field, in which Donald J. Trump is sopping up the news media\u2019s attention, Mr. Bush has for the most part escaped the kind of sharp elbows that would normally have been thrown at such a high-profile candidate.\n\nMrs. Clinton seems happy to pick up the slack. She faulted his record on voting rights. She ridiculed him for saying that Americans need to \u201cwork longer hours.\u201d And she went out of her way, in a CNN interview, to point out that Mr. Bush no longer supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe feistiness lives up to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s promises to be a \u201cfighter,\u201d and could help satisfy liberals who want her to show aggressiveness on behalf of their ideals.\n\n\u201cFor months now, she has been a pi\u00f1ata for the Republicans, the Koch brothers, the press and anyone else who wanted to take a swing,\u201d said Paul Begala, a strategist in Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign. \u201cHillary is a great counterpuncher, and I am glad to see her fighting back. Democrats will see she is not from the surrenderist wing of the progressive movement.\u201d\n\nThe strategy may also look very familiar to veterans of President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, in which Mr. Obama\u2019s basic message to his supporters was that Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee that year, \u201chates you,\u201d as one former Obama aide put it.\n\nMrs. Clinton is taking a similar approach. Though she has criticized Republicans in general and a few of Mr. Bush\u2019s rivals by name, she has recently narrowed her focus to Mr. Bush. \u201cIt makes sense to start trying to define the race against Bush as early as possible,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. \u201cShe\u2019ll do much better in contrast to Republicans.\u201d Steve Murphy, a Democratic strategist, was more blunt: \u201cForget about the Democratic heel biters and start drawing the contrast with him,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Bush.\n\nThe strategy is not risk-free: Mrs. Clinton could be accused of ignoring her own primaries, particularly by critics who will remind her of her 2008 loss to Mr. Obama, after she was initially seen as the inevitable nominee.\n\n\u201cThis is the strategy of a weak Democratic candidate: to attack and be attacked by Jeb Bush, to rally Democratic antibodies to her defense and get her through an uncertain nomination process,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s aides insist that they are not banking on Mr. Bush\u2019s becoming the Republican nominee, and that Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida cannot be discounted. But privately, several Democrats close to her campaign say they are convinced that Republicans will adhere to their practice of uniting behind the establishment candidate in the end.\n\nOn a conference call on Wednesday, looking ahead to the first Republican debate Thursday night, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pollster, Joel Benenson, responded to questions about her aggressiveness toward Mr. Bush by saying he had \u201ccreated a rather target-rich environment.\u201d\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s attacks have offered a reminder that many conservatives still view Mr. Bush with skepticism, despite his demonstrably conservative record as governor. Instead of rallying to his side, some conservatives publicly rapped him on Wednesday for fumbling his comments about Planned Parenthood the day before.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bush\u2019s aides plan to begin airing online ads making the case to conservatives that he has drawn Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fire because he is such a strong champion for their cause. \u201cHillary\u2019s coming to Jeb because they\u2019re concerned about his strength as a general election candidate,\u201d said Tim Miller, a Bush spokesman.\n\nIt is possible that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s attacks could expose Mr. Bush\u2019s weaknesses in his own party. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers privately acknowledge that Mr. Bush also has many strengths, including the ability to compete in the swing state of Florida.\n\nIf attacking Mr. Bush hurts him in his own primary, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers would not see that as a terrible outcome. And with so many Republican candidates to choose from \u2014 and given Mr. Bush\u2019s troubles with conservative voters \u2014 being targeted by Mrs. Clinton may not be of much use to him in solidifying support in his own party.\n\n\u201cIt should help him that Hillary\u2019s attacking him,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. \u201cUnfortunately, the weird way the G.O.P. is situated right now, it probably won\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150805214544, "twitter": {"description": "Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides, for the most part, believe Jeb
