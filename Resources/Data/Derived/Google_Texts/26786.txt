To celebrate the opening of its upcoming LEGO exhibit, Nature Connects, the zoo is asking builders from four different age groups to submit their best original sculpture created from the toy building blocks.

The sculpture must be an original creation — not out of a box set — and must represent a plant or animal that occurs in nature. Sculptures should be delivered to the zoo’s membership booth between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Jan. 14 to 16.

A panel of zoo experts and members of the public will judge the entries by building skill, creativity and connection to the theme.

The exhibit opens Jan. 15.
