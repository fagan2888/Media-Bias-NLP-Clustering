The conservative advocacy group has spent at least $55 million to $60 million on television ads in this election cycle, mostly blasting Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act, in an effort to help the GOP win enough seats in November to control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nMr. Phillips was interviewed by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Beth Reinhard, along with Carl Hulse of the New York Times, for C-SPAN\u2019s Newsmakers show hosted by Greta Brawner. The full interview aired Sunday. Here are some interesting excerpts:\n\nOn Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s constant attacks against AFP and its major funders:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see the majority leader using his position to attack two individual Americans, David and Charles Koch, and our organization. It\u2019s also ironic to see him go on the floor and decry the one percent, and to do that he actually comes down from the penthouse of the Ritz Carlton here in D.C. And by the way, we are for penthouses and for folks getting into them, although interesting how he pays for it on a government salary, but that\u2019s a different story\u2026It\u2019s probably helped fundraising a little bit. We were doing all right otherwise before this anyway, but it\u2019s probably helped. We assume it\u2019s a base strategy. They\u2019ve got to do something to whip up their hardcore base.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican-led House\u2019s lawsuit against President Obama over implementation of the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cIt is a tough one because it lets the president go into more of a \u2018It\u2019s a personal attack on me, this isn\u2019t about issues,\u2019 but I do think they\u2019re doing the right thing on that and they\u2019re not doing it for political reasons. I think they\u2019re doing it because they know it takes the courts a while to act. So they have start doing it now if it\u2019s going to have an impact by next year, even if they know politically it does let the president and his allies go out and play the victim card, which they are doing on impeachment, which no one is seriously contemplating at all that\u2019s in a position of responsibility. But they\u2019re raising millions of dollars off it.\u201d\n\nOn why a GOP takeover of the Senate isn\u2019t a sure thing:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to beat a sitting United States senator. It doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2026.The second reason I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slam dunk, speaking in all candor, is that the Republican brand is weak. It really is. A lot of conservatives have shifted to independents when they self-identify themselves\u2026When they were in power with the House and the Senate and President Bush, they let spending get out of control\u2026 I will say the president has been successful with class warfare, primarily, harming the brand further, but a lot of is Republicans doing self-inflicted damage over the last decade.\u201d\n\nOn why Americans for Prosperity doesn\u2019t voluntarily disclose its donors:\n\n\u201cI mentioned the IRS scandal a minute ago, where we had the chilling spectacle of the most feared regulatory agency in the nation targeting American citizens based on the fact that they happen to disagree with the ideology of this administration, and it\u2019s documented. It\u2019s clear what happened there, and I think there is a chilling effect. And as long as you have abuses like that\u2026.we think it\u2019s the best thing to protect the privacy of donors. This administration has shown they will use the most feared agency in the nation to go after people. They\u2019ve shown that, so we think it\u2019s a prudent thing to do to protect the identity of Americans who will automatically become immediate targets of a politicized IRS and a politicized bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nOn the slew of tea party challenges this year to sitting Republican senators:\n\n\u201cThe view that we would have, even though we\u2019re not electioneering and we weren\u2019t involved in any of those (primaries), is that you think about what\u2019s the most important thing. Is the most important thing having a more pure 45th Republican, or is the most important thing next year not a having a hard-left majority leader? And probably the value proposition would be better on the latter than on the former. So I hope the Republicans don\u2019t have so much inter-party, inter-movement warfare that they lose sight of that.\u201d\n\nOn the 2012 Republican field:\n\n\u201cThis is going to sound bad but it was a poor, it was not a strong accomplished group running in 2012. It just wasn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t mean that to demean individually, there were some good folks there. But I think the folks looking at running in 2016 on the Republican side, in accomplishments and experience and in philosophy as well, are every bit as good as the 1980 class that had Reagan and Bush and Connally and Crane.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "AFP's Phillips was interviewed for C-SPAN\u2019s Newsmakers show.
