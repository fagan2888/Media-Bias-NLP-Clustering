The Class of 2015 West Point graduate leaves for basic training in Fort Sill, Okla., when the season ends Sept. 7.\n\nRiverDogs homestand When: vs. Rome Braves \u2014 Monday, 7:05 p.m.; Tuesday, 7:05 p.m.; Wednesday, 7:05 p.m. vs. Augusta GreenJackets \u2014 Thursday, 7:05 p.m.; Friday, 7:05 p.m.; Saturday, 6:05 p.m.; Sunday, 5:05 p.m. Where: Riley Park Tickets: 843 577-DOGS, riverdogs.com\n\nAfter that, the recently commissioned second lieutenant is off to Fort Bragg, N.C., to hone his expertise \u2014 directing 105-milimeter howitzer shells as a field artillery officer \u2014 before a two-year deployment.\n\nAfghanistan is a strong possibility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely eager to do it,\u201d Robinett, 22, said at Riley Park, where the RiverDogs start a seven-game Class A South Atlantic League homestand Monday night against the Rome Braves. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what you sign up for, and I spent four years at West Point getting ready for that.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees took a flier on Robinett in the 32nd round of the Major League Baseball Draft in June, knowing of his five-year active duty commitment. But if the Bronx brass likes the 5-11, 190-pound right-hander enough, they can alter his Army contract to two years of active duty with eight years in the reserves.\n\n\u201cI just want to show the Yankees that I\u2019m a good investment and just make minor tweaks to my game and work with the staff to improve,\u201d Robinett said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a slow start in the South Atlantic League (0-1, 16.71 ERA and one save in five games). But among the things to like about Robinett\u2019s five innings of relief are eight strikeouts with only one walk.\n\nThe key going forward will be development of a changeup to go with his 91 mph fastball and breaking pitches.\n\n\u201cI was promoted up to here, so that\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Robinett said. \u201cBut I\u2019m definitely not happy where I am. There\u2019s room to improve, always.\u201d\n\nRobinett has already defied convention.\n\nHe became the 12th drafted player in West Point\u2019s long history.\n\nHe was born in Saudi Arabia. He spent his first 14 years living inside a walled international compound in Dhahran while his father worked for oil giant Saudi Aramco. Robinett, his parents Mike and Lynne, and sister Hayley moved to Bend, Ore., before he started high school.\n\nHis parents are now retired in Daytona Beach, Fla. Hayley attends Emory University in Atlanta. They are thrilled with Robinett\u2019s 2015 baseball whirlwind.\n\nThough the steely and modest pitcher says the Patriot League is \u201cpretty awful,\u201d a no-hitter and a 21-strikeout game are good in any league. While going 6-5 with a 2.01 ERA as an Army senior, Robinett threw a no-hitter against Longwood and struck out 21 batters in an 8-0 victory over Air Force. It was the most strikeouts in a college game since current Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg fanned 23 Utah batters while playing for San Diego State in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt was the last start I ever had at West Point,\u201d Robinett said, \u201cso it was just a good way to finish my career there. To be able to do that for our team was a good feeling.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy introduction to professional baseball for Robinett since the Yankees picked him in the 32nd round of the draft in June. He pitched in three games for Pulaski in the Appalachian Rookie League and six for Staten Island in the short-season Class A New York-Penn League before a promotion to Charleston.\n\nEventually, Robinett wants to land a management-level job with Raytheon, Lockheed Martin or another company with close ties to the military.\n\nBut that third career will have to wait while he wholeheartedly pursues the other two.\n\nKoerner a RiverDog\n\nFormer Clemson right-hander Brody Koerner has joined the RiverDogs after getting five saves for Pulaski in the Appalachian Rookie League. Koerner, 21, was the Yankees\u2019 17th-round draft pick in June.\n\nHe is best known at Clemson for his four-hit shutout at South Carolina this March, a 7-0 victory in the rubber game of a three-game series.\n\nToussaint start\n\nRome right-hander Touki Toussaint (3-4, 6.33 ERA) is scheduled to start tonight against RiverDogs\u2019 right-hander Joey Maher (4-4, 2.22). Toussaint, 19, was the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 2014 first-round draft pick. He was acquired by Atlanta in a June trade sending infielder Phil Gosselin to Arizona.\n\nFollow Gene Sapakoff on Twitter @sapakoff", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RiverDogs\u2019 West Point grad Robinett balances baseball, Army careers, Sports, \r\nSportsCharleston RiverDogs, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nGene Sapakoff, \r\nBaseball, \r\nBaseball, Alex Robinett,Army  ,Charleston RiverDogs,New York Yankees,Riley Park,SAL,South Atlantic League,The Joe,U.S. Military Academy,West Point", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "There is always a sense of urgency for minor league baseball players, but Charleston RiverDogs pitcher Alex Robinett is particularly pressed for time.
