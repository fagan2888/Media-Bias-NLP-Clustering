That it is out of the loop \u2014 that the insurers will have to deal directly with the students, faculty, and staff, bypassing the college health plans, which remain in force, so far as contraceptive coverage is concerned, only for the contraceptives that the college does not disapprove of on religious grounds.\"\n\nDespite the religious objection provision, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty \u2014 the legal group representing Wheaton \u2014 contends that the provision still violates the school's religious convictions.\n\n\"When you order somebody to provide something for the beneficiaries of my plan, you are using my plan,\" Mark Rienzi, a Becket Fund attorney, told the Tribune. \"For the government to do that is to effectively change the terms of the plan.\"\n\nAlthough the college is standing behind its moral objections, some students and alums disagree with the school's decision to nix health care coverage altogether.\n\n\"I just feel it is a very sad thing. Nobody is forcing anybody to go against their religious convictions,\" the Rev. Katherine Kallis, a 1962 Wheaton graduate, told the Tribune. \"Wheaton is really overstepping its bounds.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wheaton senior Chris Prescher also dislikes the decision.\n\n\"I fear the administration is putting petty politics above caring for students,\" he said.\n\nChelsen said the school will set aside money to help students who will have trouble paying for an increase in the cost of alternative insurance coverage. Additionally, the school will consider the possibility of self-insured plans.\n\n\"I understand this is a tumultuous, unexpected decision, but we're hoping it's not long term,\" Chelsen said. \"I can't make any promises. I don't want to raise expectations for something we can't provide. But we're going to give it our best shot.\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Due to an objection with an Affordable Care Act mandate that requires health insurance plans to offer base birth control as part of its student health plans, Wheaton College has announced that it will no longer offer health insurance to its students to avoid conflicting with the institution's Christian convictions.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Wheaton College to Drop Student Health Insurance Because of 'Obamacare' Birth Control Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "Due to an objection with an Affordable Care Act mandate that requires health insurance plans to offer base birth control as part of its student health plans, Wheaton College has announced that it will no longer offer health insurance to its students to avoid conflicting with the institution's Christian convictions.", "title": "Wheaton College to Drop Student Health Insurance Because of 'Obamacare' Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/wheaton-college-to-drop-student-health-insurance-because-of-obamacare-birth-control-mandate-142058/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/84995/billy-graham-center.jpg", "author": "Samuel Smith", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ChristianPost", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/84995/billy-graham-center.jpg", "description": "Due to an objection with an Affordable Care Act mandate that requires health insurance plans to offer base birth control as part of its student health plans, Wheaton College has announced that it will no longer offer health insurance to its students to avoid conflicting with the institution's Christian convictions.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Wheaton College to Drop Student Health Insurance Because of 'Obamacare' Birth Control Mandate"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/wheaton-college-to-drop-student-health-insurance-because-of-obamacare-birth-control-mandate-142058/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Abortion,Birth&20Control,HHS&20Mandate,Obamacare,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2015-07-29T15:57:55-04:00", "modDate": "2015-07-29T15:57:55-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Abortion, Birth Control, HHS Mandate, Obamacare,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"What has brought us here is about student health insurance, but it's bigger than student health insurance,\" Chelsen declared.\n, CP Reporter By Samuel Smith CP Reporter(Photo: Wheaton College Website) The Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois.\nThe July 10 announcement gave students on the college health plan only weeks to search for alternative coverage before their health coverage ends.\nDue to an objection with an Affordable Care Act mandate that requires health insurance plans to offer base birth control, Wheaton College has announced that it will no longer offer health insurance to its students to avoid conflicting with the institution's Christian convictions.\nAs one of the most contested aspects of Obamacare has been the requirement for health insurance plans to provide birth control and emergency contraceptives, a number of Christian organizations have cried foul, claiming that the law violates their religious beliefs."}
