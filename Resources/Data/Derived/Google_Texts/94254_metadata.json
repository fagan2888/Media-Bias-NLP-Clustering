One particularly nasty symptom for members is that contributions are increasing at a much higher rate than most members\u2019 income.\n\nThe Council for Medical Schemes\u2019s latest annual report, which was released this week, shows that over the past 12 years schemes have each year, on average, increased their contributions by four percentage points more than the inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nAt this rate, members will more rapidly reach the point at which the proportion of their income that they spend on contributions is unsustainable, Alexander Forbes says (see \u201cEnd is nigh for most members\u2019 ability to afford health cover\u201d, below).\n\nThe Council for Medical Schemes uses CPI plus three percentage points as the benchmark to determine if annual contribution increases are reasonable.\n\nDr Monwabisi Gantsho, Registrar of Medical Schemes, says his office still believes that schemes should implement contribution increases above this level only if they have good reasons for doing so.\n\nThe two main reasons for the council approving contribution increases that exceed this benchmark for individual schemes over the past 12 years are that a scheme has a dwindling or an ageing membership, Gantsho says.\n\nThe annual report shows that the contribution income that medical schemes collected in 2012 increased by 9.4 percent to R117.5 billion, from R107.4 billion in 2011.\n\nHowever, claims increased at a higher rate of almost 11 percent over the 2012 financial year, resulting in medical schemes making a much smaller operating surplus last year than they did in 2011.\n\nSchemes\u2019 overall operating surplus deteriorated to R25.7 million, from R1 billion in 2011. However, medical schemes were cushioned by their investment income and recorded a net surplus of R3.7 billion for the 2012 financial year.\n\nIn the annual report, Gantsho recognises the need for the tariffs that healthcare providers charge for their services to be regulated. However, he denies that the absence of guideline tariffs, as well as the requirement that schemes must provide their members with certain prescribed minimum benefits (PMBs), is \u2013 as many schemes assert \u2013 responsible for the large increase in the amount that schemes are paying out in claims.\n\nThe registrar says that scheme members\u2019 growing awareness of the benefits to which they are entitled is resulting in an increase in the utilisation of these benefits.\n\nIn the annual report, Gantsho says that, in the 13 years since the Medical Schemes Act was implemented, no evidence has emerged to support the \u201cmyth\u201d that PMBs are driving up medical scheme costs.\n\nHowever, he told Personal Finance that evidence may be emerging that some healthcare providers are overcharging for PMBs, and the Council for Medical Schemes will analyse and validate any evidence to this effect that is presented to it.\n\nActuary Christoff Raath told the recent Board of Healthcare Funders conference that his company, Health Monitor, has evidence that anaesthetists and surgeons are charging higher rates for services that are covered by the PMBs than they are for the same services that are not PMB claims.\n\nRaath said that providers are inflating their tariffs for PMB ser-vices, because they know that schemes are obliged by law to pay for them in full, and this is now a very real and significant problem.\n\nNeil Nair, principal officer of Samwumed, the medical scheme for members of the South African Municipal Workers\u2019 Union, told Personal Finance that it is irresponsible of the registrar to label as \u201cunfounded\u201d the claims that PMBs are making schemes unsustainable.\n\nHe says that small, low-cost schemes such as Samwumed are severely affected by having to pay PMB claims at whatever rate a provider charges. Samwumed\u2019s ratio of contribution income to claims paid out has increased from 85 percent to 102 percent since 2011, when the registrar threatened to deregister schemes that paid PMB claims at their scheme rates rather than at the rates charged by healthcare providers, Nair says.\n\nThe increase in Samwumed\u2019s claims ratio has resulted in its actuaries recommending that it raise contributions by CPI plus six percentage points in 2014, he says.\n\nSamwumed fully supports the PMBs but wants the tariffs that can be charged for these services to be regulated, Nair says.\n\nMedical schemes have been advised to contract with healthcare providers in order to reduce their PMB costs, but, Nair says, it is easier for large schemes to save costs by appointing designated service providers (DSPs) than it is for small schemes, because big schemes have more buying power.\n\nAlex van den Heever, who holds the Chair in Social Security Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, says that by appointing DSPs schemes can contain the cost of PMBs to a far greater extent than they are doing currently.\n\nAlthough the Competition Commission\u2019s inquiry into private healthcare needs to consider the obstacles to competition in the market, schemes can do more to reduce costs, he says. The inquiry is due to begin later this year.\n\nGantsho says that although schemes\u2019 solvency ratios (see \u201cVital signs\u201d, below), net results after investment income, claims-paying ability and membership growth are positive, schemes are not faring well in other areas, such as keeping contributions affordable.\n\nGantsho says that the tariffs charged for healthcare services are a big problem, which the Competition Commission\u2019s inquiry must address by considering the establishment of a bargaining chamber, recommending proper studies into the costs of health care, and taking into account the economic climate and what members can afford.\n\nPolicymakers also need to implement some kind of risk-equalisation among schemes, he says.\n\nEND IS NIGH FOR MOST MEMBERS\u2019 ABILITY TO AFFORD HEALTH COVER\n\nThe point at which most medical scheme members will not be able to afford contributions for the cover they need is approaching faster than has generally been expected.\n\nJohn Anderson, managing director for research and product development at Alexander Forbes, says that when medical scheme contributions for particular needs and benefits outstrip inflation and your income does not keep pace with these increases \u2013 as has been the case for the past 12 years \u2013 within a few years you spend a much greater, and a potentially unsustainable, portion of your income on healthcare cover. (See link to graph at the end of the article.)\n\nIt is widely believed that medical scheme contributions have been increasing at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus three percentage points, but the Council for Medical Schemes\u2019s latest annual report shows that, for the past 12 years, contributions have been increasing at CPI plus four percentage points.\n\nAnderson says this means that a person who belongs to the Government Employees Medical Scheme\u2019s Ruby option, which currently costs R1 544 a month for the main member who earns R10 000 a month, is spending 15 percent of his or her income on contributions.\n\nIf the contributions increase at CPI plus four percentage points but the member\u2019s salary increases at only CPI (6.3 percent), in 10 years\u2019 time this person will be spending 22 percent of his or her income on contributions; in 20 years, contributions will consume 32 percent of his or her income.\n\nA person who earns R25 000 a month and belongs to Discovery Health Medical Scheme\u2019s Essential Comprehensive option, is currently spending 10 percent of his or her income on contributions.\n\nIn 10 years, with contributions increasing at CPI plus four percentage points and the member\u2019s salary increasing at CPI only, medical scheme spend will consume 14 percent of his or her income; in 20 years, it will be 21 percent.\n\nSalary-earners do at times receive above-inflation increases, but above-inflation income increases are harder to come by for pensioners.\n\nAnderson says that a pensioner with an income of R5 000 a month and who pays a contribution of R1 138 a month (the average contribution rate cited in the Council for Medical Schemes\u2019s 2012/13 annual report) is spending 23 percent of his or her income on medical benefits.\n\nAssuming that the member\u2019s contributions have been increasing at CPI plus four percentage points each year, the pensioner would have paid 13 percent of his or her income to receive the same benefits in 2003.\n\nSOME ADMINISTRATORS ARE DELIBERATELY SHORT-PAYING YOUR PMB CLAIMS\n\nSome medical scheme administrators are deliberately paying claims for prescribed minimum benefits (PMBs) at scheme rates rather than in full, the Council for Medical Schemes\u2019s annual report states.\n\nIn 2012, the council dealt with 846 complaints in which administrators incorrectly paid PMB claims at the rate at which medical schemes reimburse healthcare providers, rather than in full, the report says.\n\nDr Monwabisi Gantsho, Registrar of Medical Schemes, would not be drawn on which schemes\u2019 administrators are guilty of these practices.\n\nMedical schemes are obliged by law to pay PMB claims in full regardless of what your doctor or other healthcare provider charges.\n\nThe PMBs are benefits that your scheme must by law provide. They cover all medical emergencies, 270 conditions that if left untreated would have a significant impact on your life and 25 common chronic conditions.\n\nA scheme may refuse to pay your PMB claim in full only if you fail to use a healthcare provider that it has appointed to provide a PMB service \u2013 a designated service provider (DSP).\n\nThe annual report says administrators that under-pay PMB claims settle the outstanding balance only when the Council for Medical Schemes investigates a member\u2019s complaint about the short payment.\n\nThe annual report says that the council is addressing the \u201cglaring non-compliance\u201d, and Gantsho told Personal Finance that schemes may be threatened with deregistration.\n\nGantsho says it is possible that the claims of many members who do not know their rights have been short-paid as a result of deliberate under-payment.\n\nComplaints about PMB claims made up the highest proportion of the almost 6 000 complaints that the council received from members and healthcare providers in the financial year from April 2012 to April 2013.\n\nOf the 2 411 complaints that related to PMBs, 1 814 concerned the short payment of PMB claims and 592 the non-payment of these claims.\n\nThe other issues that led to complaints about PMBs include:\n\n* Sub-limits within options that cap the payment of claims;\n\n* Treatment exceeding that outlined in scheme protocols;\n\n* Claims being denied when a medication was not on a scheme\u2019s list of approved medication (its formulary);\n\n* Incorrect diagnostic codes that resulted in a failure to identify a claim as one for a PMB service;\n\n* Payments from medical savings accounts; and\n\n* Disputes over the use of a DSP.\n\nFor the first time in the council\u2019s 13-year history, in 2012 the number of complaints received during the year fell, by 200 to 5 915, the report says.\n\nGantsho says this is a result of members\u2019 growing awareness of their rights and an improvement in schemes\u2019 complaint-resolution processes.\n\nThe council resolved 212 complaints about suspension and termination of membership.\n\nThe annual report says that prospective members often fail to make a full disclosure about their state of health and are admitted to a scheme without the imposition of a waiting period. However, soon after joining, they claim for a condition and the failure to disclose is detected. Schemes are then entitled to terminate membership.\n\nThe annual report states that, in some cases, schemes \u201cgot it wrong\u201d and terminated membership without any proof of the existence of conditions which justified disclosure, or proof of the diagnosis or treatment of the condition in the year before application.\n\nGEMS TRUSTEES WERE PAID R6.5 MILLION IN 2012\n\nThe trustees of the Government Employees Medical Scheme (Gems) are the highest-paid trustees in the medical schemes industry, according to the Council for Medical Schemes\u2019s latest annual report.\n\nThe report shows that Gems\u2019 12 trustees earned R6.5 million in 2012 \u2013 an average of R545 000 a trustee for the year. One Gems trustee has chosen not to be paid, so the actual amounts earned by the 11 other trustees could be higher than the average.\n\nAccording to the annual report, Fedhealth Medical Scheme paid the second-highest amount to its trustees last year: R3.5 million to 11 trustees, or an average of R323 000 a trustee.\n\nIn terms of payments made per trustee, Spectramed had the second-highest average: R441 000 a trustee for each of its six trustees. In 2012, its total payment was R2.6 million.\n\nDiscovery Health Medical Scheme made the third-highest average payment: R402 000 a trustee. Its total payment to its seven trustees was R2.8 million in 2012.\n\nOther medical schemes that were among those that paid high amounts to their trustees in 2012 are:\n\n* Liberty Medical Scheme: R3.3 million to its board of 10 trustees, or an average of R334 000 a trustee;\n\n* Bestmed Medical Scheme: R2.9 million to its board of 18 trustees, or an average of R163 000 a trustee;\n\n* Medshield Medical Scheme: R2.8 million to its 17 trustees, or an average of R168 000 a trustee;\n\n* LA Health Medical Scheme: R2.4 million to its 18 trustees, or an average of R134 000 a trustee;\n\n* Profmed: R2 million to its 13 trustees, or an average of R160 000 a trustee; and\n\n* Medihelp: R1.9 million to its seven-member board of trustees, or an average of R275 000 a trustee.\n\nDr Guni Goolab, principal officer of Gems, says that, of the scheme\u2019s 12 trustees, four are government employees, three are pensioners and five are professional trustees.\n\nOne of the government employees has chosen not to be paid, Goolab says. The other trustees are paid R14 533 a day and are accorded 18 hours for attending meetings and for the time required to prepare for meetings. Trustees attend between 30 and 35 meetings a year, he says.\n\nThe daily rate of R14 533 was determined in a benchmarking exercise that considered the remuneration of the trustees of the 10 largest medical schemes in South Africa and the 10 highest amounts paid to trustees, Goolab says.\n\nMike van der Nest, chairperson of Discovery Health Medical Scheme, says that the fees paid to the scheme\u2019s trustees are determined by a remuneration committee, benchmarked by auditors and put to members at the scheme\u2019s annual general meeting.\n\nThe fees include a meeting component and a basic component for holding discussions with other trustees, he says. Trustees serve on various sub-committees and attend multiple meetings throughout the year.\n\nVan der Nest says that being a trustee of a large and complex scheme such as Discovery Health is a demanding task, with some trustees attending to scheme business daily.\n\nDr Monwabisi Gantsho, Registrar of Medical Schemes, says the Council for Medical Schemes has decided to engage experts over the next financial year to study the factors that affect the remuneration of trustees.\n\nThe experts will be asked to draft guidelines for schemes on how they should determine trustee remuneration, and schemes that do not abide by these guidelines will be expected to explain to the council why they have deviated from them.\n\nThe Council for Medical Schemes is also scrutinising the remuneration of principal officers, because some are earning \u201cextremely high\u201d salaries \u2013 in some cases, in excess of R4 million a year. Bonitas\u2019s principal officer earned R4.8 million in 2012, Bestmed\u2019s earned R4.3 million and Discovery Health\u2019s earned R4 million.\n\nGantsho says that principal officers should not earn salaries that are on a par with those of chief executives of listed companies, because medical schemes are non-profit organisations.\n\nVITAL SIGNS\n\n* Medical schemes\u2019 operating surpluses bolstered their solvency ratios by a slim 0.3 percent in 2012, to an overall average of 32.6 percent. Schemes are required by law to hold reserves equal to 25 percent of member contributions \u2013 these reserves are referred to as their solvency ratio.\n\n* The average solvency ratio of the country\u2019s 25 open schemes increased by 1.4 percent in 2012, to 29.1 percent.\n\n* The average solvency ratio of the 67 restricted schemes decreased from 38.3 percent in 2011 to 37.4 percent in 2012.\n\n* There were 11 schemes with solvency ratios below 25 percent at the end of 2012.\n\n* One of the largest schemes with a solvency ratio well below 25 percent is the Government Employees Medical Scheme. Its solvency ratio declined from 8.6 percent at the end of 2011 to 7.9 percent at the end of last year. The scheme has 1.8 million members, and its rapid growth has affected its solvency ratio.\n\n* A large open scheme with a very low solvency ratio is Resolution Health (76 000 beneficiaries at the end of last year). Its solvency ratio declined from 9.1 percent at the end of 2011 to 6.1 percent at the end of last year.\n\n* Medical scheme beneficiaries increased by 1.8 percent, to 8.6 million at the end of 2012.\n\nWHERE ALL THE MONEY GOES\n\nMedical schemes spent R103.7 billion of your contributions (totalling R117.5 billion) on your healthcare benefits last year.\n\nSpending on healthcare benefits increased by 10.7 percent, up from R93.6 billion in 2011. The breakdown of the major spending is as follows:\n\n* R37.9 billion (36.7 percent) on private hospital services \u2013 an increase of 11.1 percent on 2011 expenditure;\n\n* R24 billion (23.3 percent) on medical specialists \u2013 an increase of 12.9 percent on what was spent in 2011;\n\n* R16.3 billion (15.8 percent) on medicines \u2013 7.8 percent more than 2011;\n\n* R7.9 billion, (7.7 percent) on supplementary and allied health professionals \u2013 an increase of 3.8 percent on 2011 expenditure.\n\n* R7.5 billion (7.2 percent) on general practitioners \u2013 9.2 percent more than 2011; and\n\n* R2.8 billion (2.7 percent) on dentists (excluding dental specialists) \u2013 an increase of 10.1 percent on 2011.\n\nIn addition to spending your contributions on healthcare benefits, medical schemes spent R13.1 billion on non-healthcare expenses. This was an increase of 8.1 percent, or R1 billion, on the amount spent in 2011.\n\nThe main components of non-healthcare expenses were:\n\n* Administration: R8.8 billion, which was 7.5 percent more than was spent in 2011;\n\n* Managed healthcare fees: R2.7 billion, which was 9.6 percent more than 2011;\n\n* Brokers\u2019 fees: R1.4 billion, up 4.3 percent from 2011; and\n\n* Bad debts: R189.7 million, up 81.2 percent from 2011.\n\nThe annual report notes that since 2005, when the Council for Medical Schemes started to apply more pressure on medical schemes to reduce their non-healthcare expenditure, there has been a gradual decline in non-healthcare costs in real terms (after adjusting for inflation).\n\nGraph: Increase in medical scheme contributions relative to income", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "description": "undefined", "og": {"url": "http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/medical-schemes-nasty-symptoms-hurt-members-1574415", "image": "http://classic.iol.co.za/polopoly_fs/pf-7sep-ad-cartoon-1-1.1574413!/image/702595394_gen/derivatives/box_600/702595394", "site_name": "IOL", "description": "undefined", "title": "Medical schemes\u2019 nasty symptoms hurt members | IOL"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "IOL", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "YmiNpvzQrHdqXOi__ytAIEQM_vjpAQvum7AZW5rs1xE", "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec6f\"", "article_summary": "The Council for Medical Schemes this week highlighted that medical schemes\u2019 vital signs are healthy, but there are still strong arguments that the industry needs \u201cmedical attention\u201d.\nDr Monwabisi Gantsho, Registrar of Medical Schemes, would not be drawn on which schemes\u2019 administrators are guilty of these practices.\nMedical schemes are obliged by law to pay PMB claims in full regardless of what your doctor or other healthcare provider charges.\nDr Monwabisi Gantsho, Registrar of Medical Schemes, says his office still believes that schemes should implement contribution increases above this level only if they have good reasons for doing so.\nDr Monwabisi Gantsho, Registrar of Medical Schemes, says the Council for Medical Schemes has decided to engage experts over the next financial year to study the factors that affect the remuneration of trustees."}
