Steve Scalise said no actual numbers on the amount of enrollees who were not covered before signing up for Obamacare have been released.\n\n\u201cJudgment day has arrived for President Obama\u2019s health care law, and yet the self-proclaimed \u2018most transparent administration\u2019 still hasn\u2019t released figures to the public showing how many enrollees have actually made a premium payment or were previously uninsured,\u201d said Scalise. \u201cPresident Obama has twisted and bent his health care law through more than 20 delays in an effort to minimize the political damage in an election year.\u201d\n\nAs the report cites, navigators said that excitement and enrollment had \u201cdefinitely increased\u201d in the past few days. Just in Louisiana, as of March 1st, 45,561 Louisianians enrolled in Obamacare. From that amount, only 29 percent were in the age bracket of 18-34.\n\nThis age group, which is set to subsidize the older and unhealthy, has been the Obama administration\u2019s target audience from the get-go, with President Obama promoting the program through a Funny or Die video with Zach Galifianakis.\n\nHowever, as of March 1st, only a quarter of Obamacare\u2019s enrollees were 18-34 year-olds.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "In a report by the Associated Press, Louisiana\u00a0Obamacare \"navigators\"\u00a0point out that last minute enrollment for the healthcare overhaul program was plagued with website troubles, causing navigators to sign-up potential enrollees via the telephone which...", "title": "Obamacare Website Still An Issue On Final Enrollment Day", "url": "http://thehayride.com/2014/04/obamacare-website-still-an-issue-on-final-enrollment-day/", "image": "http://thehayride.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Healthcare.gov-website-down-150x150.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Louisiana, Millenials, obama, Obamacare, obamacare enrollment, President Obama, Steve Scalise, young people, Zach Galifianakis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a47\"", "article_summary": "Tinh Bui, one of four staffers involved in the signup effort, said website troubles prompted the staff to sign up applicants by telephone last week and Monday.\nThis age group, which is set to subsidize the older and unhealthy, has been the Obama administration\u2019s target audience from the get-go, with President Obama promoting the program through a Funny or Die video with Zach Galifianakis.\nIn a report by the Associated Press, Louisiana Obamacare \u201cnavigators\u201d point out that last minute enrollment for the healthcare overhaul program was plagued with website troubles, causing navigators to sign-up potential enrollees via the telephone which sometimes meant spending up to one to two hours just to sign-up one enrollee.\nJust in Louisiana, as of March 1st, 45,561 Louisianians enrolled in Obamacare.\nIn a news release, U.S. Rep.
