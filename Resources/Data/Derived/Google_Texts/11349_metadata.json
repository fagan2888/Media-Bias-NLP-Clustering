The confluence of these events and election season demagoguery is generating fear and outrage.\n\nIn the midst of these national struggles, many families are preparing for a more personal religious fight: going to church on Christmas. Americans increasingly don\u2019t identify with a religion, with significant generational differences.\n\nThe Pew Research Center reported this year that 35% of millennials \u2013 those born between 1981 and 1996 \u2013 are religious \u201cnones.\u201d Many young people may darken a church door only to placate their parents on Christmas and Easter.\n\nThese disparate trends are related to the same phenomenon: cultural change.\n\nThe old and the new\n\n\n\nJim Urquhart/REUTERS\n\nReligious extremists want to roll back the clock on modernity to recreate a time when moral choices were simple and Old World values predominated. In contrast, old institutional forms are not resonating with millennials\u2019 postmodern mentality.\n\nFundamentalists\u2019 reaction to modernity is predictable. They are threatened by individualism, the upending of traditional values and gradual decimation of institutions that have historically maintained moral order. What is novel in the fundamentalists\u2019 response is that they use modern technology to promote their regressive morality.\n\nFor the millennial generation, the same technology expands rather than contracts their horizons. As I argue in my book Finding Faith, tradition means little to them. They pick and choose among various options, including the array of religions and forms of spirituality.\n\nThe common denominator of fundamentalism and millennial individualism is \u201cover-choice.\u201d For the former, choice is a threat. For the latter, it is an opportunity for self-expression.\n\nA threat from two sides\n\nFor many Americans, both cultural trends bring fear.\n\nHomegrown terrorism seems like a greater threat when anyone, in any religious tradition, can be radicalized via the internet. And many grandparents fret over how younger generations will find meaning, morality and even eternal salvation without religion.\n\nAs a grandparent myself, I understand this fear, but as a scholar of religion, I\u2019m quite positive about our future. To borrow a phrase from business and economics, mainstream religion is in a period of \u201ccreative destruction.\u201c It may be falling apart, but contemporary culture also offers the opportunity for religion to renew itself.\n\nOne needs only to look around at the gray heads in most churches and synagogues to realize that in a generation, these institutions will be nearly empty. Yes, megachurches with hip pastors and contemporary music will continue to draw an audience, but such tribal gatherings and collective rituals can feel shallow and empty. Megachurches, too, are seeing young adults\u2019 interest and regular attendance wane.\n\nFundamentally, the old Christian cosmology \u2013 God sending a son to redeem the world; a God who is all-powerful and yet seemingly impotent in the face of mass violence \u2013 simply doesn\u2019t work for many educated young adults. The idea of being \u201cspiritual but not religious\u201d oversimplifies people\u2019s understanding of spirituality, but it also signals the possibility that the human spirit quests for something deeper than the latest technological gadget.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Could spiritual practices like feeding the homeless and fighting injustice take the place of traditional religion?", "title": "Religion\u2019s \u201ccreative destruction\u201d: Millennials, the new religious \u201cnones,\u201d are experimenting with new forms and rituals", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Could spiritual practices like feeding the homeless and fighting injustice take the place of traditional religion?", "title": "Religion\u2019s \u201ccreative destruction\u201d: Millennials, the new religious \u201cnones,\u201d are experimenting with new forms and rituals", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/25/celebrating_christmas_in_an_age_of_extremism_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/church_angels.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Could spiritual practices like feeding the homeless and fighting injustice take the place of traditional religion?", "title": "Religion\u2019s \u201ccreative destruction\u201d: Millennials, the new religious \u201cnones,\u201d are experimenting with new forms and rituals", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/church_angels.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Donald E.
