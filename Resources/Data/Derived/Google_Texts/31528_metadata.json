Top people.\n\nWASHINGTON, May 17, 2016 \u2014 In an act of self-parody, America\u2019s \u201cnewspaper of record,\u201d the New York Times, ran the headline, \u201cLittle is off limits as Donald Trump plans attacks on Hillary Clinton\u2019s character.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton enabled husband Bill\u2019s sexual assaults, instigating after-the-fact intimidation campaigns against his traumatized victims. Her deals with foreign governments and corporations as Secretary of State enriched herself, her husband and the family foundation. The Times might ask whether she has sufficient character to attack.\n\nThe Times says Trump \u201cintends to portray Mrs. Clinton as fundamentally corrupt, invoking everything from her cattle futures trades in the late 1970s to the federal investigation into her email practices.\u201d\n\nWhy Bill Clinton will not lead Hillary\u2019s economic agenda\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward told a convention of the National Association of Realtors, \u201cWe have 20 people working on Trump, we\u2019re going to do a book, we\u2019re doing articles about every phase of his life.\u201d\n\nAppearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Woodward assured host Chris Wallace that an \u201cequivalent effort will be made on Hillary Clinton \u2026 And I think, particularly in this campaign, which is one of those pivot points in the history of the country, we need to tell people everything we can find out. That means a massive effort.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Post was dedicating equal manpower to the effort, Woodward backpedaled a bit. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not necessarily the number of people, it\u2019s whose working on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s smarter people on Hillary?\u201d asked Wallace through his laughter.\n\nWoodward looked into the camera and affected a tone of deep sincerity. \u201cBelieve me, the goal here is the best obtainable version of the truth \u2026 As we know, biography is character.\u201d\n\nAs Marxist literary critic Walter Benjamin said, \u201cHistory is written by the victors.\u201d\n\nIn 1922, before the USSR was formally established, Russian commissars established the Chief Administration for the Preservation of State Secrets in the Press.\n\n\u201cIts function was \u2018to effect political, ideological, military and economic control of all kinds over printed works, manuscripts, photographs, pictures, etc.\u2019,\u201d writes Arup Banerji in his book, \u201cWriting History in the Soviet Union: Making the Past Work.\u201d\n\nWhen the Soviet program to collectivize agriculture began in earnest in the early 1930s, resulting in the famine-genocide in Ukraine, the word \u201cstarvation\u201d was banned from reporting by state censors.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nAs Obamacare\u2014called the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d by the irony-free members of our press\u2014causes insurance premiums to rise and insurers to leave state exchanges rather than face bankruptcy, President Obama\u2019s failure is heralded by the Boston Globe as \u201can unheralded success.\u201d\n\nThe program is an unpopular albatross around the neck of working Americans. So the Globe says, the Democratic Party\u2019s signature accomplishment \u201cis playing an increasingly critical role in reducing inequality \u2026 Immigrants saw the sharpest rise in [Obamacare] coverage.\u201d\n\nIf you have recently crossed our southern border illegally, if your offspring have been designated \u201cdreamers\u201d by the Obama administration, if you have never paid taxes in support of the American welfare system whose benefits you now enjoy, the wealth-redistributive powers of Obamacare are there for you.\n\nIf you are an American citizen, you\u2019ve more likely had your truly affordable healthcare plan cancelled. Obamacare has reduced your work status to part-time, and the zero-growth Obama economy ensures that the next generation of Americans is worse off than the previous one, something new in America.\n\nAs Woodward said, this presidential campaign is \u201cone of those pivot points in the history of the country.\u201d And the mainstream media would like to fill your head with their version of the truth concerning illegal immigration and Hillary Clinton\u2019s biography.\n\nTrump and Cruz: Shifting America\u2019s politics\n\nShortly after announcing his intension to seek the Republican presidential nomination, Trump was interviewed by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper.\n\nCooper presented Trump with a manufactured poll showing him losing to his GOP primary rivals. \u201cThe people don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Trump told Cooper, leaning into him, \u201cAnd the people don\u2019t trust the media \u2026 I find that fifty to seventy percent of the political media is really, really dishonest.\u201d\n\nTrump was right.\n\nMichael Lynch, professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut, expressed his and the mainstream media\u2019s worries in a New York Times op-ed. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s willingness to be inconsistent\u2014even in a single interview, or the same speech\u2014has baffled political strategists for months. Even more puzzling is his followers\u2019 happy toleration of it \u2026 But how could this be? After all, other candidates are seemingly held to different standards, by their supporters and others. They are held responsible for what they say.\u201d\n\nReally? Place this quote:\n\n\u201cI want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I\u2019m going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never. These allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people.\u201d\n\nNow this one:\n\n\u201cThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We\u2019ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We\u2019ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we [the U.S. government] had nothing to do with.\u201d\n\nBoth statements were lies. Who held the Clintons responsible?\n\nCharacter, as Bob Woodward said, \u201cis biography.\u201d But America\u2019s media class is as corrupt as the Clintons.\n\nNews is geared to fit the prejudices, fantasies and outright fabrications of the Democratic Party. As MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, a chief Obamacare architect noted, \u201cBasically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter, or whatever, that was really, really critical to get this thing [Obamacare] to pass.\u201d\n\nMedia lies are designed to foster and expand that stupidity.\n\nThere is some good news for Trump, though. The Associated Press said of a Media Insight Project Survey, \u201cTrust in the news media is being eroded by perceptions of inaccuracy and bias \u2026 Just 6 percent of people say they have a lot of confidence in the media, putting the news industry about equal to Congress \u2026 In this presidential campaign year, Democrats were more likely to trust the news media than Republicans and independents.\u201d\n\nThe media can no longer count on stupid Americans to carry Hillary into the Oval Office, and Donald Trump is about to give the nation an education on \u201ccorrupt Hillary\u2019s\u201d sordid character.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times says Trump plans to attack Hillary's character.
