What follows is the transcript for Episode 26, in which Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick sits down with the Los Angeles Times\u2019 David Savage to preview some of the first cases of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015\u201316 term. They include Fisher v. University of Texas, which takes on affirmative action in higher education; Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which challenges the right of public unions to collect mandatory fees from workers; and Evenwel v. Abbott, a case that could transform the meaning of \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d To learn more about Amicus, click here.\n\nWe\u2019re a little delayed in posting this episode\u2019s transcript\u2014apologies. This is a lightly edited transcript and may differ slightly from the edited podcast.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Hi, and welcome to Amicus, Slate\u2019s podcast about the U.S. Supreme Court. I\u2019m Dahlia Lithwick, Slate\u2019s Supreme Court correspondent. So, just about a year ago, we inaugurated this podcast with a podcast about the court term that was just then starting to get underway. Longtime Amicus listeners might remember that on that episode we talked to SCOTUS blog chief Tom Goldstein about, among other things, the court\u2019s apparent decision not to take up same-sex marriage in the 2014 term.\n\nThat means he has covered the confirmation of all nine currently sitting justices. He\u2019s also one of the savviest court watchers out there. David, welcome to Amicus.\n\nDavid Savage: Good to speak with you, Dahlia.\n\nLithwick: So, I wonder if you\u2019d do one second of precatory service journalism, David. We get a ton of emails from people who ask how it is that the court gets thousands of cases that are appealed up to the court, and yet they only hear 70-some cases a year. Can you explain to us how the court decides which cases to take?\n\nSavage: Well, they\u2019re interested in resolving legal questions, situations where the law is a mess. Judges in California say the federal law means one thing, judges in New York say it means something else. That\u2019s why we have the Supreme Court, to resolve those disputes. So, they don\u2019t go looking for cases so much as they go looking for big, unresolved legal questions. If you approach it that way, you could look through 1,000 appeals, and there\u2019s only a limited number that really raise a question where the law is uncertain where they need to step in.\n\nSo, that\u2019s why they sort of go through a whole lot of them to find just those questions they want to answer.\n\nLithwick: So, David, I want to start by asking you a thematic question if I could, which is, a lot of the conventional wisdom around last term, which was generally really good for the liberal bloc in important ways.\n\nGay marriage, Obamacare, and some other big wins on the left. Significant losses on the right in some sense. But this year is going to be just flaming torches and arrows. It\u2019s going to be really bad for the left. And that was best characterized by a recent article by Jeff Toobin, who more or less said, \u201cBuckle your seatbelts, folks, because this 2015 term that\u2019s coming up is going to really, really decimate core areas of the law for liberals.\u201d\n\nDo you have thoughts on that as a theme of the upcoming term?\n\nSavage: Well, I didn\u2019t agree with the conventional theme, I think, which is that last term was a lot of big wins for the left. And let me explain what I mean. I think the gay marriage case was a huge victory for the left. But most of the other cases where situations where the conservatives pressed an issue.\n\nFor example, we should basically overturn Obamacare based on this one provision in the law. This was a fairly extreme proposition when it first came up, and it moved quickly, and the court took it. In the end, there weren\u2019t the five votes to knock out that part of Obamacare, but it kept the law exactly where it was. This was a status quo decision. There were quite a few of those cases where the conservatives pressed an issue and they lost.\n\nBut the law didn\u2019t move to the left. It was a status quo decision. Now we\u2019ve got the same thing coming up in the new term, which is the conservatives are pressing the issue of knocking out college affirmative action. They\u2019ve got their case from Texas to test that. The conservatives are pressing an issue to sort of change\u2014in a big way\u2014how voting districts are designed, to move away from the total population back to only eligible American citizen voters.\n\nThey\u2019re pressing the issue of, we should knock out mandatory fees for union employees because they violate the free speech rights of dissident teachers. In all three cases, it\u2019s the conservative bloc of the court that\u2019s pushing that issue. So, I think a lot of liberals are right to say, uh oh, beware. This could be a series of really big conservative wins. The conservatives are setting the agenda here.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know is whether it\u2019ll be a repeat of last year, where the conservatives fall one vote short. If they fall one vote short, we\u2019ll be writing in the spring and say, oh boy, big liberal victories. But they will be the kind of liberal victories that basically keep the law exactly where it was.\n\nLithwick: Well, let\u2019s unpack affirmative action a little bit, because this is indeed a case that the court has looked at before, that has garnered an enormous amount of public interest, David.\n\nA lot of folks say the court is taking it to kind of finish the job. So, can you describe a little bit the Fisher case, how it came to the court, and how it\u2019s come back.\n\nSavage: Well, sure. The truth is that there\u2019s a conservative activist, Ed Blum, who\u2019s been interested in pressing this issue. When the 2003 Supreme Court Michigan case basically said, \u201cYes, universities, you may consider race as one factor in admissions.\u201d\n\nThe University of Texas, which had suspended its affirmative action, began again. They started considering race for some applicants. Ed Blum went in search of a plaintiff to sue. He found this young woman named Ms. Fisher who was a good, but not great, student at a school in East Texas. She didn\u2019t get into UT\u2013Austin. She went to LSU and graduated. Nonetheless, he filed a lawsuit on her behalf.\n\nIt became Fisher v. the University of Texas. Basically the complaint was she was suing because her race may have been used against her when she was applying, because the university admitted it considered race. We thought, as you said, that that was going to be the big five to four decision that knocks out college affirmative action. And two years ago, the court essentially\u2014after having the case the whole year\u2014punted.\n\nAnthony Kennedy wrote a very strange opinion that basically said to the appeals court, \u201cGo back and take another look at this. You should only use race as a last resort. Take another look at it.\u201d The appeals court took another look at it and decided the same thing. They upheld the University of Texas plan and said, gee, if it was OK for the University of Michigan to do this, you told us in 2003, it\u2019s OK for the University of Texas to take race into account. Now, the court, having seen it for the second time, has granted it again.\n\nAnd you tell me, Dahlia. What do they do now?\n\nLithwick: Well, it\u2019s tough, right? Nothing functionally has changed in two years. Anthony Kennedy, as you said, held it off for another day. Now I think he\u2019s got to contend with it. And it\u2019s probably worth flagging for listeners, David, that the difference between the 2003 Michigan case where the court upheld an affirmative action program is Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, right?\n\nShe leaves the court, Sam Alito comes on the court. O\u2019Connor herself was pretty ambivalent about affirmative action, but she felt that we weren\u2019t there yet as a society, that we needed a little bit more time to use affirmative action programs to help level the playing field. And when she left the court, that was a crucial vote, correct?\n\nSavage: Oh, absolutely. Justice Kennedy never had exactly the same views that he did. He dissented in every affirmative action case.\n\nThat\u2019s why we were very confident, we thought, that they were going to do something more two years ago. You know, it\u2019s possible, Dahlia, that Kennedy was unwilling to flatly overturn O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in the Michigan case. He tried to write around it and couldn\u2019t figure out a way to do it. And now the question is back again. Do they overturn- essentially overturn what O\u2019Connor said and say, \u201cNo, universities, you may not use race as an admissions factor.\u201d\n\nI should say there\u2019s also a possibility. When we looked at Texas before, it\u2019s got a very odd situation. They have this top 10 percent law, which says if you are a top graduate of any high school in Texas, including a relatively poor high school in the Rio Grande valley or in the center city of Houston, you can get in to the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nAnd they actually do fairly well on admitting particularly Latino, and to some degree, African American students. I always thought it\u2019s possible that Kennedy might say, if you\u2019re a state university and you\u2019ve found a way to bring a significant amount of diversity to your entering class without using race explicitly, then you may not use race at all.\n\nLithwick: David, does it change anything that Kennedy wrote that fairly surprising opinion at the end of last term about the Fair Housing Act, where he suddenly seemed to have a kind of a solicitude for the idea that we do have unconscious biases, that racism still profoundly infects the way we allocate resources? I\u2019m wondering A, if that decision from Kennedy surprised you, and B, if you think it informs in any way his thinking about Fisher as it comes up.\n\nSavage: Yes, and maybe. Yes, it surprised me. I think you\u2019re very smart to point out that, to say, hey, maybe there\u2019s at least some sign that Anthony Kennedy is sort of shifting to the middle. In a year of Ferguson, and all the police shootings, and all the focus on race in the criminal justice system, is it possible that Anthony Kennedy is sort of thinking, well, wait a minute, there really is a race problem in this country? And do I want to be the person to say I\u2019m going to close the door to at least considering race in colleges and universities?\n\nSo, yes. I think if I were one of the conservative lawyers in this case, I would be very concerned that what he wrote last year in the housing case is that Kennedy may be rethinking his view on what should we say about race in the area of colleges and universities. So, I think this case is a very hard one to gauge as to what they\u2019re doing.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the thinking was in 2013. And now, I have less confidence of thinking what the court is going to do about this case in the year ahead.\n\nLithwick: One little detour for gossip, David. Joan Biskupic reported last year, in her big book about Sotomayor, that Sotomayor wrote a draft opinion in Fisher that she circulated but then actually didn\u2019t publish that would have been a dissenting opinion that turned out to be that sort of cri de coeur in the Michigan affirmative action case.\n\nNot the Michigan affirmative action case from 2003, the recent one where she talked deeply personally about what it is to be a minority and to have not been given the benefit of the doubt. Do you have any reason to believe A, that Sotomayor\u2019s presence on the bench has somehow shaped the way the other Justices think and talk about race, and that B, that may be part of the reason that the court is having a tough time with Fisher?\n\nSavage: Yes, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s had some effect. I mean, I think Joan is right. That may explain why Kennedy didn\u2019t press ahead with the opinion that he thought he was going to write in the Fisher case two years ago. Let me say, on the other side of the case, I think the hard thing for the liberal advocates of affirmative goes to the difference of Sonya from the Bronx and what I would call Sonya from Scarsdale.\n\nSonya from the Bronx, she personifies why affirmative action seemed like a necessary and good thing. She grew up in the Bronx, relatively poor, struggling family, and she was a good student. And why wouldn\u2019t Princeton or any university say, this is the kind of young woman, Puerto Rican heritage, that we would want to open the doors to.\n\nShe excelled as a student at Princeton and Yale. But fast forward to 2015. What if she were Sonya from Scarsdale? Because Texas faces the situation that a lot of the minority students who get good SAT scores come from professional and upper middle income families, let\u2019s say in the Dallas or Houston suburbs. And the question is, does the university need to give those students an affirmative advantage in admissions because they want to increase the number of Latino or African American students?\n\nI think that argument is harder to make. Because you\u2019re talking about students who are not from the background of Sonya from the Bronx. They\u2019re not the kids who grew up in poor neighborhoods and whose parents did not go to college, but that they\u2019re from middle class families.\n\nLet\u2019s pivot for a minute, David, and talk about another big, big case that the court has agreed to hear that has to do with public sector unions, and first amendment, and speech. Friedrichs is a case that, again, the court has teed this issue up in the past\u2014has practically invited this case to come back. Can you tell us what it\u2019s about?\n\nSavage: Yes. This is a really conservative agenda item case. Which was back in the seventies, the court came up with a sort of compromise for public employee unions.\n\nAnd it went like this: that in Detroit and other cities, we\u2019re going to say that all the teachers may organize and have a union. We\u2019re going to say that those teachers who do not want to belong to the union may not be required to pay dues to pay for politics and lobbying to make it a sort of political organization. But they must pay a fee to pay their fair share of the cost of collective bargaining and sort of grievances.\n\nThey must pay the sort of basic cost, because otherwise you have the sort of free rider problem, is that if I were one of those teachers, I\u2019d benefit from the bargain and I\u2019d also have somebody to represent me in grievances, but I wouldn\u2019t be paying anything. So, the compromise is all public sector union employees, where there is a union, must pay this fee.\n\nSo, the court said that in 1977, a case called Abood. And so, fast forward to the more recent era when conservatives like Scott Walker in Wisconsin and other Republican governors are going after public sector unions and saying these collective deals have been bad for the people of this state. We\u2019re going to do what we can to undercut the public sector unions. The Supreme Court, in a couple cases, all of which Sam Alito have written, where he\u2019s basically said, wait a minute, doesn\u2019t this seem to violate the free speech rights?\n\nIf you\u2019re a dissenting employee, you don\u2019t want to be part of this union. Nonetheless, your money is taken to help fund this union. Doesn\u2019t that put you in a position of the government is forcing you to support a cause you don\u2019t want to support? So, he said that a couple times, suggesting that there is a first amendment problem. And lo and behold, one of the conservative filed a lawsuit in California challenging the union fees that California teachers must pay.\n\nThey lost in the lower court. They lost in the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit said, wait a minute, the Supreme Court resolved this 40 years ago. The Supreme Court has now granted that case. The question is, does it violate the first amendment to require public employees who are part of unions, but don\u2019t want to be part of the union, to pay a fair share fee to support the union?\n\nLithwick: And this is sort of like what we said about Fisher, insofar as the court recently had an opportunity, if they wanted to eviscerate Abood, that 1977 case, they could have done it only two years ago, and they didn\u2019t do it. So, is this sort of an example of that incrementalism that the Roberts court is famous for, where they almost do it one year and then a couple years later they come back and do it do it?\n\nSavage: Yes. But it\u2019s also an example of what we were just talking about with Fisher, is that there was a group of justices to push this issue, but they stopped just short of resolving it in a big way. So, the first case, Fisher, we don\u2019t know whether the five of them are going to unite and say no to affirmative action. We don\u2019t know whether five of them are going to unite in this case and say no forced fees. It was very unclear from the argument. Justice Scalia seemed to be the one who was most unwilling to take a big leap in this case.\n\nBecause he had written an opinion about twenty years ago in a case involving colleges, and saying the free rider argument makes sense. That the government is telling this union you have to represent everybody. Well then, why shouldn\u2019t everybody have to pay? So, we will know, again, in the spring whether there\u2019s five votes ready to make a big decision, or that there are four and one leaner and they can\u2019t get a fifth vote to actually decide the big issue.\n\nLithwick: Four and one leaner might actually become the name of Justice Kennedy\u2019s autobiography. I like that characterization. David, let\u2019s turn briefly, if we could, to this big existential question of what the definition of one person, one vote is. This is another big, big case that the court has in some ways invited, the conservative on the court, specifically in this case Clarence Thomas.\n\nCan you just briefly outline this other big, big challenge the court is going to hear?\n\nSavage: Yes. And I should mention again Ed Blum, because the same conservative activist who pushed the affirmative action case in Texas has for many years been interested in this issue that, I must say, Dahlia, I was completely unaware of until Blum started sending this issue up to the court. As you correctly said, Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion saying that he thought this was a good issue the court should take on.\n\nWhen state legislatures draw district lines for the state assembly, or the state senate, or for the congressional districts, basically under the one person, one vote rule, you have to get districts that are essentially of even size. You don\u2019t want one district to have 10,000 people and another district to have 1,000. Or whatever. You want them to be the same size so that all the votes have roughly the same share of power.\n\nWell, the numbers that states use to do that are the total population numbers. That is, the numbers that come in the U.S. census. But Ed Blum made the point is, wait a minute, if it\u2019s a one person, one vote rule, shouldn\u2019t you divide up the districts based on the number of actual or eligible voters. So, stop and think about that for a minute. What does that mean in California or Texas?\n\nWell, there are a lot of districts around Los Angeles and around Texas where a significant percentage of the population may be noncitizens and not eligible to vote, but they are counted as part of the total population. So, Blum says the way we\u2019re doing it now, the way Texas has been doing it, the way California is doing it, is essentially unconstitutional, because you\u2019re dividing up districts not based on the one person, one vote rule, but using the total population.\n\nLithwick: And it\u2019s worth pointing out, David, that this really was a huge surprise. That most of us thought of this as a kind of a thought experiment, some kind of cool law review proposition. But the idea that there are four justices willing to grant cert, and sit down, and grapple with what we thought was a fairly established principle of how we define one person, one vote in this country really is\u2014\n\nI think it can\u2019t be overstated. This was a big surprise.\n\nSavage: Yeah. It\u2019s the kind of thing that ordinary voters or ordinary people may not think about or be aware of. But it\u2019s really a part of the mathematics of power in most states. If the court were to buy this and say, no, you must use a tally of eligible voters, it shifts power in the state legislature\u2014and possibly in Congress\u2014away from districts with large percentages of Latinos and more towards a sort of white, Anglo conservative communities.\n\nIt would shift power because it would diminish the number of seats in a legislature in those areas that have large percentages of Hispanics.\n\nLithwick: This all comes up purely coincidentally against the backdrop of Donald Trump, right?\n\nWilling to talk in pretty inflammatory ways about the privileges of citizenship and his fears about noncitizens who live in this country. I wonder if the court is a little bit regretting having taken this case in light of the sort of subsequent conversation we\u2019re now having, which feels pretty toxic in ways that if, as you say, Justice Kennedy is affected by the national discourse around race.\n\nI wonder if the ways we\u2019re talking about immigrants right now is making the conservative bloc a little nervous about agreeing to take on this case.\n\nSavage: Well, I don\u2019t know Dahlia. If you mean Justice Kennedy, you may be right. He may be a little nervous. My guess is that some of them think there\u2019s a large group of people out there who sort of agree with us, that why should be giving congressional support to areas that basically just have a lot of illegal immigrants?\n\nLithwick: David, I want to ask you one last question that I suspect a lot of listeners are wondering. When the term wrapped up at the end of June, there was a lot of strong language, a lot of acrimonious, ugly dissents and opinions. The justices looked, at least to me, as though they were ready for a nap and a snack.\n\nIn some cases, it looked like it was personal. What do you think happens over the summer? Do the justices have sort of lingering grudges? Do they lie awake in their beds and say, man, I wish I\u2019d written, \u201cShut up!\u201d, instead of what I wrote. How do they get past some of the rancor that comes with the close of term and reboot themselves? Or, do they just not get past the rancor? Are they mad at each other as we lead up into these opening weeks of the term?\n\nSavage: Well, the truth is I don\u2019t know. I do know what they all say, is that when they go away for the summer and you come back, a little time passes. I don\u2019t know what your office is like or what my office has been like in the past, but different people have difficult situations with people in your office, and you go away for a vacation and you come back, and two months down the road you can\u2019t even remember to some degree. What is it we were arguing about?\n\nSo, I think there\u2019s some of that. That they can sort of move on and move on to the next case. They all say they like each other as sort of office friends. They\u2019re not true friends that they really go out of their way to see each other away from the office, but they\u2019re sort of office friends. They get along. I also think it differs by the people. For example, I actually think Sam Alito is somebody who more holds a grudge. There\u2019s sort of some bad feeling and it lingers on.\n\nI think some of the others are just more used to, oh, this is just part of\u2014Kennedy will say\u2014being on the court. Scalia can be really mean in his legal writing and comments, but then be exceedingly friendly. The famous example, of course, is Ruth Ginsburg. They are great friends, even though he writes very harsh things at times about her opinions. Scalia just has that view of the matter. I remember going to see him once after the\u2014\n\nYou remember the period where he was writing all those bad thing about Sandra O\u2019Connor, how her opinions are not to be taken seriously? And I said, \u201cYou were pretty hard on her. You really were.\u201d\n\nAnd he said, \u201cOh, you know how that is. You come out to the middle of the ring, you tap gloves, and you come out swinging.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think she sees it as a boxing match.\u201d But you know, his view is that\u2019s just the way the game is played. We\u2019re in the law business, so we fight over the law. But we\u2019re still friends, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how we get along personally.\n\nI think Scalia is a good example of it. A lot of them have their views. You know, we have our legal disagreements, but we go away and we come back and we can get along as friends. They know that there are some things they\u2019re never going to agree on. But my impression is they manage to, after two or three months, put that aside and start over again for another term.\n\nLithwick: Well then, I suppose we should all put our rancor aside as well and look forward to the opening of the 2015 term.\n\nDavid Savage has been covering the U.S. Supreme Court and legal issues around the court for the L.A.
