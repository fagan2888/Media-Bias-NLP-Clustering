regard to the importance of a historical 19th century Plymouth fort, according to English Heritage.\n\nPersimmon Homes has submitted design proposals to Plymouth City Council detailing what phase five of the planned Seaton neighbourhood will look like, along with drawings of houses and examples of landscaping.\n\nThe development will see 111 homes built north of Forder Valley and south of William Prance Road in Derriford.\n\nPlanning permission has already been granted but access, layout, scale, appearance and landscaping still need to be considered.\n\nEnglish Heritage, in a letter to the council, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the developer\u2019s designs did not take into consideration their advice issued back in January 2013 that the current landscaping plans would have a detrimental impact on Bowden Battery, a scheduled monument.\n\nBowden Battery is a well-preserved 19th century fort which formed part of the ring of Palmerston forts which protected the city and its naval dockyard during the second half of 1800s.\n\nIt provided interlocking defence with the neighbouring Crownhill Fort, Eggbuckland Keep and Fort Austin, with Bowden Battery particularly unusual given the survival of its entire glacis (an area kept free from visual obstructions to provide a clear field of fire for soldiers).\n\nEnglish Heritage said the views from the fort remain \u201clittle changed from the time the fort was operational,\u201d something the new landscaping of the Seaton development would threaten.\n\n\u201cThe application fails to assess the impacts of the development on the setting of the monument, and makes no real attempt to mitigate the harmful impacts of the development on this setting,\u201d wrote Keith Miller, inspector of ancient monuments.\n\n\u201cThe good survival of the fort and its glacis, within its original landscape setting, makes it a highly important survival in a regional and national context.\u201d\n\nMr Miller advised that trees should be planted around the border of the development to help hide the view of the houses when looking out from the fort.\n\nPersimmon has agreed, as part of its section 106 agreement, that 22 per cent of the phase five homes will be affordable housing.\n\nIt has also confirmed it will make a number of payments when 100 homes are occupied, including a car club contribution of \u00a3125,000, an investment of \u00a325,000 in public transport infrastructure and give another \u00a375,000 towards creating a better bus service.\n\nA \u201cfirst strategic transport contribution\u201d of \u00a32million will be issued along with a local highway network improvement contribution of \u00a3300,000 and air quality contribution of \u00a34,195.\n\nIt is also due to shell out more than \u00a3700,000 within six months of the development work starting.\n\nIt will include a first residential travel pass contribution of \u00a328,500, bus lane enforcement worth \u00a325,000 and an education contribution of \u00a3731,561.\n\nThe Seaton neighbourhood plans will see 873 dwellings built in total.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DESIGNS for more than 100 houses and their landscaping give scant regard
