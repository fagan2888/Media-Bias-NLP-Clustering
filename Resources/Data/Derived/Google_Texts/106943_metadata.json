Previous studies on obesity\u2019s effect on Hispanic women's risk for breast cancer had been small and inconsistent. For example, a study published in 2010 found that there was no link between breast cancer and obesity among Mexican-American women.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known this for a long time for white women, but now we are seeing this also in Hispanic women,\u201d said Esther John, a senior research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California and author of the study, in a press release. In addition, she added that \u201cbreast cancer appears to have different risk factors in younger versus older women, but by far, breast cancer is more common among postmenopausal women.\u201d\n\nThe second study was led by epidemiologist Dr. Elisa V. Bandera of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Bandera and her research team analyzed obesity\u2019s link to different hormone-receptor types among some 15,000 African-American women. They found that being overweight was associated with a 31 percent increase of ER positive tumors in postmenopausal African-American women.\n\nBreast cancer isn\u2019t a single disease; in fact, there are many different ways to classify it. As a result, certain people are more likely to be affected by different subtypes; and each subtype has its own risk factors. \u201cWe know that breast cancer has several subtypes and there is growing evidence that these subtypes have different risk factors,\u201d Bandera said in the press release. \u201cThe distribution of these subtypes and risk factors are different for African-Americans and Hispanics compared to white women.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Breast Cancer Fund, the \u201cdiagnostic and prognostic descriptions of subtypes of breast cancer have become increasingly sophisticated over the past decades.\u201d There are three main groups that help doctors define breast cancer subtypes: understanding the site of the tumor\u2019s origin (ductal or lobular cancer); whether the tumor is contained within the walls of the ducts or lobes; and the \u201creproductive status\u201d of the women, or whether they\u2019re pre-menopausal or post-menopausal.\n\nThough more research will be needed to fully grasp how obesity may increase the risk of cancer, it\u2019s enough for now to know that eating healthy and maintaining a normal weight is one of your best prevention strategies for pretty much any chronic disease out there, including cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), other research has discovered links between obesity and cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, endometrium, kidney, thyroid, and gallbladder, among others. One 2007 study out of the NCI estimated that around 34,000 new cases of cancer in males (four percent) and 50,500 in women (seven percent) could be attributed to obesity.\n\n\u201cThis has huge implications for not just Hispanics but all women,\u201d John said. \u201cWe cannot change genetics or family history, but we can do something about obesity. You can eat less, choose healthier foods and do more physical activity\u2026 And it\u2019s important for not just lowering breast cancer risk but for many other diseases.\u201d\n\nSources: John E, Sangaramoorthy M, Hines L, Stern M, Baumgartner K, Giuliano A. \u201cOverall and abdominal adiposity and premenopausal breast cancer risk among Hispanic women: The Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.\u201d Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, 2014.\n\nJohn E, Sangaramoorthy M, Hines L, Stern M, Baumgartner K, Giuliano A. \u201cBody size throughout adult life influences postmenopausal breast cancer risk among Hispanic women: The Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.\u201d Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obesity, breast cancer, hispanic-american, african-american", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study finds a link between being overweight and a heightened risk of developing certain types of breast cancer among black and Hispanic women.", "title": "Obese Hispanics, Blacks May Be At Risk Of Breast Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obesity-may-increase-risk-breast-cancer-african-americans-hispanics-308816", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/01/obesity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study finds a link between being overweight and a heightened risk of developing certain types of breast cancer among black and Hispanic women.", "title": "Obese Hispanics, Blacks May Be At Risk Of Breast Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obesity-may-increase-risk-breast-cancer-african-americans-hispanics-308816", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/01/obesity.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/01/obesity.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-01T13:00:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T13:00:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study finds a link between being overweight and a heightened risk of developing certain types of breast cancer among black and Hispanic women."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe415a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOverall and abdominal adiposity and premenopausal breast cancer risk among Hispanic women: The Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.\u201d Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, 2014.\n\u201cBody size throughout adult life influences postmenopausal breast cancer risk among Hispanic women: The Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.\u201d Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, 2014.\nTwo new studies find that obesity can increase the risk of particular types of breast cancer in African-American and Hispanic women, especially if they are postmenopausal.\nPrevious studies on obesity\u2019s effect on Hispanic women's risk for breast cancer had been small and inconsistent.\nFor example, a study published in 2010 found that there was no link between breast cancer and obesity among Mexican-American women."}
