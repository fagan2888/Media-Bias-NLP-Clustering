The problem with the recent reports on Republicans failing to show up for congressional hearings is that they’re the equivalent of a ticky-tack foul in sports: it matters, but only in an inconsequential way. Sure, it’s annoying that Republicans made committee attendance a key part of their 2014 campaign message , but at the end of the day, it’s tough to get worked up over this.

But lawmakers who specifically call for a hearing, requesting certain information, and then fail to show up, that’s a very different kind of story. Andrew Kaczynski had this interesting piece yesterday.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is expected to announce that he is running for president Monday, skipped a series of hearings in the aftermath of Osama Bin Laden’s death, including a specific hearing Rubio had called for on talk radio days before he skipped it.
