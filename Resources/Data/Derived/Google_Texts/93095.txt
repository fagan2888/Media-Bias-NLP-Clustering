U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is making a rare foray into a state-level race, helping to make the closing argument for Bryan Hughes in his bid for the Texas Senate.

The former presidential candidate has recorded a call urging voters to cast ballots for Hughes in the Tuesday runoff for Senate District 1, where Hughes is vying with fellow state Rep. David Simpson to replace retiring Sen. Kevin Eltife of Tyler.

"Bryan Hughes is a conservative fighter we can count on," Cruz says in the 30-second call, which was obtained by The Texas Tribune. "He's filed legislation to kick Obamacare out of Texas, and he is the only candidate in this race that voted for Gov. [Greg] Abbott's plan to double border security."

Cruz has largely stayed out of legislative primaries and other contests at the state level this cycle. He has long been viewed as supportive of Hughes in the race to replace Eltife, though the call marks his first formal effort to boost Hughes.

Hughes was among the first state lawmakers to endorse Cruz for president, doing so at a rally for Cruz in September in Tyler. Simpson ended up never formally supporting Cruz's bid for the White House.

Simpson did not immediately return a request for comment.
