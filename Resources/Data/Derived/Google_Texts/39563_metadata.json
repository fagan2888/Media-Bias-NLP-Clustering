She launched her 2000 campaign for the Senate with a purposely low-key \u201clistening tour.\u201d As a senator, she cultivated a reputation as a workhorse who eschewed high-profile media appearances for the mundane work of writing legislation. Throughout, she staked out a place as a familiar kind of Democrat \u2014 a little more liberal on social issues, a little more conservative on foreign policy and national security \u2014 but nobody\u2019s idea of an ideologically transformative figure.\n\nBut now that she\u2019s making her second run for the White House, is Hillary Clinton becoming the Candidate of Big Ideas?\n\nIt\u2019s starting to look that way. When yesterday she proposed national automatic voter registration \u2014 registering all Americans to vote when they turn 18 unless they opt out \u2014 it surprised everyone. While universal registration isn\u2019t an idea no one had thought of before, Clinton took a Democratic priority (expanding voting rights and boosting turnout) and advanced it with an ambitious, national plan that went beyond what most prominent Democrats had advocated before.\n\nWe saw something similar on immigration, where Clinton didn\u2019t just support the Obama administration\u2019s position on immigration but went beyond it, proposing that the parents of \u201cDREAMers\u201d be allowed to stay in the country legally. She also called for an end to the \u201cera of mass incarceration,\u201d an era her husband had no small part in creating. She has signaled an intention to go bold in the area of campaign finance, floating the idea of a Constitutional amendment to get so-called \u201cdark money\u201d out of politics (though she has not gone so far as to make formal proposal).\n\nThis kind of thing is surprising coming from Clinton, given that she\u2019s the likely nominee of the incumbent party. Usually, a candidate in that position will propose a program that sounds like, \u201cLet\u2019s continue what we\u2019ve been doing, but a little better.\u201d Generally it\u2019s the opposition party, which has had eight years to contemplate everything they dislike about current government policy, that\u2019s more prone to come up with dramatic ideas for change. Not only that, the candidate pushing Big Ideas is often one struggling in the polls who is looking for a way to distinguish himself from the pack. You might expect some dramatic policy proposals from some of the lower-tiered Republican candidates.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, could easily ride to the Democratic nomination without putting out a single policy paper. But for now she\u2019s taking a very different course. As a media strategy, it\u2019s very effective: the less-than-threatening nature of her primary opposition gives her the freedom to put out big ideas and get attention for them; after a temporary drought of campaign activity, she can get plenty of coverage for a speech that includes a significant policy proposal.\n\nTo be sure, we shouldn\u2019t exaggerate the extent to which the Clinton campaign is focused on big ideas. We\u2019re only talking about a few so far, and there are other topics like the Trans-Pacific Partnership on which she\u2019s been vague. Part of the explanation for Clinton\u2019s previous cautious approach lies in the failure of Bill Clinton\u2019s health care overhaul, which she ran during the early days of his presidency \u2014 and which would have been a much more radical change than the Affordable Care Act. Supposedly, the lesson she learned from that experience was that people fear change, and when you propose something too sweeping it\u2019s difficult to succeed and easy to get burned.\n\nBut it\u2019s starting to look as if Clinton has decided that being the candidate of big ideas might be a pretty good plan. Particularly when the ideas themselves are likely to be popular.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She may be breaking with her past reputation for caution.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "She may be breaking with her past reputation for caution.", "title": "Is Hillary Clinton becoming the candidate of big ideas?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/25/National-Politics/Images/2015-03-23T155744Z_01_WAS210_RTRIDSP_3_USA-CLINTON-ECONOMY.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "But now that she\u2019s making her second run for the White House, is Hillary Clinton becoming the Candidate of Big Ideas?\nBut it\u2019s starting to look as if Clinton has decided that being the candidate of big ideas might be a pretty good plan.\nTo be sure, we shouldn\u2019t exaggerate the extent to which the Clinton campaign is focused on big ideas.\nNot only that, the candidate pushing Big Ideas is often one struggling in the polls who is looking for a way to distinguish himself from the pack.\nHillary Clinton has long been known as a cautious politician who leaned more toward methodical plodding than grand gestures."}
