Gov. Chris Christie agreed to an expansion up to 138 percent of the poverty line, which amounts to $15,856 for a single person. Castro said many unemployed young people who live with their parents are eligible for the program without realizing it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best kept secrets in the state,\u201d Castro said.\n\nBeyond that, Castro advises residents to choose plans that may cost more but provide richer benefits -- both in terms of lower cost-sharing after premiums have been paid and in having wide provider networks.\n\n\u201cYou never know when you need insurance,\u201d Castro said. He said healthcare policy advocates have begun to refer to a \u201cbronze trap,\u201d in which residents choose a lower-premium plan -- known as bronze plans. The out-of-pocket cost sharing may be so high that these residents decide against visiting their doctors when they\u2019re ill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any easy answer, except to really understand what it is you\u2019re buying,\u201d Castro said. Federal subsidies can be estimated through the Kaiser Family Foundation calculator.\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, AmeriHealth New Jersey, and Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey are the three companies offering insurance through the marketplace. Despite the limited number of companies, consumers have a variety of choices to make, both in terms of health plans and in the amount they are willing to pay for premiums.\n\nOther than a limited number of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans, which are only available to residents younger than 30 and those who can\u2019t afford more expensive plans, each health plan is categorized by the amount of cost sharing that residents can expect to pay once they\u2019ve paid their premiums. Plans labeled \u201cplatinum\u201d require residents to pay 10 percent of these costs, while \u201cgold\u201d require 20 percent, silver 30 percent, and bronze 40 percent. Bronze plans have the lowest premiums, while platinum plans have the highest.\n\nFor example, a 27-year-old Middlesex County resident has a choice of 26 \u201cmetallic\u201d plans, as well as two catastrophic plans that are only available to residents younger than 30 and those who can\u2019t afford more expensive plans.\n\nThe hypothetical 27-year-old\u2019s options among the non-catastrophic plans range in monthly premiums from the AmeriHealth New Jersey Tier 1 Advantage Bronze EPO Health Savings Account plan, costing $229.56, to AmeriHealth\u2019s Select National Access Platinum POS+ plan, costing $478.01.\n\nA childless couple in which both spouses are 40 years old would also have a choice of the same 26 non-catastrophic plans, with the premium ranging from $559.88 to $1,165.82.\n\nMost residents will be eligible for tax credits to offset these costs. They are available for residents with incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty line, which currently amounts to between $11,490 and $45,960 for a single person and between $15,510 and $62,040 for a couple. The premium tax credits would substantially lower their costs.\n\nBut the differences in out-of-pocket cost sharing through deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance are serious. Deductibles are the amount of medical bills that must be paid before insurance coverage starts, while copayments are fees charged for individual visits to healthcare providers. Coinsurance is the percentage of expenses charged to patients once their deductible has been reached.\n\nThe lowest-premium plan would require the 27-year-old to pay $2,500 in medical costs before meeting his or her annual deductible. After that, the policyholder would be required to pay 50 percent of additional coinsurance costs, up to the annual cap of $6,350 set by the ACA. The 40-year-old couple would have to pay a $4,700 deductible on the lowest-premium plan, then 50 percent of costs up to the annual cap of $12,700.\n\nHowever, the highest-premium plans require no deductible, with the insurer covering most costs other than copayments for visits to healthcare providers.\n\nLow-income residents will also receive assistance for this out-of-pocket expense, up to a maximum of 250 percent of the poverty line, which currently amounts to $28,725 for a single person.\n\nBoth Horizon and AmeriHealth offer plans with lower premiums, in which roughly half of the state\u2019s hospitals are \u201cTier 1\u201d providers. While residents will pay less to go to those hospitals, the other hospitals will be much more expensive.\n\nNew Jersey Hospital Association spokeswoman Kerry McKean Kelly said the association was concerned about some plans that don\u2019t include enough hospitals in their \u201cTier 1,\u201d which offer less-expensive care to residents.\n\nThe NJHA advises residents to \u201ccarefully research their options and truly understand what their coverage will \u2013 and will not \u2013 pay for,\u201d McKean Kelly said. \u201cObviously, the lowest premium will attract your attention first. But consumers have to weigh those upfront premium costs with the out-of-pocket expenses that they may incur down the line, especially if they are hit with a serious illness.\u201d\n\nOfficials with both Horizon and AmeriHealth said they have employees available to help residents choose the right plans for them. They also said they are working to make sure that residents know what benefits are available through their plans, so they won\u2019t be surprised by expenses later.\n\n\u201cThe best thing consumers can do is educate themselves on how health insurance protects them from large medical bills,\u201d Horizon spokesman Thomas Vincz said. \u201cA good way to start is to look back over the last few years at what they have spent on healthcare and what they can afford to pay for health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nVincz said Horizon asked all of its network hospitals to participate in Tier 1. Having different tiers is based on research showing that consumers would accept narrower networks in exchange for lower premiums.\n\nCynthia Jay, marketing and strategic outreach director for Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey, has noted that while her company\u2019s plans have somewhat higher premiums, they also offer comprehensive benefits at a wider range of hospitals.\n\nThose helping residents make their insurance decisions have been trying to learn more about the options that are available. They include the organizations that have been awarded federal funding to serve as \u201cnavigators\u201d for residents, as well as federal qualified health centers, which serve as primary care providers for low-income residents.\n\nEva Turbiner, president and CEO of the Zufall Health Center in Dover, oversees a staff that includes workers who have been certified to provide counseling to residents completing insurance applications for the marketplace. Her organization is a federally qualified health center, serving Hunterdon, Morris, Sussex and Warren counties.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that most of them are simply going to go by (premium) price because affordability is a huge deal,\u201d Turbiner said. She expects that younger patients will be particularly focused on premiums, while older patients will look to make sure that their doctors are included in the plan\u2019s provider networks.\n\nTurbiner said that the number of choices for patients will make it particular difficult to sort through all of the pros and cons.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, although we had hoped to see more competition in New Jersey, the lesser number of choices makes selection a little bit easier,\u201d she said.\n\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said residents who currently have individual insurance plans might want to check to see if their plans are up for renewal before January 1. If they are pleased with their current plans, they can renew them for a year, putting off the challenge of sorting through the new options. However, that choice likely only makes sense for residents who aren\u2019t eligible for subsidies, Schwimmer added.\n\nSchwimmer said that each individual must weigh his or her individual situation before deciding which plan to purchase.\n\n\u201cMost people are going to look at price, price, and price and that\u2019s because if you can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Schwimmer said. \u201cBut you also want to look at cost-sharing because that can be quite high.\u201d\n\nThis year, residents will have to work within the constraints of the premium, cost-sharing, and provider network information made available through the marketplace and insurer websites. But the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute -- a nonprofit that works to ensure quality, safety, accountability and cost containment in healthcare \u2013 would like to see more information made public in the future about the quality of care of the providers included in the insurers\u2019 networks.\n\n\u201cWe definitely want to see more transparency around quality and cost so that people can make informed decisions,\u201d Schwimmer said.\n\nAnother factor that could shape the residents\u2019 insurance marketplace decisions in future years is the increased emphasis on paying for more coordinated care through arrangements like accountable care organizations, in which some payments depend on providers lowering costs while increasing the measured quality of care.\n\nFor now, the insurers are more focused on driving down costs through the traditional model of negotiating lower fees with providers, which pay for each individual healthcare service they deliver.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/13/1022/2100"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "Three insurers offer different provider networks, cost sharing through marketplace healthcare coverage", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8448\"", "article_summary": "Plans labeled \u201cplatinum\u201d require residents to pay 10 percent of these costs, while \u201cgold\u201d require 20 percent, silver 30 percent, and bronze 40 percent.\nNew Jersey residents looking to buy health insurance through the federal marketplace or exchange may focus on the monthly premiums, but healthcare experts say it may pay to weigh other factors.\n\u201cThe best thing consumers can do is educate themselves on how health insurance protects them from large medical bills,\u201d Horizon spokesman Thomas Vincz said.\nDespite the limited number of companies, consumers have a variety of choices to make, both in terms of health plans and in the amount they are willing to pay for premiums.\nBronze plans have the lowest premiums, while platinum plans have the highest."}
