It opens Saturday at the High.\n\nThe centerpiece of the exhibition is 24 works by Cezanne, including 16 rarely exhibited watercolors.\n\nOne of the first paintings visitors see in the exhibition, Chaim Soutine\u2019s \u201cView of Ceret,\u201d in which a cityscape is hardly recognizable, was Henry Pearlman\u2019s first major acquisition made in 1945. In Pearlman\u2019s \u201cReminiscences of a Collector,\u201d which is printed in the exhibition\u2019s catalog, Pearlman writes that he would get a \u201clift\u201d when he saw that painting whenever he arrived home.\n\n\u201cThis first pleasant experience with a modern painting started me on a road of adventure that has been both exhilarating and satisfying. I haven\u2019t spent a boring evening since that first purchase,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPearlman, whose Eastern Cold Storage Company made significant contributions to marine shipbuilding during World War II, and his wife Rose went on to build an impressive collection that has been housed at the Princeton University Art Museum since 1976.\n\nThe collection includes works that are considered among the best by the respective artists, including van Gogh\u2019s \u201cTarascon Stagecoach,\u201d Modigliani\u2019s portrait of Jean Cocteau and Cezanne\u2019s \u201cMont Sainte-Victoire.\u201d But it also lacks anything by Pablo Picasso and others that would seem natural inclusions for a collection of works from that era.\n\n\u201cThere are relationships between things, but it\u2019s not a textbook collection,\u201d said High director of collections and exhibitions David Brenneman. \u201cIt\u2019s really Pearlman looking at things and drawing relationships.\u201d\n\nPearlman greatly admired Cezanne, and his collection includes works featuring familiar subjects for the artist - landscapes set in the countryside of Provence in southern France and still lifes of objects from his studio.\n\nSome of the oil paintings seem incomplete with patches of canvas showing through, and it\u2019s not clear whether Cezanne had reached a point at which he was satisfied or whether he meant to come back to the paintings later, Brenneman said. Graphite drawings provide the framework for the watercolors, with colors added in varying intensity and the bright white of the paper shining through in places.\n\nSoutine, the second most represented artist in the exhibition, is perhaps less familiar to the casual art consumer. But Brenneman said he hopes the exhibition will help expose more people to the works of the French expressionist who painted with thick strokes that leave markedly raised ridges of paint on the canvas.\n\nTo that end, the High borrowed five Soutine portraits from a private collection to supplement the seven other Soutine works included in the exhibition. Just as Soutine\u2019s landscapes verge on abstraction, his portraits nearly cross the line into caricature, Brenneman said.\n\nOther highlights of the exhibition include \u201cThe Sacred Grove\u201d by Toulouse-Lautrec, a parody of a classical scene by academic painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes that includes objects and people from Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s time, and carvings by Gauguin and Modigliani.\n\nThe exhibition runs through Jan. 11 at the High. Then it will be at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Vancouver, Canada, (Feb. 7-May 18) and will finish its tour at the Princeton University Art Museum (Sept. 12-Jan. 3, 2016). It previously was shown at museums in England and France.\n\n___\n\nIf You Go\u2026\n\nCEZANNE AND THE MODERN: Oct. 25 through Jan. 11 at the High Museum of Art, 1280 Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta; http://www.high.org, 404-733-5000.
