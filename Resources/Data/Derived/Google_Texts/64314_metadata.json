Gazprom officials said the project will be partly financed by a $25 billion pre-payment from China, but that would still leave $30 billion to be found, with half of it to be provided by the state.\n\nSuch a sum would represent about 3.5% of all budgetary spending this year and, given the Finance Ministry\u2019s tight budgetary policy, it is difficult to see how the budget can bear such a cost.\n\nMr. Putin hinted, however, at the possibility of using the country\u2019s foreign exchange and gold reserves which, at $466 billion, are the fourth-largest in the world.\n\n\u201cIn the modern world, endless increases in gold and foreign exchange reserves hold some risks as well,\u201d he said, adding that investment in the Chinese project will be profitable in the long run.\n\nAnalysts are not impressed by the idea of increasing Gazprom\u2019s charter capital, since it may dilute existing shareholders\u2019 stakes.\n\nMoscow-based UralSib said project financing from Chinese companies would have been preferable, since that would have reduced the large capital expenditure that analysts have long criticized Gazprom for.", "article_metadata": {"article.template":
