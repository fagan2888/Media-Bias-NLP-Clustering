"Red Eye's Andy Levy on News, Satire, and Political Correctness": Produced by Anthony L. Fisher. Camera by Jim Epstein with help from Brett Crudgington. About 9 and a half minutes.

Original release date was April 28, 2015 and the original writeup is below.

"To me, the best shows are when you're mixing it up...everything is more interesting when there's disagreement," says Andy Levy, co-host of Fox News Channel's Red Eye, which was described by the New Yorker as "an odd and often funny late-night show that is not exactly satire, and not exactly anything else, either."

Over the show's eight years (and counting), Levy's role has evolved from being the show's ombudsman, where he would humorously take panelists to task for errors and exaggerations, to being a full-time panelist and occasional guest host. He is beloved by fans of the show for his sardonic contrarian takes, his hilarious takedowns of both Chris Brown and Stephen Colbert, and despite his self-avowed libertarian streak, his refusal to be pigeon-holed into tribalist thinking.

Levy spoke with Reason TV's Anthony L. Fisher about Red Eye's unique place in the news and comedy worlds, the diverse politics of the show's panelists, guests that go "too far," and how the show will continue to evolve now that original Red Eye host Greg Gutfeld has left to host his own weekend show on Fox News Channel.
