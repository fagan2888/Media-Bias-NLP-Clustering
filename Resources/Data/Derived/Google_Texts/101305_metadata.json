This is a problem we\u2019ve been experiencing for a while.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 mayoral election consisted of a 26.9 percent turnout, the highest turnout since 2003 according to the Houston Chronicle. Although this spike may have been attributed to the interest in the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, the turnout itself was low.\n\nPolitical science professor Cyrus Contractor said political participation is needed at every level of government.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Houston and local politics, I always bring up the importance that politics happen outside of D.C. as well,\u201d Contractor said. \u201cGovernance, governments, elections and policies don\u2019t just take place in those buildings in D.C. but everywhere across the nation. People need good government and good governance. Either we don\u2019t see those things as being political, or we are too focused on D.C., if we are focused on politics at all.\u201d\n\nFor local elections ranging from state elections and inward, Sorurbakhsh believes there should be a much higher turnout because of its proximity to the people it serves.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have an election that does not fall on a presidential election year, turnout is going to be low,\u201d Sorurbakhsh said. \u201cSo much of our attention is on national politics \u2014 particularly from the media \u2014 that we feel that these elections are the most important or salient. However, the truth is that the outcomes of local elections matter more in terms of our everyday lives than national elections.\u201d\n\nFor presidential elections, the U.S. Census Bureau shows that on average less than half of eligible young adult voters actually make it to their district\u2019s poll site, with factors ranging from lack of access to transportation to refusing to vote.\n\nThere are high stakes for young voters to cast their vote because government is confronted with issues directly concerning the youth, according to the Annette Strauss Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\u201cSomething that is important to remember about the democratic process is that it takes place based upon who participates, and it doesn\u2019t make special exceptions for those who don\u2019t,\u201d said John McDonald, doctoral candidate in political science. \u201cA benefit of young people participating in elections is that it gives them the chance to familiarize themselves with some of the issues, and after wrestling with those issues for some time, (it) can enable them to become responsible voters.\u201d\n\nFor Student Government President Shaun Theriot-Smith, the second factor for student apathy toward elections is regarding the difference in generations\u2019 declaration of political ideology.\n\n\u201cI think students and young folks tend to see primaries as an older institution,\u201d Theriot-Smith said. \u201cMany students don\u2019t explicitly identify as a Democratic or Republican or (as a) specific party, and many tend to opt-out participating in parties all together. So, they see primary voting as an institutional them versus us, red versus blue.\u201d\n\nA third factor is transportation. Theriot-Smith believes because of the lack of transportation and the strict guidelines workplaces have for requesting time off, voters become unmotivated to go through the obstacles of voting in primary elections.\n\n\u201cThere are people throughout the world who don\u2019t have the right to self-govern, which is akin to saying that they don\u2019t have the right to create the world in which they are a part (of),\u201d McDonald said. \u201cLiving in a country based on the principles of self-governance is a wonderful opportunity that should not be taken lightly. That is why it is important for voters, young and old alike, to truly wrestle with the political issues of our time so that our democracy not only continues, but flourishes.\u201d\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Primary registration ended Monday and many young students do not even bother with the ballot - a trend that has continued for years.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Primary registration ended Monday and many young students do not even bother with the ballot - a trend that has continued for years.", "title": "Student apathy toward elections: why millennials aren't voting", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Favicon500x500.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T20:25:36+00:00", "url": "http://thedailycougar.com/2016/02/03/student-apathy-toward-elections-millennials-arent-voting/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Primary registration ended Monday and many young students do not even bother with the ballot - a trend that has continued for years.", "title": "Student apathy toward elections: why millennials aren't voting", "image": {"src": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Favicon500x500.png"}, "creator": "@thedailycougar", "site": "@thedailycougar", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 37502686}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thedailycougar", "section": "News", "tag": "voting", "published_time": "2016-02-03T05:00:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T20:25:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02ad\"", "article_summary": "Student apathy toward elections: why millennials aren\u2019t votingEncouraging young adults to cast their vote has been a debated topic since 1962, according to USA Today.\n\u201cWhen it comes to Houston and local politics, I always bring up the importance that politics happen outside of D.C. as well,\u201d Contractor said.\n\u201cGovernance, governments, elections and policies don\u2019t just take place in those buildings in D.C. but everywhere across the nation.\n\u201cLooking at voter turnout trends, however, you can see that in the past few election cycles, turnout has stabilized (for millenials) right around 58 percent for presidential elections and 30 to 33 percent for congressional elections.\n\u201cA benefit of young people participating in elections is that it gives them the chance to familiarize themselves with some of the issues, and after wrestling with those issues for some time, (it) can enable them to become responsible voters.\u201dFor Student Government President Shaun Theriot-Smith, the second factor for student apathy toward elections is regarding the difference in generations\u2019 declaration of political ideology."}
