Alabama and Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama, parties are challenging the legality of \u201cpacking\u201d minority voters into districts where they already are in political control, reducing their impact elsewhere.\n\nAs summarized by SCOTUSblog:\n\nBoth [cases] challenge decisions by a federal district court that upheld (by a split two-to-one vote) a new boundary map that kept the same number of state senate and state house districts that previously had majorities of African-American voters, but added to those majorities in almost every district. Sponsors of the plan insisted they were doing so to obey their obligations to protect minority voters\u2019 political strength under federal voting rights law, but the challengers argued that this was an unconstitutional use of racial gerrymandering.\n\nIn both the Alabama cases and the case pending here (Dickson v. Rucho), state lawmakers have argued that the Voting Rights Act required them to redraw districts and pack African-American voters into districts \u2014 even though those voters, while still a minority of the voting age population in their previous districts, had been electing their candidates of choice.\n\nThe viability of that argument will be before the nation\u2019s highest court in the fall, and yesterday \u2014 in a friend-of-the-court brief filed there \u2014 attorneys for the parties challenging the North Carolina maps urged the justices to reject redistricting on that basis as \u201can unconstitutional use of race that must be corrected.\u201d\n\nHere is an excerpt from that brief:\n\nThis Court reiterated in Bartlett v. Strickland the well-established principle that the \u201c\u2018moral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal Protection Clause,\u2019 and racial classifications are permitted only \u2018as a last resort.\u2019\u201d The Court further cautioned that \u201c[o]ur holding also should not be interpreted to entrench majority-minority districts by statutory command, for that, too, could pose constitutional concerns.\u201d The North Carolina legislature, like the Alabama legislature, misapplied these principles in the 2011 redistricting by imposing a racial proportionality target for the number of majority-black districts and requiring every district to meet a specific black population percentage target. As in Alabama, the North Carolina General Assembly believed that these fixed racial targets were required by the Voting Rights Act. Ignoring decades of progress in increasing opportunities for black voters to participate in the political process, in 2011 the General Assembly created more majority-black districts than ever before, thereby entrenching racial stereotypes and tearing apart effective cross-racial coalitions that had evolved over time. The General Assembly\u2019s use of racial targets in redistricting was justified only by the mistaken belief that they were required by federal law. In addition to North Carolina and Alabama, there is only one other redistricting case, currently pending in Virginia, in which it is alleged that the Legislature admittedly and explicitly used racial targets in drawing districts. Thus, what is needed here is not a revision of voting rights jurisprudence; nor will reversal of the trial court result in significant upheaval of redistricting maps throughout jurisdictions formerly covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Rather, the misinterpretation of the Voting Rights Act\u2019s requirements resulting in the unfair imposition of racial targets in redistricting in a few states is an unconstitutional use of race that must be corrected.\n\nRead the full brief here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0a6\"", "article_summary": "As in Alabama, the North Carolina General Assembly believed that these fixed racial targets were required by the Voting Rights Act.\nAs the case challenging North Carolina\u2019s 2011 redistricting plan languishes in state Supreme Court, two similar cases out of Alabama that may bear directly on the legality of our state maps are set for argument in the U.S. Supreme Court this fall.\nThus, what is needed here is not a revision of voting rights jurisprudence; nor will reversal of the trial court result in significant upheaval of redistricting maps throughout jurisdictions formerly covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s use of racial targets in redistricting was justified only by the mistaken belief that they were required by federal law.\nRather, the misinterpretation of the Voting Rights Act\u2019s requirements resulting in the unfair imposition of racial targets in redistricting in a few states is an unconstitutional use of race that must be corrected."}
