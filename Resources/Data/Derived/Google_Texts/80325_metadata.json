We gotta be urgent about these two years and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nOn the same day Obama continued a tour of red states \u2014 Idaho and Kansas \u2014 to promote his new policies, McDonough endorsed Clinton to carry the mantle.\n\nMcDonough said Clinton would be a \u201cvery good president\u201d who is \u201cunequivocally well prepared,\u201d \u201cabsolutely dogged,\u201d \u201cvery strategic\u201d and a \u201cdecent and caring\u201d person.\n\nMcDonough worked closely with Clinton during her four years as secretary of state under Obama.\n\nIn wide-ranging comments, McDonough revealed the context behind the White House\u2019s act-first strategy in the aftermath of Democrats suffering dramatic defeats in last year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n>>>Emboldened Liberals are \u2018Still Full of Hope\u2019 After Obama Charts Aggressive State of the Union\n\nThe morning after the midterms, Obama walked into the Roosevelt Room of the White House with a self-assured message.\n\n\u201cHe looked at it as the start of a new period,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Look, I am a competitive person. We have a clear opportunity to show our ideas work.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn traveling to red states this week after the State of the Union, Obama \u201cwants to make clear he believes the country is not as divided\u201d as some in Washington believe.\n\nOn his part, McDonough could not avoid politics altogether in his comments before a public audience.\n\nDenis Mcdonough speaks with @mikeallen at #PlaybookLunch. | Photo: Rodney Lamkey Jr. pic.twitter.com/KeGEoZKBDW \u2014 POLITICO Pro (@POLITICOPro) January 22, 2015\n\nBelow, The Daily Signal highlights some of McDonough\u2019s memorable thoughts on the news of the day.\n\n* McDonough weighed in on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s decision to act on his own to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak before Congress in March. The White House said today that Obama would not meet with Netanyahu during his visit because it doesn\u2019t want to interfere with Israel\u2019s March 17 elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of anger,\u201d McDonough said about Boehner not consulting with the White House before inviting Netanyahu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions. We have to make sure we approach this in a nonpartisan way. Our relationship with Israel is above partisan politics. That\u2019s the way we will continue to approach this.\u201d\n\n* McDonough reiterated the White House\u2019s opposition to an effort by Republican congressmen to enact additional sanctions against Iran. He said the Obama administration needs \u201ctime and space\u201d as they continue diplomatic negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.\n\n\u201cRather than apply added sanctions or have Congress insert itself as a decider on the deal, there ought to be space to make this deal permanent,\u201d McDonough said.\n\n* The White House chief of staff pointed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement as an area where some Democrats and the majority of Republicans could agree. McDonough also said he expects the White House to find common ground with Congress on cybersecurity and possibly corporate tax reform.\n\n* On a lighter note, McDonough shed some light on Obama\u2019s leadership style and work-life routine. Known as an avid reader of the news, Obama especially enjoys reading Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Tom Friedman of The New York Times on his iPad. McDonough says he rarely discovers interesting news that Obama hasn\u2019t already read about. But that doesn\u2019t mean Obama isn\u2019t open to other perspectives, McDonough said.\n\n\u201cThe president is already known as someone who wants to hear everybody in the room,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to a meeting with the president, you better be ready to say something because he will call on you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the wake of the State of the Union address, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough charted a \u201curgent\u201d and aggressive future for Democratic power.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In the wake of the State of the Union address, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough charted a \u201curgent\u201d and aggressive future for Democratic power.", "title": "White House Chief: Hillary Would Be a \u2018Very Good President\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo350878.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-23T14:07:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uzCpZC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In the wake of the State of the Union address, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough charted a \u201curgent\u201d and aggressive future for Democratic power.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo350878.jpg"}, "title": "White House Chief: Hillary Would Be a \u2018Very Good President\u2019", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "politics,president", "published_time": "2015-01-22T17:44:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T14:07:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "White House, State of the Union, Denis McDonough, POLITICO, John Boehner, Benjamin Netanyahu, Iran"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc84\"", "article_summary": "McDonough said Clinton would be a \u201cvery good president\u201d who is \u201cunequivocally well prepared,\u201d \u201cabsolutely dogged,\u201d \u201cvery strategic\u201d and a \u201cdecent and caring\u201d person.\nAfter declaring that the White House \u201cfeels quite good\u201d about the State of the Union, McDonough went on to hint that presumed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would be a fitting flagbearer of President Obama\u2019s progressive vision.\n* The White House chief of staff pointed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement as an area where some Democrats and the majority of Republicans could agree.\nMcDonough also said he expects the White House to find common ground with Congress on cybersecurity and possibly corporate tax reform.\n\u201cThe president is already known as someone who wants to hear everybody in the room,\u201d McDonough said."}
