MUNICH (AP) - Robert Lewandowski scored a late winner to give Bayern Munich a 1-0 victory over Real Madrid in the final of the preseason Audi Cup on Wednesday.

Douglas Costa sent in a free kick and Lewandowski steered the ball home from close range in the 88th minute. Both teams played without some top stars - Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo did not even come to Munich, while teammate Gareth Bale sat out the match.

A deflected shot from Thomas Mueller hit Madrid’s post in the first half and goalkeeper Keylor Navas made some key saves to deny Bayern a bigger margin of victory.

Earlier, Tottenham beats AC Milan 2-0 to take third place, courtesy of goals from Nacer Chadli in the eighth minute and Tom Carroll in the 71st.
