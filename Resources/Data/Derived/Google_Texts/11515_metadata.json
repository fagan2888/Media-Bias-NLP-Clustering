And those results \u2014 coming in the form of innovative treatments \u2014 fundamentally alter the lives of American patients each day. Because of the incredible potential to impact millions, we have devoted our careers to translational research in renal disease with the goal of helping patients.\n\nWhile largely out of the public eye, 26 million Americans suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD). And more than 636,000 of those have been diagnosed with CKD\u2019s final phase, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) \u2014 an irreversible condition, which is fatal without a kidney transplant or weekly dialysis treatments.\n\nFor decades, we have treated ESRD the same way. And while dialysis treatments can delay death, technological advancement has provided us with an opportunity to truly elevate quality of life for ESRD patients. Unfortunately, though, myriad hurdles continue to stymie progress \u2014 a burden levied on vulnerable patients and generations more to come.\n\nIn our work at Vanderbilt University and University of California, San Francisco, for instance, we have been engineering an implantable artificial kidney as a permanent solution to ESRD \u2014 essentially a bioengineered transplant organ to add to the very limited pool of donor organs that are available for transplant.\n\nYet, despite years of support from the FDA and National Institutes of Health (NIH), progress has slowed due to limited funding for kidney care research.\n\nUnfortunately, our story is not unique; it simply represents a growing trend in the renal research community. However, not only is it possible to overcome current shortfalls in kidney care innovation, the decision to support ESRD research makes sense for patients and our nation as a whole.\n\nConsider this: The Medicare ESRD program \u2014 which singularly provides coverage, regardless of age or income, to virtually every American with kidney failure \u2014 currently costs the government and taxpayers more than $34 billion each year. Our most powerful tool to bend the cost curve is medical research. However, we dedicate only $585 million in federal funds (a minuscule $30 per patient) for kidney-specific projects.\n\nAlong with unfunded and underfunded research endeavors, an unintended consequence of such funding levels is \u201cbrain drain\u201d in kidney disease and kidney failure research. Indeed, many of nephrology\u2019s brightest minds are shying away from careers in research and choosing other professions altogether or entering the more lucrative world of private practice \u2014 something we have personally witnessed among peers.\n\nScroll down to continue reading.\n\nShuvo Roy (Photo: Submitted)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a doctor to see the potential danger for those suffering kidney disease. Nor does it take an expert to realize that investing in research will spur incredible returns \u2014 not just for patients, but our nation\u2019s coffers.\n\nOne must only look at our nation\u2019s most prominent current research efforts. Robust investments in HIV, for instance, have effectively transformed the once fatal disease into a manageable chronic illness.\n\nLikewise, extensive efforts to understand and combat cancer have ensured better outcomes for patients, while slashing overall costs. Now it\u2019s time to offer similar devotion to kidney disease, which touches more lives than HIV and cancer combined.\n\nThe simplest solution is an outright increase in federal funding for kidney care research, which is something we certainly hope to see.\n\nHowever, especially in the wake of the financial crisis less than a decade ago, bolstering the efficiency of current kidney research efforts and advancing our understanding of kidney diseases is an attainable goal in the short-term. And it\u2019s one that proposed bipartisan legislation, \u201cThe Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act,\u201d sets out to achieve.\n\nSpecifically, the legislation would help assess the adequacy of funding and identify gaps in CKD federal research. Additionally, it would improve collaboration among research agencies and require the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to better understand the progression of kidney disease and treatment of kidney failure in minority populations.\n\nThe Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act is an important step toward a smart, necessary investment in kidney research.\n\nUltimately, it is imperative to close the gap between the sheer magnitude of kidney disease and scale of our nation\u2019s response. And if we wish to sustain the quality improvements we\u2019ve achieved in the past decade and elevate the quality of kidney care for future generations, medical research is the silver bullet.\n\nAt this very moment, the future of medical research rests in the hands of policymakers. Therefore, innovative policy may truly be our best chance for breakthroughs in kidney care and beyond.\n\nDr. William H.
