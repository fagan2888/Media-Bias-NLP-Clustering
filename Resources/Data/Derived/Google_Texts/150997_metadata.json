PLF\u2019s precedent-setting victories against CWA overreach, abuses, and misinterpretations include the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Rapanos v. United States, which prompted regulators to develop the new rule.\n\nStatement by PLF\u2019s Reed Hopper\n\n\u201cToday, the Corps and EPA released a new rule that would vastly \u2014 and illegally \u2014 expand federal regulatory power under the Clean Water Act through a practically open-ended new definition of the term, \u2018waters of the United States,\u2019\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney M. Reed Hopper. \u201cAlthough government officials claim the new rule does not enlarge their power over average Americans, and is consistent with Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Clean Water Act, this could not be further from the truth. In the 2006 case of Rapanos v. United States, for example, the Supreme Court held that the federal government could not regulate all \u2018tributaries\u2019 to navigable waterways, and reaffirmed that isolated water bodies are off-limits to federal regulators. But these are the very waters that the new rule purports to regulate.\n\n\n\n\u201cEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy claims the new rule will clarify which waters are regulated under the Clean Water Act without expanding the scope of the Act,\u201d added Hopper, who successfully argued the Rapanos case before the Supreme Court. \u201cBut in fact, the rule introduces even more vagueness and uncertainty into the regulatory scheme. It leaves all the previously ill-defined terms in place, like \u2018adjacent,\u2019 \u2018wetland,\u2019 and \u2018discharge,\u2019 while adding a handful of equally malleable terms such as \u2018floodplain,\u2019 \u2018tributary,\u2019 and \u2018significant nexus.\u2019 The new rule also provides that federal officials can decide on a case-by-case basis whether any \u2018other waters\u2019 should be regulated. This necessarily leads to unpredictable and subjective enforcement of the law.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll this vagueness gives federal officials the freedom to assert the broadest possible interpretation of their Clean Water Act jurisdiction, thereby fostering an environment of uncertainty that undermines economic growth,\u201d Hopper continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs for the Administrator\u2019s claim that the new rule does not broaden the scope of the Clean Water Act, that\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cTo the contrary, with its vagueness and nearly limitless definition of the waters that can be regulated, the rule continues the EPA\u2019s longtime agenda of an overly broad reading of its power. The EPA has a consistent history of exceeding its authority, especially under the Clean Water Act. In 2001, in the SWANCC case, and again in 2006, in the Rapanos case, the Supreme Court chastised EPA for precisely such overreaching.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to the regulators\u2019 claims, the new rule does not simply reassert federal authority over historically regulated waters,\u201d Hopper said. \u201cInstead, it expands the scope of the Clean Water Act to an unprecedented extent \u2014 violating both the terms of the Act and the Constitution\u2019s limits on federal authority, and undermining the rights and responsibilities of the states to control local land and water use.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnder this new rule, the only waters that are clearly not subject to federal regulatory power are the few that are exempted or expressly excluded from the Clean Water Act, including artificial reflective pools, ornamental waters, ground water, and gullies, non-wetland swales, and puddles,\u201d Hopper noted. \u201cIn the wake of this new rule, prudent lawyers would have to advise their clients that unless the waters or ditches on their land are exempt or expressly excluded under the letter of the Clean Water Act, they may be subject to federal regulation. This is hardly the \u2018increased clarity\u2019 that the EPA promised.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbout Pacific Legal Foundation\n\nDonor-supported PLF (www.pacificlegal.org) is a watchdog organization that litigates for limited government, property rights, individual rights, and a balanced approach to environmental regulations, in courts nationwide.
