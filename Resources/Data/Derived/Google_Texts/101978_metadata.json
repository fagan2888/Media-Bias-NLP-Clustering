The upcoming advertisement makes mention of Obamacare, but probably not in the way that many people would expect.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Get Screwed By Obamacare, Find A Sugar Daddy\u201d\n\nThe online dating website Seeking Arrangement is launching the new campaign in Dallas, targeting young and healthy women who are now set to pay higher health insurance premiums under the recently launched Affordable Care Act. The new law is projected to increase insurance prices by an average of 41 percent next year, the website states. They want to offer women a \u201csweeter\u201d plan.\n\nSeeking Arrangement suggests that women use their service to connect with a \u201csugar daddy\u201d who can offset some of the new healthcare related costs. The website has earned a reputation for urging female college students and single mothers to meet men who are willing to offer money and expensive gifts for companionship.\n\nSeeking Arrangement launched in 2006 and now boasts more than 2 million members.\n\nThe online dating website said that they have seen an 83 percent increase in \u201chealthcare\u201d being mentioned in their \u201csugar baby\u201d profile pages \u2014 the descriptions of those women looking for men \u2014 since the Affordable Care Act went into effect on October 1. This new trend sparked the ad campaign.\n\n\u201cYounger, healthy Americans are essentially subsidizing those who need healthcare more,\u201d said Seeking Arrangement founder and CEO Brandon Wade. \u201cWhile \u2018Obamacare\u2019 proves beneficial to those with pre-existing conditions, low-income and elderly, young adults are now required to pay for services that they rarely use. In response, we are proving that there exists other options to curb the increasing costs of healthcare.\u201d\n\nWade even took an opportunity to jab at the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online portal. \u201cUnlike \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 SeekingArrangement.com offers a fully functional website and realistic solutions in the form of generous benefactors,\u201d he said.\n\n(\u00a92013 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
