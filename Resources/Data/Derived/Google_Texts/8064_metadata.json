Gov. Tate Reeves is running for re-election in November. Reeves cites a balanced budget, efforts to cut taxes and increased school funding as his major accomplishments. (Photo: Submitted photo)\n\nMississippi voters will choose between incumbent Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and his recent Democratic-convert opponent Tim Johnson on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Reeves maintains his record over the past four years qualifies him for another term, Johnson, a former Republican state senator and county supervisor, said his own priorities as lieutenant governor are what Mississippi needs.\n\nReeves described campaigning as a different experience from his first go-round in 2011.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to voters about what we have done \u2014 about my record as lieutenant governor, about the fact that we\u2019ve truly balanced the budget for the first time in many, many years,\u201d Reeves explained.\n\nReeves highlighted a full rainy-day fund, increased education spending and his support of education reform efforts such as the Literacy-Based Promotion Act and the Mississippi Public Charter Schools Act of 2013, which led to Mississippi\u2019s first charter schools opening in Jackson this school year.\n\nReeves said if re-elected, he hopes to further improve the charter school law to allow students to attend charter schools outside their own school district.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be arbitrary lines separating the good schools and kids having access to them,\u201d Reeves said.\n\nReeves, who pushed for the elimination of the inventory tax on small businesses in the state, said he hopes to continue those efforts. The accomplishment he\u2019s most proud of, however, is the literacy law, also known as the third-grade reading gate.\n\nThe law requires third-graders to pass a reading test before being promoted to fourth grade.\n\n\u201cI was in Noxubee County a couple weeks ago, where the state funded a reading coach and a data coach for that school district, for those elementary kids. Their reading scores improved nearly 25 percent year over year \u2014 that\u2019s three times better than the state average,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cWe had positive results statewide, reading results improved 7 to 8 percent \u2026 Those kids have a chance now for long-term success.\u201d\n\nAsked where he stood on public school funding should Initiative 42 not pass, Reeves said he hopes to continue increasing spending for schools over the next four years.\n\n\u201cIn the most recently completed legislative session, we spent 57 percent of all new revenue on K-12 public schools,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd so if Initiative 42 does not pass \u2014 and I pray that it does not for the sake of our kids \u2014 if 42 does not pass, we hope to continue to significantly improve funding for public education but to do it in a responsible way that does not raise taxes, does not take money away from the good schools and that focuses on what\u2019s best for kids.\u201d\n\nReeves, who has drastically outraised his opponent, currently has $3.5 million campaign cash on hand, according to the most recent campaign filings. He\u2019s raised $1.6 million this year. In comparison, Johnson has raised about $207,300 this year.\n\nTim Johnson, Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, says his priorities to expand Medicaid, fully fund schools and improve infrastructure are what Mississippi needs. (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger)\n\nJohnson said his focus, if elected, will be on three priorities: expanding Medicaid, improving infrastructure and fully funding the Mississippi Adequate Education Program.\n\nJohnson switched from the Republican Party to Democratic Party earlier this year. He said his decision came after his 90-year-old mother had a stroke in Kosciusko. At the time, there were talks of shutting down Montfort Jones Memorial Hospital, the only hospital in Attala County.\n\nAlthough his mother was able to get care and recover, Johnson said it made him ask, \u201cWhat would\u2019ve happened if that hospital had been closed?\u201d\n\nHe began looking at how Medicaid expansion was handled by state officials. The Affordable Care Act would have allowed Mississippi to expand coverage to 333,000 people, but Mississippi did not do so.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The fact they would not allow those dollars to flow into Mississippi that could help our rural hospitals, protect our professional health-care providers and help our sick and elderly \u2014 it just didn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d Johnson said at an editorial board meeting of The Clarion-Ledger earlier this month.\n\nReeves has criticized Johnson\u2019s position on Medicaid as evidence of his alignment with the president, calling him \u201cout of tune with Mississippians.\u201d\n\nJohnson pointed to his experience as an alderman, county supervisor and state senator, which he says he would bring with him to the lieutenant governor\u2019s office. He said as a supervisor in Madison County, his main focus was infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe were able to build $69 million worth of new roads in Madison County,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure roads and bridges are safe in this state. I want to make sure more money flows into cities and counties. We need to invest in the future by building new roads.\u201d\n\nAsked about his party switch, he says he doesn\u2019t think of himself or his values in Republican/Democrat or conservative/liberal terms.\n\n\u201cI have Mississippi values. \u2026 I believe the Democratic Party offers people like me with a heart for public service the opportunity to serve, and that\u2019s what I want to do \u2014 serve,\u201d he explained.\n\nContact Kate Royals at (601) 360-4619 or kroyals@gannett.com.
