Brookdale was first.\n\nAces have installed, configured, secured, tested Domain Name Server, critical to Internet operation.\n\nHoliday Hacking: evaluated security of infrastructure controling weather at the North Pole.\n\nIt is no accident that there is a connection here to \u201cTop Gun,\u201d the iconic film about fighter pilots learning to excel in the wild blue yonder. While those post-Vietnam pilots reached new heights in the nation\u2019s efforts to keep foreign predators in check, there now is another generation of \u201caces\u201d hard at work at Brookdale Community College.\n\nThis new group also seeks to be the \u201cbest of the best\u201d at securing this country\u2019s ever fluid and expanding cyberborders, according to Professor Michael T. Qaissaunee, one of two volunteer instructors running the ground-breaking New Jersey Cyber Aces Academy at the Lincroft campus.\n\nIt is here that students \u2014 ranging in age from 17 to 56 \u2014 train as part of an elite inaugural class or \u201ccohort,\u201d a word chosen by organizers because it can mean \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201ccolleague\u201d or \u201cwarrior\u201d or \u201csoldier,\u201d and for the work they are training to do, any of those labels works just fine.\n\nCyberPatriots hail from Red Bank teacher\u2019s class\n\nThese soldiers likely will never hike through deserts or jungles with 50-pound packs on their backs; rather, they likely will keep suburbia safe from cyber threats without ever leaving those environs. It is a wireless war that is coming but one just as potentially devastating, experts said.\n\nIt began here with cyber buster Ed Skoudis of Wall, who has an international reputation and contracts with the military to train its elite cyber soldiers. Skoudis built a miniature city for soldiers in cyber training. In CyberCity, Skoudis can poison the water supply or cause haywire at Main Street financial institutions or go with one of the classics: aim a missile into the heart of downtown. He watches as soldiers armed with nothing more than an Internet connection and a keyboard save the community.\n\nHow critical is the work going on at Brookdale?\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned of a \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d in which enemies of the U.S. could derail passenger trains or planes, contaminate the water supply or mess with the power grid or financial system, with a few keystrokes.\n\n\u201cOur most important investment is in skilled cyber warriors needed to conduct operations in cyberspace,\u201d he said in 2012, kicking off a massive recruitment drive by the Pentagon.\n\nColin Mahns, 21, of Shrewsbury is one of those competitors who survived months of online applications to receive an invitation to the Cyber Aces competition where, curiously, he found his former teacher, Mandy Galante from Red Bank Regional High School, also competing. Both earned a place in the program.\n\n\u201cShe is sort of the reason I started this,\u201d said the student from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Now at Brookdale, he can expand upon those lessons.\n\nWith so much of the cyber world focused on the young, it is both ironic and heartening that one of the best students in the cohort also is the oldest. Jack Ratigan of Chatham was an out-of-work Navy veteran when he took the tests that led to the scholarship offer. His scores alone attracted interest among employers, he said, and he now works full-time for IBM in a job he loves.\n\nFunded through a two-year $300,000 National Science Foundation grant and the SANS Institute, the Cyber Aces Academy is public-private initiative that is the first of its kind anywhere in the nation and is meant to be a model for the program \u201cBuilding a Pipeline of Cyber Warriors Through Education and Competition Offered Through Community Colleges.\u201d\n\nSANS Institute Research Director Alan Paller has compared the shortage of skilled cyber warriors to the shortage of airplane pilots during World War II. That is why the Cyber Aces program focuses so much on what he has described as \u201cstick time,\u201d a reference to fighter pilots and their critical time in the air.\n\nIn 2012, Paller emailed Brookdale President Maureen Murphy, suggesting they team up to establish a community college program to develop a career pathway for cybersecurity professionals. By shifting the training of the cybersecurity workforce to the community college and focusing on hands-on skills, cybersecurity workers get out of the training pipeline faster and begin the job of protecting the country sooner, officials say.\n\nWith Skoudis, a SANS faculty member and internationally known trainer, author and editor of all things related to cyber defense, making his home in Wall, it was not rocket science to locate the inaugural program nearby. Skoudis is volunteering his time.\n\nSkoudis is the founder of Counter Hack, an innovative organization that designs, builds and operates popular information-security challenges and simulations. As director of the CyberCity project, Skoudis is an expert in hacker attacks and defenses, incident response and malware, which is hacker lingo for \u201cmalicious software\u201d or any program that disrupts computer operations.\n\n.\n\nSkoudis said the program soon would send 14 highly trained, highly motivated \u201ccyber warriors\u201d into jobs in government or private industry, where they will work on the front lines to detect or stop crippling cyber attacks in which, officials say, the average take by cyber criminals is $600,000.\n\nBy contrast, those who protect the nation\u2019s computer systems can expect to earn anywhere from $60,000 to $120,000 by the time they conclude the program, Skoudis said.\n\nThe shortage in such cybersecurity experts ranges from 10,000 to 30,000 and is likely going to grow worse, officials said. Headquartering the program at Brookdale \u2014 a college degree is not considered as essential for this work as hands-on experience \u2014 will make high-paying and secure jobs more readily available in the community, advocates said.\n\nCarol Gorga Williams: 732-643-4212; CGorgaWilliams@\n\napp.com.\n\nFor more information on Cyber Aces, go to http://sites.brookdalecc.edu/home/business-technology-division/nj-cyber-aces-academy/\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1tulraw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Brookdale students, aged 17 to 56, train as part of an elite inaugural class or \u201ccohort.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Brookdale students, aged 17 to 56, train as part of an elite inaugural class or \u201ccohort.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 cyber defense warriors train at Brookdale", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/22/best-best-cyber-defense-warriors-train-brookdale/14478539/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brookdale students, aged 17 to 56, train as part of an elite inaugural class or \u201ccohort.\u201d", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b38f25c04c241a085e1941b021125d638d28e9f5/c=848-0-4237-3389&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/08/22/3071214-cyberaces-1.jpg", "title": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 cyber defense warriors train at Brookdale", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f02\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Ed Skoudis, who works at the SANS Institute, leads a session of the Cyber Aces program at Brookdale Community College.\nFor more information on Cyber Aces, go to http://sites.brookdalecc.edu/home/business-technology-division/nj-cyber-aces-academy/Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1tulraw\n\u201cOur most important investment is in skilled cyber warriors needed to conduct operations in cyberspace,\u201d he said in 2012, kicking off a massive recruitment drive by the Pentagon.\nThat is why the Cyber Aces program focuses so much on what he has described as \u201cstick time,\u201d a reference to fighter pilots and their critical time in the air.\nIt began here with cyber buster Ed Skoudis of Wall, who has an international reputation and contracts with the military to train its elite cyber soldiers."}
