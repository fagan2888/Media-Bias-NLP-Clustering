Congress has been struggling for years to come up with a way to pay for a long-term extension, and they are likely to have to settle now for another temporary patch to prevent a transportation funding shutdown at month's end.\n\nThe traditional source for transportation funding is revenue collected by the federal gas tax, which is currently set at 18.4 cents per gallon. The federal government spends about $50 billion per year on roads, but the gas tax take only brings in $34 billion annually.\n\nCongress has turned to other areas of the federal budget to close the gap, and lawmakers on the Transportation Committee have said that the Ways and Means Committee will have to identify a set of offsets for the new highway bill before it can move forward.\n\nTransportation advocates complain that Congress has not passed an infrastructure measure that lasts longer than two years since 2005.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's Sargaent said Congress would be better off leaving transportation funding decisions to states and focusing on just a handful of projects that are \"truly national in scope and are federal priorities,\" however.\n\n\"STRR expands funding for bridges that are not part of the national highway system and thus should be taken care of by states and localities,\" he wrote. \"Rather than continue bailing out a broken system, congress should give itself the opportunity to enact real reforms that put states in the driver\u2019s seat and focus the federal role on projects of true national significance.\"\n\nTransportation advocates have resisted proposals from conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation to eliminate the federal gas tax, which are usually referred to as \"devolution,\" arguing that the federal government is best suited to handle transportation infrastructure that runs between states, like highways.\n\n\"A safe, efficient network of roads, bridges and public transit means that we spend less time in traffic, transportation costs for goods and services remain lower and more jobs are created throughout the economy,\" House Transportation and Infrastructure Committe Chairman Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) said during Thursday's markup of the multiyear highway bill.\n\n\"That\u2019s what this bill does in a way that I believe ensures a strong and appropriate federal role in surface transportation, enables our country to remain competitive and improves Americans\u2019 quality of life,\" Shuster continued.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated it will take about $100 billion, in addition to the annual gas tax revenue, to pay for a six-year transportation funding bill, which is the length being sought by the Obama administration and transportation supporters.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The group said the infrastructure measure is \"another status-quo bailout.\u201d", "description": "The group said the infrastructure measure is \"another status-quo bailout.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The group said the infrastructure measure is \"another status-quo bailout.\u201d", "title": "Heritage Foundation pans $325B House highway bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/257860-heritage-foundation-pans-325b-house-highway-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/highwayconstruction1_072815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/257860-heritage-foundation-pans-325b-house-highway-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-23T10:05-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, Gas Tax, Devolution, Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015, STRR Act,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-23T10:05:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/257860-heritage-foundation-pans-325b-house-highway-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The group said the infrastructure measure is \"another status-quo bailout.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Heritage Foundation pans $325B House highway bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Heritage Foundation pans $325B House highway bill"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers are facing a Oct. 29 deadline for the expiration of current infrastructure funding.\nTransportation advocates complain that Congress has not passed an infrastructure measure that lasts longer than two years since 2005.\nThe traditional source for transportation funding is revenue collected by the federal gas tax, which is currently set at 18.4 cents per gallon.\nThe federal government spends about $50 billion per year on roads, but the gas tax take only brings in $34 billion annually.\nThe Heritage Foundation's Sargaent said Congress would be better off leaving transportation funding decisions to states and focusing on just a handful of projects that are \"truly national in scope and are federal priorities,\" however."}
