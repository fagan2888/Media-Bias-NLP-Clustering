Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota Overnight Regulation: GOP slams new Obama education rules Paul blocks chemical safety bill in Senate MORE (R-Ky.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the chair of the House Science Committee, recently wrote, \u201cNo, the GOP is not at war with science.\u201d\n\nBut actions speak louder than words. Some in Congress may say science is important, but the truth is we have seen sustained attempts to undermine the use of science in making policy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe debate about science in this Congress isn\u2019t about carefully selecting which scientific endeavors are worthy of support. The debate is about whether we should use science to protect public health and the environment.\n\nPaul and Smith\u2019s op-ed focuses on a few small-scale research grants called \u201cwasteful\u201d and unworthy of funding. \u201cScrutinizing science funding isn\u2019t the same as attacking science,\u201d they say. While that\u2019s true, picking out grants with funny-sounding names distracts from what\u2019s actually going on in Congress: preventing federal agencies from using science to do their jobs and protect the American people.\n\nAmericans want laws that protect their health, safety and environment, and they expect that their implementation will be based on science, not ideology. Laws like the Clean Air Act are big, bipartisan success stories and perfect examples of how we can use science to improve lives. But they\u2019re too popular to take on directly. Instead, Congress has experienced attacks on individual research grants as a way to discredit the robust body of scientific evidence behind the regulations that protect our communities.\n\nScience helps us understand the most effective and efficient way to create policies that are good for people and the planet. Without science, we cannot effectively protect our environment or Americans, leading to negative impacts on our water, air, land, and human health. For example, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funds vital environmental issues in the Great Lakes, such as cleaning up contaminated sediments, mitigating habitat degradation and loss, addressing invasive species, such as Asian carp, and protecting drinking water. Furthermore, funding organizations such as National Institute of Health (NIH), the world\u2019s preeminent medical research institution, is our best hope for finding cures, improving treatments, and gaining a better understanding of the complex causes of diseases that affect millions of people. These funding dollars don\u2019t go to \u2018wasteful projects\u2019 but are crucial to the well-being of our society.\n\nRather than supporting science, many in Congress are advocating for bills that would nullify vital laws that protect American communities by making it next to impossible for the government to use science to implement them. These deceptively named bills are described using vague terms like \u201creform,\u201d \u201ctransparency,\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d but would radically overhaul our science-based regulatory system.\n\nTake the \u201cEPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act,\u201d a cleverly-named bill that passed the House last year. Under the cover of \u201creforming\u201d the science advisory board of the EPA, this legislation would have prevented scientists from giving advice to agencies based on their own research \u2013 the topics they\u2019re the most qualified to weigh in on. At the same time, it would have allowed industry-paid \u201cexperts\u201d more input and more chances to derail new rules. Scientists were left shaking their heads.\n\nOr consider the \u201cRegulatory Accountability Act,\u201d which passed by the House earlier this year. It would make science-based policymaking next to impossible by introducing at least 70 new procedural requirements and giving corporations and special interests more power to interfere. It would require extensive analysis of potential costs of new rules with no commensurate requirement to look at the benefits \u2013 like the 230,000 lives that the Clean Air Act will save by 2020. It\u2019s designed to prevent agencies from doing the job that, by law, they\u2019re supposed to do. That\u2019s the opposite of \u201caccountability\u201d \u2013 and make no mistake, it\u2019s an attack on science.\n\nSpecial interests might see some short-term gain from congressional interference with science-based policy, but in the long term, we will all pay the price. Science matters, and the attacks on science-based policies are real. We certainly shouldn\u2019t let ourselves be distracted from that fact.\n\nQuigley has represented Illinois\u2019 5th Congressional District since 2009.
