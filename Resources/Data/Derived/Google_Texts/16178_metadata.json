Clinton topped Cruz though in the number of people talking about her with 2.3 million people making 5.6 million interactions, while Cruz had 1.8 million users referencing him in 5.6 million interactions. (POLITICO provided the list of contenders to Facebook and Twitter.) Of the 15.9 million mentions of candidates\u2019 names or Twitter handles between Sept. 1 and Dec. 1, Cruz snagged 4.6 million mentions, or 29 percent, while Clinton garnered 2.9 million mentions, or 18 percent.\n\nA former digital director for President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign noted, \u201cImperfect as it is, [Facebook] is probably the biggest trove of data of what actual human beings outside of Washington, D.C., are talking about day to day and that makes it intrinsically important, and these platforms are actually important for reaching people and motivating them.\u201d\n\nThe Beltway-obsessed media usually concocts its own narrative with little regard for the issues on which everyday Americans are focused. The stupid firestorm the D.C. press kicked up about a now-former Hill staffer\u2019s Facebook comments about President Obama\u2019s daughters is a pretty good example of that.\n\nAnd though both Clinton and Cruz were mentioned on social media more than the other top eight 2016 presidential contenders, not all of that was positive.\n\nThe mentions cut both ways, including negative comments as well as positive ones. But they reflect the extent to which Clinton, a long-standing subject of debate, and Cruz, who casts himself as a conservative renegade, have dominated the conversation at a time when others are trying to gin up some grass-roots energy.\n\nFor example, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s social media spikes was near the end of October when she attempted to walk back \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\u2019s corporations and businesses that create jobs.\u201d Certainly, there weren\u2019t a lot a positive responses on social media to her remarks.\n\nCruz\u2019s largest spike on social media was when he called net neutrality \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Texas Governor Rick Perry tied for second place with 11 percent of the total interactions during the three-month period, while Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren came in third.\n\nJosh Perry, the man behind Senator Cruz\u2019s digital media strategy, told POLITICO:\n\n\u201cOur main strategy is to be as engaging with our content as possible, whether that\u2019s by thinking of ways to generate comments, likes, or shares - this all helps boost the appearance of our posts in people\u2019s timelines. Of course, that all begins with having a clear and direct message about something people care about, whether it is about the economy, national security, healthcare or any other issue.\u201d\n\nThese numbers show grassroots support (and, sometimes, opposition) for Cruz and others heading into 2016. It\u2019s important for their respective campaigns to generate shareable content that engages and entertains users. To that end, Senator Cruz has done an exceptional job doing that.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "2016 Elections,Facebook,Grassroots,social media,Ted Cruz,Twitter,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "Ted Cruz is dominating Facebook, Twitter", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "Ted CruzFacebook and Twitter revealed that &#8220;Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz together accounted for 40 percent of the discussion on Facebook and nearly half \u2014 47 percent \u2014 of mentions on Twitter among 10 top presidential possibilities in the"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeae4\"", "article_summary": "To that end, Senator Cruz has done an exceptional job doing that.\nThe stupid firestorm the D.C. press kicked up about a now-former Hill staffer\u2019s Facebook comments about President Obama\u2019s daughters is a pretty good example of that.\nOf the 15.9 million mentions of candidates\u2019 names or Twitter handles between Sept. 1 and Dec. 1, Cruz snagged 4.6 million mentions, or 29 percent, while Clinton garnered 2.9 million mentions, or 18 percent.\nAnd though both Clinton and Cruz were mentioned on social media more than the other top eight 2016 presidential contenders, not all of that was positive.\nFor example, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s social media spikes was near the end of October when she attempted to walk back \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\u2019s corporations and businesses that create jobs.\u201d Certainly, there weren\u2019t a lot a positive responses on social media to her remarks."}
