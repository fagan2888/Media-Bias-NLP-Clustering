The country\u2019s colleges and universities played host to an estimated 900,000 international students during the 2013-14 academic year, an 8% increase over the previous year.\n\nThe data comes from the 2014 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange recently released by the Institute on International Education and the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs.\n\nConducted annually, the report delves into America\u2019s international student population, countries of origin, fields of study, schools of choice and other related trends.\n\nWhere Students Come From\n\nWhile the largest segment of America\u2019s international student population continues to come from China, this year\u2019s study shows an increase in the diversity of countries of origin.\n\nHere are the top five countries of origin and the percentage of the international student population they represent, according to the report:\n\nChina, 31%\n\nIndia, 11.6%\n\nSouth Korea, 7.7%\n\nSaudi Arabia, 6.1%\n\nCanada, 3.2%\n\nOther leading countries of origin include Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nFields of Choice\n\nInternational students come to the United States to study a variety of fields, ranging from the arts to social sciences.\n\nHere are the top five fields of study and the percentage of the international student population pursuing those fields:\n\nBusiness and management, 21.1%\n\nEngineering, 19.2%\n\nMath and computer science, 10.3%\n\nSocial sciences, 8.2%\n\nPhysical and life sciences, 8%\n\nSchools of Choice\n\nAlthough America\u2019s international student population is distributed among all states and many different colleges and universities, some schools draw a larger percentage of students.\n\nHere is a look at the five top schools international students are choosing across the country and the total number of students from other countries enrolled during the 2013-14 academic year:\n\nNew York University, 11,164\n\nUniversity of Southern California, 10,932\n\nUniversity of Illinois \u2013 Urbana-Champaign, 10,843\n\nColumbia University, 10,486\n\nPurdue University, 9,988\n\nInternational student exchange programs that enable students from America to study abroad and those from other countries to come to the United States are considered vital for international relations, experts say.\n\nThe report also indicates the practice is beneficial to the economy. International students contributed an estimated $27 billion to the American economy last year, an increase of $3 billion over the previous year.\n\nWhile there were once concerns that the events of Sept. 11, 2001, might slow the growth of international student populations in the United States, the ongoing studies have proven the fear unfounded. The growth of the international student population over the last 15 years is about 72%.\n\nThe numbers of exchanges have grown on both sides, Peggy Blumenthal of the Institute of International Education pointed out, adding that this turn of events is beneficial for all involved.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s very complicated world, it\u2019s educational exchange that is the hope that we can find ways to work together,\u201d she said.\n\nGet Free Updates!
