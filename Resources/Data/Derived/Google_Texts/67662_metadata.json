But, seriously: you will not believe what Medicare just did about patient engagement in a draft new rule dramatically changing how doctors are paid.\n\nAnd, depending upon the reaction of the patient community, you definitely won\u2019t believe what happens next.\n\nBy way of background, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) just issued long-awaited regulations for implementation of a law as important to the health care delivery system as Obamacare was to health insurance. The Medicare and CHIP Reconciliation Act (MACRA) passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both houses of Congress in 2015, in large part because it eliminated the sustainable growth rate (SGR) pay formula for doctor payment that doctors hated.\n\nIn place of the SGR, MACRA links doctor pay to either their being part of a value-based arrangement such as certain accountable care organizations or participating in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). By law, the MIPS score determines provider bonuses or penalties based on four domains: quality measures, efficiency measures, meaningful use of electronic health records and clinical practice improvement activities.\n\nAs I wrote in an Urban Institute white paper with colleague Robert Berenson, measures mentioned in the law include \u201cpatient-reported outcome and functional status measures; patient experience measures; care coordination measures; and measures of appropriate use of services, including measures of overuse.\u201d\n\nNaturally, when the draft MACRA rule was issued by CMS late on April 27, I immediately did a search through its 962 pages to see what patient empowering provisions it contained. (The PDF has all those details missing in the CMS YouTube version, though it\u2019s way less fun.)\n\nFunctional assessment tools and patient experience measures are, indeed, part of a very long list of possible MIPS measures. Some of these are extraordinarily progressive. For instance, there\u2019s a measure of the percentage of patients undergoing a non-emergency surgery \u201cwho had their personalized risks of postoperative complications assessed by their surgical team\u201d and then discussed with the patient. The \u201csteward\u201d of that measure is the American College of Surgeons.\n\nBut in the section entitled, \u201cCoordination of Care Through Patient Engagement,\u201d the standards related to use of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology are startling in their laxity. Here are a few key excerpts. Emphasis added:\n\n\u201cDuring the performance period, at least one unique patient (or patient-authorized representatives) seen by the MIPS eligible clinician actively engages with the EHR made accessible by the MIPS eligible clinician.\u201d \u201cFor at least one unique patient seen by the MIPS eligible clinician during the performance period, a secure message was sent using the\u2026EHR\u2026.\u201d \u201cPatient-generated health data or data from a non-clinical setting is incorporated into the certified EHR technology for at least one unique patient\u2026.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right: one instance of \u201cactive engagement\u201d with the EHR, one secure message exchange and one use of patient-generated health data among the doctor\u2019s entire Medicare patient load during calendar year 2017 (the first performance period) qualifies a clinician for part of the MIPS bonus. I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I don\u2019t know whether \u201cunique\u201d patient means three different individuals or if three interactions with the same person \u2013 a designated \u201ce-patient\u201d? \u2013 would count.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: the rules say \u201cat least one\u201d patient because CMS knows that patient engagement is like eating potato chips! Nobody can stop with just one. Perhaps. But here\u2019s a different perspective. Monday, Jan. 2, 2017 is a federal holiday. That gives doctors four days to send and receive three emails before checking off the tough regulatory burden of electronic patient engagement until the first week of 2018.\n\nThe MACRA rule is available as a download on this government website. It will be formally published by CMS in the Federal Register on May 9 and open for public comment until June 27. (Details are at the beginning of the document.) Perhaps some pointed questions might be asked by attendees at this year\u2019s Health Datapalooza, where a host of senior Obama administrations will provide preening perorations on their commitment to open data and patient empowerment.\n\nIf we in the patient community do not raise questions and objections to this critically important MACRA rule, you will definitely not believe what happens next.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If we in the patient community do not raise questions and objections to this critically important MACRA rule, you will definitely not believe what happens next.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "If we in the patient community do not raise questions and objections to this critically important MACRA rule, you will definitely not believe what happens next.", "title": "You won\u2019t believe what CMS did on patient engagement in MACRA", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/howard-beale.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-01T22:33:24-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/05/cms-patient-engagement-macra/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/howard-beale.jpg", "description": "If we in the patient community do not raise questions and objections to this critically important MACRA rule, you will definitely not believe what happens next.", "card": "summary", "title": "You won't believe what CMS did on patient engagement in MACRA"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Gov, MACRA, Patient Engagement, regulations, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "regulations", "published_time": "2016-05-02T06:25:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-01T22:33:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I know what you\u2019re thinking: the rules say \u201cat least one\u201d patient because CMS knows that patient engagement is like eating potato chips!\nBut, seriously: you will not believe what Medicare just did about patient engagement in a draft new rule dramatically changing how doctors are paid.\nFunctional assessment tools and patient experience measures are, indeed, part of a very long list of possible MIPS measures.\nThat gives doctors four days to send and receive three emails before checking off the tough regulatory burden of electronic patient engagement until the first week of 2018.\nIf we in the patient community do not raise questions and objections to this critically important MACRA rule, you will definitely not believe what happens next."}
