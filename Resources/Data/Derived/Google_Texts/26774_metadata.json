Asked about calls by Sarah Palin to impeach Obama over the administration\u2019s immigration policies, Holder said: \u201cShe wasn't a particularly good vice presidential candidate. She's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why.\u201d\n\nHolder similarly dismissed calls for himself to be impeached for declining to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS scandal. Holder insisted that a special prosecutor isn\u2019t necessary, with \u201ccareer people\u201d and FBI agents \u201cdoing a good, professional job\u201d investigating the matter.\n\nREAD: Meet the Impeachment Crowd: 6 Republicans Who Want Obama Out\n\nREAD: 4 Things You Might Not Know About Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nREAD: Border Brawl to Food Fight: Five Stories You'll Care About in Politics This Week\n\nAs for House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against the administration over the Affordable Care Act, Holder said he doesn\u2019t think \u201cthat lawsuit's going to have legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a more, I think, a political gesture than a truly legal one,\u201d he said. \u201cFiling a lawsuit against the president that has no basis is not going to improve the quality of life for the American people.\u201d\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview for \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos,\u201d Holder spoke at length about race and discrimination in America, saying the country is in \u201ca fundamentally better place than we were 50 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've made lots of progress,\u201d he said. \u201cI sit here as the first African-American attorney general, serving the first African-American President of the United States. And that has to show that we have made a great deal of progress.\n\n\u201cBut there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the place that is consistent with our founding ideals,\u201d he said.\n\nHolder said that he and President Obama are treated differently than their predecessors.\n\n\u201cThere's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me [and] directed at the president,\u201d Holder said. \u201cYou know, people talking about taking their country back. \u2026 There's a certain racial component to this for some people. I don\u2019t think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus.\u201d\n\nREAD: Latest Syria Threat 'More Frightening Than Anything' Else, Holder Says\n\nREAD: DOJ Set to Fight Gay-Marriage Bans in Supreme Court\n\nAsked about his controversial comments from 2009, in which he called the United States a \u201cnation of cowards\u201d when it comes to race, Holder stood firm.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't walk away from that speech,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues,\u201d rarely engaging \u201cone another across the color line [to] talk about racial issues.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Holder took Republicans to task for efforts to, among other things, enact voter ID laws in some states. He called such moves \u201cpolitical efforts\u201d aimed at making it \u201cmore difficult\u201d for \u201cgroups that are not supportive of those in power\u201d to \u201chave access to the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is disproportionately impacted by them? Young people, African Americans, Hispanics, older people, people who, for whatever reason, aren't necessarily supportive of the Republican Party,\u201d Holder said, noting that \u201cthis notion that there is widespread in-person voter fraud is simply belied by the facts.\u201d\n\nHolder said the Justice Department is expected to soon file challenges to restrictive voting laws in Ohio and Wisconsin, as the department already did in Texas and North Carolina.\n\n\u201cI'm attorney general of the United States. I will not stand for -- I will not allow people to take away that which people gave their lives to give, and that is the ability for the American people to vote,\u201d Holder said.\n\nIn the interview, Holder was also asked about the controversy now surrounding the name of Washington's professional football team, the Redskins.\n\n\u201cI think the name ought to be changed,\u201d Holder, a long-time Washingtonian, said. \u201cI think it is an offensive name. And the Redskins are \u2026 a team with a storied history that has huge amounts of support in Washington, D.C. And I think in the 21st Century, they could increase their fan base, increase their level of support if they did something that is so, from my perspective, so obviously right.\u201d\n\nLike \"This Week\" on Facebook here.
