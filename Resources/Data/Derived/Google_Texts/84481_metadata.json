"article_text": "Flooding of the Reid Building at the University of SA, September 2009.\n\nTHE State Government and Adelaide City Council are being sued after their alleged incompetence caused $5 million worth of flood damage to UniSA facilities, destroying its research.\n\nIn Supreme Court documents, obtained by The Advertiser, the university asserts it lost irreplaceable research, expensive equipment and laboratory animals to a 2m \u201cinundation\u201d of stormwater.\n\nThe deluge is being blamed on two separate sets of public works being conducted at the same time \u2014 one by the council, the other by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\n\u201cIt was reasonably foreseeable that, if the works were not performed with reasonable care, skill, diligence and competence, then the university would suffer loss and damage,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe Council and the Government, meanwhile, have pointed the finger at one another, each asserting the other is to blame for the drenching of the university\u2019s work and property.\n\nThe university\u2019s case, in court this month, was filed in relation to incidents of flooding that happened in the basement of the Reid Building, on Frome Rd, in May, June, July, August and September 2009.\n\nThe statement of claim says the university\u2019s Schools of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences were located in the building\u2019s basement during that period.\n\nPrior to that time, it asserts, the council began earthmoving work at nearby Frome Park to remove a bitumenised car park, while the Department carried out other earthmoving work close by.\n\nIt says work disrupted the overflow of stormwater from Main Lake, situated in Botanic Park, to First Creek and required the erection of a swale to catch the run-off.\n\n\u201cWater and silt overflow from the council\u2019s works ran across the adjacent roadway toward the basement of the Reid Building,\u201d it asserts.\n\nIt says the council tried using hay bales and \u201clong rubber snakes\u201d to stem the flow of water but both measures \u201cwere ineffective and failed\u201d to assist.\n\n\u201cOn August 29, there was a substantial overflow (that) caused inundation of water \u2026 up to a depth of approximately 8-10cm,\u201d it asserts.\n\n\u201cOn September 21, at approximately 4pm, the Reid Building was subjected to a substantial inundation of water (that) reached a depth of 2m throughout the basement area.\n\n\u201cThe Metropolitan Fire Service was involved in pumping stormwater from the building for approximately 48 hours.\u201d\n\nIt says the council and government \u201cknew, or ought to have known\u201d overflow would result from its earthworks and that the measures put in place were inadequate.\n\nFlooding of the Reid Building at the University of SA, September 2009.\n\nIt further asserts they breached their duty of care by failing to take steps, or taking only inadequate steps, to respond to the risk of overflow.\n\n\u201cThe basement contained a vast array of contents used for scientific research (and) also hosted engineering workshops and animal laboratories,\u201d it asserts.\n\n\u201cThe inundation of water (caused the) loss of animal cohorts, biological samples, research results and equipment.\u201d\n\nIt asks the court to award $458,645.13 for building repairs, $2,197,900 for damage to contents and facilities and $2,437,500 for \u201cinterrupted and destroyed\u201d research.\n\nIn its defence papers, the council says the Department diverted water overflow from its project into the swale without first informing the council.\n\nIt claims the water that flooded the Reid Building originated from that project and that the basement \u201cwould have flooded in any event\u201d due to the area\u2019s topography.\n\nThe government denies this assertion in its defence papers, claiming the council never told it that the swale was unable to hold overflow from both projects.\n\nIt says any loss or damage suffered by the university is the sole responsibility of the council.\n\nThe case returns to court on Wednesday.\n\nToday the university released a statement saying it had settled a claim with its insurer in 2011 and the university had no interest in pursuing legal action against the State Government or city council.\n\n\u201cThe legal action is in fact being initiated by the insurance company as part of their normal subrogation processes,\u201d it said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE State Government and Adelaide City Council are being sued after their
