The whole season to this point has been a blast.\n\nThat, however, isn't the goal. That is still to come, and as far as Resurrection Christian's thinking leans on the boys basketball team, that means the Cougars still have to get better than the 102-53 rout of Highland in the 2A District 7 Championship game Saturday at Greeley Central.\n\n\"Our goal is to be better Monday in practice. We want to play better next week than we played this week,\" Rez coach Dick Bruce said. \"That's just the attitude we have to have and have to sustain.\"\n\nThe Cougars better get used to the idea of a rough week of workouts if they're going to top this game, particularly the first half. Rez was a blistering 22-of-30 from the field, leading to a pair of 30-point frames. They ran out to a 14-0 lead in the first 2:33 of the game, leading 65-24 at the break.\n\nLeading the way was Tanner Ervin, who hit 9-of-11, scoring 27 points in the first two quarters, saying he really didn't know he was that hot.\n\n\"No, not really. I was just kinda going with the flow,\" said the sophomore guard, who finished with 30 points, hitting 4-of-7 from behind the 3-point line. \"My teammates were doing everything. I'm coming off screens, Mike (Stevenson) is giving me good passes, (Luke) Fick can attack the basket and give it to me. I'm just spotting up, they're doing the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's not just me at all.\"\n\nIt's also just not that easy, Ervin just made it look like it at times. Then again, while Fick was impressed, he wasn't surprised.\n\n\"I've seen better. There's times he can go 10-of-10 from 3 and reign in 30 points in 5 minutes,\" Fick said. \"He can do it all, drive to the basket and shoot 3s, do whatever he wants and score like that.\"\n\nResurrection Christian School's Luke Fick (35) goes up up for a shot in the lane amidst Highland defenders Cole Rouse, left, Tanner Dill, back, and Matthew Faryna in the third quarter Saturday. Fick scored 14 in the win. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nIt was the ninth time this season the Cougars have posted 90 points or better, the second time they've eclipsed the century mark. Factor in they did it against a Highland team that reached as high as No. 3 in the state rankings and is 19-3 on the season. Two of those losses are to Rez, with the Cougars scoring at least 93.\n\n\"My hat's off to them. They're a great team,\" Highland coach Efren Perez said. \"Good team. They don't have any weaknesses I can see. It's going to take a special team on a special night to beat them.\"\n\nThe Cougars finished with five players in double figures, with Fick adding 14. Evan Anderson and Stevenson each had 12, with Kyle Lahr pitching in 10.\n\nAs good as they were offensively, the Cougars are adept at setting it up on defense. They force turnovers and tough shots and rebound well, keeping teams from going on extended runs.\n\n\"We're always saying that defense wins championships,\" Fick said. \"We're always stressing defense in practice, whether it's defensive fundamentals or our Cougar D, a drill we do. It's No. 1 in our books.\"\n\nThat attention to all the details is what made Dick so happy after the game. For his team, defense isn't a chance to catch their breath, but a chance to take the game away. For a man who has coached a lot of basketball, it was easy for him to hand out high praise to his squad.\n\n\"I think that's as good as any of my teams have ever played,\" Dick said. \"We have the guys, we have the attitude. It's just a great group of kids that have come together with wanting to achieve and have success. We've been very blessed to have a group like this.\"\n\nThe fact remains, Saturday's title isn't the one the team really wants. Nor would be the one they can earn in regionals next week, but both are viewed as checkpoints to the final destination.\n\nFor the Cougars, they don't believe the real fun has yet to begin.\n\n\"It's been awesome, but the big prize still hasn't happened yet,\" said Ervin, still hitting the target. \"I hope it's going to be a blast. I hope it's going to be a lot of fun.\"\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/RHpreps\n\n2a District 7 Championship\n\nCougars 102, Huskies 53\n\nAt Greeley Central HS\n\nHIGHLAND (19-3)\n\nKadyn Hicks 2 3-4 7, Cole Rouse 8 3-7 20, Omar Naranjo 2 0-0 6, Tanner Dill 2 1-5 6, Dandre Sanchez 2 0-2 4, Fabian Flores 3 0-0 6, Reese Anderson 1 0--0 2, Rian James 1 0-0 2.
