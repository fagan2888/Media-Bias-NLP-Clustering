It was about 1,385 miles from the islands with 50 mile-per-hour winds at 11 a.m. New York time Wednesday.\n\nIn Miami, the National Hurricane Center is predicting it may even become a hurricane by Friday.\n\nWell, maybe. The hurricane center has begun to reduce its strength forecast and many commercial meteorologists doubt Danny will hold together.\n\n\u201cMeh, it has a couple of days to strengthen before it meets the guillotine in the form of strong shear,\u201d said Todd Crawford, meteorologist with WSI in Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nThe wind shear, which can rip a storm apart, is out by the Windward Islands, said Paul Walker, a meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. The Windward and Leeward islands form an arc across the Atlantic, acting as a boundary between the eastern Caribbean and the high seas.\n\nThe more immediate hazard to storm growth is a cradle of dry air that appears in satellite photos to be escorting the system through the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe big potential inhibitor is a ton of dry air to the north,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, lead author of the Colorado State University seasonal hurricane forecast. \u201cIf that were to mix in the center in the next day or two, it could squash it completely.\u201d\n\n\u201850-50 Chance\u2019\n\nStill, Klotzbach is giving the system \u201ca 50-50 chance of reaching hurricane strength.\u201d\n\nThe initial hurricane center analysis projected the storm\u2019s top winds could reach 100 miles (161 kilometers) per hour, which would make it a Category 2 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. The center has since reduced that to a 90-mph Category 1 hurricane.\n\nThe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model predicts Danny will be weaker and encounter more impediments to its growth than the U.S. Global Forecast System sees, Todd Kimberlain, a hurricane specialist at the center, wrote in an analysis.\n\n\u201cThe intensity forecast is therefore reduced throughout the forecast period,\u201d Kimberlain wrote.\n\nDry Air\n\nThe dry air near Danny is sure to impede its development, said Thomas Downs, a meteorologist at WeatherBell Analytics LLC in New York.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-based modeling seems to be over-exuberant in trying to strengthen it, given the obstacles it faces,\u201d Downs said.\n\nCrawford said the cut in the hurricane center\u2019s strength forecast will probably \u201cstart a downward trend.\u201d\n\nEarlier runs of the European model had Danny falling apart in the Caribbean.\n\n\u2018I like that idea,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThis is the time of year when the Atlantic starts to stir. Typically, the biggest, most powerful storms of any hurricane season get going from about Aug. 20 to the end of September or even into October.\n\nStorms\u2019 Cradle\n\nThose monsters are born, for the most part, in the same patch of ocean where Danny is taking its first steps. Meteorologists call it \u201cthe main development region.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s in a typical year. This year is a bit different. First off, there\u2019s an El Nino in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which can actually create wind shear across the Atlantic.\n\nThen there has been a lot of dust and dry air from the Sahara in Africa. The shear and the dryness have the same effect on hurricanes as adding sawdust to cake batter.\n\nIt\u2019s not totally inhospitable in the Atlantic, however. Water temperatures in central part of the ocean are about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), Walker said. That\u2019s conducive to storm formation.\n\n\u201cIt is plenty warm,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile even a bad storm bearing down on the islands, which include St. Lucia, Martinique, and Grenada, may be enough to end vacation plans for visitors, residents themselves could probably use the rain, sans the high winds and raging surf, Walker said.\n\nMany of the islands are experiencing drought. About 64 percent of Puerto Rico is gripped by some level of dryness, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nOf course, the whole thing could fall apart in a few days, and the quiet August in the Atlantic could keep rolling leisurely along.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-type": "post", "sailthru.author": "Brian K.
