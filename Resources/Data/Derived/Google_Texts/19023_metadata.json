His body is then left outside for four hours. The shocking gore of the situation sparks countless protests around the country calling for an end to racism. Meanwhile, popular attention to the incident prompts investigations into the young man killed, leading some critics to suggest that his working-class background and alleged criminal activities somehow make his death justifiable.\n\nIt is not the last month in Ferguson, Missouri. It is not Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Ezell Ford, Roshad McIntosh or any of the other unarmed black men killed by police in recent weeks \u2014 though it could be. It is San Quentin, California, in the year 1971. His name was George Jackson. Though more than four decades have gone by since he was killed, his life and death signal the ways in which this country\u2019s macabre routine of police violence against young black men and women has become institutionalized throughout the criminal justice system.\n\nWith Jackson, as with the others, the deaths marked not just the tragic end of a young life but also the bizarre beginnings of speculation about the character of the deceased. Jackson, an activist and bestselling author, was killed at California\u2019s San Quentin prison on Aug. 21, 1971, by two guards who fired down at him as he ran toward the wall surrounding the prison after a 30-minute takeover of a solitary confinement unit. Unlike the unarmed youth killed by police, Jackson did have a gun on him when he was killed. Yet the circumstances surrounding his death remain mysterious, including how he managed to get his hands on a gun. How he managed to acquire it in the confines of what was then one of California\u2019s toughest prisons remains a mystery, especially since authorities kept changing their story about the caliber of the gun and its origins. Was it smuggled in or did he wrest it from a guard who was about to kill him?\n\nOne thing is clear: Jackson\u2019s intransigence and the open-ended questions that surround his death make him a relevant figure in the age of mass incarceration and rampant police violence. His place in history has been secured largely according to one\u2019s political perspective. To some he is a martyr of political injustice, like Sacco and Vanzetti a half-century before him. Every year, thousands of college students meet George Jackson as an author, someone whose raw eloquence captures the prison experience like few others. And to others, Jackson is an exaggerated bad guy, famous for being infamous and a hustler to the end.\n\nDepending on your outlook, Jackson is some combination of these. But he is also something else: a specter haunting the American criminal justice system, a trenchant critic even from the grave. Whether as boogeyman, hero or martyr, George Jackson remains prominent in prison America. Indeed, if the 1953 execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was the dystopic expression of Cold War anxieties, the 1971 killing of George Jackson marked the onset of a new era of mass incarceration and the hyper-policing that sustains it.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen George Jackson went to prison in 1960, there were 200,000 people in prisons around the country. When he published \u201cSoledad Brother\u201d in 1970, the rate of imprisonment was the lowest it had been in 20 years, with 96 out of every 100,000 Americans in prison. When he was killed in San Quentin in 1971, there were 300,000 people incarcerated, a rate of about 200 per 100,000 people.\n\nThree decades later, when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to stay the execution of Stanley Tookie Williams because the Crips co-founder had dedicated one of his anti-violence books to George Jackson and other well-known black activists (proving, Schwarzenegger said in a statement at the time, that Williams had not been rehabilitated), one in 100 American adults is in prison \u2014 approximately 2.3 million people. As of 2011 one in 34 adults, more than 7 million people, is under some form of correctional supervision: prison, parole or probation. Five percent of the world\u2019s population, the United States imprisons 25 percent of the world\u2019s prisoners.\n\nSuch staggering and lopsided rates of incarceration devastate whole communities, as the families of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride and so many others can attest: Not only does mass incarceration break up families but it promotes punitive and preemptive policing of black life.\n\nThe captives in this prison nation are a lot like George Jackson: Many of them are poor or working-class young men of color who run afoul of the law. Jackson was convicted at 18 for his role in a $70 gas station robbery. The judge pointed to Jackson\u2019s previous arrests \u2014 for theft, assault and other high jinks carried out as a teenager \u2014 as justification for sentencing him to serve one year to life in prison. It was the kind of stringently vague sentence that postwar justices, especially in California, used to compel \u201cgood behavior.\u201d\n\nIn Jackson, and in so many others, it had the opposite effect. He remained defiant. He protested the pervasive racism and segregation of California\u2019s prison system in organized and informal ways. He organized a sit-in against a segregated prison cafeteria and taught prisoners martial arts to fight back against attack by the guards. In 11 years in captivity, Jackson spent long stretches of time in solitary confinement for his obstinacy. He wrote eloquently of the racism he experienced in prison and earned the admiration of prisoners around the country \u2014 especially other black prisoners in a time that saw American prisons become increasingly disparate in terms of racial composition and then grow exponentially in size, producing stark inequalities that render the criminal justice system the vanguard site of American racism.\n\nGeorge Jackson became so well known as a dissident in the California prison system that he was appointed a field marshal in the Black Panther Party and tasked with recruiting more prisoners to its ranks. He became the figurehead of a political and intellectual movement located in American prisons. He captured the ways that people in prison were active participants in the social movements of his day. \u201cThere are still some blacks here who consider themselves criminals \u2014 but not many. Believe me, my friend, with the time and incentive that these brothers have to read, study, and think, you will find no class or category more aware, more embittered, desperate, or dedicated to the ultimate remedy \u2014 revolution. The most dedicated, the best of our kind \u2014 you\u2019ll find them in the Folsoms, San Quentins, and Soledads. They live like there was no tomorrow. And for most of them there isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJackson was charismatic and intelligent, strong and soft-spoken. According to many who knew him, he was easy to talk to and quick with a smile, at least among friends. To them, he was generous with his time, knowledge and what little resources he had. He taught interested fellow prisoners Marxism and martial arts. He retained a hard edge among competitors and antagonists, especially guards, but also some fellow prisoners. But his influence \u2014 and what prison administrators have always loathed \u2014 owes to his persuasive intellect, political commitments and anti-authoritarian defiance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1971, activist George Jackson was mysteriously killed in San Quentin prison \u2014 a tragedy repeated time and again", "title": "America\u2019s fortress of blood: The death of George Jackson and the birth of the prison-industrial complex", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In 1971, activist George Jackson was mysteriously killed in San Quentin prison \u2014 a tragedy repeated time and again", "title": "America\u2019s fortress of blood: The death of George Jackson and the birth of the prison-industrial complex", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/americas_fortress_of_blood_the_death_of_george_jackson_and_the_birth_of_the_prison_industrial_complex/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/george_jackson_ferguson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 1971, activist George Jackson was mysteriously killed in San Quentin prison \u2014 a tragedy repeated time and again", "title": "America\u2019s fortress of blood: The death of George Jackson and the birth of the prison-industrial complex", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/george_jackson_ferguson.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dan Berger", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, America, Black Panthers, Civil Rights, George Jackson, mass incarceration, Prison, Prison Industrial Complex, War on Drugs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca734\"", "article_summary": "Topics: America, Black Panthers, Civil Rights, George Jackson, mass incarceration, Prison, Prison Industrial Complex, War on Drugs, News, Politics NewsA young black man gunned down by law enforcement.\nHis name was George Jackson.\n* * *When George Jackson went to prison in 1960, there were 200,000 people in prisons around the country.\nEvery year, thousands of college students meet George Jackson as an author, someone whose raw eloquence captures the prison experience like few others.\nHe protested the pervasive racism and segregation of California\u2019s prison system in organized and informal ways."}
