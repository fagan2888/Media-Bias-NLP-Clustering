A viewer in Phoenix sent in this adorable picture of three tiny finch eggs laid in a nest atop an Easter decoration.

"On Good Friday a little finch laid eggs in the nest she built recently upon the Easter Egg Wreath on our front door," wrote viewer Lori Rocco.

The family has been entering and leaving the house through the garage so as not to disturb the precious nest. They plan to continue "until the chicks are born and ready to leave the nest," said Rocco.

"Who knew the Easter Bunny was actually a bird!" Rocco said.
