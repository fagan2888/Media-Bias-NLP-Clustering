Osiris realized a gain of $47.2 million from the sale during the period.\n\nWithout it, though, Osiris still would have reported a net profit for the period. The company said net income for the quarter was $49.9 million, or $1.44 a share, swinging from a loss of $2.65 million, or 8 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet expected no income for the quarter. Income from continuing operations was 11 cents a share.\n\nRevenue during the quarter was $8.08 million against last year\u2019s $2.94 million. That also came in ahead of FactSet\u2019s forecast of $7.5 million.\n\nShares were up $1.56 to $17.04 in recent action.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nBristol-Myers doing late-stage tests on drug for lung cancer treatment\n\nGentiva shares tumble on surprise loss\n\nWill Obamacare enrollment end with a bang or whimper?", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-03-05T11:23:03-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A small biopharmaceutical player sees its shares jump by double digits after reporting an unexpected profit that came by way of a major transaction.", "title": "Small biopharma Osiris jumps after reporting an unexpected profit", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/05/small-biopharma-osiris-jumps-after-reporting-an-unexpected-profit/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU300_pharma_MG_20140210105102.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "biotechnology,earnings,health care,Osiris Therapeutics,pharmaceuticals,stem cells", "article.headline": "Small biopharma Osiris jumps after reporting an unexpected profit", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "biotechnology,earnings,health care,Osiris Therapeutics,pharmaceuticals,stem cells", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A small biopharmaceutical player sees its shares jump by double digits after reporting an unexpected profit that came by way of a major transaction.", "article.published": "2014-03-05T11:23:03-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/05/small-biopharma-osiris-jumps-after-reporting-an-unexpected-profit/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A small biopharmaceutical player sees its shares jump by double digits after reporting an unexpected profit that came by way of a major transaction.", "title": "Small biopharma Osiris jumps after reporting an unexpected profit", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/05/small-biopharma-osiris-jumps-after-reporting-an-unexpected-profit/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU300_pharma_MG_20140210105102.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2179", "article.updated": "2014-03-05T11:23:03-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ddb\"", "article_summary": "Without it, though, Osiris still would have reported a net profit for the period.\nA smaller biopharmaceutical player saw its shares jump by double digits Wednesday, as it reported an unexpected profit that came by way of a major transaction.\nOsiris realized a gain of $47.2 million from the sale during the period.\nShutterstockOsiris Therapeutics Inc. /quotes/zigman/102500/delayed /quotes/nls/osir OSIR jumped 10% after beating earnings estimates and revenue for the fourth quarter.\nRevenue during the quarter was $8.08 million against last year\u2019s $2.94 million."}
