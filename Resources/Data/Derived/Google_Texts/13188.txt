"Shame on you. It’s not true,” Grayson said, according to sources in the room.

“It is true, and I want you to lose,” Reid fired back.

Grayson’s confrontational approach was derided by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the leader of the CPC.

“Why are you doing that?” Ellison asked, according to sources in the room. “This is so stupid.”

Another source said other CPC members shared Ellison’s sentiments.

“All the members were appalled” by Grayson’s behavior, the source said. “It was embarrassing for him and embarrassing for us that he behaved that way.”

Grayson, a liberal firebrand, is embroiled in a primary battle against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) for the swing seat soon to be vacated by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who had vied for the White House before bowing out of the race in March. Reid has endorsed Murphy in the contest.

Reid’s office issued a statement after the meeting confirming the confrontation, saying the Democratic leader “was honored” to address the CPC but that Grayson “decided to be disruptive, to the embarrassment of his fellow colleagues.”

“Senator Reid took the opportunity to express his low opinion of Congressman Grayson to his face and remind him that the reason Senator Reid has said that Grayson is under ethics investigation and appears to be running a Cayman Islands hedge fund from his Congressional office in order to line his own pockets is because these things are true, as established by seventy-four pages worth of evidence from the Congressional Ethics Committee,” the statement said.

Grayson — who has dismissed the ethics complaint as “frivolous” and “politically motivated” — defended his conduct at the meeting, saying his motive was “very simple.”

“I wanted to find out why Harry Reid lied about me a couple of months ago, when he smeared me. ... I wanted to try to get to the bottom of it,” Grayson told reporters. “What he said was profoundly untrue, and even allowing for the fact that I am the anti-establishment candidate.
