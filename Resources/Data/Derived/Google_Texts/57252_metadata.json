The nonprofit organization \u201cNow I Lay Me Down To Sleep\u201d (NILMDTS) has offered to give the gift of remembrance to parents grieving the loss of their terminally ill babies by sending photographers to capture final moments at the hospital.\n\nCheryl Haggard, NILMDTS founder, believes these images can serve as an important step in the family\u2019s grieving process, especially after dealing with the loss of her newborn son, Maddux Achilles Haggard, in 2005. Maddux was born with X-linked myotubular myopathy, a condition that prevents patients from breathing, swallowing, or moving on their own.\n\nBefore Maddux was taken off life support in 2005, Haggard reached out to photographer and now NILMDTS co-founder Sandy Puc to take pictures of the family cradling their son. This included photos after Maddux was off life support and \u201cfree from the tubes and the wires that had sustained him,\" said Haggard on the NILMDTS website.\n\nClick \"View Gallery\" to see the heartbreaking moments of parents\u2019 saying goodbye to their sick newborns.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "now i lay me down to sleep, terminally ill, goodbye to you, newborn babies, sick children, death and dying, premature death, stillborn, myotubular myopathy, genetics, infants, grief, photography, photos, camera, remembrance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The nonprofit organization \u201cNow I Lay Me Down To Sleep\u201d gives the gift of remembrance to parents suffering the loss of a newborn baby.", "title": "Heartbreaking Moment When Parents Say Goodbye To Sick Newborns [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/now-i-lay-me-down-sleep-series-captures-parents-final-moments-terminally-ill-babies-322134", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/13/haggard-son-maddux-who-died-myotubular-myopathy-2005.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nonprofit organization \u201cNow I Lay Me Down To Sleep\u201d gives the gift of remembrance to parents suffering the loss of a newborn baby.", "title": "Heartbreaking Moment When Parents Say Goodbye To Sick Newborns [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/now-i-lay-me-down-sleep-series-captures-parents-final-moments-terminally-ill-babies-322134", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/13/haggard-son-maddux-who-died-myotubular-myopathy-2005.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/13/haggard-son-maddux-who-died-myotubular-myopathy-2005.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-13T16:42:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-16T16:42:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The nonprofit organization \u201cNow I Lay Me Down To Sleep\u201d gives the gift of remembrance to parents suffering the loss of a newborn baby."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc973\"", "article_summary": "Click \"View Gallery\" to see the heartbreaking moments of parents\u2019 saying goodbye to their sick newborns.\nThe nonprofit organization \u201cNow I Lay Me Down To Sleep\u201d (NILMDTS) has offered to give the gift of remembrance to parents grieving the loss of their terminally ill babies by sending photographers to capture final moments at the hospital.\nThis included photos after Maddux was off life support and \u201cfree from the tubes and the wires that had sustained him,\" said Haggard on the NILMDTS website.\nCheryl Haggard, NILMDTS founder, believes these images can serve as an important step in the family\u2019s grieving process, especially after dealing with the loss of her newborn son, Maddux Achilles Haggard, in 2005.\nSaying goodbye to a loved one is never easy, especially when it\u2019s someone you brought into the world just a few days ago."}
