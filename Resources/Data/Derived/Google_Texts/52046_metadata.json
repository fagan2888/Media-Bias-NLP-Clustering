But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s premature to lay out some broad parameters for identifying the characteristics, qualities or backgrounds of those most likely to succeed in the quest.\n\nSo in this column, while I won\u2019t mention any specific names of potential candidates (save for one \u2014 Jeb Bush), I will identify some desirable traits.\n\nJeb Bush would be my own personal choice at this time, but there are myriad good reasons that he might choose not to run. It\u2019s his call entirely. Either way, he satisfies most of the criteria I set forth for a potential nominee.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some things that won\u2019t matter in 2016 as much as they might have in prior nominating cycles.\n\nFirst, there is no \u201cit\u2019s his turn\u201d candidate. No runners-up Republicans from 2012 can lay claim to deserving the nomination for their performances last time as candidates and vote-getters.\n\nSure, someone like Rick Santorum can perhaps claim success in a particular state or with a certain constituency, but no one \u201calmost won\u201d the nomination last time and no one was especially covered in glory in defeat.\n\nMy advice to anyone who ran last time and wants an encore would be to do things very differently this time around, and make it clear that last time was not their best stuff. They would need what marketers call a \u201creplacement image\u201d to try again.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for most tigers to change their stripes. So in truth, 2012\u2019s losers would probably do best to move along and find another quest besides the presidency.\n\nI also think that being the \u201cright-most legitimate conservative,\u201d a key positioning to victory in past nomination contests, might not be the ticket in 2016.\n\nI think enough GOP voters next time will be hungry enough for victory and smart enough to project that being too far right doesn\u2019t bode well for November success.\n\nThe winner will be conservative enough to satisfy all but the most hard-core conservatives, and even take a right-wing position on guns or selected social issues, but have a few other libertarian positions that would have been troublesome in the past.\n\nVoters will be looking for proof of electability, and that doesn\u2019t mean a 100 percent record on every conservative totem.\n\nThe winner will almost surely come from outside Congress and the D.C. insider clique. A governor, former governor, retired military officer, professional athlete, celebrity, civic leader or successful businessman will doubtless win.\n\nIt won\u2019t be anyone in this or any recent Congress. They are tainted goods. America and the Republican mainline long for something fresh, someone new and different.\n\nIf businessmen like Ross Perot, Morry Taylor, Michael Bloomberg or even Donald Trump Donald TrumpKasich not ready to endorse Trump Muslim lawmakers fear Trump, and what he's tapping into Sanders: Democratic primary not a 'monarchy' MORE \u2014who have all flirted with Republican nominations or independent bids \u2014 were to run in 2016, they might finally get some traction.\n\nFor those specific individuals, it\u2019s too late. They are now officially not new and fresh. Look for one or two candidates of their ilk to run well three years from now.\n\nRepublicans in 2016 will also be looking, as intimated above, for a winner.\n\nSometimes winning takes a back seat to ideology. But Barack Obama Barack ObamaClinton allies blame Bernie for bad polls Bill Press: Bernie is not a threat John Feehery: GOP: Listen to Reince MORE surprised many with two wins, so now the mainline GOP voter recognizes that potential for success should be taken into account, not just litmus-test issue positions.\n\nThere\u2019s a Republican out there that fills the bill. We can only hope that person steps up and runs.\n\nHill is a pollster who has worked for Republican campaigns and causes since 1984.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The question that I am asked most often, particularly by those who know that I am a Republican pollster, is: \u201cWho will win our party\u2019s nomination for president in 2016?\u201d", "description": "The question that I am asked most often, particularly by those who know that I am a Republican pollster, is: \u201cWho will win our party\u2019s nomination for president in 2016?\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David Hill", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The question that I am asked most often, particularly by those who know that I am a Republican pollster, is: \u201cWho will win our party\u2019s nomination for president in 2016?\u201d", "title": "Makings of a 2016 GOP nominee", "url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/david-hill/327369-makings-of-a-2016-gop-nominee", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T23:19-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/david-hill/327369-makings-of-a-2016-gop-nominee", "dcterms.date": "2013-10-08T23:43-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Megan Ruyle", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Barack Obama, Donald Trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-08T23:43:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/david-hill/327369-makings-of-a-2016-gop-nominee", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The question that I am asked most often, particularly by those who know that I am a Republican pollster, is: \u201cWho will win our party\u2019s nomination for president in 2016?\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Makings of a 2016 GOP nominee"}, "dcterms.title": "Makings of a 2016 GOP nominee"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd884\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s start with some things that won\u2019t matter in 2016 as much as they might have in prior nominating cycles.\nSo in this column, while I won\u2019t mention any specific names of potential candidates (save for one \u2014 Jeb Bush), I will identify some desirable traits.\nEither way, he satisfies most of the criteria I set forth for a potential nominee.\nI also think that being the \u201cright-most legitimate conservative,\u201d a key positioning to victory in past nomination contests, might not be the ticket in 2016.\nNo runners-up Republicans from 2012 can lay claim to deserving the nomination for their performances last time as candidates and vote-getters."}
