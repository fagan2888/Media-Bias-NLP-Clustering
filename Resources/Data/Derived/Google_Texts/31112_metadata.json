Michael Grimm is having The Problems. He will reportedly agree to a plea deal following his multi-count indictment over federal tax evasion charges from when he co-owned a restaurant, before serving in Congress. That could mean jail time and, if so, he will almost certainly resign. He said during the most recent campaign \u2014 which he won while under indictment, that he would step down if he was \u201cunable to serve.\u201d It is very difficult to serve from within the slammer.\n\nThe terms of the plea deal are still unknown but, if it doesn\u2019t include jail time, his congressional future is much more uncertain. He doesn\u2019t seem interested in resigning as long as he is physically able to serve, and there technically aren\u2019t any constraints that would bar him from doing so.\n\nAll eyes are on Speaker John Boehner now, and how far he\u2019s willing to go to force Grimm to resign. He could deny Grimm committee seatings, direct the NRCC not to give him any funds, and warn him that the House Ethics Committee may end up recommending his expulsion. Boehner, as Politico writes, has \u201chistorically had little tolerance for beleaguered lawmakers, even for those he considers personal friends. Boehner gives his colleagues plenty of rope, but he will yank it back if they cross the line.\u201d It\u2019s taken far less than a federal felony guilty plea for Boehner to exert his will, too. He successfully forced New York Rep. Chris Lee out on the very day that shirtless photos of him, sent to his not-wife, surfaced on the Internet. He \u201cpushed former Indiana Rep. Mark Souder to resign when it came out that the congressman was having an affair with an aide,\u201d as Politico writes. \u201cCocaine Congressman\u201d Trey Radel didn\u2019t last too long, either, after getting probation for trying to buy coke from an undercover cop.\n\nWhy does Boehner care so much? He seems to buy into the media conventional wisdom when it comes to members\u2019 extracurricular problems, whether it\u2019s with extraspousal relationships, drugs, the law, or some combination. The conventional wisdom here is that it would be an unwelcome \u201cdistraction\u201d for Boehner heading into the 114th Congress, in which he\u2019ll have an expanded majority and a new Senate Republican majority to work with. That, were Grimm to keep showing up for work, it would taint the Republican party to have a felon loitering around within its conference. It could really hurt the \u201cGOP brand\u201d heading into a presidential electorate for a Republican member to face censure or expulsion from the Ethics Committee, etc.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arguments that the Speaker should try to boot the felonious congressman are wrong-headed.
