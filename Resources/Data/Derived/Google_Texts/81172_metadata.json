She attended segregated schools, where black students received textbooks only after white students were done with them. Ad Policy\n\nAfter Okiakpe moved to Virginia, she brought her birth certificate, Social Security card, voter-registration card, and bank statement to the polls with her, but was unable to vote under the state\u2019s strict voter-ID law, which required a government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot. The only photo IDs she had were a North Carolina driver\u2019s license and an expired Virginia DMV card, neither of which were accepted.\n\nAs she argued with poll workers, other voters in line snickered at Okiakpe. \u201cI felt very frustrated, very upset,\u201d she told a federal court, the Associated Press reported reported. Okiakpe wept as she told the story.\n\nShe was ultimately given a provisional ballot, which was only counted after Okiakpe obtained a valid voter ID in Manassas days after the election.\n\nOn Thursday, federal district court judge Henry Hudson upheld Virginia\u2019s voter ID law, despite hearing many stories like Okiakpe\u2019s of voters burdened by the law. Hudson, a George W. Bush appointee once known as \u201cHang \u2018Em High Henry\u201d for his tough on crime record, was also the first judge to rule against Obamacare. His decision will make it harder for the 200,000 Virginia voters without a driver\u2019s license to cast a ballot.\n\nVirginia first passed a voter-ID law in 2012, which accepted non-photo IDs like a utility bill, pay stub, bank statement, government check, or Social Security card. The Justice Department approved the law. But after Barack Obama carried Virginia in 2012, the GOP-controlled legislature significantly toughened the law, accepting \u201conly drivers licenses, voter ID cards, student IDs, and concealed handgun permits,\u201d MSNBC reported.\n\nThe change needed approval from the DOJ or a federal court, but was allowed to go into effect after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in June 2013, ruling that states like Virginia with a long history of voting discrimination no longer had to submit their voting changes for federal approval. (The state tried to exclude any \u201cevidence of Virginia\u2019s history of racial discrimination\u201d from being heard in the case as \u201cnot relevant.\u201d) LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS\n\nAs a result, Virginia is one of 17 states with new voting restrictions in place for the first presidential cycle in 2016, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nVirginia presented no cases of voter impersonation to justify the law, but Judge Hudson stated, \u201cDespite arguments to the contrary, the statute\u2019s stated intention of protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process serves a substantial governmental interest.\u201d\n\nHudson\u2019s ruling comes the same week as Wisconsin\u2019s voting restrictions are being challenged in federal court. A former chief of staff to a Republican state senator testified that Wisconsin Republicans were \u201cgiddy\u201d about the state\u2019s voter-ID law\u2019s reducing turnout in heavily Democratic areas like \u201cneighborhoods around Milwaukee and on the college campuses.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s now overwhelming evidence that voter-ID laws are designed not to combat nonexistent voter impersonation but to make it harder for Democratic-leaning constituencies to vote. Yet conservative judges in states like Virginia and North Carolina keep upholding these laws.\n\nThis underscores the importance of changing the courts, particularly the Supreme Court that gutted the VRA. Donald Trump released his short list of very conservative Supreme Court nominees this week. It\u2019s important to remember that both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would appoint very different people to the bench.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Virginia_election_AP_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Ari Berman", "description": "Josephine Okiakpe, a 69-year-old African-American woman, grew up in a small town in North Carolina in the Jim Crow South.
