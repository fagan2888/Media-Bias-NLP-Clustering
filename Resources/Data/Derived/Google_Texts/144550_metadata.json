The program will benefit more than 12,000 individuals covered by a Cigna health plan who receive care from nearly 50 primary care doctors and specialists affiliated with Central Florida Affordable Care. Cigna now has eight collaborative care programs in Florida and 134 of them nationwide.\n\nIn places where it\u2019s been introduced, Cigna Collaborative Care is helping to improve the health of Cigna customers while effectively managing medical costs. The programs are helping to close gaps in care, such as missed health screenings or prescription refills, reinforcing the appropriate use of hospital emergency rooms, increasing the number of preventive health visits and improving follow-up care for people transitioning from the hospital to home.\n\n\u201cWith a focus on care coordination and access to data from Cigna, we can take the quality of our care to the next level,\u201d said Robert Alexander, executive director of Central Florida Affordable Care, LLC. \u201cAs people live healthier, more productive lives, costs will go down and the entire community will benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough these types of collaboration we have the opportunity to help transform the health care delivery system,\u201d said Michael Howell, M.D., Cigna\u2019s senior medical director for Florida. \u201cWhen we reward doctors for results and focus on prevention, wellness, health improvement and care coordination, we can create a system that works for everyone who uses, pays for or delivers health care.\u201d\n\nUnder the program, Central Florida Affordable Care will monitor and coordinate all aspects of an individual\u2019s medical care. People will continue to go to their current physician and automatically receive the benefits of the program. Individuals who are enrolled in a Cigna health plan and later choose to seek care from a physician affiliated with Central Florida Affordable Care will also have access to the benefits of the program. There are no changes in any plan requirements regarding referrals to specialists. Individuals most likely to see the immediate benefits of the program are those who need help managing chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\n\nCritical to the program\u2019s benefits are the registered nurse clinical care coordinators, employed by Central Florida Affordable Care, who will help individuals with chronic conditions or other health challenges navigate the health care system. The care coordinators are aligned with a team of Cigna case managers to ensure a high degree of collaboration between the medical group and Cigna, which will ultimately provide a better experience for the individual.\n\nThe care coordinators will use data from Cigna to help identify individuals being discharged from the hospital who might be at risk for readmission, as well as those who may be overdue for important health screenings or who may have skipped a prescription refill. The care coordinators are part of the physician-led care team that will help people get the follow-up care or screenings they need, identify potential complications related to medications and help prevent chronic conditions from worsening.\n\nCare coordinators can also help people schedule appointments, provide health education and refer individuals to Cigna's clinical support programs, such as disease management programs for diabetes, heart disease and other conditions; and lifestyle management programs, such as programs for tobacco cessation, weight management and stress management.\n\nCigna will compensate Central Florida Affordable Care for the medical and care coordination services it provides. Additionally, the organization may be rewarded through a \u201cpay for value\u201d structure if it meets targets for improving quality and lowering medical costs.\n\nCigna has been at the forefront of the accountable care organization movement since 2008 and now has 134 Cigna Collaborative Care arrangements with large physician groups. They span 29 states, reach nearly 1.5 million commercial customers and encompass nearly 60,000 doctors, including approximately 30,000 primary care physicians and 30,000 specialists.\n\nAbout Central Florida Affordable Care, LLC\n\nCentral Florida Affordable Care LLC (CFAC) is a private practice physician led company that is designed to meet the changes in the healthcare delivery system primarily brought on by the Affordable Care Act.
