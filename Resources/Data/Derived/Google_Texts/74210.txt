Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said his government was ready to act on suggestions, if any, of the Congress or any other party on rehabilitating victims of Muzzafarnagar riots.

Reacting to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's visit to relief camps and homes of the victims in Muzaffarnagar, the Chief Minister said "we are ready to work on suggestions if they want to give one. If they want to play politics it is up

to them."

"We will act on suggestions on rehabilition of victims, if any, of the Congress or any other political party," he told reporters here.

Asked whether Rahul's visit to meet riot-hit victims was an attempt to derive political mileage, Akhilesh said "I will not make political allegations. It is up to you (media) to analyse. You might know better."

He said the state government had given Rs five lakh to the vicitms for their rehabilitation, adding as their houses were burnt and near and dear ones were killed, they did not want to leave relief camps.

Earlier, at a function to feliciate him on the success of the polio eradication programme in the state, the Chief Minister said a political disease was spreading in the state and that needed to be checked.

"A political disease is spreading in the state. I do not know from where it has come. We need to check it," he said in an obvious reference to BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's poll campaign in the state.

"It is a challenge to thwart communal forces in the state," he said.

The Chief Minister alleged political parties were carrying out false propaganda against the Samajwadi Party.

The opposition parties were worried as schemes of the state government were being implemented at the ground level to the benefit of the people, he said.

"The restlessness of opposition parties shows we have succeeded in implementing our schemes," Akhilesh said.
