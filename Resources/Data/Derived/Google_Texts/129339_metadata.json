It\u2019s widely expected that Cruz will amplify the charge that Rubio is insufficiently anti-\u201camnesty,\u201d to raise doubts about his conservatism.\n\nNow Cruz has unleashed what may be his most aggressive and sustained assault on Rubio yet, and the topic is indeed immigration. Cruz\u2019s target: Rubio\u2019s heretical support for comprehensive immigration reform, for which the Florida Senator has been trying to atone for years. The New York Times\u2019 Jeremy Peters caught up with Cruz last night:\n\nMr. Cruz was asked Wednesday night by a reporter in Kingston N.H., if there was still a distinction between his position on immigration and Mr. Rubio\u2019s. \u201cIt is not complicated,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, then paused before adding, \u201cthat on the seminal fight over amnesty in Congress, the Gang of Eight bill that was the brainchild of Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama, that would have granted amnesty to 12 million people here illegally, that I stood with the American people and led the fight to defeat it in the United States Congress.\u201d Mr. Cruz said: \u201cIn my view, if Republicans nominate for president a candidate who supports amnesty, we will have given up one of the major distinctions with Hillary Clinton and we will lose the general election. That is a path to losing. \u201cAnd part of the reason the debate last night was so productive is you started to see clear, meaningful policy distinctions, not just between what people say on the campaign trail. Talk\u2019s cheap. But between their records. When the fight was being fought, where did you stand? That speaks volumes about who you are and where you will stand in the future. And we\u2019re entering the phase now in the presidential race where primary voters are starting to examine the records of the candidates.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s broadside contains two key ingredients. The first is the suggestion that Rubio\u2019s support for Obama/Schumer comprehensive reform shows that his current posture on immigration is not to be trusted. Rubio has retreated to the position that the border must be fully secured before we can even discuss legalization. And Rubio has also sought to reassure conservatives with a careful straddle: he doesn\u2019t support Donald Trump\u2019s call for deportation of the 11 million, but neither does he align himself fully with Jeb Bush\u2019s and John Kasich\u2019s forceful moral and practical criticism of Trump\u2019s vow of mass removal. However, conservatives are not convinced: they want him to fully rule out any future \u201camnesty,\u201d which (by their lights) he has not done yet. Cruz may also press Rubio to say whether he\u2019d immediately end Obama\u2019s executive action protecting the DREAMers from deportation. It\u2019s a point on which Rubio has fudged, and it\u2019s a legitimate question.\n\nThe second key ingredient in Cruz\u2019s monologue goes to the heart of competing theories of the 2016 presidential race. Cruz is claiming that only a GOP nominee who is unequivocally opposed to \u201camnesty\u201d can draw the sharp contrast with the Democratic nominee that is necessary for a Republican to win the White House. (This is of a piece with a broader belief that Republicans must break their addiction to nominating squishy moderates rather than Real Conservatives.)\n\nThis theory is diametrically opposed to the prevailing theory among many GOP strategists (including, at one point, the RNC), which holds that to win in future national elections, the GOP must embrace meaningful immigration reform that reorients the party as more culturally welcoming and inclusive, broadening its demographic appeal. It\u2019s hard to say where Rubio now stands on this spectrum \u2014 the hedging in his immigration pronouncements seems designed to keep that vague. But Rubio strategists are reportedly convinced that his ability to maintain mainstream appeal will be key to his success, which suggests he hopes to reserve room to pivot back to a more pro-reform posture later, if he wins the nomination. Cruz may challenge Rubio in ways designed to foreclose that possibility.\n\nCruz\u2019s prescription for 2016 seems dangerously wrong-headed. But it now looks as if this argument over competing theories of the case may be hashed out in a more public way.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\n* GOP FOREIGN POLICY VIEWS ALL OVER THE MAP: The Post has a good piece detailing the degree to which this week\u2019s debate showed the GOP presidential candidates\u2019 foreign policy views are all over the place. There\u2019s the conflict between hawks (Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio) and non-interventionists (Rand Paul, Donald Trump). And:\n\nThere is also inconsistent command of the subject matter \u2014 a sharp contrast with the sure-footed knowledge that Clinton has displayed, most recently at a grueling, 11-hour congressional hearing last month on the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, \u00adLibya\u2026.During some of the back-and-forth, several candidates appeared confused as to what the issues were and what was happening on the ground.\n\nBut even if the details are fuzzy, all of the candidates, of course, are certain that Obama\u2019s foreign policy has been nothing but an epic disaster.\n\n* HILLARY STILL LEADS SANDERS: A new New York Times/CBS poll finds that Hillary Clinton leads Democrats nationally by 52-33, barely changed from October. Note this:\n\nMrs. Clinton enjoys a firmer base of voters than Mr. Sanders, according to the poll. Fifty-four percent of her supporters said their minds were completely made up, while 58 percent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters said they had not made a final decision. And 43 percent of Democrats said they would enthusiastically support Mrs. Clinton as their presidential nominee, compared to 35 percent for Mr. Sanders.\n\nAt Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate, the pressure will be on Sanders to sharpen the contrast with Clinton (as he\u2019s already tried to do of late on a number of issues) to try to jog loose this dynamic.\n\n* REPUBLICANS WANT BENGHAZI PROBE TO CONTINUE: A new McClatchy/Marist poll finds that four in 10 Americans think Clinton\u2019s email conduct was unethical but legal. However, on the Benghazi attack, the poll finds:\n\nVoters are split 49-45 percent on whether Clinton has sufficiently answered questions about the attack or whether Republicans should continue their investigation.\n\nSo a plurality of Americans overall say she\u2019s sufficiently answered questions. But 80 percent of Republicans want the probe to continue. After all, if investigators look hard enough, surely they\u2019ll find something that ends her candidacy eventually! So of course Republicans want it to keep going.\n\n* SANDERS VOWS \u2018AGGRESSIVE\u2019 CLIMATE PROPOSALS: Bernie Sanders tells National Journal that he plans to roll out a very robust agenda for tackling climate change. This includes going beyond a carbon tax:\n\n\u201cWe need to be ex\u00adtraordin\u00adar\u00adily bold in trans\u00adform\u00ading our en\u00adergy sys\u00adtem away from fossil fuel,\u201d Sanders said in the Cap\u00adit\u00adol. \u201cWe are go\u00ading to be very ag\u00adgress\u00adive, and we will come out with some very spe\u00adcif\u00adic ideas.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt that Sanders\u2019 climate agenda will be substantially more ambitious than Hillary Clinton\u2019s will. Still, if this prods her to go further than she otherwise might, all the better.\n\n* GOP POLICIES NOT AIMED AT WORKING CLASS WHITES: Writing on that new study showing rising mortality among whites, E.J. Dionne notices an interesting disconnect: While the GOP base is well stocked with working class white voters, the policies on display at the GOP debate weren\u2019t targeted at their challenges:\n\nThe fire bell was heard only dimly at the two Republican debates in Milwaukee on Tuesday. Indeed, much time was consumed by a vigorous competition over tax proposals aimed at slashing the rates paid by the wealthiest Americans. The candidates were all about flat or flatter taxes, or levies on consumption, which tend to disadvantage lower-income Americans, who are suffering most in this economy. The GOP hopefuls often sounded as if they were addressing a convention of Mercedes owners.\n\nOf course, if many Republican voters believe the claim that cutting taxes on the rich (sorry, on everyone) is in their interests, what\u2019s the harm?\n\n* AND REPUBLICANS ARE DIVIDED OVER DOOMED REPEAL EFFORT: The Hill reports that Senate Republicans are planning to vote yet again on Obamacare repeal, but some aren\u2019t so sure:\n\nSenate GOP leaders have told their members they will repeal as much of the 2010 healthcare reform law as possible, but some Republicans are balking at a proposal to repeal the expansion of Medicaid. \u201cI am very concerned about the 160,000 people who had Medicaid expansion in my state. I have difficulty with that being included,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.\n\nYep, Obamacare repeal is a great idea, except for the fact that it would take the law\u2019s benefits away from people. Here\u2019s the solution: Say that the Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t really Obamacare, and then hold a vote to \u201cfully\u201d repeal Obamacare while leaving the expansion untouched.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was bound to happen.
