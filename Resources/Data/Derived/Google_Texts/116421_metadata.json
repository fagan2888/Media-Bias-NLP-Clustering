The studio also debuted a first look at the comic-book movie \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d at the annual convention.\n\nBut it was \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d that was the main event that fans had camped out for days to see. Stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot and Jesse Eisenberg were on hand to talk about the superhero showdown, too \u2014 a step up from last year\u2019s Comic-Con when none of the stars was allowed to talk.\n\nIn the first full trailer for the film, out on March 25, 2016, we see a society that has turned against the godlike Superman (Cavill) following a massive disaster. While Holly Hunter\u2019s steadfast Senator schemes with Eisenberg\u2019s Lex Luthor to protect the public from the dangerous Superman, Affleck\u2019s Batman decides to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Batman fighting Superman is a thing that happens all the time in comic books,\u201d said Zack Snyder, who also directed \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d He likes to pay homage to Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d but wanted to make clear that this story is not that story.\n\nOscar-winning screenwriter Chris Terrio (\u201cArgo\u201d) wrote the script.\n\nSnyder said the story will also launch toward bigger conflicts with other superheroes.\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said coyly. \u201cI mean, I do know.\u201d\n\nWhile audiences have met Cavill\u2019s Superman before, this is their first real introduction to Affleck\u2019s Batman.\n\n\u201cI think if I thought too hard about the actors who played this part before, I couldn\u2019t have taken the job,\u201d said Affleck. But Snyder explained to him that this Batman would be different. He told Affleck that Bruce Wayne here is at \u201cthe end of his rope, he\u2019s older, he\u2019s a burnout.\u201d\n\nAs the villain Lex Luthor, Eisenberg said that there\u2019s \u201calways a campy element to the character.\u201d\n\nBut unlike in previous versions, this Lex Luthor has an \u201cemotional groundedness.\u201d He also has hair.\n\nGadot, who plays Wonder Woman in this film and in an upcoming stand alone, said her character has the \u201cstrength of a superhero\u201d but is \u201cvery sophisticated, loving and has a lot of emotional intelligence.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros. also showed the first footage from \u201cSuicide Squad,\u201d another DC Comic about a group of imprisoned supervillains recruited by a government organization to perform black ops for their freedom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Affleck debuts \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 footage at Comic-Con", "title": "Ben Affleck debuts \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 footage at Comic-Con", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ben Affleck debuts \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 footage at Comic-Con", "title": "Ben Affleck debuts \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 footage at Comic-Con", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/11/ben_affleck_debuts_batman_v_superman_footage_at_comic_con/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/2015-comic-con-warner-bros.-presentation.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Affleck debuts \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 footage at Comic-Con", "title": "Ben Affleck debuts \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 footage at Comic-Con", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/2015-comic-con-warner-bros.-presentation.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsey Bahr", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e2a\"", "article_summary": "But it was \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d that was the main event that fans had camped out for days to see.\nWhile Holly Hunter\u2019s steadfast Senator schemes with Eisenberg\u2019s Lex Luthor to protect the public from the dangerous Superman, Affleck\u2019s Batman decides to take matters into his own hands.\n\u201cI mean, I do know.\u201dWhile audiences have met Cavill\u2019s Superman before, this is their first real introduction to Affleck\u2019s Batman.\nStars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot and Jesse Eisenberg were on hand to talk about the superhero showdown, too \u2014 a step up from last year\u2019s Comic-Con when none of the stars was allowed to talk.\n\u201cI think if I thought too hard about the actors who played this part before, I couldn\u2019t have taken the job,\u201d said Affleck."}
