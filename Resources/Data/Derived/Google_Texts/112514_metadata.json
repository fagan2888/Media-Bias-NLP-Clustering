The district\u0092s current agreement with HTEA expires Aug. 2015.\n\nSolicitor Greg Parker said the extension provides a salary increase of 2.42 percent in 2015-16, and 2.45 percent in 2016-17.\n\nThe extension also calls for increases in employee premium contributions to health care coverage of 1 percent each year, Parker said. And, it contains language permitting parties to open discussions and move to mediation if necessary, if the Affordable Care Act presents unanticipated costs the district feels require negotiation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe association includes more than 400 teachers, counselors, librarians, speech/language therapists, school psychologists, school nurses, occupational therapists and school social workers.\n\nBoard President Denis Gray thanked parties for their work.\n\n\u0093It makes running the district smooth,\u0094 he said.\n\nIn other business at the meeting, Parker reviewed proposed revisions to the district\u0092s Transportation Video Monitoring policy. Parker said the changes were driven by Act 9 of 2014. Act 9 amended Pennsylvania\u0092s wiretap statute, creating an exception that expressly allows audio taping on school buses and vehicles.\n\nHowever, Parker noted that three conditions must be met. First, the board must officially adopt/revise school policy to authorize installation of the audio taping equipment. It must also post proper notices on the buses and vehicles that carry the equipment. The district also must send written notification via regular mail to parents and students.\n\nParker proposed adding language to the district\u0092s current videotaping policy to include audio monitoring, and to state the board\u0092s authorization of audio taping as permitted by the statute, for disciplinary and/or security purposes. Changes incorporate all three requirements, Parker said.\n\nAlso at the meeting, school directors approved $93,736 in change orders connected to the Maintenance Facility and Transportation offices project.\n\nThe board appointed Larry Feinberg, Phil Hopkins and Russ Bilotta to serve as voting delegates to the Pennsylvania School Boards Association 2014 Delegate Assembly.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Primos Education news, PA Education news, US Education news, world Education news.", "title": "Education association contract extension OK\u0092d in Haverford", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140714/NEWS/140719811", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Education association contract extension OK\u0092d in Haverford"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "HAVERFORD \u0097 School directors last week approved a contract extension negotiated between the school district and Haverford Township Education Association.", "title": "Education association contract extension OK\u0092d in Haverford", "url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140714/NEWS/140719811", "image": {"src": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016"}, "site": "@delcotimes", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563336340", "iphone": "id508962453", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.thedelawarecountydailytime"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Education, Education news, Primos Education news, PA Education news, US Education news, world Education news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "HAVERFORD \u0097 School directors last week approved a contract extension negotiated between the school district and Haverford Township Education Association."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f9b\"", "article_summary": "HAVERFORD \u0097 School directors last week approved a contract extension negotiated between the school district and Haverford Township Education Association.\nAdvertisementThe association includes more than 400 teachers, counselors, librarians, speech/language therapists, school psychologists, school nurses, occupational therapists and school social workers.\nFirst, the board must officially adopt/revise school policy to authorize installation of the audio taping equipment.\nSolicitor Greg Parker said the extension provides a salary increase of 2.42 percent in 2015-16, and 2.45 percent in 2016-17.\nAct 9 amended Pennsylvania\u0092s wiretap statute, creating an exception that expressly allows audio taping on school buses and vehicles."}
