There are five teams, ten people each, that must make their own version of veggie chili. Juanita Alvarado stirs the secret ingredient into the pot for Team 1. They call themselves the SuperHots.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s let that caramelize,\u201d she says, tapping the wooden spoon on the edge of the saucepan.\n\nThis simmering pot of fresh black beans, zucchini, and carrots is a far cry from what Alvarado ate when she was in prison. Late nights in the bunks, inmates would pool their goods from the commissary to make a prison concoction called The Spread.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ramen noodle. It consists of pickle juice, tuna, Velveeta cheese. Sausages, hot chips, some hot sauce, pork rinds, mayonnaise,\u201d she says.\n\nThen they mixed it all together and cooked it \u2013 sort of.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically getting a plastic bag and asking for hot water and smashing everything and keeping it steamed for an hour, then putting it in a tortilla,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really tasty, but it really hurts your stomach.\u201d\n\nAlvarado says she gained 70 pounds eating like this in prison.\n\n\u201cYou get out and think, \u2018I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m big, I\u2019m good,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize your body is really damaged inside.\u201d\n\nToday, Alvarado works at the Transitions Clinic in San Francisco, helping people recently released from prison manage conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Community health workers, like Alvarado, have all done time. They call on their own experiences to mentor patients through medical treatments, as well as finding a job, housing, and food.\n\nShe and 50 other community health workers from Transitions clinics across the country gathered at the San Francisco Ferry Building recently for the cooking class.\n\nAlvarado said the approach was to teach these workers \u201cto help people access food that\u2019s healthy and low cost, and also to be able to learn how to cook,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd cook with a budget, so they\u2019re not just going back to ramen noodles and spreads.\u201d\n\nBut all this can be really hard for many former inmates in California. The state is one of 34 in the country that ban people convicted of certain drug crimes from receiving food stamps.\n\nMore than 90 percent of people recently released from prison skip meals or struggle to get enough food, in part because of the ban, according to a survey of Transitions Clinic clients in California, Texas, and Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe know when people don\u2019t have access to food, they\u2019re at risk for chronic conditions, or their chronic conditions get worse, or they\u2019re at risk for HIV,\u201d says Dr. Shira Shavit, director of the Transitions Clinic network.\n\nOne patient from the San Francisco clinic \u201chad to work as a sex worker to be able to buy a Happy Meal for her children to feed them,\u201d Shavit said.\n\nStudies show that steady access to food reduces crime and recidivism. California lawmakers decided to get rid of the food stamps ban, and the new policy will take effect next April 15.\n\nTeaching Cooking on a Budget\n\nThat\u2019s where Chef Hollie Greene comes in to lead the chili cook-off. She\u2019s been teaching cooking on a budget to low income and homeless populations for years, and now through her start-up, JoyFoodly.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re at the store and you\u2019re trying to make a decision about what to buy,\u201d she says to the class of community health workers. \u201cWhole chickens are about a dollar less per pound, than when you start to buy all the different parts.\u201d\n\nShe also has gentle strategies for encouraging people to buy more fruits and vegetables, or brown rice instead of white rice. Or even quinoa.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asks one member of Team 5, while they sit eating their chili.\n\nChef Hollie nods. \u201cWell when I was growing up I thought it was for people who hug trees. I used to call it \u201cquin-oh-a,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I call it, \u2018Keen-Whaaat?\u2019\u201d (It\u2019s a high protein grain.)\n\nShe continues making the rounds to check on each team\u2019s final results. She dips a spoon into the bowl from Juanita Alvarado\u2019s team, the SuperHots, which they decorated with leaves of red cabbage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. I feel like I\u2019m on a cruise ship,\u201d Chef Hollie laughs. \u201cThis is the best chili I\u2019ve ever had. I can taste the love.\u201d\n\nTo try your hand at the veggie chili from the cooking class, follow Chef Hollie\u2019s recipe below.

Fold over either side, and then roll to close.
