Kentucky Health News examined what it would cost a one-parent, one-child family in Scott County.\n\nThe least expensive premium for this family on Kynect is the CareSource \u201cbronze\u201d plan at $254 per month, but this plan also has the highest deductibles at $6,650 per person and $13,300 per group.\n\nThe lowest deductible for this family is the Humana \u201cplatinum\u201d plan at $500 per person and $1,000 per group, but this plan\u2019s premium was also one of the most expensive at $532.98 per month.\n\nTwo steps below the platinum plan are the \u201csilver\u201d plans, which are the most popular by far on the Obamacare exchanges. Deductibles for the silver plans available to our sample family ranged from $2,000 to $3,700 per person and $4,000 to $7,500 per group.\n\nDeductibles for the bronze plans, which have the lowest premiums, ranged from $4,400 to $6,650 per person and $8.800 to $13,300 per group.\n\nOther costs to consider when looking at the affordability of a plan are its co-payments, co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximums.\n\n\u201cThose deductibles are causing concern among Democrats \u2014 and some Republican detractors of the health law, who once pushed high-deductible health plans in the belief that consumers would be more cost-conscious if they had more of a financial stake or skin in the game,\u201d Pear writes.\n\nWhile the shift to cost-sharing through higher deductibles has become the norm, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that fewer than half of all households above the poverty level have enough assets to cover an out-of-pocket maximum of $3,000 to $6,000, which is considered mid-range. The highest out-of-pocket maximum for 2016, as set by the health-reform law, is $6,850, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\nWhile the report from HHS said, \u201cEight out of 10 returning consumers will be able to buy a plan with premiums less than $100 a month after tax credits, and about seven out of 10 will have a plan available for less than $75 a month,\u201d several consumers complained to Pear that the high deductibles make the plans unaffordable.\n\n\u201cOur deductible is so high, we practically pay for all of our medical expenses out of pocket,\u201d said Wendy Kaplan, 50, of Evanston, Illinois, whose family of four pays premiums of $1,200 a month, with an annual deductible of $12,700, \u201cSo our policy is really there for emergencies only, and basic wellness appointments.\u201d\n\nThere are mitigating factors, Pear reports, health officials and insurance counselors cite several. All plans must cover preventive services without a deductible or co-payment; some plans help pay for some items before patients meet their deductible; there is an overall limit on out-of-pocket costs; and there are discounts available for those with particularly low incomes.\n\nAnd for those who say their deductibles are too high, Dave Chandra, a policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Pear, \u201cEveryone should come back to the marketplace and shop. You may get a better deal.\u201d\n\nBut Pear writes that the deductibles are so high they may be scaring away some consumers, especially the young, healthy consumers that would help bring the premiums down for everyone.\n\nAlexis C. Phillips, 29, of Houston, is one of those who told Pear, \u201cThe deductibles are ridiculously high. I will never be able to go over the deductible unless something catastrophic happened to me. I\u2019m better off not purchasing that insurance and saving the money in case something bad happens.\u201d\n\nThe penalty for not having health insurance in 2016 is $695 or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.\n\nFrom Kentucky Health News, an independent news service of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kentuckians also struggle with high deductibles, based on a look at plans offered on Kynect, Kentucky\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\nAlexis C.
