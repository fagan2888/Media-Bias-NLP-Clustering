Elliot Street is well known for the preservation efforts he along with a group of others do throughout the city. The most recent being the former police station and the Threefoot Building. Now he is taking his efforts of preservation and clean-up to the Temple Theater, where he along with others are creating a space for The Company of Angels to operate out of.\n\n\"Today, we're involved in trying to clean up enough space we have been occupying because Roger and the Temple have basically given The Company of Angels a home here,\" Street said. \"We felt that in order to be use it we needed more space.\"\n\nThe room is a quaint little area on the second floor behind the main stage. It's the remnants of what use to be a gathering room for Shriners with a fully equipped bar attached.\n\n\"I see a lab theater,\" Street said. \"We were fortunate enough to be able to get enough equipment that we'll be able to run a complete sound system and complete tech booth right behind this wall.\"\n\nThat vision he mentions will allow The Angels to do business as the Rails to Reels Festival. When all is said and done, Street says the room will act a hub for any future projects The Angels take on.\n\n\"For better words it will be a screening room or live streaming as I mentioned,\" said street. \"A more versatile space, but geared primarily towards film and theatre up here.\"\n\nIf you would like to volunteer to help, you can contact the Temple Theater at 601-693-5353.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Company of Angels spent Saturday cleaning up a vacant room on the 2nd floor of the Temple Theater", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "The Company of Angels spent Saturday cleaning up a vacant room on the 2nd floor of the Temple Theater", "title": "Company of Angels Working on New Home in Temple Theater", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Company-of-Angels-Working-on-New-Home-in-Temple-Theater-369534361.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/812/BA5/812BA55C8D03400EBECB6DF950CFCF30", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/1D8/3D1/1D83D1832C2D40AE84DD31F65483723D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Company of Angels spent Saturday cleaning up a vacant room on the 2nd floor of the Temple Theater", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Company-of-Angels-Working-on-New-Home-in-Temple-Theater-369534361.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Temple+Theater.jpg", "title": "Company of Angels Working on New Home in Temple Theater", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Company of Angels Working on New Home in Temple Theater", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Company of Angels Working on, New Home in Temple Theater"}, "article_summary": "If you would like to volunteer to help, you can contact the Temple Theater at 601-693-5353.\nThe Temple Theater in downtown Meridian will soon be the hub for a local theatre group.\nNow he is taking his efforts of preservation and clean-up to the Temple Theater, where he along with others are creating a space for The Company of Angels to operate out of.\n\"I see a lab theater,\" Street said.\n\"Today, we're involved in trying to clean up enough space we have been occupying because Roger and the Temple have basically given The Company of Angels a home here,\" Street said."}
