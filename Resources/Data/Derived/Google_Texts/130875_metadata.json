The team also moved Charlie Culberson to the 60-day disabled list to make room on the 40-man roster for Oberg.\n\nAxford\u2019s son, Jameson, was bitten on his right foot by a rattlesnake last month in the backyard of their rental house near Scottsdale during spring training. He\u2019s been in the hospital ever since.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stable, but there are still a lot of issues,\u201d Axford said.\n\nJameson underwent an initial surgery on Monday. But doctors found a staph infection that was more serious than they expected. They removed all the tissue and skin at the spot of the bite, down to the tendon and bone.\n\n\u201cMy wife couldn\u2019t actually even tell me on the phone because of how tough the news was for her,\u201d Axford said. \u201cShe\u2019s been by his side the entire time in the hospital. So it was difficult to hear that, but I just keep going back to the memories of how happy he was in his good moods and his good spots.\u201d\n\nJameson needs another surgery to repair the muscle and graft on new skin. So he will be moved from a Phoenix-area hospital to Denver on a medical emergency flight to meet a recommended surgeon in Colorado.\n\n\u201cAt least I\u2019ll get to be closer to him,\u201d Axford said.\n\nAxford\u2019s wife, Nicole, and their 3-year-old son J.B., have stayed with Jameson since last month. And Axford left the team for a week during spring training to be with his family. He returned late in spring and pitched a hitless inning Wednesday at Milwaukee in his season debut.\n\nJameson, obviously, has weighed heavy on his mind, Axford said.\n\n\u201cAnybody who has kids, you get to see your toddler running around, it\u2019s an amazing thing to see,\u201d Axford said.\n\n\u201cBut when your son has been laying in a bed for more than two weeks and can\u2019t move and he probably won\u2019t be able to walk for another couple of months, what you want is just for him to walk.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies place John Axford on family medical emergency list, call up Scott Oberg", "title": "Rockies place John Axford on family medical emergency list, call up Scott Oberg", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/12/rockies-place-john-axford-on-family-medical-emergency-list-call-up-scott-oberg/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150331__john-axfordp1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150331__john-axfordp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T11:58:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T02:14:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeae9\"", "article_summary": "John Axford\u2019s 2-year-old son continues to struggle after suffering a rattlesnake bite, so the Rockies on Sunday moved Axford off their active roster.\nThe team also moved Charlie Culberson to the 60-day disabled list to make room on the 40-man roster for Oberg.\nAnd Axford left the team for a week during spring training to be with his family.\nAxford, a right-handed reliever, was put on the family medical emergency list for a minimum of three days and a maximum of seven.\nAxford\u2019s son, Jameson, was bitten on his right foot by a rattlesnake last month in the backyard of their rental house near Scottsdale during spring training."}
