The majority of women who start out leaning toward an abortion will carry a baby to term after receiving counseling and an ultrasound, the group found.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019ve done through the program is continually investing in the medical clinics that we work with,\u201d Robyn Chambers, director of Option Ultrasound, told The Daily Signal.\n\nOption Ultrasound provides medical services free of charge to women at pregnancy centers around the country. The program helps make the services more widely available.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to go into these clinics and really identify their greatest need,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a replacement machine or additional nurses trained. \u2026 It\u2019s not just one machine and we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nOption Ultrasound, funded entirely by donors, has channeled millions of dollars\u2019 worth of help to pregnancy centers.
