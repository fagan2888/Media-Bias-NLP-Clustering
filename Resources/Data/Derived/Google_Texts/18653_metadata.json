The illegitimate SCOTUS ruling does not name Texas, so fight those lousy bastards. They hate God and want to let the Sodomites queer our country.\u201d\n\nHotze, who pasted in his email a link to a Washington Post blog item, was referring to a defiant statement by Republican Louisiana Attorney General James D. \u201cBuddy\u201d Caldwell.\n\nCaldwell said he\u2019d found no specific line in the court ruling that said that Louisiana had to obey it. \u201cTherefore, there is not yet a legal requirement for officials to issue marriage licenses or perform marriages for same-sex couples in Louisiana,\u201d he said.\n\nHotze, a major Republican campaign donor, closed with an Old Testament verse comparing \u201ca righteous man who gives way before the wicked\u201d with polluted water.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News obtained some of Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s June correspondence about upcoming Supreme Court decisions using the state\u2019s open-records act. However, the two Republican statewide officials invoked exceptions to the law to withhold various items. They have asked Paxton\u2019s open records unit to decide if their withholdings and redactions were appropriate.\n\nThe emails Abbott\u2019s office released show that on the day after the court issued its gay-marriage ruling, he asked aides to print out a copy of Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion so that he could read it \u201con the airplane later today.\u201d\n\nThere was no further explanation. Abbott, a lawyer and former judge and state attorney general, already had issued statements responding to the court.\n\nPaxton\u2019s released emails show that on June 29, Dunn forwarded to him a Wall Street Journal column critical of Kennedy\u2019s opinion by William McGurn. McGurn, once chief speechwriter to former President George W. Bush, predicted \u201cendless litigation\u201d would flow from the court\u2019s action. He warned that the tax-exempt status of private Christian educational institutions could be yanked, and business owners who refuse to cooperate with same-sex weddings could feel the \u201cfull furies\u201d of gay rights zealots.\n\nDunn, a Midland oilman who is the major funder of Empower Texans leader Michael Quinn Sullivan, told Paxton that McGurn wrote a \u201cgood article.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that the AG\u2019s office could represent citizens, churches and schools who \u2026 have their constitutional religious liberties attacked \u2014 by government,\u201d Dunn wrote. \u201cParticularly the federal government. That at least would take away their ability to simply bankrupt everyone with legal fees.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, on Sunday, June 28, Paxton released an attorney general opinion in answer to questions posed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, another GOP social conservative. Among other things, Paxton said many private lawyers \u201cstand ready\u201d to help defend county clerks, their employees and judges and justices of the peace who feel their religious beliefs dictate that they refuse to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples or officiate at gay weddings. Paxton said the legal services would come \u201cin many cases on a pro-bono basis, and I will do everything I can from this office to be a public voice for those standing in defense of their rights.\u201d\n\nOn June 24, two days before the court ruled, Hotze wrote Paxton questioning Bexar County Clerk Gerard Rickhoff\u2019s preparations for a possible decision in favor of same-sex couples. Hotze pasted into the email portions of a San Antonio Express-News story that said Rickhoff\u2019s employees had removed gender references from Bexar County\u2019s marriage licenses, although the references \u2014 at the time \u2014 remained on the state marriage application.\n\nRickhoff \u201cdoes not have the authority to change the marriage license, does he?\u201d Hotze wrote. It\u2019s not clear whether Paxton responded.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Paxton spokeswoman said Hotze\u2019s emails didn\u2019t influence Paxton\u2019s response to the Supreme Court decision.\n\n\u201cIn response to Lt. Gov. Patrick\u2019s request for guidance, our office issued a legal opinion \u2014 which is a nonbinding interpretation of the law,\u201d Paxton said spokeswoman Cynthia Meyer. \u201cThe 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling earlier this month is consistent with our opinion, which emphasizes the importance of protecting religious liberty while enforcing the Supreme Court\u2019s expanded definition of marriage.\u201d\n\nMeyer was referring to federal Circuit Judge Jerry Smith\u2019s July 1 instructions to lower courts in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. As AP reported in this story, Smith told them to conclude their gay marriage cases with orders from the district judges legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nTexas Ethics Commission records show that last December, Dunn gave $50,000 to Paxton, who had just won election as attorney general. Hotze, who is president of Conservative Republicans of Texas, gave Paxton $5,000.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNy9wYXh0b24taW5ib3gtaGludHMtYXQtY2hyaXN0aWFuLWNvbnNlcnZhdGl2ZXMtZnVyeS1vdmVyLXN1cHJlbWUtY291cnQtZ2F5LW1hcnJpYWdlLXJ1bGluZy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
