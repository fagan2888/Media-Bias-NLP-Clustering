I mean, animals have feelings too,\u201d said Dylan.\n\nThe community raised more than enough for doctors to put a plate in his femur.\n\n\"It's been hard for all of us to see that, but he's got great spirit and a great personality and we're happy that we were able to help him,\u201d said Dr. Erin Schelle from County Animal Hospital.\n\n\u201cI asked my dad if I could keep him and my dad said no, we just got a puppy, haha,\u201d said Dylan.\n\nNow the requests to take Red home are flooding in, but we're happy to say Red will have a good home when he leaves the hospital Friday.\n\nYou\u2019ve already met his new mom Hemrick, from Joseph's Legacy. She said it's the first time she's taken a rescue dog home from Joseph\u2019s Legacy.\n\n\u201cI couldn't stand to see him go through anything more than he already has,\u201d said Hemrick. \u201cNo animal deserves to be treated the way he was and we just wanted to ensure that wouldn't happen to him ever again.\"\n\nRed will be on crate rest for two month and will need some physical therapy.\n\nThe extra money raised for Red will go to help other animals in need.\n\nIf you are interested in helping, click here.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 23:45:13 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Tammy Mutasa", "og": {"site_name": "WLWT", "description": "A puppy who was found abused and alone underwent surgery Wednesday.", "title": "Abused puppy on comeback trail after major surgery", "url": "http://www.wlwt.com/news/abused-puppy-on-comeback-trail-after-majory-surgery/36665858", "image": "http://www.wlwt.com/image/view/-/36666456/medRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/ii3d59/-/img-Abused-5-month-old-puppy-has-surgery--on-road-to-recovery.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wlwt.com/news/abused-puppy-on-comeback-trail-after-majory-surgery/36665858", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wlwt://content/article/36665858", "iphone": "wlwt://content/article/36665858", "googleplay": "wlwt://content/article/36665858"}, "name": {"ipad": "wlwt", "iphone": "wlwt", "googleplay": "wlwt"}, "id": {"ipad": 505481301, "iphone": 505481301, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wlwt"}}, "site": "@wlwt", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wlwt://content/article/36665858", "app_name": "wlwt", "package": "com.hearst.android.wlwt"}, "ios": {"url": "wlwt://content/article/36665858", "app_store_id": 505481301, "app_name": "wlwt"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 110757060145}, "google-site-verification": "IkBHONRD-Zbw01u4duml6ZDoxFYSpGz_V-Icj5L0_J0", "keywords": "Cincinnati, Ohio, Red, Roselawn, Reds Urban Youth Academy, abused, recovery, surgery", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/tammymutasaWLWT"}, "news_keywords": "Cincinnati, Ohio, Red, Roselawn, Reds Urban Youth Academy, abused, recovery, surgery", "description": "A puppy who was found abused and alone underwent surgery Wednesday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcaf\"", "article_summary": "WLWT first told you about Red, the puppy who was found alone and abused outside the Reds Urban Youth Academy in Roselawn last week.\nThe community\u2019s love and support helped him get the surgery he needed to repair a fractured femur.\nThe extra money raised for Red will go to help other animals in need.\n\u201cHe was in so much pain, yet at the same time he never lost that, he just loves,\u201d said Janel Hemrick with Joseph\u2019s Legacy.\n\u201cI asked my dad if I could keep him and my dad said no, we just got a puppy, haha,\u201d said Dylan."}
