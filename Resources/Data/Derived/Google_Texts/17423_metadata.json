But Walker\u2019s office doesn\u2019t comment on whether there\u2019s any investigation.\n\nThis specific type of death, by hanging of a young African-American male, has a history in this country and this region. That history includes quick dismissals by state and local officials who wanted to look the other way. Because of that history, there are doubts.\n\nThe NAACP pathologist\u2019s analysis offers additional cause for doubt. The organization is right to seek federal involvement.\n\nThis is not something we want to be in doubt about. We need a genuine effort to discover and analyze the physical and circumstantial evidence in Lacy\u2019s death.\n\nSeek out the truth, then offer a public accounting that will cast aside the burden of doubt.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4ea\"", "article_summary": "We need a genuine effort to discover and analyze the physical and circumstantial evidence in Lacy\u2019s death.\nThis specific type of death, by hanging of a young African-American male, has a history in this country and this region.\nThat history includes quick dismissals by state and local officials who wanted to look the other way.\nSeek out the truth, then offer a public accounting that will cast aside the burden of doubt.\nThe NAACP has asked Thomas Walker, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, for a federal inquiry into whether a hate crime occurred or Lacy\u2019s civil rights were violated."}
