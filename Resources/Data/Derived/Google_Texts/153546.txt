TALLAHASSEE -- Florida lawmakers are poised to end their special session today by passing a $78.7 billion state budget that will boost public education funding to a record level, provide more than $400 million in tax relief and fund hundreds of hometown projects.

“I think all in all it’s a good product,” Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said about the budget bill (SB 2500A), which will face a Senate vote shortly after 5:37 p.m. and then a final vote in the House, ending a 20-day special session that was called when lawmakers failed to pass a budget in their regular session.

Gardiner pointed to the $19.7 billion K-12 funding, which will boost per-student spending by nearly $207 for each of the 2.7 million students in Florida public schools.

Gardiner, who has a son with Down syndrome, said he was also pleased by a number of initiatives aimed at Floridians with developmental disabilities, or “unique abilities,” including the expansion of scholarship accounts and more funding for “Early Steps,” a state intervention program that provides services to infants and toddlers who could be developmentally delayed.

House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, said the budget met the top priorities for the House and Gov. Rick Scott, including more than $400 million in tax cuts and higher education funding.

“I think there is a lot in this budget for everybody and I think the governor will find favor to it,” he said.

But Gardiner also acknowledged that lawmakers have sidestepped the issue of dealing with a huge group of uninsured Floridians, after the House rejected the Senate plan to expand health care coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act. Instead, the House and Senate used $400 million in state funding to boost a complicated funding formula that helps hospitals offset some of the cost of caring for the uninsured.

“Until we come up with a long-term health care solution for the uninsured, that’s just going to be where we are,” Gardiner said.

The rejection of the Medicaid expansion plan was a theme taken up by a number of House Democrats as they debated the budget bill on the House floor on Thursday.

“There is no health care expansion,” said House Democratic leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach, arguing the state lost out on federal funding that could have helped the budget do more. “We left a ton of those dollars, billions of dollars, out of this budget scenario.”

But House Majority Leader Dana Young, R-Tampa, urged members to vote for the budget bill because of what it will provide to the state in addition to the tax cuts and higher education funding.

She cited major funding boosts for child welfare programs and mental health and substance abuse initiatives. Young said the budget included money to take 2,000 disabled Floridians off a waiting list for services in the Agency for Persons with Disabilities.

Young said the budget will provide nearly $82 million for Everglades restoration as well as $50 million for the protection of Florida’s natural springs.

“It is critical that the people back home know what we are doing for them,” Young said. “If you vote no you are snubbing your constituents on these helpful, useful programs.”

Other Democrats criticized how the budget handled spending under the new Amendment 1, which required some $742 million be spent on environmental initiatives. Environmental groups say lawmakers should have devoted more funding than $55 million, including $17.5 million for the Florida Forever program, to land-buying initiatives.

Rep. Evan Jenne, D-Dania Beach, said the environmental budget “violates the intent of the amendment.”

“I have grave concerns that we are going to be sued as a body again,” said Jenne, referring to the threat of a lawsuit by environmental groups and the fact that the House was found in violation of the state constitution by ending its regular session three days early in April.

The new budget also contains hundreds of local economic development, education, historic, social service and environmental projects, including more some $300 million in spending that was added on the final night of budget negotiations on Monday.

The projects range from $2 million for the IMG Academy in Bradenton to $250,000 to buy a Marion County home that was once owned by Ma Barker, the mother of members of the Depression-era Barker-Karpis gang.
