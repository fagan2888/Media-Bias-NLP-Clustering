Everyone\u2019s at standing desks, manipulating their workflow like the cops in Minority Report. The whole thing probably looks a lot like the inside of an Apple store. Hold that picture in your mind \u2014 complete with gleaming surfaces and chrome \u2014 and ask yourself: Does the office of the future have an HR department?\n\nPlayer utilities Popout\n\nShare download This story is based on a radio interview. Listen to the full interview. PRI.org\n\nIt\u2019s hard to picture. The tasks we normally associate with Human Resources \u2014 doing payroll, managing health care, procuring your access badge \u2014 they all seem like candidates for automation. And tech companies like Namely and ZenPayroll are definitely trying to automate big parts of the HR process.\n\nZenPayroll, as you might guess from its name, tries to make payroll easy and stress-free, especially for small businesses. Its payroll software runs on any device with an Internet connection, and it handles all payroll-related functions. Namely automates even more Human Resource work \u2014 tackling benefits, performance reviews and compensation management. It\u2019ll even set up a private social network for your company, to help employees connect and work on projects together.\n\nWith software like that, more companies are doing away with traditional HR departments. A marketing firm in Toronto even replaced Human Resources with two concierges, who do traditional things like arrange mentoring sessions, but also pick up gifts for employees\u2019 family members. Cool, right? Who doesn\u2019t want someone else to remember your boyfriend or girlfriend\u2019s birthday?\n\nBut to be sure, doing away with HR can lead to a whole host of problems.\n\n\u201cOrganizations that have done away with HR completely underestimate the legal consequences,\" says Steven Miranda, managing director of Cornell\u2019s Center for Advanced HR Studies. \"What are the latest regulations on taking care of our veterans? How is the most recent proclamation on the Affordable Care Act going to affect our healthcare plans? So there\u2019s 101 things that are not optional, that are legally required, and not having someone on your staff to take a look at them puts your company at legal and financial risk.\u201d\n\nMiranda believes that all this talk about the \"end of HR\" is shortsighted. He says it serves a critical role, not just keeping companies abreast of laws and regulations, but finding the best people for the organization and integrating them into the company.\n\nIndeed, he points to an issue that's frequently in the news \u2014 the shocking lack of women and minorities within the tech world \u2014 and says it's something that better HR could help solve. \u201cThe [tech companies] would point towards this and say, well, we don\u2019t need diversity, we just need top-level engineers. The reality is, you can have top-level engineers and a diverse workforce, thereby gaining access to even broader talent than what you thought was available before.\u201d\n\nSo, unfortunately for The Office's Michael Scott, it looks like his enemy, Toby from Human Resources, may be part of the workplace of the future. Though hopefully, he\u2019ll be sitting in an ergonomic desk.\n\nThis story first aired as an interview on Innovation Hub with Kara Miller.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "Tech companies see traditional HR functions as being ripe for disruption and innovation \u2014 and that's raised questions about what the future of HR will look like.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Public Radio International", "description": "Tech companies see traditional HR functions as being ripe for disruption and innovation \u2014 and that's raised questions about what the future of HR will look like.", "title": "What does HR look like in the office of the future", "url": "http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-03-03/what-does-hr-look-office-future", "image": "http://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/Travis%2520Wise_1.jpg?itok=-MQLeKWO", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "abstract": "Tech companies see traditional HR functions as being ripe for disruption and innovation \u2014 and that's raised questions about what the future of HR will look like.", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "p": {"domain_verify": "64e034384212a1d25ac7debae5fccf54"}, "fb": {"admins": 16800048, "app_id": 142079625983010}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/publicradiointernational"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 24953039, "title": "What does HR look like in the office of the future", "url": "http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-03-03/what-does-hr-look-office-future", "image": {"src": "http://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/Travis%2520Wise_1.jpg?itok=hrBIqwTx"}, "card": "summary", "description": "Tech companies see traditional HR functions as being ripe for disruption and innovation \u2014 and that's raised questions about what the future of HR will look like."}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd99d\"", "article_summary": "Hold that picture in your mind \u2014 complete with gleaming surfaces and chrome \u2014 and ask yourself: Does the office of the future have an HR department?\nAnd tech companies like Namely and ZenPayroll are definitely trying to automate big parts of the HR process.\n\u201cThe [tech companies] would point towards this and say, well, we don\u2019t need diversity, we just need top-level engineers.\nThe tasks we normally associate with Human Resources \u2014 doing payroll, managing health care, procuring your access badge \u2014 they all seem like candidates for automation.\n\u201cOrganizations that have done away with HR completely underestimate the legal consequences,\" says Steven Miranda, managing director of Cornell\u2019s Center for Advanced HR Studies."}
