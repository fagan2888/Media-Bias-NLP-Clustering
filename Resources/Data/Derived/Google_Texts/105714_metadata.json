Just ask any horse player.\n\nLIBN is blessed with a treasure trove of knowledgeable readers and community leaders who we can call upon for their insights. The response this year was remarkable and came from a wide range of forward-thinking professionals.\n\nIn this edition local futurists expressed a primary theme, one of cautious optimism, a feeling that the economy and Long Island have emerged from the Great Recession and are moving in the right direction.\n\nThis horse player had his best year in 37 years, eye-witnessing American Pharoah capture the Triple Crown at Belmont Park in June. At odds of 3-5, I didn\u2019t make much money that day. Money isn\u2019t everything; I have a memory of a lifetime.\n\nThe last time racing had a Triple Crown champ was 1978, a colt named Affirmed. At the time, the United States had endured the Nixon Watergate scandal and our failure in Vietnam. It was an era that included runaway inflation, a recession and unemployment. There was chaos in the Middle East. Americans would be taken hostage by Islamic extremists.\n\nSound familiar? At least we\u2019ve moved past disco and leisure suits. It would take until the mid-\u201980s for boom times to return.\n\nWhile I\u2019m optimistic about the future, I\u2019m not betting on a rosy outcome just yet. The nation, and by extension, Long Island, needs to make drastic changes.\n\nFor example, our experts implied that healthcare is a mess. The Affordable Care Act has increased premiums and put unacceptable limitations on the quality of care.\n\nAnd I\u2019m all for the ACA, but it has to actually work. It\u2019s not working.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard all year how our students are stressed out over standardized testing, promoted by an agenda designed to make millions and not educate anyone. That needs fixing.\n\nIt\u2019s also time to address the statewide curriculum. The skills needed by the American workforce are changing. An overhaul of the way we teach is long overdue.\n\nOur experts see continued growth, so long as local governments and others don\u2019t get in the way. We should go full steam ahead into downtown revitalization, especially around the transit hubs. The NIMBYs need to stand down. Progress is needed now; affordable housing needs to be a priority.\n\nAnd we need jobs, better paying, high-tech jobs that will drive the economic engine forward.\n\nThe finish line is in sight. Now is the time to pull together and win.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's pull together and win", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Joe Dowd", "og": {"site_name": "Long Island Business News", "description": "Let's pull together and win", "title": "Joe Dowd: 2016 \u2013 Time to get moving", "url": "http://libn.com/2016/01/04/joe-dowd-2016-time-to-get-moving/", "image": "http://libn.com/files/2016/01/American-Pharoah-200x200.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Joe Dowd: 2016 \u2013 Time to get movingLong Island Business News", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "keywords": "forecast, long island, economy, american ph", "google-site-verification": "prJM0F6_hLVnSjClKqHN9f0yCvgWPpfGJpTRzyS7lpo", "y_key": "3dbc4b23a8d3ae0b", "thumbnail": "http://libn.com/files/2016/01/American-Pharoah-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Our experts see continued growth, so long as local governments and others don\u2019t get in the way.\nThis horse player had his best year in 37 years, eye-witnessing American Pharoah capture the Triple Crown at Belmont Park in June.\nLIBN is blessed with a treasure trove of knowledgeable readers and community leaders who we can call upon for their insights.\nThe nation, and by extension, Long Island, needs to make drastic changes.\nIn this edition local futurists expressed a primary theme, one of cautious optimism, a feeling that the economy and Long Island have emerged from the Great Recession and are moving in the right direction."}
