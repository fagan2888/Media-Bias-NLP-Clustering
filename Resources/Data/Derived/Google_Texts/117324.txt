In his first interview since being involved in a fatal crash on the New Jersey Turnpike in June 2014, comedian Tracy Morgan spoke with Today show anchor Matt Lauer Monday about the pain he says he will always feel after losing his fellow comedian and friend, James "Jimmy Mack" McNair.

Morgan sustained broken bones and, as it was revealed later, a traumatic brain injury after a Walmart tractor trailer rear-ended his limousine. The truck driver, Kevin Roper, was driving over 20 miles over the speed limit and hadn’t slept for more than 24 hours. Although Morgan continues on the mend physically, it's the emotional pain he says will make recovery most difficult. He learned of McNair's passing after awakening from his coma.

Once home, Morgan says he felt the weight of what had happened and began to watch the video of the crash as a way to accept the loss of his friend. “I had to know what happened to my friend. I had to know. And I had to pay my respects, and that was my way,” Morgan told Lauer of his decision to replay the footage.

In March, Walmart agreed to pay a $10 million settlement to McNair's family, which Morgan applauded in the interview. “They took full responsibility,” he said.

At various points during the interview, Morgan became visibly emotional and continued to thank those who have been involved in his rehabilitation process, from therapists to nurses and doctors. He plans to continue rehab until his health is restored and then wants to get back to comedy.

“I can’t believe I’m here. I can’t believe I’m in front of you,” Morgan told Lauer.
