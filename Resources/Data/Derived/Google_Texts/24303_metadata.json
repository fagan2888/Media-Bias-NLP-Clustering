(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)</p>\n\nBy Richard Locker\n\nNASHVILLE \u2014 The new Tennessee Legislature opens its two-year run Tuesday with an agenda of controversial issues that would hit Tennesseans in their doctors\u2019 offices, schools, workplaces and pocketbooks.\n\nThat list includes fights over abortion restrictions, a possible gasoline tax hike, tax cuts, school vouchers and Common Core academic standards, guns, and Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s new health insurance proposal.\n\nThe abortion issues come in response to Tennesseans\u2019 ratification of a state constitutional amendment in November that removed abortion rights from the state Constitution and gives the Legislature authority to enact whatever abortion regulations are allowed under U.S. constitutional law. Abortion-restriction bills have already been filed.\n\nLegislative leaders are backing at least three restrictions: a mandatory 24- or 48-hour waiting period before a woman seeking an abortion can undergo the procedure, mandatory pre-abortion counseling and new inspection requirements where abortions are performed.\n\nAs a result, lawmakers will be greeted Tuesday by a \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Nashville,\u201d whose organizers, a coalition called Healthy and Free Tennessee, say will be attended by hundreds \u201cto send a loud and strong message to our lawmakers that we are watching and ready to take action against any laws that restrict our individual rights and threaten the health of Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nThe march will culminate with a rally across from the State Capitol just before the Legislature is gaveled into session.\n\nAfter that, the opening week is largely organizational and ceremonial, with the swearing in of members and the formal re-elections of state Rep. Beth Harwell and state Sen. Ron Ramsey as the House and Senate speakers on Tuesday and the re-elections of state Comptroller Justin Wilson and state Treasurer David Lillard on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, officials from all three branches of state government will pack 50,000 meals for food banks across the state as part of a Campaign Against Hunger community service event organized by Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, and others.\n\nThe week will end next Saturday with the Legislature\u2019s inauguration of Gov. Bill Haslam to a second term.\n\nLegislative leaders then plan to recess the session until Feb. 2, when they will go immediately into a special session called by the governor to consider his alternative Medicaid expansion plan. Harwell and Ramsey said Thursday they expect that session to run a week or two because it will be limited to discussion and action on the governor\u2019s controversial plan.\n\nThat means legislative action on all the other issues won\u2019t begin until mid-February. The 2015 session will likely run through late April and possibly into early May.\n\nThe 109th General Assembly has the largest Republican majority since the 19th century: 28-5 in the Senate, 73-26 in the House. The majority in the Tennessee Senate, 84.8 percent, is second among the states only to the Wyoming Senate\u2019s 86.7 percent.\n\nBut Republicans are deeply divided on some issues, between more traditional business-oriented members and tea party conservatives. Haslam, for example, said Wednesday it will take every Democratic legislator\u2019s vote, plus a share of Republicans, for his \u201cInsure Tennessee\u201d plan to pass.\n\nHarwell acknowledged as much on Thursday that so deeply are Republicans divided on any issue associated with the federal Affordable Care Act, which would fund the governor\u2019s plan.\n\nThe special session pushes back the governor\u2019s budget presentation and all the fiscal battles associated with it, including higher tuition on the state\u2019s public campuses.\n\nHaslam and his transportation commission have spoken of the need for more highway funding, but he hasn\u2019t said yet whether he\u2019ll ask for a gasoline tax hike to pay for it. A statewide Transportation Coalition of Tennessee, made up of business and other groups, has formed to lobby for a fuel tax increase, but even though the last state gas tax hike occurred in 1989, it will still face an uphill battle among lawmakers pledged to raise no taxes.\n\nIn education, there will be battles over efforts by conservatives to repeal the Common Core state standards in math and English language arts; vouchers, which divert public school funding to pay private school tuition; and how textbooks are chosen.\n\nThe Legislature will again consider whether to abolish the authority of city and county governments to ban guns in local parks, and some gun activists are pushing for fewer restrictions on guns elsewhere, including revisions in the 2013 law allowing handgun-carry permit holders to keep guns in their cars at work despite employer policies.\n\nThere are also efforts to cut the state\u2019s Hall income tax on certain interest and stock dividends, which Haslam says the state can\u2019t currently afford.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Long list of controversial issues for new General Assembly", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/long-list-of-controversial-issues-for-new-general-assembly-ep-869063528-353687901.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/0504_kclo_ipadjudges_1411395836982_8300954_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 464}, "type": "article", "description": "NASHVILLE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The new Tennessee Legislature opens its two-year run Tuesday with an agenda of controversial issues that would hit Tennesseans in their doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, schools, workplaces and pocketbooks.", "title": "Long list of controversial issues for new General Assembly"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/0504_kclo_ipadjudges_1411395836982_8300954_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Long list of controversial issues for new General Assembly", "description": "NASHVILLE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The new Tennessee Legislature opens its two-year run Tuesday with an agenda of controversial issues that would hit Tennesseans in their doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, schools, workplaces and pocketbooks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde886\"", "article_summary": "The majority in the Tennessee Senate, 84.8 percent, is second among the states only to the Wyoming Senate\u2019s 86.7 percent.\n<p>This photo taken Sept. 19, 2009, shows the Tennessee state Capitol in Nashville.\n(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)</p>By Richard LockerNASHVILLE \u2014 The new Tennessee Legislature opens its two-year run Tuesday with an agenda of controversial issues that would hit Tennesseans in their doctors\u2019 offices, schools, workplaces and pocketbooks.\nThat list includes fights over abortion restrictions, a possible gasoline tax hike, tax cuts, school vouchers and Common Core academic standards, guns, and Gov.\nThe 109th General Assembly has the largest Republican majority since the 19th century: 28-5 in the Senate, 73-26 in the House."}
