It\u2019s a campaign season in which violence against protesters is increasingly commonplace and even candidates\u2019 spouses are not exempt from attack ads and threats from their opponents.\n\nOne result has been that some groups are now seriously concerned about the physical safety and emotional well-being of people involved in the race. Though in some cases, the response seems more logical than others.\n\nRelated: Trump Wins Arizona and Gets Ugly, Threatening Cruz\u2019s Wife\n\nA story in The Washington Post on Wednesday revealed that National Public Radio has begun offering reporters assigned to cover Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the GOP nomination an abbreviated version of the training that they offer reporters covering armed conflicts and other dangerous events.\n\nClearly, NPR isn\u2019t treating covering Trump rallies as the equivalent of sending reporters into a combat zone. However, violence at the Republican frontrunner\u2019s rallies has become increasingly common, and Trump himself frequently directs his supporters\u2019 attention to the \u201cpen\u201d in which reporters are forced to stand as he rages about the \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d media. At least once, he has called out an individual reporter by name in front of thousands of his angry supporters.\n\nSo, it seems understandable when NPR senior vice president of news Michael Orsekes told the Post that the network thought it might be wise to offer reporters some training on how to deal with \u201cdangerous or possibly hostile environments.\u201d\n\nBut the Post isn\u2019t the only organization concerned about the well-being of people attending Trump rallies.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Turn US Military into the World\u2019s Rent-a-Cop\n\nLate Tuesday, The Daily Beast website reported that the white supremacist American Freedom Party is launching the Trump Harassment Hotline \u201cto help those who are attacked physically and verbally for supporting Trump.\u201d\n\nThe 24-hour hotline will reportedly be staffed with attorneys and counselors who can advise Trump supporters on whether they have an actionable legal claim, attorney William Daniel Johnson, the American Freedom Party\u2019s leader, told the website.\n\nSo far, though, while there has been plenty of verbal abuse directed at Trump supporters \u2013 mainly from groups opposed to racism and religious bigotry \u2013 most of the documented violence at Trump rallies has involved the billionaire Republican frontrunner\u2019s supporters sucker-punching defenseless protesters. That may not stop the Trump Harassment Hotline from doing a booming business, though.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The white supremacist American Freedom Party is launching the Trump Harassment Hotline \u201cto help those who are attacked physically and verbally for supporting Trump.\u201d", "title": "White Supremacist Trump Supporters Launch 24-Hour Hotline", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/White-Supremacist-Trump-Supporters-Launch-24-Hour-Hotline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/us-usa-election-trump-foreign_5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/White-Supremacist-Trump-Supporters-Launch-24-Hour-Hotline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/us-usa-election-trump-foreign_5.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The white supremacist American Freedom Party is launching the Trump Harassment Hotline \u201cto help those who are attacked physically and verbally for supporting Trump.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Clearly, NPR isn\u2019t treating covering Trump rallies as the equivalent of sending reporters into a combat zone.\nSo far, though, while there has been plenty of verbal abuse directed at Trump supporters \u2013 mainly from groups opposed to racism and religious bigotry \u2013 most of the documented violence at Trump rallies has involved the billionaire Republican frontrunner\u2019s supporters sucker-punching defenseless protesters.\nThat may not stop the Trump Harassment Hotline from doing a booming business, though.\nAt least once, he has called out an individual reporter by name in front of thousands of his angry supporters.\nOne result has been that some groups are now seriously concerned about the physical safety and emotional well-being of people involved in the race."}
