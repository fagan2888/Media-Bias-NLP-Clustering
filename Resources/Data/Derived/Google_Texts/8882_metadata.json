So it\u2019s a bunk, fallacious argument that we are wasting time discussing.\n\nThe two weren\u2019t done battling, but Hannity was forced to wrap up the segment.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 78, "twitter": {"description": "Appearing on \u201cHannity\u201d Tuesday night, TheBlaze\u2019s Dana Loesch clashed with Patricia Ireland, a leader in the feminist movement and former president of the National Organization for Women, over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case.
