Hobby Lobby, in the spotlight this week for winning its fight in the U.S. Supreme Court against paying for some types contraception for its employees, will open its first store in the New Orleans metro area's south shore later this month.

The national craft-store chain already operates 11 outlets in Louisiana including Slidell and Covington. Hobby Lobby said this week it will open July 14 at the Elmwood Village Shopping Center at 5151 Citrus Blvd.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Monday that closely held businesses can refuse to provide contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs, in a case that started with Hobby Lobby and cabinet maker Conestoga Wood Specialties.

Hobby Lobby, whose family owners say they run the firm on religious principles, challenged a requirement under the federal Affordable Care Act to pay for certain types of contraception coverage for its employees. The family argued that emergency contraceptives for women, such as Plan B and ella, are tantamount to abortion.

Hobby Lobby has more than 600 big-box crafting and home decor stores nationwide.
