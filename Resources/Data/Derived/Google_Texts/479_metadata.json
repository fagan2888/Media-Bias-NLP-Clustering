How many ways is this wrong? Let us count:\n\n1. California already has a high-speed transportation network.\n\nIts called the airlines. They\u2019re not going to build a train that can outrun a Boeing 737. Some 16,000 people fly between Los Angeles and San Francisco every day. How many trains would it take to put a dent in that total?\n\n2. California is broke.\n\nThe once prosperous state has more bankrupt cities than any other. And the price for this rail system keeps going up, the goalposts keep moving. Voters approved a $9.95 billion bond package for the train in 2008 based on the projections of a final cost of about $45 billion. But last year the agency in charge of organizing the project put the tab at $98 billion. Reshuffling the routes helped shave $30 billion off the tab (and slow down the train considerably) but does anybody think a project like this is going to come in on or under budget. Boston\u2019s Big Dig was sold to the voters as a $2.6 billion project. Final tally was more like $14.6 billion.\n\n3. Tickets are too expensive.\n\nProponents at first bragged of one-way tickets costing $50. Now it\u2019s looking more like $120+. Southwest Airlines has nine flights a day covering that route; $59 one way.\n\n4. The trains keep getting slower.\n\nCalifornia voters were originally promised a train trip that would be 2 hours and 40 minutes or less. As the political mud wrestling moves along that travel time has been extended to 3 hours, 40 minutes\u2013and that\u2019s only on the express train. Add the typical 40 to 60 minute commute it requires to get anywhere in LA or San Francisco, and high speed rail passengers will save at best an hour over the six-hour driving time.\n\n5. It\u2019s not all that green.\n\nIn terms of greenhouse gas emissions high speed trains are about on par with airplanes. Cars are more polluting but add a passenger and you cut the emissions per passenger mile in half. Add the whole Griswold family for a vacation and you\u2019re practically an honorary member of Greenpeace.\n\n\u2026\n\nSo California\u2019s over-promised high-speed rail is already under-delivered before construction starts. It is a liberal pipe dream that duplicates less-expensive alternatives and sold under the sham pretext of being the greener alternative. Sounds like Obamacare to me\u2014which was overpromised and catastrophically under-delivered, reproducing at often higher costs medical plans that were already available, and sold under so many sham pretenses that a full count has not yet been tallied.\n\nAs impossible as it sounds, California\u2019s high-speed rail ambitions are in one way actually worse than Obamacare. At least Obamacare tried to solve a problem everybody recognizes in the high cost of medical care in the United States.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s high speed rail is a solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Equipment World Magazine - Construction Equipment, News and Information", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Equipment World", "og": {"url": "http://www.equipmentworld.com/fast-train-to-nowhere-5-reasons-why-high-speed-rail-is-the-next-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.equipmentworld.com/files/2013/11/california-high-speed-rail-04-lg-1024x576.png", "type": "article", "title": "Fast Train to Nowhere: 5 reasons why high-speed rail is the next Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Equipment_World", "image": "http://www.equipmentworld.com/files/2013/11/california-high-speed-rail-04-lg-1024x576.png", "description": "California is chugging along in it's crusade to build a high-speed rail system linking Los Angeles and San Francisco.
