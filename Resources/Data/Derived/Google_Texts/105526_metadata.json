On top of that, we've had the rapid change in the construction market, materials market, the labor market. We have seen some expansion of costs.\"\n\nHilliard said campus officials could be going before the Board of Regents again this fall to ask for additional spending authority.\n\nThe campus already added $13 million to the cost of the project a year ago because of poor soil conditions and high labor costs. That brought the project's initial $143 million budget up to $156 million.\n\nIf approved by the board, the newest budget could be $160 million, a 12 percent cost increase since the project was first approved by the board in December 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the campus is financing the expansion with about $150 million in bond revenues, the athletic department is responsible for the full cost and plans to pay for the upgrades with fundraising, business contracts and community partnerships.\n\nSo far, the athletic department says it has raised nearly $77 million \u2014 $18 million in endowment funding and $58 million for construction.\n\nAthletic department officials launched the \"Drive for $105M\" campaign in January and want to raise $85 million in capital funding and $20 million in endowment funding.\n\nOfficials with Mortenson Construction, which is leading the expansion and remodel, declined to answer questions and instead sent an emailed statement.\n\n\"Mortenson is currently working with CU to finalize our final contract value and schedule,\" wrote Nancy Kristof, a spokeswoman for the company.\n\nWork began in the spring of 2014 and is expected to be completely finished by the spring or summer of 2016, Hilliard said. The stadium upgrades are set for completion Sept. 12, he said.\n\nHilliard said other campus construction projects may also require more spending authority, some of which could be presented to the regents' capital construction committee Aug. 19 in Denver.\n\nHilliard declined to specify which other projects may need budget increases, but he said the $25 million 580-space parking garage to be built under the indoor practice facility should finish on budget.\n\n\"It's safe to say right now with all of our major projects that we are evaluating the numbers and looking at that exact thing,\" Hilliard said.\n\nAlready this year, rising costs delayed the start of a project to construct a building atop the Euclid Autopark garage. Planners are reworking the design of the $43 million Center for Academic Success and Excellence to stay within the budget, officials said.\n\nHilliard said the campus plans to reflect on these construction challenges to develop a system that allows CU to \"adjust more quickly to market conditions.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28606301/cu-boulder-stadium-expansion-needs-extra-4m", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28606301:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-08T15:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The $156 million price tag on the  University of Colorado's stadium expansion and remodeling project could be getting bigger.", "title": "CU-Boulder: Stadium expansion needs extra $4M", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28606301/cu-boulder-stadium-expansion-needs-extra-4m", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0807/20150807__09DCAATHw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-08-09T10:34:00-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-08T15:00:00-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-08-07T22:46:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-08T15:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder: Stadium expansion needs extra $4M", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "The $156 million price tag on the  University of Colorado's stadium expansion and remodeling project could be getting bigger.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28606301/cu-boulder-stadium-expansion-needs-extra-4m", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The $156 million price tag on the  University of Colorado's stadium expansion and remodeling project could be getting bigger.", "title": "CU-Boulder: Stadium expansion needs extra $4M"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a45\"", "article_summary": "On top of that, we've had the rapid change in the construction market, materials market, the labor market.\nHilliard said campus officials could be going before the Board of Regents again this fall to ask for additional spending authority.\nHilliard said other campus construction projects may also require more spending authority, some of which could be presented to the regents' capital construction committee Aug. 19 in Denver.\nIncrease would bring project budget to $160 million, up from initial $143 millionThe $156 million price tag on the University of Colorado's stadium expansion and remodeling project could be getting bigger.\nPlanners are reworking the design of the $43 million Center for Academic Success and Excellence to stay within the budget, officials said."}
