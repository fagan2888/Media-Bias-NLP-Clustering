Equipment is expensive. Trained personnel must be available in an instant. And though ambulances are busier than ever responding to calls from senior citizens in aging suburbs, each year cities collect a smaller percentage of what they bill for ambulance runs.\n\nSome cities, such as partners Apple Valley, Lakeville and Farmington, have decided it\u2019s easier to guarantee quality service by hiring an outside provider.\n\nCities such as Edina, Burnsville and St. Paul, meanwhile, say that they are committed to their ambulance services and that they are proud of their speedy response times.\n\n\u201cThis is something that our residents have grown to appreciate and expect,\u201d said Edina City Manager Scott Neal. \u201cThey like it when the city shows up to help at what is sometimes their lowest moment.\u201d\n\nBurnsville Fire Chief B.J. Jungmann echoed that.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those public service things where residents get excellent care and excellent response,\u201d Jungmann said. \u201cWe get people who stop by our stations, send notes and call. They are very thankful for the service.\u201d\n\nIn St. Paul, where city officials say the survival rate for cardiac arrest patients is two to three times higher than average, the ambulance service also is efficient, said Steve Zaccard, the city\u2019s fire marshal.\n\n\u201cFirefighters are being used for ambulance service, as well; it\u2019s dual staffing,\u201d Zaccard said.\n\nSince 1980, Minnesota has been divided into ambulance service areas, with one license holder per area.\n\nAmong 321 ambulance services, 47 are linked to city fire departments and another 110 are public services that likely are connected to cities, according to the Minnesota Emergency Medical Services Regulatory Board.\n\nCovering costs tricky\n\nAnyone who runs an ambulance service knows they are likely to collect only part of what they charge for an emergency trip, said Buck McAlpin, who works with North Memorial Health Care and is lead lobbyist for the ambulance industry in Minnesota. Ambulance services that charge $1,400 for an emergency trip usually are reimbursed $425 or $450 by Medicare or Medicaid, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a community-based system, city councils have to look at this as a service they want to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say the majority of large fire [department]-based systems do not cover their costs, so they offset with tax dollars.\u201d\n\nSome smaller cities have dropped their ambulance service and hired larger organizations such as hospitals or health companies to provide the service, McAlpin said.\n\n\u201cMost all of these shifted from city-based [emergency medical service] to large hospital-based [services] because of economy of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can buy materials cheaper when we buy in bulk. Buying 12 ambulances is cheaper than buying one.\u201d\n\nIn the case of partner cities Apple Valley, Lakeville and Farmington, the three agreed to drop their ambulance service in 2008 to contract with Allina Health and to improve service, said Steve Mielke, Lakeville city administrator.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about quality of care,\u201d Mielke said. \u201cFor smaller agencies, it can be difficult just to maintain the latest and most up-to-date capabilities and training. \u2026 We\u2019re very pleased. They\u2019ve brought a level of expertise we didn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nHiring Allina eased the burden on city employees who were responsible for running the ambulance service. The city consortium still holds the ambulance license, which Mielke said allows it to change providers if service isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nIn 2008, the cities estimated that hiring Allina collectively would save them $61,000 each year.\n\nFirefighters as paramedics\n\nIn cities where ambulance service is part of fire department duties, the cost of emergency services is embedded in the overall fire department budget.\n\nAs fire prevention has improved and fire calls have declined for many departments, the primary job of firefighters is now responding to medical calls.\n\nNew firefighters in Burnsville and Edina must also be certified paramedics. In Burnsville and St. Paul, 70 to 75 percent of emergency calls are medical. In Edina, it\u2019s more than 80 percent.\n\n\u201cSome people would say we are an ambulance service that provides fire service,\u201d said Darrell Todd, Edina\u2019s interim fire chief. \u201cI see us as an all-hazard service.\u201d\n\nWhile the number of medical calls in Edina has grown by 35 percent since 2000, the collection rate on ambulance bills has dropped from 84 percent in 2002 to 42 percent in 2012. Burnsville\u2019s collection rate dropped from 67 percent in 2003 to 49 percent in 2012. Most of the gap in payment is due to changes in Medicare reimbursement.\n\nThe cities have coped by raising charges for ambulance runs. So far, that and the increasing number of emergency trips have combined to raise revenue from ambulance operations: Edina\u2019s ambulance revenue increased from $1.3 million in 2002 to more than $1.8 million in 2012, while Burnsville collected $1.1 million in 2003 and $1.9 million in 2012. Both cities put that money in their general funds, as does St. Paul.\n\nEdina\u2019s Todd said it\u2019s the service, not the money, that matters.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s great that we can offset our costs, this is the level of service that the City Council has decided it wants to provide,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe city\u2019s function isn\u2019t necessarily to make money. We\u2019re here to provide services to people and business owners.\u201d\n\nSt. Paul has 12 ambulances that run out of 15 fire stations, Burnsville four ambulances at two stations and Edina three ambulances at two stations.\n\nIn Edina, most police are trained as emergency medical technicians, and they carry oxygen and external defibrillators in their cars. Because they are already out in the community, they often are the first responders to a medical call.\n\nJohn Wallin, Edina\u2019s finance director, said he thinks it would be hard for an outside provider to improve on the service the city already offers.\n\n\u201cThey probably would not keep two ambulance sites in Edina, so response times would be different,\u201d Wallin said. \u201cAnd minutes can make a difference.\u201d\n\nNavigating health changes\n\nNeal, the Edina city manager, said the city is watching ambulance reimbursement trends and wondering about how the Affordable Care Act might affect ambulance use.\n\nHe said the city is in discussions with Fairview Southdale Hospital in Edina about possibly expanding paramedics\u2019 duties by having some act as \u201ccommunity paramedics.\u201d In this role, they would check on people after they\u2019ve been discharged from the hospital and help them manage their health at home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s a strong possibility the city might be involved in that kind of activity,\u201d Neal said.\n\nHe said it\u2019s all part of navigating a changing health landscape.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned because our costs don\u2019t drop,\u201d Neal said. \u201cWe are not going to refuse assistance.
