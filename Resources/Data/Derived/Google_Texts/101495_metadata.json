Unfortunately, the news is even worse than that. While the nation\u2019s eyes are riveted to the national stage, Republicans continue the multi-decade project of turning our nation into a right-wing wasteland by focusing their efforts where they can have the most impact with the least attention: state legislatures.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get inured to the relentless drumbeat of stories of Republican-controlled state legislatures passing bills codifying the culture war obsessions of the right, and with the Republican primary serving as a distraction, the state horror show is getting less national attention than it usually does. Which is how Republicans like it, because they can maximize the damage while minimizing the pushback. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to pay attention, even if it can, at times, be overwhelming.\n\nAs it has been for years now, the No. 1 priority for Republican state legislatures is making sex as fraught and unsafe an experience as possible for women, especially low-income women. As I reported earlier last week, Florida passed a massive bill that will cut off access to both birth control and abortion, by reducing funding and passing medically unnecessary restrictions to make it simply too expensive to offer affordable care to women, especially through Planned Parenthood.\n\nNow Indiana\u2019s Legislature has passed a bill that forces women to give birth if a doctor has detected a fetal abnormality. Which, yes, would mean that a pregnant woman who contracts Zika would lose her right to abortion, while a woman with a healthy pregnancy would retain her right to say no to giving birth. Even some Republicans balked at the sadistic pleasure their colleagues take in the idea of forcing women to give birth to children who will suffer, die or be too much for women to care for.\n\n\u201cToday is a perfect example of a bunch of middle-aged guys sitting in this room making decisions about what we think is best for women,\u201d state Rep. Sean Eberhart, a Republican, said. He voted no on the advice of his wife.\n\nThe breathless obsession with making sure all those sex-having women pay has completely enthralled state legislatures across the country. Oklahoma state Sen. Nathan Dahm is pushing a bill that would strip any doctor who performs an abortion of his or her medical license. His colleague, state Sen. Joseph Silk, went one further, authoring a bill that would charge anyone who performs an abortion of murder. Both bills have come out of committee, though Senate Republicans are holding the murder bill from a vote right now. Hopefully they\u2019ll keep it that way, because they look like a bunch of yahoos.\n\nIn Iowa, state Sen. Jake Chapman is trying to make abortion a \u201chate crime.\u201d This is no doubt based on right-wing propaganda that argues that women get abortions because they have irrational bigotry toward embryos and not because of mundane things like they want to control when and how they have children.\n\nAnd, of course, you have the Planned Parenthood defunding orgies. On top of Florida, the legislatures in Missouri, Virginia and Arizona all took steps to cut Planned Parenthood patients off from getting affordable checkups and contraception.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's going on in Republican-run state legislatures is just as terrifying as the GOP presidential race", "title": "This is where right-wing radicalism is festering: While the nation watches the presidential race, there are scary things happening at state legislatures", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "What's going on in Republican-run state legislatures is just as terrifying as the GOP presidential race", "title": "This is where right-wing radicalism is festering: While the nation watches the presidential race, there are scary things happening at state legislatures", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/13/this_is_where_right_wing_radicalism_is_festering_while_the_nation_watches_the_presidential_race_there_are_scary_things_happening_at_state_legislatures/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/pence_dahm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What's going on in Republican-run state legislatures is just as terrifying as the GOP presidential race", "title": "This is where right-wing radicalism is festering: While the nation watches the presidential race, there are scary things happening at state legislatures", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/pence_dahm.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, abortion rights, Arizona, Contraception, Dark Money, Elections 2016, Florida, Gay Marriage, Georgia, Gun Control, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Planned Parenthood, Same-sex marriage, Sanctuary Cities, sharia law, state legislature", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1965\"", "article_summary": "1 priority for Republican state legislatures is making sex as fraught and unsafe an experience as possible for women, especially low-income women.\nThe breathless obsession with making sure all those sex-having women pay has completely enthralled state legislatures across the country.\nWhile the nation\u2019s eyes are riveted to the national stage, Republicans continue the multi-decade project of turning our nation into a right-wing wasteland by focusing their efforts where they can have the most impact with the least attention: state legislatures.\nNow Indiana\u2019s Legislature has passed a bill that forces women to give birth if a doctor has detected a fetal abnormality.\nBoth bills have come out of committee, though Senate Republicans are holding the murder bill from a vote right now."}
