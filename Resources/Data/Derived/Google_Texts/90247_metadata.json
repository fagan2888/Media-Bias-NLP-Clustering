The specific facility consists of eight 500-foot high, 2.5 megawatt industrial wind turbines.\n\nThe board made its finding with a 4-0 vote (three members were not present) at an Oct. 14 meeting after it had wrestled with health complaints about the wind plant for more than four years. Ultimately, the board\u2019s ruling was based on a year-long survey which documented health complaints and demonstrated that infrasound and low-frequency noise emanating from the turbines was detectable inside homes within a 6.2-mile radius of the industrial wind plant.\n\nJay Tibbetts, a physician and a member of the Brown County Board of Health, said the board based its position that the turbines constitute a health hazard on the weight of evidence.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we are absolutely not an anti-wind energy board,\u201d Tibbetts said. \u201cWe worked on this for four and a half years before making this decision. Three families have moved out. I knew all of them. We also know that this isn\u2019t only happening here. In Ontario 40 families have abandoned their homes to get away from the effects of wind turbines.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tibbetts, micro barometers were placed in homes located in the area surrounding the industrial wind plant. The purpose of this was to detect acoustic emissions, including infrasound and low frequency noise emanating from the turbines.\n\n\u201cThey found that there were tones of infrasound and low frequency noise as far away as 6.2 miles from the nearest wind turbine,\u201d Tibbetts said. \u201cThere were no complaints associated with the home that was 6.2 miles away, but there were complaints associated with one 4.2 miles away.\n\n\u201cWe have 80 people on record who have made health complaints, including a nurse who is going deaf,\u201d Tibbetts continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t just ignore this.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these problems, I am aware that wind turbines sin arid locales, such as the massive wind farm near Palm Springs, California, kick uop a lot of dust, aka particulate matter. Moreover, there is no mention of the toll on migratory birds that tend to follow the same wind patterns that wind farms are situated to exploit.
