Lawsuits brought by the families of patients who were denied coverage added to the pressure on insurers. In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled that health plans must cover residential treatment for anorexia under California\u2019s parity law. The higher reimbursement rates offered some relief to families, who had often mortgaged their houses or drained their savings to pay for critically needed care.\n\nThey also attracted the attention of Wall Street investors, who saw profits in providing treatment for so-called behavioral health problems like eating disorders, alcoholism and drug abuse. \u201cThe number of covered lives is growing faster than the availability of services to treat them, creating compelling investment opportunities,\u201d the accounting and consulting firm BDO noted last year in an article on its website, referring to the effects of the legal changes.\n\nAs the industry has expanded, larger centers have acquired smaller ones and some programs, flush with private equity investments, have expanded across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor example, Monte Nido, a treatment program founded by Carolyn Costin, a former teacher who recovered from an eating disorder, began with a center in Malibu.\n\nBut in 2012, with financing from Centre Partners, a middle-market equity firm, Monte Nido began opening new residential centers and day-treatment programs. The company now has centers in Oregon, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York, including one in a renovated mansion in Westchester County.\n\nSign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.\n\nLast year, noting that the investment had \u201ctripled the company\u2019s facility footprint during our ownership period,\u201d Centre Partners sold Monte Nido to another investment firm, Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, for an undisclosed sum.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Monte Nido\u2019s [sic] approach to eating disorder treatment is what you and others like you have been waiting for,\u201d Ms. Costin wrote in a letter to potential patients on the company\u2019s website, which includes images of beaches, mountains and the Boston skyline on its home page.\n\nWith a need to fill more beds, marketers for some centers make cold calls to psychiatrists, psychotherapists, medical doctors and others who treat eating disorders, offering to inform them about a program\u2019s advantages and inviting them to visit.\n\nThe Denver-based Eating Recovery Center has a call center and employs 20 \u201cprofessional relations liaisons\u201d who contact clinicians across the country. The author and motivational speaker Jenni Schaefer, who recovered from an eating disorder, recently joined the program\u2019s outreach team. On its website, the company, which began with a single center, bills itself as \u201cthe only national health care system devoted to serious eating disorders at all levels of care.\u201d\n\nCraig Johnson, a well-known eating disorders specialist, joined the company in 2010 and has seen it through its expansion to 24 treatment programs in seven states, including three residential centers. He said when therapists visit, the focus is education, not entertainment. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering lectures,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.\n\nSome therapists see the offer of free trips as a chance to view the facilities that they might recommend to patients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnn Jacob Smith, a family therapist in Chevy Chase, Md., said that last year, she accepted an invitation to visit the Oliver-Pyatt eating disorders center in Miami. (The center is now part of Monte Nido).\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely promotional,\u201d she said, \u201cBut it was actually really educational. They took us in depth into what they did.\u201d\n\nHer later referrals were not influenced by the visit, she added. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed by being romanced.\u201d\n\nBut Adrian Brown, a psychiatrist in Virginia, said that therapists who had not gone through the \u201cbattle phase\u201d with drug companies might not even realize they were being swayed by financial interests.\n\nDr. Brown recalled being offered a \u201cV.I.P.\u201d trip to a treatment center, with the representative telling her, \u201cWe will pay your way, put you up in a really nice hotel, all expenses paid, yoga and whatever.\u201d\n\nDr. Brown responded, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not ethical.\u201d\n\nThe representative replied, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Another invitation arrived the next year.\n\nPhoto\n\nMixed Results\n\nProspective patients or family members searching for a treatment program sometimes turn to sites like edtreatmentreview.com or www.edtxreviews.com, where former patients describe their experiences at different centers, evaluating the staff, critiquing the food and noting whether cellphones are allowed.\n\nMany reviewers have spent time in more than one residential center and the opinions on any particular program vary widely, a range reflected in interviews with former patients over the last several months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTina Klaus, a 51-year-old artist who has struggled with bulimia since she was 10, said residential care was initially useful.\n\n\u201cResidential treatment is vital when you are at your ultimate rock bottom\u201d she said. But once home, her illness worsened because \u201cyou\u2019re going back into your life, you\u2019re going back into all the emotions you used your eating disorder to hide from.\u201d\n\nMelissa R., 28, who asked that her last name not be used for reasons of privacy, said after several hospitalizations for anorexia, beginning when she was 21, she found a residential center in the Southwest on the Internet and spent six weeks there. The center, which she described as \u201cmore like a resort,\u201d was \u201csomewhat helpful,\u201d she said, but not worth the time and money.\n\n\u201cPeople were nice, and the food was really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI had fun, I enjoyed rock climbing and stuff, but that\u2019s not why I was there. I\u2019m paying a lot of money to get well, not to rock climb.\u201d\n\nLast year, she spent two months at Eating Recovery Center in Denver, moving from residential care to day treatment, and began to gain control of her illness. \u201cE.R.C. was the best place I\u2019ve been,\u201d she said about the center. \u201cThey were very individualized.\u201d\n\nAshley Bilkie, 29, had a different experience with E.R.C. When she returned home in February 2015 after about six months in the Denver program \u2014 her fourth stay in an inpatient program for treatment of anorexia and her second at E.R.C. \u2014 \u201cI was getting sicker and sicker,\u201d she said. She lost the weight she had gained back at the center. \u201cI had to buy children\u2019s clothing,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was evasive with her parents. At the recovery center, she said, \u201cIt was kind of like they set up a battle between myself and my parents.\u201d For their part, Ms. Bilkie\u2019s parents, who for years had watched their daughter\u2019s health decline, grew frantic. Ms. Bilkie would disappear, her father, Robert Bilkie, said, and he would find her wandering the aisles at Kroger or Target. Driving through the neighborhood, he half-expected to see her hanging from a tree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a parent\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was also expensive. Mr. Bilkie, a financial adviser in Michigan, calculated that over three years, he paid at least $350,000 for unreimbursed inpatient care for his daughter. The Eating Recovery Center, he said, sent him bills for $30,000 each month. Mr. Bilkie paid willingly \u2014 he was desperate to see Ashley get well, he said \u2014 but no program seemed to produce lasting results.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe spent an outrageous amount of money for what really amounted to ineffectual treatment,\u201d Mr. Bilkie said.\n\nLast fall, Ms. Bilkie entered the eating disorder center at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, a university affiliated program.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe staff there gradually weaned her off some drugs she had been taking taking at the center in Denver, including high doses of Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Adderall, an attention deficit drug and a stimulant.\n\nIn group therapy, other patients put pressure on her to change her behavior. It was a switch, she said, from previous groups, where patients talked about their problems. With the program\u2019s stress on weight restoration \u2014 studies show that it is the best predictor of how anorexic patients will do once they leave, rather than, say, elevated mood \u2014 her weight returned to normal.\n\nShe was discharged in November and continues to do well.\n\n\u201cI hated every single solitary second of it,\u201d she said of the experience. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing, because I was not comfortable, and it meant that something was working.\u201d\n\nDr. Ovidio Bermudez, the chief clinical officer of Eating Recovery Center, said that other patients have fared poorly at academic centers and then done well at E.R.C. Despite Ms. Bilkie\u2019s perception, he said, therapists at the program did not try to divide patients from their families. (Ms. Bilkie gave Eating Recovery Center permission to discuss her case.)\n\n\u201cWe would have to filter this through 20/20 hindsight,\u201d Dr. Bermudez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to know what somebody\u2019s frame of mind is and the degree of fragility they bring to any treatment experience.\u201d\n\nDr. Anne Marie O\u2019Melia, a psychiatrist at the recovery center, said Ms. Bilkie was on Xanax when she arrived and was fearful of reducing the drug\u2019s dosage, though the center tried. She was switched to Adderall from another stimulant at E.R.C., Dr. O\u2019Melia said, to treat \u201csignificant impulsivity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeeking Standards\n\nMs. Bilkie\u2019s history of ups and downs is not unusual for patients with eating disorders.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, you see one step forward, two steps back,\u201d said Dr. Mark Friedlander, the chief medical officer for Aetna Behavioral Health.\n\nHis company, Dr. Friedlander said, considers residential care essential for treatment of some patients. But, he said, a lack of outcome studies, an absence of industry standards and a patchwork licensing system across states make it difficult for Aetna or other insurers to evaluate care.\n\n\u201cWe would love to see greater consistency and higher standards,\u201d he said.\n\nTo that end, a group of eating disorder specialists from treatment centers, including Eating Recovery Center and Monte Nido, have developed a list of minimum requirements for accreditation of residential programs. The Joint Commission, an independent company that accredits health care facilities, has adopted the requirements, which go into effect July 1.\n\nDr. Lampert, president of the consortium, said the centers in the organization were also collecting data on patient outcomes, lengths of stay and other variables, with each center collecting data on 15 consecutive admissions of adults and adolescents.\n\nIn the meantime, many patients and families will continue to rely on word of mouth and any information they can find online.\n\n\u201cThese are black boxes,\u201d Dr. Scott Hadland, an adolescent medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School, said of the residential centers. \u201cPeople get the idea that these are places that can heal just based on what they see on a website or in the photos.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Residential Treatment Centers", "tone": "news", "ptime": 20160314135319, "twitter": {"description": "A proliferation of residential centers has
