The Brazilian jungle city of Manaus is home to exotic dining options, from the tart “mari mari” fruit that looks like a giant string bean to barbecued fish ribs from the giant “piracuru” to soup made from flesh-eating piranha.

Some places to sample local delights:

___

O CANTO DA PEIXADA: This fish restaurant of plastic tables and chairs on the sidewalk is the stuff of local legend. Pope John Paul II ate here in 1980. An extensive menu, translated into inventive English, features a variety of river fish served in every imaginable way. Avoid the “half tambabqui,” which is among the few farmed fish on the menu.

___

CHOUPANA: A slightly higher-end fish joint where a light “calda de piranha,” or piranha soup, is the amuse-bouche. “Tambaqui” ribs are a perennial favorite.

___

TRATTORIA DA MARGO: Offers mouthwatering Italian food, with scrumptious pasta sauces created by Manaus native Margo Gois, who is self-taught and never been outside Brazil. Getting there adds to the adventure — the restaurant is tucked in the Parque Dez de Novembro residential neighborhood and few taxi drivers seem to have heard of it.

___

LANCHE TRES MULHERES: Tucked in one of two food courts flanking the Adolfo Lisboa Municipal Market, this stand serves delicious “biju,” or tapioca omelets. Bijus, which run about $2 a piece, come stuffed with a selection of banana or cheese slices, fried eggs or crushed Brazil nuts, but the tastiest version includes a bit of everything.
