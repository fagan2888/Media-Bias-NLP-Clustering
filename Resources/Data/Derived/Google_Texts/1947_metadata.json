Besides having to labor on your hands and knees in the hot sun, the medium itself is messy, imprecise and hard to shade.\n\nEach work of chalk art that will adorn The 400 Block in downtown Wausau this weekend, then, is worthy of respect, and the best of them \u2014 the abstract swirls, the Wisconsin scenes and the painstaking recreations of great artworks and pop-cultural icons \u2014 are a minor miracle.\n\nChalkfest may be the most enjoyable part of the most enjoyable weekend on Wausau's calendar. The downtown square will be populated with artists beginning early Saturday, and all weekend long crowds will tour the art in progress and, once finished, will ooh and ahh and choose their favorite chalk depictions.\n\nOne of the drawings depicts Rev.

In recent years, we've seen multiple depictions of Harry Potter, Iron Man and characters from the \"Twilight\" and \"Hunger Games\" series. We're predicting a lot of drawings based on \"The Lego Movie\" this year. Maybe some images from the \"Game of Thrones\" books or TV show.\n\nChalkfest, which has grown into a local institution beloved by artists and audiences, is only one of the weekend's big, exciting events. Downtown streets will be lined with sidewalk sales. And at the Wausau Downtown Airport, the Balloon and Rib Fest kicked off Thursday and will continue through the weekend, with lots of music and family activities, balloon glows \u2014 hot air balloons inflated at dusk, lovely glow from the inside \u2014 at 8:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and fireworks at dark afterward.\n\nAnd ribs. Lots of ribs, pulled pork sandwiches and other barbecue goodness.\n\nAt Chalkfest, another part of the fun is the impermanence of the art. Like a Buddhist sand mandala, soon enough the small artworks will all be gone, rubbed away by the footsteps of downtown visitors and washed away by summer rain. It's meant to be enjoyed right now, this weekend. Enjoy it!\n\nBuy Photo Raechel Schultz of Wausau works on her drawing based on the book \u201cWhere The Wild Things Are,\u201d by Maurice Sendak at 2011\u2019s Chalkfest event.
