WestArk RSVP also has expanded services this year. The IRS also has a Free File system. The deadline to pay is April 18.\n\n\u201cIf, for whatever reason, you cannot meet the April 18 tax deadline this year, you also can use Free File to submit an extension to file,\u201d the IRS adds. \u201cJust look for the companies that are offering free extensions. The extension will give you until Oct. 17. But remember, it\u2019s an extension to file, not an extension to pay. If you think you will owe, be sure to make any payment by April 18.\u201d\n\nThrough the grapevine, word has spread around Fort Smith that free services are available to a wider segment of the population than previously believed. Trish Walker, director of volunteer services at WestArk RSVP, 401 N. 13th St. in Fort Smith, said they will be working on taxes until the end of the day on April 18.\n\n\u201cWe were always known as the free site for low income and people over 60 years old,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhat the IRS classifies as \u2018low income\u2019 is $54,000 and under. We put that on our flyer this year, and we are seeing an increase. \u2026 Most people in Fort Smith, Arkansas, don\u2019t make $54,000 a year.\u201d\n\nWalker has made accommodations for more tax pros this year, with eight volunteers in four screened areas on weekdays for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistant and Tax Counseling for Elderly programs. There is a ninth volunteer in a staff office on Saturdays. WestArk RSVP has averaged 98 to 100 tax filings a day.\n\n1095 Forms Unfamiliar\n\nNew tax filing rules created by the Affordable Care Act are not as complicated as they may seem, she adds. But there has been some misunderstanding in regards to the 1095 forms.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a special enrollment period from Feb. 1 through March 31 for taxpayers who failed to file a federal income tax return and reconcile advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC).\n\n\u201cThis special enrollment period will only be available to taxpayers after they file their tax return and reconcile APTC that was paid on their behalf,\u201d the IRS states. \u201cOnce the return has been filed, they can return to the Marketplace and update their application to explain that they have filed a return and reconciled their APTC. Eligibility for this special enrollment period is limited to those who have previously attempted to enroll in 2016 coverage.\u201d\n\nWalker said the tax filers only have to see the 1095 A form holders, those who ordered health insurance through the federal Marketplace and \u201cwere actually paid a premium for that insurance.\u201d They do not have to see the 1095 B and 1095 C form holders, Walker said, for those who were approved for the expanded Medicaid program.\n\nAt the first of January the IRS put out information that all 1095 forms would be mailed out by the end of that month. In mid-January, the IRS announced it would postpone that mailing until the end of March. The 1095 B and C forms are for those who got insurance through an insurance company through expanded Medicaid or through an employer.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be that scared of it,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIf their income is low, if they don\u2019t have a filing requirement, we can get them an exemption and they won\u2019t have to pay a penalty. There are things out there that we can work.\u201d\n\nWalker went on to explain that an exemption can filed for someone who went without insurance for several months. And people who had income at 137 percent above the Federal Poverty Level are eligible for expanded Medicaid also known as the \u201cprivate option\u201d in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cWe have sent a lot of people down to DHS to get signed up for that so they won\u2019t have penalties next year,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAlthough Oklahoma did not expand its Medicaid program, residents of Oklahoma can also apply for an exemption from a penalty. The Oklahoma Tax Commission approved RSVP to file taxes.\n\nAs of last week, RSVP has filed $2.3 million in refunds. About half of that, $1 million, was through the Earned Income Credit, Walker said.\n\nEducation on the ACA\u2019s requirements and penalties are still part of the tax filer\u2019s job, she added. The IRS will catch up with those who say they had insurance all year and actually did not, Walker said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not telling us the truth on this, it\u2019s one area the IRS is going to be doing data matching this summer,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey will find out.\u201d\n\nVolunteer tax filers at WestArk RSVP will be available Monday through Friday until April 15, and Saturdays through February and April. They will not be open Saturdays in March.\n\nWestArk RSVP will be open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday and Tuesday; 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday; and 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays through February. Walker said they will be open all day Monday, April 18. Due to most people\u2019s schedules, the center sees its busiest hours after 3:30 p.m.\n\nThere are Spanish language interpreters available in the morning only on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Call (479) 783-4155 for more information.\n\nLast year on April 14, the day before the tax filing deadline, RSVP filed 127 tax returns. They have averaged 98 a day this year since Jan. 25. As of Feb. 15 the volunteers have prepared 104 more tax returns than the same period last year, Walker said.\n\nAARP Foundation Locations\n\nThe AARP Foundation, in conjunction with the IRS, will offer free tax assistance and preparation for taxpayers with low to moderate income through the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide program.\n\nThrough April 15, AARP Foundation Tax-Aide sites will provide free tax assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis. Although the program focuses on those 60 and older, officials urge anyone who needs tax assistance to utilize the service.\n\nLike those at WestArk RSVP, all returns are filed electronically. Valid photographic identification and a Social Security Card, or a copy of last year\u2019s tax return must be presented before filing a return.\n\nThe program provides six local AARP Foundation Tax-Aide locations in western Arkansas.

Some of these providers offer free federal and free state return preparation and electronic filing. If you made more than $62,000, you can use Free File Fillable Forms, electronic versions of IRS paper forms best for someone experienced in return preparation.\n\nFree File offers all federal tax forms for free. That goes for the Form 1040, Form 1040EZ and Form 1040A. For example, all forms are free if you have mortgage interest deductions, children in college or made money in the stock market, among other things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For those looking to get a little help on their taxes, there are several free options in the Fort Smith area through volunteer organizations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "For those looking to get a little help on their taxes, there are several free options in the Fort Smith area through volunteer organizations.", "title": "Fort Smith Area Offers Free Tax-Filing Services For Many", "url": "http://swtimes.com/business/fort-smith-area-offers-free-tax-filing-services-many", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_TrishWalkerRSVP_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/fort-smith-area-offers-free-tax-filing-services-many", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_TrishWalkerRSVP_0.jpg"}, "title": "Fort Smith Area Offers Free Tax-Filing Services For Many", "description": "For those looking to get a little help on their taxes, there are several free options in the Fort Smith area through volunteer organizations.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=2276670", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=2276670", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Business,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T04:06:03-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Free File offers all federal tax forms for free.\nThrough April 15, AARP Foundation Tax-Aide sites will provide free tax assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis.\nFor those looking to get a little help on their taxes, there are several free options in the Fort Smith area through volunteer organizations.\nValid photographic identification and a Social Security Card, or a copy of last year\u2019s tax return must be presented before filing a return.\nLocations and service hours are:\u2022 Fort Smith Senior Activity Center, 2700 Cavanaugh Road, Fort Smith, 648-9970."}
