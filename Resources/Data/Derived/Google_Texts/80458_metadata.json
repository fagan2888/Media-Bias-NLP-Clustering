First, it disclosed that Facebook manipulated the News Feeds of nearly 700,000 English-speaking users in a research study on emotional states. Second, the study (found in PNAS) suggests that emotional contagion can happen without \u201cdirect interaction between people.\u201d\n\nThe study is based on the idea that \u201cemotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness,\u201d according to the abstract. (The abstract also states that the results of studies on this phenomena are controversial.)\n\nIn the experiment, researchers wanted to test whether emotional contagion was possible outside of in-person interaction. They did so by manipulating the emotional content of users\u2019 News Feeds on Facebook. \u201cWhen positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,\u201d reads the abstract. Basically the study found that the transference of emotions documented in other real-world experiments, was also true of not face-to-face interaction.\n\nResults aside, the study itself is rather creepy. Though the study did not breach the Facebook user terms and conditions, it was deemed questionable by the editor of the study, according to the Atlantic. From the Atlantic:\n\n\u201cEven Susan Fiske, the professor of psychology at Princeton University who edited the study for Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of America, had doubts when the research first crossed her desk. \u201c\u2018I was concerned,\u2019 she told me in a phone interview, \u2018until I queried the authors and they said their local institutional review board had approved it\u2014and apparently on the grounds that Facebook apparently manipulates people\u2019s News Feeds all the time\u2026 I understand why people have concerns. I think their beef is with Facebook, really, not the research.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Who knows what other research they\u2019re doing.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The study's results suggests that \"emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people\"", "title": "Facebook admits manipulating 689,003 users\u2019 emotions in psychology experiment", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The study's results suggests that \"emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people\"", "title": "Facebook admits manipulating 689,003 users\u2019 emotions in psychology experiment", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/facebook_admits_it_manipulated_689003_users_emotions_in_psychology_experiment/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/mark_zuckerberg3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The study's results suggests that \"emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people\"", "title": "Facebook admits manipulating 689,003 users\u2019 emotions in psychology experiment", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/mark_zuckerberg3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Emotions, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, newsfeed, Psychology, Social Media, technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "First, it disclosed that Facebook manipulated the News Feeds of nearly 700,000 English-speaking users in a research study on emotional states.\nTopics: Emotions, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, newsfeed, Psychology, Social Media, technology, Innovation News, Technology NewsA new research paper has revealed two startling pieces of information.\nIn the experiment, researchers wanted to test whether emotional contagion was possible outside of in-person interaction.\nThey did so by manipulating the emotional content of users\u2019 News Feeds on Facebook.\nI think their beef is with Facebook, really, not the research.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Who knows what other research they\u2019re doing."}
