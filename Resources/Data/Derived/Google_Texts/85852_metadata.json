Dohmen Co.\n\nBy of the\n\nWisconsin's bioscience industry is bolstered by one of the largest academic research efforts in the country and includes 1,600 businesses and nearly 36,000 employees. There's just one problem: Most people don't know it's there.\n\nNow, with a new leader heading BioForward, the state trade association, industry executives are planning to aggressively market their segment's benefits to state residents and government officials, and create more business development opportunities for companies and research institutions.\n\n\"Bioscience is a growing industry even while others are flat or declining,\" said Randy Spaulding, president and CEO at Spaulding Clinical Research, a West Bend clinical trial center. \"We need to get more awareness and energy behind the biosciences industry in Wisconsin.\"\n\nSpaulding, a former general manager of cardiology services at GE Healthcare, will moderate a panel at BioForward's 2015 Bioscience Summit Wednesday where top executives will discuss how their industry needs to make a case for itself \u2014 in the state, and elsewhere.\n\nBioForward also plans to unveil at the summit an economic development report prepared by the accounting firm of Ernst & Young that suggests the state's bioscience industry has a larger impact on indirect job creation than manufacturing, long one of Wisconsin's most prominent employment sectors. Bioscience companies indirectly create 1.96 jobs in other sectors for every one job in the industry, vs. 1.79 jobs for every manufacturing job, the report says.\n\n\"Traditional manufacturing is what we think of in Wisconsin, but we all know the ups and downs of that and the challenges of low-cost outsourcing,\" Spaulding said. \"Why not build a parallel industry and game plan for Wisconsin that highlights biosciences more?\"\n\nThe bioscience industry had economic output, a measure similar to sales, of almost $27 billion, and paid $716 million in state and local taxes, according to the report. And average salary for the industry is $73,241.\n\nThe report's broad definition of bioscience includes areas such as soybean processing and chemical manufacturing, along with more traditional areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices and diagnostic imaging.\n\n\"It's widely known and understood how productive the life sciences and bioscience industry is as a component of our national economy,\" said Cynthia LaConte, a panelist who is president and CEO of the F. Dohmen Co., a Milwaukee company that provides technical consulting services to life science manufacturers. \"It's less known how effective that industry can be to grow the state of Wisconsin. These are better-paying jobs that will attract young people coming out of our university systems and can cause them to stay with us.\"\n\nBioForward will be the umbrella organization for aggressively marketing a wide swatch of bioscience, from health information technology to therapeutics, diagnostic medical devices and the state's research institutions, said Lisa Johnson, who was an executive at the state commerce agency and at several biotech firms before becoming BioForward's CEO in May.\n\n\"We're looking to expand industry collaborations, partnerships and investments into the state,\" Johnson said.\n\nUnlike many states that are angling to be bioscience centers, Wisconsin has a good foundation. Between the University of Wisconsin-Madison \u2014 the state's life sciences research juggernaut \u2014 and a consortium of schools in the Milwaukee area, universities here generate a strong talent pool and attract nearly $1 billion of research funding, Ernst & Young's report says.\n\nThe state already has a pool of start-up companies that have proven attractive to global acquirers, as evidence by FujiFilm Holding Corp.'s acquisitions earlier this year of human cell maker Madison-based Cellular Dynamics International Inc. for about $307 million and Wauwatosa-based medical imaging software maker TeraMedica Inc. for an undisclosed price.\n\nHowever, the state does not leverage its bioscience assets as well as it could, the industry executives say.\n\nFor example, only two Midwestern states \u2014 Iowa and Minnesota \u2014 receive less academic research funding from industry collaborations than Wisconsin, which gets $98 million a year from such activities, according to an eight-state comparison in the Ernst & Young report.\n\n\"Industry collaborations currently represent less than 3% of Wisconsin's bioscience funding, but as neighboring states have shown, academic research and technology commercialization is a lucrative field to pursue,\" the report says.\n\n\"We do OK in Wisconsin, but we're leaving too much on the table,\" Spaulding said. By 2020, the pharmaceutical industry alone is projected to be producing $1 trillion of revenue, he added.\n\nAdding to the urgency is the fact that Wisconsin is getting older, with the number of people over 65 projected to double to about 1.5 million in the next 15 years, said Kevin Conroy, CEO of Exact Sciences Inc., Madison, and a panelist at the summit. Meanwhile, median household income is dropping.\n\nThose trends don't bode well for the state unless it creates higher-growth companies with higher-paying jobs that are globally competitive, Conroy said.\n\n\"And that means reinventing who we are as a state and becoming more competitive in a fiercely competitive global economy,\" he said.\n\nBioForward's 2015 Bioscience Summit will be held on Wednesday at Monona Terrace in Madison. Cost ranges from $50 for students to $250 for attendees not affiliated with government or academic organizations.
