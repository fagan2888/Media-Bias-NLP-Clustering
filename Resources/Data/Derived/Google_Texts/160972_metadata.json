People want to see these guys continue to play, and play on the biggest stage.\u201d\n\nDespite all that offensive prowess, the Great Danes can play some defense, too. They upset top-ranked and third-seeded Loyola 13-6 on the road in the opening round for their eighth straight win, holding the Greyhounds to their lowest scoring output of the season. Loyola had won 15 straight since dropping its season opener to Virginia in overtime.\n\n\u201cI think it just shows a lot about our defense and how far we\u2019ve come this year as a team,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cA lot of people look at our team and see us as an offensive team. Our defense played huge against Loyola. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen our defense play.\u201d\n\nThe quarterfinals begin Saturday with Albany facing ACC tournament champion and No. 6 seed Notre Dame (10-5), which easily beat Harvard 13-5 in the opening round. The other Saturday matchup features No. 7 Maryland (12-3) against Bryant (16-4); on Sunday, Johns Hopkins (11-4) meets top-seeded and defending national champion Duke (14-3), and No. 5 Denver (15-2) plays Drexel (13-4).\n\nFive things to know about the men\u2019s Division I lacrosse quarterfinals, with Saturday\u2019s games at Hofstra University and Sunday\u2019s matchups at the University of Delaware:\n\nPARITY TIME: Besides Albany, three other teams still in the running for the national championship are unseeded: Bryant beat No. 2 seed Syracuse 10-9, Drexel topped No. 4 seed Penn 16-11, and Johns Hopkins beat No. 8 Virginia 14-8 in the opening round.\n\n\u201cThat speaks volumes of how competitive it is,\u201d Marr said.\n\nAdded Miles Thompson: \u201cI just believe that it shows that anyone is capable of winning this year. There\u2019s no dominant team out there.\u201d\n\nBULLDOGS RULE: Bryant, a small school in Rhode Island, has been in Division I for just six years, but under former Duke coach Mike Pressler the Bulldogs have morphed into a real threat. A year ago, they nearly upset Syracuse in the opening round and this year got the job done \u2014 in the Carrier Dome, no less \u2014 to reach the quarterfinals for the first time. Pressler called the triumph \u201cmonumental\u201d and sophomore goalie Gunnar Waldt was a key, making eight fourth-quarter saves. Bryant, which has won five straight, also defeated Drexel (12-6) and Albany (12-11) in March.\n\nDRAGONS SLAY: Drexel used a 7-0 run against Penn to win its ninth straight game and now faces defensive-minded Denver. Penn outshot Drexel 47-45, but the Dragons won 11 more faceoffs and had 40 ground balls to Penn\u2019s 31. Denver, which beat North Carolina 9-5 in the first round for its 12th straight victory, lost to Duke (14-10) in the second game of the season and to Penn (12-10) on March 1.\n\nBLUE GAME: Johns Hopkins missed the tournament last year for the first time in 41 years, and now the Blue Jays face the Blue Devils and aim to reach the semifinal round for the first time since 2008. Duke has made the Final Four in each of the past eight years.\n\nNATIVE TOUCH: In Albany\u2019s first-round victory over Loyola, Lyle Thompson had three goals and five assists, brother Miles had five goals and two assists, and cousin Ty chipped in with three goals, giving the Mohawk Indian trio 18 points in the game. Out West, Denver freshman Zach Miller, from the Allegany Indian Reservation in western New York, had two goals and an assist in the Pioneers\u2019 9-5 victory over North Carolina in the first round.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse tournament includes 4 unseeded teams", "title": "NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse tournament includes 4 unseeded teams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/17/ncaa-mens-lacrosse-tournament-includes-4-unseeded-teams/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140513__20140514_B3_SP14LAXDUp1.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140513__20140514_B3_SP14LAXDUp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T19:50:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:20:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think it just shows a lot about our defense and how far we\u2019ve come this year as a team,\u201d Lyle said.\n6 seed Notre Dame (10-5), which easily beat Harvard 13-5 in the opening round.\n8 Virginia 14-8 in the opening round.\nBefore the pairings were announced for the men\u2019s Division I NCAA lacrosse tournament, Syracuse\u2019s John Desko uttered what most of his coaching brethren probably were thinking about Albany.\nDRAGONS SLAY: Drexel used a 7-0 run against Penn to win its ninth straight game and now faces defensive-minded Denver."}
