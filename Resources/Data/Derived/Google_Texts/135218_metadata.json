CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett reports the \"why\" of visiting the largely vacant capital city is more elusive; it is 200 miles north of Myanmar's former capital of Yangon.\n\nYoung voters\n\nYoung voters in the 2014 midterm elections did not turn out in the numbers they did in 2012, but a CBS News poll shows signs of a shift in the youth vote that may mean changes for both political parties.\n\nPort slowdown\n\nThere are growing concerns that a worker slowdown at one of the country's busiest ports, in Long Beach, Calif., could hit holiday shipments.

CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford reports, one of the architects of the health care law was caught on camera saying the bill was specifically written in a way that it wouldn't be viewed as including a tax. He then went on to call American voters stupid.\n\nOut of network costs\n\nDoctors saved a Wisconsin woman after what could have been a deadly heart attack, but the lifesaving work came at a steep cost. CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds reports the patient went to a hospital outside her insurance network, and now faces medical bills that could force her into bankruptcy.\n\nDrug prices\n\nSome spectacular jumps in generic drug prices have been exposed in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jonathan LaPook reports Doxycycline, an antibiotic, went from $.06 a pill to$3.36, an increase of more than 5,000 percent. A recent analysis found nearly 10 percent of generics more than doubled in price in the past year.\n\nPrinting skin\n\nScientist are developing a method of 3D printing of human skin on demand.
