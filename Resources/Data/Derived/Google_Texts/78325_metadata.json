(Photo: Submitted)\n\nBy Oct. 29, Lindsay Conner was used to receiving packages filled with smocks, specially sewn for neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) babies.\n\nShe inspected each stack, documented and photographed them.\n\nBut this package was even more special; it was from a former Vanderbilt patient.\n\n\"This was really important to me just because I was a NICU baby and my mother had her first surgery with you guys,\" Eagle Scout and Utah native Nathan Porritt's letter read.\n\nHis package was filled with 150 smocks, just a portion of the collection of handmade gowns to be delivered to Vanderbilt's NICU mid-December.\n\n\"It goes beyond your wildest expectations of what might be possible,\" Conner said.\n\nThe handmade outfits fold crossways over the baby's torso, with Velcro on the sides to close them. This way, medical staff can easily access IVs and tubes attached to the child.\n\n\"But the biggest impact is for the parents,\" said Vanderbilt NICU manager Belinda Mathis.\n\nMathis and her staff see roughly 1,300 babies come through the unit each year. Many patients are tiny babies born premature, or those with heart, gestational or other problems so severe they need surgery.\n\n\"It really brightens the parents\u2019 day to go in and see their baby in clothes,\" she said. \"It\u2019s no longer this cold, sterile hospital environment.\"\n\nLindsay Conner received several donations of NICU smocks to give to Vanderbilt and other local hospitals. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nMusic City Modern Quilt Guild has donated smocks to Vanderbilt's NICU for three years as just one of its many philanthropic efforts. For the past two years, Conner has asked for donations through her blog, Lindsay Sews.\n\nLast year, the group donated 247 smocks.\n\nThis year, the group is donating 1,082, including the 96 created by the quilting group.\n\nBecause of the large amount, the group will split the gowns between Vanderbilt, Centennial and Saint Thomas Midtown, bringing warmth and fashion to babies all around Nashville.\n\nHow to help\n\nMusic City Modern Quilt Guild's smock drive is over this year, but Conner encourages interested sewers to donate smocks to Gracie's Gowns, which accepts them year-round.\n\nContact: 540-287-0143, info@graciesgowns.org\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1jlH0cP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Many patients are babies born premature, or those with heart, gestational or other problems so severe they need surgery.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Many patients are babies born premature, or those with heart, gestational or other problems so severe they need surgery.", "title": "Over 1,000 smocks donated for Vanderbilt NICU babies", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2015/11/26/over-1000-smocks-donated-vanderbilt-nicu-babies/76334554/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many patients are babies born premature, or those with heart, gestational or other problems so severe they need surgery.", "title": "Over 1,000 smocks donated for Vanderbilt NICU babies", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ae931f047488f3969582c93ed021acdec003ff8/c=0-0-1116-1116&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jen.todd.12"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/The Saint", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/The Saint", "title": "Over 1,000 smocks donated for Vanderbilt NICU babies", "author": "Jen Todd", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21e1d91b7e9060e573347c6271a77d2c3780d8b7/c=174-0-1011-1116/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf19a4663f3d273fc0d089b01304fb772cd5b22b/c=0-0-1116-1116/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e89e313eecbc8fb2705721417967d62fb261baa/c=0-0-1116-839/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/76dcb915cfdb333e673f0dddc619fbec71974b3d/c=0-0-1116-631&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-26T12:00:30.010000-06:00", "shorthed": "Smocks donated for Vandy NICU babies", "articleid": 76334554, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9922377513deafe6e09558b1b56f3447c0606c78/c=0-0-1116-631/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/08086c7b0c6ff52b04c493ee07059127864a1b72/c=87-0-712-1116/local/-/media/2015/11/25/Nashville/Nashville/635840670477090988-12211138-10208039905665610-94689092-o.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Vanderbilt NICU, Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital, premature babies Nashville, Nashville NICU, Music City Modern Quilt Guild, Lindsay Sews, Nashville sewing"}, "article_summary": "Music City Modern Quilt Guild and sewers from around the country created smocks for NICU babies at Vanderbilt and other local hospitals.\n(Photo: Submitted)Music City Modern Quilt Guild has donated smocks to Vanderbilt's NICU for three years as just one of its many philanthropic efforts.\n(Photo: Submitted)By Oct. 29, Lindsay Conner was used to receiving packages filled with smocks, specially sewn for neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) babies.\n\"But the biggest impact is for the parents,\" said Vanderbilt NICU manager Belinda Mathis.\nLindsay Conner received several donations of NICU smocks to give to Vanderbilt and other local hospitals."}
