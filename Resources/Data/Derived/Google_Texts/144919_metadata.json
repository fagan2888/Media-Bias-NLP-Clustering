Pedro Ribeiro Sim\u00f5es, CC BY 2.0\n\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious that a good night\u2019s sleep makes for a healthy and thriving life.\n\nAs yet another example of that, a new study published Wednesday in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology has found that poor sleep habits are linked to a higher risk of developing early warning signs of heart disease.\n\n\"Inadequate sleep is a common problem and a likely source of poor health, including visible signs of disease, such as heart attack,\" said study co-lead author Dr. Chan-Won Kim, a clinical associate professor in the Center for Cohort Studies at Kangbuk Samsun Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, in a statement.\n\nStudying the medical records of nearly 50,000 adults, the study authors were to detect a correlation between the participants\u2019 sleep habits - as detailed via a questionnaire - and their measured levels of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and arterial stiffness. Both measures are known to predict later coronary disease and related heart conditions, in particular because calcium is deposited in the arteries as they become clogged with plaque.\n\nCompared to people who reported 7 hours of sleep every night, people with only 5 hours of sleep had on average around 50 percent more calcium in their arteries, and those who slept 9 or more hours had around 70 percent more calcium. Additionally, people who reported poor sleep quality had about 20 percent more coronary calcium than those who slept soundly.\n\n\"We also observed a similar pattern when we measured arterial stiffness,\" said co-lead author Dr. Yoosoo Chang, also an associate professor in the Center for Cohort Studies at Kangbuk Samsun Hospital. \"Adults with poor sleep quality have stiffer arteries than those who sleep seven hours a day or had good sleep quality. Overall, we saw the lowest levels of vascular disease in adults sleeping seven hours a day and reporting good sleep quality.\"\n\nLooking more specifically at gender, the authors found that poor sleep quality only predicted more CAC in women, and that the link between sleep quality and arterial stiffness was strongest in men.\n\nBecause people were asked to self-report how long and how well they sleep, there\u2019s a chance that the authors underestimated the impact of sleep on heart health, since people frequently downplay how poorly they\u2019re actually sleeping.\n\nTaken as a whole, the authors concluded that their findings \u201cunderscore the importance of an adequate quantity and quality of sleep to maintain cardiovascular health,\u201d and Kim believes that clinicians should routinely ask about their patients\u2019 sleep habits when trying to assess heart risk.\n\nSource: Kim C-W, Chang Y, Zhao D, et al.
