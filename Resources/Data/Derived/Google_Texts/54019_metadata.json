With Iraq now falling to pieces as it struggles to contain the advance of the Islamic extremist group ISIS, the same public officials who made the spurious case for war in 2003 and the media outlets that aggressively backed it are once again agitating for armed conflict.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board was one of the Iraq War\u2019s most fervent supporters. (\u201cIt will be the nasty weapons and the cheering Iraqis the coalition finds when it liberates the country,\u201d they predicted in February 2003, wrongly.) Now they want the U.S. to go back to war, and they\u2019ve even done the courtesy of drawing up their own battle plans.\n\nMr. Obama now faces the choice of intervening anew with U.S. military force or doing nothing. The second option means risking the fall of Baghdad or a full-scale Iranian intervention to save Mr. Maliki\u2019s government, either of which would be terrible strategic defeats. The alternative is to stage an intervention similar to what the French did in Mali in early 2013, using a combination of air power and paratroops to defeat or at least contain ISIS. But that would be an admission that Mr. Obama\u2019s policy in Iraq has failed, that his claims of retreat without risk from the Middle East were false and naive, and that his premature withdrawal now demands an emergency intervention.\n\nIt\u2019s that simple! Just send in some paratroopers, drop a few bombs and win. What comes after that? Who cares! Let\u2019s have us a war.
