The report will formally be released Monday afternoon at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee for Investigations.\n\n\u201cIf all these people are disabled . . . I want them all to get it and then we need to figure out how we\u2019re going to fund it,\u201d Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), a prominent critic of wasteful government spending and member of the subcommittee, told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night. \u201cBut my investigation tells me and my common sense tells me that we got a system that\u2019s being gamed pretty big now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s another troubling sign for a government lifeline that is just three years away from insolvency.\n\nRELATED: GOV OVERPAYS $1.3 IN DISABILITY BENEFITS TO 36,000\n\nJust last month, the Government Accountability Office identified 36,000 people who may have received $1.29 billion of disability overpayments at the same time they were working and earning wages.\n\nSSDI benefits are paid to those who have worked long enough, paid Social Security taxes, and are unable to hold down a job because of a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death. But the list includes vague diagnosis for back pain, muscle aches, depression and other unmeasurable afflictions, making the system vulnerable to cheaters.\n\nThe two-year Senate subcommittee probe focused on attorney Eric Christopher Conn, who opened a legal practice in 1993 in a small trailer complex next door to his boyhood home in Stanville, KY, population 500. Conn went on to build one of the largest and most lucrative disability practices in the nation. From the beginning, Conn focused his efforts primarily \u2013 and later exclusively \u2013 on helping people get SSDI benefits, according to the report.\n\nSteve Kroft, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent, pointed out that despite his clientele, Conn had only one entrance that was wheelchair accessible.\n\nHis knack for navigating the program\u2019s arcane rules, along with an aggressive approach to marketing that included television, radio, and online advertisements, drew thousands of clients to his office. At the height of his success in 2010, Conn employed nearly 40 people and obtained more than $3.9 million in legal fees from SSA, making him the agency\u2019s third highest paid disability lawyer that year.\n\nConn declined to talk about his practice or fraud allegations with Kroft. The Fiscal Times today attempted to reach Conn for comment, but his office said he was traveling and was unavailable to immediately respond.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first raised concerns about Conn\u2019s methods in May 2011, when it published an article about his relationship with David B. Daugherty, an administrative law judge in the SSA\u2019s regional Huntington, WV office. In the years leading up to 2011, Daugherty had become one of the agency\u2019s highest producing judges, greenlighting more decisions each year than nearly all 1,500 of SSA\u2019s other judges.\n\nThe Journal report showed that in some years, 40 percent of Daugherty\u2019s caseload consisted of clients represented by Conn \u2013all of whom he approved for benefits. Top SSA officials subsequently requested an investigation by the SSA Inspector General. Daugherty was also placed on administrative leave, after which he quickly resigned.\n\nThis suspected fraud compounds a long-brewing crisis in the disability benefits program. Unless Congress and the administration intervene, the trust fund that supports the SSDI program will be broke by 2017.\n\nRELATED: GOVERNMENT WASTES MORE MONEY THAN YOU THINK\n\nAbout two decades after that, Social Security\u2019s much larger retirement fund is projected to run dry as well. Driving the projected shortfalls are laid-off workers and aging baby boomers who are bombarding the disability program with benefit claims, leaning heavily on the cash-strapped system.\n\nApplications rose by nearly 50 percent over the past decade as people lost their jobs and couldn\u2019t find new ones in an economy that shed nearly 7 million jobs before the recession ended. There are currently 8.7 million beneficiaries.\n\nAlso, some people were double dipping the system \u2013 collecting unemployment insurance benefits, which extend for 99 weeks, as well as Social Security benefits and, in some cases, state and federal pensions.\n\nThis double dipping is not illegal per se, and many people would feel like suckers if they didn\u2019t take advantage of all the benefits available to them through federal and state governments. Yet the actual benefits are not all that substantial. The monthly maximums for 2013 are $710 for an eligible individual and $1,066 for an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, so the program has entered dire straits while making certain lawyers wealthy by obtaining poverty-level benefits.\n\nAmong the key findings of the subcommittee investigation:\n\n\u2022 Daugherty awarded more than $2.5 billion in benefits in the last years of his career. Daugherty moved an unusually large number of disability cases through the agency and awarded an unusually high percentage of disability benefits. Over a nearly seven year period, from 2005 to his retirement in mid-2011, Daugherty awarded disability benefits to 8,413 individuals, which translates into about 1,200 cases per year and an estimated total award of federal lifetime benefits exceeding $2.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Judge provided \u201cDB lists\u201d to Conn law firm. From at least June 2006 to July 2010, Daugherty telephoned the Conn law firm each month and identified a list of Conn\u2019s disability claimants to whom the judge planned to award benefits. Judge Daugherty also indicated, for each listed claimant, whether he needed a \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cmental\u201d opinion from a medical professional indicating the claimant was disabled\n\n\u2022 Daugherty relied on Conn\u2019s doctors to generate medical evidence. After receiving the DB List, Conn\u2019s office scheduled appointments for the identified claimants with certain doctors favored by the law firm. The Conn law firm provided several of those doctors with physical or mental residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) forms in which the medical information was already filled out, and the doctors signed the forms without making any changes\n\n\u2022 Key doctors had suspect credentials. Of the doctors used by the Conn law firm to produce medical opinions for disability claimants, two had their medical license suspended or revoked in another state. Under SSA rules, a doctor with a suspended or revoked license could not be used by the Social Security Administration to review a disability case, but could still examine claimants at the request of a claimant or outside attorney.\n\n\u2022 Conn earned millions in legal fees paid by SSA. From cases on the DB lists alone, over the four year period from 2006 to 2010, the Social Security Administration paid Conn over $4.5 million in attorney fees. Social Security records show that, altogether in 2010, Conn was the third highest paid disability law firm in the country.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A two-year investigation by the Senate Subcommittee for Investigations documents what appears to be a breathtaking scam involving lawyers, medical professionals and an administrative judge in Eastern Kentucky who may have gamed the Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs out of billions of dollars.", "title": "New Evidence That Disability Fraud Costs Billions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/07/New-Evidence-Disability-Fraud-Costs-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07272012_disability_claim_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/07/New-Evidence-Disability-Fraud-Costs-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07272012_disability_claim_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A two-year investigation by the Senate Subcommittee for Investigations documents what appears to be a breathtaking scam involving lawyers, medical professionals and an administrative judge in Eastern Kentucky who may have gamed the Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs out of billions of dollars.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a5e\"", "article_summary": "Social Security records show that, altogether in 2010, Conn was the third highest paid disability law firm in the country.\nDaugherty moved an unusually large number of disability cases through the agency and awarded an unusually high percentage of disability benefits.\nThis suspected fraud compounds a long-brewing crisis in the disability benefits program.\nAfter receiving the DB List, Conn\u2019s office scheduled appointments for the identified claimants with certain doctors favored by the law firm.\nRELATED: GOV OVERPAYS $1.3 IN DISABILITY BENEFITS TO 36,000Just last month, the Government Accountability Office identified 36,000 people who may have received $1.29 billion of disability overpayments at the same time they were working and earning wages."}
