Forget about the simple incompetence that used to fire up libertarian critics of an expansive government\u2014that\u2019s a complaint that seems almost quaint given recent and ongoing revelations about official fraud and deception. It\u2019s looking more and more like the government tends toward evil and mean-spiritedness, and it\u2019s going to take real change to reverse eroding faith among citizens.\n\nThough it was sent 50 long years ago, the FBI\u2019s so-called suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr. is very much of a piece with today\u2019s America, where fear of and anger toward the government casts a shadow over everything from web-surfing to starting a business. Historian Beverly Gage and The New York Times have just published an unredacted version of the anonymous November, 1964 letter almost certainly sent by the FBI to Martin Luther King, Jr. a few weeks before the civil rights leader was set to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe typo-laden note pretends to be from a black American repulsed by King\u2019s \u201cpsychotic\u201d sexuality and warns that he will be unmasked as a \u201cfilthy, abnormal animal\u201d unless he kills himself. \u201cKing you are done,\u201d reads the letter, drawing on surveillance and wiretaps approved by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and President Lyndon Johnson. \u201cThere is but one way out for you,\u201d the note continues. \u201cYou better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.\u201d\n\nIn the 21st century, we worry less about the government ratting out our sex lives and more about it tapping our phones, reading our emails, secretly dispatching drones abroad, sending \u201cdesperate and dumb\u201d mash notes to Iranian fascists, and generally lying about its true goals and actions. \u201cSecret \u2018Kill List\u2019 Proves a Test of Obama\u2019s Principles\u201d announced the Times in 2012, clearly uncomfortable with the implications of its own expose (\u201cSecret \u2018Kill List\u2019 Reveals Obama\u2019s Principles\u201d would have been more accurate).\n\nSo it\u2019s fitting that the letter to King, one of the government\u2019s most despicable acts of domestic surveillance, has only fully come to light in the age of Wikileaks, Edward Snowden, and what Barack Obama promised was going to be the \u201cmost transparent administration\u201d in U.S. history.\n\nAlas, when it comes to openness, Barack Obama neglected to mention that the most disturbing revelations would happen in spite of\u2014not because of\u2014his actions. We didn\u2019t learn that the president\u2019s former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, former CIA director Keith Alexander, and current CIA director John Brennan all lied to Congress because the administration suddenly decided to come clean.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just unseemly cloak-and-dagger stuff in an age of terrorism that\u2019s causing trust issues. MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who helped create the Affordable Care Act, has rightfully come under fire for admitting that the \u201clack of transparency\u201d in Obamacare was a political strategy designed to take advantage of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d Nancy Pelosi, who was speaker of the House when Obamacare passed, has carried the deception further still, falsely saying that \u201cI don\u2019t know who [Gruber] is\u201d and that \u201che didn\u2019t help write our bill\u201d \u2014claims that were immediately revealed as false after about 10 seconds of Googling.\n\nA new survey by The Atlantic of 50 \u201cSilicon Valley Insiders\u201d\u2014\u201cexecutives, innovators, and thinkers\u201d--asks respondents to name \u201cthe biggest barrier to innovation in the United States.\u201d The top three answers are \u201cgovernment regulation/bureaucracy\u201d (20 percent), \u201cimmigration policies\u201d (16 percent), and \u201ceducation\u201d (14 percent). Given the role it plays in setting immigration policy and controlling education at all levels through a mix of money and mandates, that means government takes the gold, silver, and bronze medals at making life harder.\n\nIt\u2019s not just tech gazillionaires who feel this way. Gallup annually asks jes' plain folks, \"Which of the following do you think is the biggest threat to the country in the future\u2014big business, big labor, or big government?\u201d Last December, a record-high 72 percent chose big government. That\u2019s more than double the figure Gallup recorded when the FBI was listening to Martin Luther King\u2019s heavy-breathing sessions. These days, says Pew Research, just 2 percent (!) of us trust the government \u201cto just about always\u201d do the right thing.\n\nFifty years ago\u2014again, right around the time that the FBI was about to become the subject of a hagiographic hit TV show and trying to goad Martin Luther King, Jr. into killing himself\u2014Richard Hofstadter was denouncing the \u201cparanoid style in American politics,\u201d. He lamented that, \u201cAmerican politics has often been an arena for angry minds.\u201d\n\nBut today\u2019s lack of trust and confidence in the government doesn\u2019t seem all that angry. It\u2019s more like we\u2019re resigned to the fact that our rulers think little of us\u2014that is, when they think of us at all. In gaining new knowledge about how people in power almost always behave, we are wiser and sadder and, one hopes, much less likely to put up with bullshit from the left, right, or center.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "nickgillespie"}, "keywords": "Martin Luther King, Federal Bureau of Investigation, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201411151145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "A reminder that Washington has been toying with and lying to Americans for a long, long time.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why the FBIs Suicide Note to MLK Still Matters", "tags": "entity:person/martin_luther_king,entity:organization/federal_bureau_of_investigation,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why the FBI\u2019s Suicide Note to MLK Still Matters\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/15/why-the-fbi-s-suicide-note-to-mlk-still-matters.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/15/why-the-fbi-s-suicide-note-to-mlk-still-matters/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47201730.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/15/why-the-fbi-s-suicide-note-to-mlk-still-matters\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-15T11:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Nick Gillespie\",\"tags\":[\"martin_luther_king\",\"federal_bureau_of_investigation\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Martin Luther King, Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Nick Gillespie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-11-15T11:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/nick-gillespiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/15/why-the-fbi-s-suicide-note-to-mlk-still-matters", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "A reminder that Washington has been toying with and lying to Americans for a long, long time.", "title": "Why the FBI\u2019s Suicide Note to MLK Still Matters", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/15/why-the-fbi-s-suicide-note-to-mlk-still-matters.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/15/why-the-fbi-s-suicide-note-to-mlk-still-matters/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1416051915097.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/n/nick-gillespie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe288f\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s more than double the figure Gallup recorded when the FBI was listening to Martin Luther King\u2019s heavy-breathing sessions.\nThough it was sent 50 long years ago, the FBI\u2019s so-called suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr. is very much of a piece with today\u2019s America, where fear of and anger toward the government casts a shadow over everything from web-surfing to starting a business.\n\u201cKing you are done,\u201d reads the letter, drawing on surveillance and wiretaps approved by FBI director J.
