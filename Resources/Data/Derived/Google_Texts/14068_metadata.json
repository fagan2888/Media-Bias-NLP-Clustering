Republicans are not trying to stop Obamacare Medicaid expansion and are actually drafting the bill for the expansion.\n\nRegarding a possible third-party run, Day declared that this is a serious consideration. \u201cI\u2019m not actually just throwing this out here, you know \u2018maybe I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 I\u2019ve already got a team together to get on the ballot. I need to get 3,000 signatures to get on the ballot as an independent. I already have a team in place, I\u2019ve had a lawyer review the process.\u201d\n\nFollowing the interview, Day clarified to Truth in Media that \u201cif the Republicans in New Hampshire expand Medicaid, I will launch a third party campaign. If the party rejects expansion, I will continue fighting in the trenches to elect conservative Republicans.\u201d\n\nAaron Day said he asked Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), who is now the Speaker of the House, how he would advise and instruct the Republicans in the N.H. state senate regarding medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cTell them no, no, no on Medicaid expansion. The funding won\u2019t be there,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nDay said that expanding Medicaid would ultimately bankrupt New Hampshire or trigger a massive tax hike. Currently, New Hampshire has no income or sales tax.\n\nDay said that Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) is an influential force behind the movement to move Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCook asked Day about his thoughts on splitting the vote and the result of Republicans losing a majority in the Senate if Sen. Ayotte loses.\n\n\u201cNot only might this cost her her seat, this might cost the Republicans control of the United States Senate,\u201d said Day. \u201cWhich tells you just how serious I am about this issue, because it was thrown in our face. We wouldn\u2019t be in this place if it weren\u2019t for people who made a political calculation that said \u2018in order for Kelly to win we are going to throw the state underwater so she has better election chances,\u2019 I\u2019m just changing the math.\u201d\n\nDay asked, \u201cwhy bother even have two parties if Republicans are going to cave on an issue like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the number one problem our country faces in the next 12 to 18 months is a looming sovereign debt crisis. We have $18 trillion of debt and hundreds of trillions of unfunded liabilities and we are asleep at the switch and adding fuel to the fire by expanding Medicaid is only going to exacerbate the situation,\u201d added Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aaron Day, the New Hampshire State Chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus,\u00a0has been fighting Obamacare's medicaid expansion on the local level for years", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Joshua Cook", "og": {"site_name": "Ben Swann's Truth In Media", "description": "Aaron Day, the New Hampshire State Chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus,\u00a0has been fighting Obamacare's medicaid expansion on the local level for years", "title": "Sen.
