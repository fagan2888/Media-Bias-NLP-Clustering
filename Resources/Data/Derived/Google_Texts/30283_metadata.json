The other is a dreary examination of the job preferences and prospects for young Americans 18 to 34-year old \u2013 a once optimistic age cohort that has taken a beating in the aftermath of the worst recession of modern times.\n\nRelated: Millennials\u2019 Joblessness Costs the Government $8.9 Billion a Year\n\nDespite a youthful surge of interest in the government after President Obama\u2019s first historic election, federal employment of young people is tailing off and many millennials are leaving government service, according to The Washington Post.\n\nGovernment figures show the share of federal workers under the age of 30 dropped to seven percent, the lowest point in nearly a decade. The Post says that many federal agencies and departments are clamoring for digitally savvy young people to replace retiring baby boomers, but are having trouble finding them. Overall, about a quarter of the U.S. workforce is younger than 30 \u2013 or more than three times the proportion that holds down federal jobs.\n\nRelated: Are 401(k) Plans Setting Up Millennials for Pain?\n\nWhite House budget office personnel experts tell the Post they are increasingly distressed about the government\u2019s youthful brain drain and are doing everything they can to lure more young people into the federal bureaucracy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not easy given a raft of developments that have discouraged or scared away the millennials \u2013 including last year\u2019s government shutdown, periodic furloughs and pay freezes. What\u2019s more, the federal personnel system is extraordinarily slow and cumbersome, and it has discouraged many from seeking employment or trying to get a promotion\u2014especially those with college degrees who can find jobs in the private sector with far more flexibility and a corporate culture that\u2019s more appealing.\n\nStill, all of that couldn\u2019t be any worse than the realities for undereducated millennials who lack the verbal and technical skills to succeed in the workplace. So says The Future of Millennial Jobs, a new report by the Young Invincibles.\n\nRelated: Why Millennials \u2013 Shocker! \u2013 Now Prefer a GOP Congress\n\nThe study outlines a rather depressing job picture for those Americans and urges government policymakers to work in 2015 to align higher education with the workforce to try to spur economic growth in the years ahead. If the present demographic trends hold up, millennials by 2020 will make up about 50 percent of the work force, the group says.\n\nThe study suggests that despite society\u2019s mind-boggling array of technological advances, young people today have less to cheer about in terms of employment opportunities and advancement than people their age 50 years ago, at the dawn of the computer age.\n\nThe report says, \u201cThe optimistic vision of economic prosperity has been tarnished by severe economic retraction, industry shifts, and ironically, lost jobs due to increased technical efficiency.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Surprising Reason College Grads Can\u2019t Get a Job\n\nFor those young adults fortunate enough to have found employment, their jobs are disproportionately more likely to be part-time, the study shows. About 25 percent of employed 18 to 34-year-olds are working only a part-time positions, contrasted with one in six adults over 34-years old. Of course, 18-22 year olds are either in college and therefore working part time, or are undereducated and possibly working two jobs.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n\n\n\nDespite a steep drop in the unemployment rate, many millennials continue to struggle in low-wage sectors that analysts say may not set them up for meaningful careers or financial security. One consequence of this insecurity is fewer marriages and fewer children\u2014the building blocks of a dynamic society and economy. That\u2019s been the case in Japan, Italy and other developed countries that are struggling economically.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, employers \u201chave shifted towards hiring more part-time and temporary workers in lieu of investing in full-time employees,\u201d the report states. Although contract workers comprise a relatively small sector of the labor market, contract workers have also increased four-fold in the past three decades.\n\nCareer Builder\u2019s annual jobs forecast claims that 42 percent of employers planned to hire temporary or contract workers in 2014. On the positive side, over 40 percent of companies said they planned to convert some of those positions into full time positions down the road.\n\n\u201cYet the trends are alarming for young adults who are starting their careers with fewer options than before,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nWith all of that to contend with, a government post many not look so bad after all.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite a surge of interest in the government after President Obama\u2019s first election, federal employment of young people is tailing off and many Millennials bailing out.
