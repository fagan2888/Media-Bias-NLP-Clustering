I personally know and respect some of them. And much as I\u2019d like to spend pages upon pages calmly and respectfully refuting their arguments, that particular point is incidental to the question I want to ask here, and a larger point which needs to be made. That is, that no matter how severe the crisis surrounding a default may or may not be, the question needs to be asked \u2014 how did we get to the point where our government is willing to risk a crisis, however large, over intractable ideological disagreements?\n\nMany people, on both sides of the spectrum, have blamed this phenomenon of crisis courting on ideological extremism. According to this framing, if there were only more Republicans willing to raise taxes, or Democrats willing to delay Obamacare, or more members of either party willing to do (insert pie-in-the-sky party brand-destroying thing here), we could have functional government again. Bitter Republicans mourn the days of Bill Clinton\u2019s deal-making, while bitter Democrats mourn Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201c75 percent friend\u201d approach to Tip O\u2019Neil. In other words, according to this thought process, if people just stopped having principles altogether, we\u2019d be fine.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t think so. Because much as it\u2019s fashionable to pretend that believing in nothing produces more functional government, the fact is that all politicians need some sort of polestar by which to decide whether to support or not support a policy. Principles give people a metric by which to determine whether a particular legislative deal is a good one, for instance, and to measure tradeoffs. Democrats might not like what Republicans want, but at least they know what they have to give them to get anywhere, and vice versa. In other words, extremism/ideological certainty should be a clarifying force that makes deals easier, not one that impedes it.\n\nYet, neither side is getting anywhere, which raises the question of why. I\u2019m going to suggest a hypothesis that sounds like click bait, but hopefully won\u2019t read like it once I\u2019ve defended it. I think the reason neither party can get anything past the other isn\u2019t that they\u2019re too extreme \u2014 it\u2019s that they\u2019re too moral.\n\nBy that, I don\u2019t mean that both parties are doing the right thing. That would be impossible, since they\u2019re behaving in a diametrically opposed fashion over equally opposed principles. What I mean is that both parties are too convinced that they are doing the right thing, and equally, that to do anything the other party wants would be to do the wrong thing. In other words, they\u2019re not thinking of deals in terms of tradeoffs or mutual benefit, but in terms of ironclad moral rules.\n\nThis kind of thinking is death to any sort of collaborative decision-making. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Take the word of University of Michigan moral psychologist Timothy Ryan, who has demonstrated that overly moralistic outlooks on politics lead to a refusal to compromise, no matter how \u201cextreme\u201d those outlooks ar,e in his fascinating paper \u201cNo Compromise: Political Consequences of Moralized Attitudes.\u201d\n\nFor the purposes of this article, I want to focus on one particularly interesting experiment which Ryan did on his subjects, which sums up the problem in Washington perfectly. Subjects were asked if they would be willing to receive a certain small amount of money (between $0 and $5), provided that a politically opposed group (The Tea Party Patriots or the \u201cProgressive Change Campaign Committee\u201d) received half as much as they did.\n\nYet despite the favorable proportions and relatively small amounts of money involved, at least a plurality of both parties refused to take any money at all if it meant political opponents got anything. Interestingly, contrary to the prevailing media narrative about Republicans being the more extreme of the two parties, this effect was actually stronger among Democrats, of whom 65 percent refused to take any money, while a mere plurality (44 percent) of Republicans refused.\n\nNevertheless, the resulting effect was the same. When the issues involved were viewed as moral ones, the idea of compromise evaporates, because morality is viewed as an issue of following rules, and rules are not susceptible to tradeoffs. To quote the study:\n\nAgainst the backdrop of moral psychology, however, the phenomenon makes more sense, as moralized attitudes orient behavior toward adhering to rules, rather than maximizing gains.\n\nOr to put it a bit less clinically, let\u2019s quote the philosopher Ayn Rand:\n\nWhen men reduce their virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the force of an absolute, when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by the virtuous, it\u2019s picked up by scoundrels\u2014and you get the indecent spectacle of a cringing, bargaining, traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromising evil.\n\nAnd indeed, this is precisely the mindset that is currently plaguing negotiations in Washington, where many members of both parties appear willing to forgo any progress toward policy positions they support, if it means the other party benefits, however slightly, because any benefit to the other party is an implicit concession to evil and thus a violation of moral law.\n\nThis problem has been more widely publicized among Republicans, but it\u2019s also observable among Democrats. Consider the huffy reaction of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., when asked by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Crossfire why he wouldn\u2019t vote to extend benefits to veterans during the shutdown. Whitehouse\u2019s complaint about the seeming compromise measure was that it let Republicans keep any federal agencies closed. Certainly, the \u201cwe don\u2019t negotiate\u201d approach that Democrats take, and which Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., rightly characterized as a political misstep, is emblematic of the same problem. Indeed, the very language used by Democrats \u2014 that Republicans are \u201cterrorists,\u201d for instance \u2014 is all the confirmation needed.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Ryan provides one clue when he describes the problem as being a conflict between consequentialist thinking and deontology. He explains this way:\n\nA consequentialist appeal justifies a policy in terms of its expected effects. A deontological appeal, in contrast, suggests that some actions are required or prohibited by their very nature. For instance, a consequentialist way to frame one side of the collective bargaining issue would be, \u2018Collective bargaining agreements cause states to face budgetary problems,\u2019 while a deontological framing on the same side would be, \u2018Everybody has a right to work.\u2019 The former frame is, in principle, falsifiable, such as if it were shown that collective bargaining agreements do not cause budgetary problems. The latter is not.\n\nHe also adds that consequentialist thinking \u201cactivates higher cognition, more executive function, more complex planning, and brain areas that are diminished or absent in humans\u2019 evolutionary ancestors. In contrast, deontological reasoning is quicker, more emotional, more primal.\u201d\n\nThe problem, in short, is that too many people are going by what they feel, and not enough are actually thinking things through. Democrats and Republicans both need to drop their emotional hackles and begin thinking of what outcome will mutually benefit them, rather than how best they can hurt each other, no matter the damage to them, or to the country.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://redesign.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/R-Street-Logo1.png", "title": "The GOP\u2019s \u2018moral\u2019 hazard | R Street"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7e4\"", "article_summary": "I think the reason neither party can get anything past the other isn\u2019t that they\u2019re too extreme \u2014 it\u2019s that they\u2019re too moral.\nIn other words, they\u2019re not thinking of deals in terms of tradeoffs or mutual benefit, but in terms of ironclad moral rules.\nIndeed, the very language used by Democrats \u2014 that Republicans are \u201cterrorists,\u201d for instance \u2014 is all the confirmation needed.\nBitter Republicans mourn the days of Bill Clinton\u2019s deal-making, while bitter Democrats mourn Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201c75 percent friend\u201d approach to Tip O\u2019Neil.\nTo quote the study:Against the backdrop of moral psychology, however, the phenomenon makes more sense, as moralized attitudes orient behavior toward adhering to rules, rather than maximizing gains."}
