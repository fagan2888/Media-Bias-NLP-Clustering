Dan Schmidt, D-Moscow, brought two bills before the Senate Health and Welfare Committee. Both propose a way to expand medical coverage to uninsured Idahoans using federal dollars.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s proposals are based on work group recommendations. Three years ago, a work group made up of lawmakers and physicians considered straight Medicaid expansion as suggested within the Affordable Care Act. Leavitt Partners, a Salt Lake City research firm, provided a demographic study of individuals who make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for tax subsidies through the state Health Exchange. Milliman, a national actuarial research firm that consults for business, nonprofit, government and education partners, provided a fiscal report.\n\nThe group then gave a unanimous recommendation to the Legislature to expand Medicaid, but it was never heard, Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2014, a working group analyzed the various ways other states had expanded Medicaid and worked to make an \u201cIdaho plan\u201d that subsidized premiums for private insurance plans. This plan became known as the Healthy Idaho plan, backed by Close the Gap Idaho, but action was never taken on it either.\n\nBoth plans were presented as alternatives to Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter\u2019s Primary Care Access Program, which proposed the use of about $30 million in state funding to provide basic health services to the 78,000 individuals in the gap. Otter unveiled his plan in his State of the State speech Jan. 11. The Healthy Idaho Plan was repeatedly touted as a better option at the hearing.\n\n\u201cI want to make this clear \u2013 I applaud Gov. Otter for seeking action on those who fell into this Medicaid gap,\u201d said physician Ted Epperly,\n\nCEO of Family Medicine Residency of Idaho. He testified in support of Healthy Idaho to the Senate Health and Welfare Committee Feb. 2. \u201cBut this plan eliminates wasteful programs, and, more importantly, saves and improves the lives of working Idahoans who fall into the coverage gap, live sickly and die younger.\u201d\n\nSeveral business advocates, such as the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce, have argued for Medicaid expansion for years. Expanding coverage would save the state money and would help protect companies from the rising health insurance premiums associated with cost shifts from unpaid medical bills. But most of the testimony given at the hearing came from physicians who treat the uninsured and the uninsured themselves.\n\n\u201cSeventy-eight thousand Idahoans live in the gap and there is no dignity here,\u201d said Michelle Gluch, owner of Kid Co. and a master\u2019s degree student at Boise State University. \u201cMy story is not unique. Most of my friends fall into this gap. We are waitresses, construction workers and adjunct professors.\u201d\n\nThe most rousing testimony came from physician Kenneth Krell, director of critical care at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, who said that legislative inaction was responsible for the deaths of 1,000 Idahoans. That led the chairman of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, Lee Heider, R-Twin Falls, to threaten the removal of the next person to \u201ccharge the Senate unfavorably.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see those patients on a near-daily basis,\u201d Krell said of uninsured Idahoans who can\u2019t afford preventative care. \u201cDying often, because the disease processes are now at an end state and have resulted in organ failure.\u201d\n\nKrell\u2019s testimony was based on his own experiences as a physician and from a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that concluded states that expanded Medicaid saw significantly reduced death rates, 19.6 fewer deaths annually per 100,000 adults.\n\n\u201cI could only come to one inescapable conclusion \u2013 that the Idaho Legislature is unfortunately responsible for those deaths,\u201d Krell said. \u201cOur intransigence in failing to pass Medicaid expansion for the last three years has probably resulted in over 1,000 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe Healthy Idaho Plan and PCAP vary greatly in services and cost. PCAP provides primary services such as regular checkups. The Healthy Idaho Plan covers that and more, including prescriptions, hospitalization, and many specialized treatments associated with diseases such as diabetes and cancer.\n\nThe Healthy Idaho Plan pays for the expansion of Medicaid through $590 million in federal tax revenue while contributing about $30 million more in state contributions. The difference in state costs between this plan and PCAP, though, rises from Healthy Idaho\u2019s recommendation to shut down county and state indigent plans. That would save Idaho about $56 million, according to Close the Gap Idaho.\n\nOne such indigent program, the catastrophic medical care program, uses state general funds and local property taxes to cover medical costs for patients who can\u2019t pay the bill off in five years and cost more than $50 million in four of\n\nthe last five years, according to the Legislative Budget Book.\n\nHeider said he didn\u2019t want to hold a vote on the Healthy Idaho Plan because the committee hadn\u2019t yet heard from Otter on PCAP. Regardless, nearly everyone who testified asked the committee to approve the Healthy Idaho Plan.\n\n\u201cI think this is the most important public policy decision in the state of Idaho by far,\u201d said Boise Mayor David Bieter.\n\nDemocrats have tried to move on Medicaid expansion several times recently, but have failed to get traction. At the hearing, citizens and politicians urged the committee to put away political ideology while considering what is best for the state.\n\n\u201cAs a politician there have been times I was told if I go through with something it would be the end of my political career,\u201d Bieter said. \u201cI can say that in 17 years that was never true. Sometimes it was told to me as a threat and sometimes it was told to me as advice. I really urge you to pass this bill.\u201d\n\nHeider searched the room for someone with a dissenting opinion and found Fred Birnbaum, vice president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation. Birnbaum argued that the Healthy Idaho savings wouldn\u2019t necessarily happen as forecast. The savings are based on existing federal and state Medicaid contribution levels, only 10 percent of which are paid by the state. If the ratio changed, Idaho might see its savings disappear, Birnbaum said.\n\n\u201cThe savings that are projected are based on thin air in my opinion because we simply don\u2019t know what future Congresses are going to do,\u201d Birnbaum said.\n\nAbout 60 people signed up to testify, but less than a dozen were allowed to do so before Heider ended the hearing. With no motion, the proposed bills stay in Schmidt\u2019s hands \u2014 so it is possible they will return to the committee for a hearing or vote.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress", "author": "Benton Alexander Smith", "og": {"site_name": "Idaho Business Review", "description": "The Statehouse was teeming with physicians, city officials and citizens for the first Idaho Senate hearing on a bill to expand Medicaid to 78,000 uninsured", "title": "Idaho doctor: Legislative inaction has killed 1,000 Idahoans", "url": "http://idahobusinessreview.com/2016/02/03/idaho-doctor-legislative-inaction-has-killed-1000-idahoans/", "image": "http://idahobusinessreview.com/files/2015/02/Statehouse-spring-cropped-600x319.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Idaho doctor: Legislative inaction has killed 1,000 IdahoansIdaho Business Review", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "pdIfxBOwt8N_Zpc5UZ3AIrXpeYa5v0h0Jnr8IiS1W-A", "y_key": "877cbb0bd73c44cd", "thumbnail": "http://idahobusinessreview.com/files/2015/02/Statehouse-spring-cropped-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This plan became known as the Healthy Idaho plan, backed by Close the Gap Idaho, but action was never taken on it either.\nThe Healthy Idaho Plan was repeatedly touted as a better option at the hearing.\nThe Healthy Idaho Plan covers that and more, including prescriptions, hospitalization, and many specialized treatments associated with diseases such as diabetes and cancer.\nThat would save Idaho about $56 million, according to Close the Gap Idaho.\nBoth propose a way to expand medical coverage to uninsured Idahoans using federal dollars."}
