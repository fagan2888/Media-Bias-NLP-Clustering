That\u2019s very exciting for us.\u201d\n\nGov. David Ige hasn\u2019t yet decided whether he will sign the bill, and his staff has to vet all bills for legal issues, he said.\n\n\u201cThe departments will be doing their review and then we\u2019ll have the opportunity to look at it,\u201d Ige said.\n\nThose caught breaking the rules would be fined $10 for the first offense, and subsequent violations would lead to a $50 fine or mandatory community service.\n\nDozens of local governments have similar bans, including Hawaii County and New York City.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Heath, 5,600 kids in Hawaii try smoking each year, and 90 percent of daily smokers begin the habit before age 19. Meanwhile, 1,400 people die from tobacco use or exposure in Hawaii every year, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\n\u201cToday we have the opportunity to change the paradigm,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Rosalyn Baker, who introduced the bill.\n\nSmoking prevalence would fall an estimated 12 percent if the minimum smoking age was raised to 21, according to a report by the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe favorite flavors among teens who use electronic cigarettes are sweet tart and \u201cunicorn puke, which is described as a combination of every flavor of Skittle in one,\u201d Baker said.\n\n\u201cWhile the industry is not allowed to directly market to children, it is still developing packaging and advertising products in ways that appeal to children,\u201d she said.\n\nSabrina Olaes, 17, got involved in promoting the legislation after finding herself in restrooms full of electronic cigarette fumes when her classmates vaped at her high school.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you want to hold your breath because you don\u2019t want to smell what they\u2019re smoking,\u201d Olaes said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad to know that they\u2019ve fallen under the addiction.\u201d\n\nOpponents say it\u2019s unfair that a military veteran returning from service could be prevented from smoking.\n\n\u201cIt is not right because you are deemed an adult when you turn 18,\u201d said Michelle Johnston, owner of Sub Ohm Vapes in Kailua-Kona, on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island.\n\n\u201cYou can sign up and be in the military and basically give your life for your country. You can vote,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you be able to choose if you want to buy tobacco products or vaping products, when you\u2019re considered a legal adult?\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Gil Riviere, who voted against the bill in the 19-4 vote, said if the state wants to eliminate smoking, it should ban it for everyone.\n\n\u201cYou can sign contracts, you can get married, you can go to war and lose an arm or lose an eye \u2026 you come back and you\u2019re 20 years old and you can\u2019t have a cigarette,\u201d Riviere said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hawaii Poised to Become First U.S. State to Raise Smoking Age to 21", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hawaii Poised to Become First U.S. State to Raise Smoking Age to 21", "title": "Hawaii Poised to Become First U.S. State to Raise Smoking Age to 21 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/cigarettes-ashtray-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/25/hawaii-poised-to-become-first-u-s-state-to-raise-smoking-age-to-21/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hawaii Poised to Become First U.S. State to Raise Smoking Age to 21", "title": "Hawaii Poised to Become First U.S. State to Raise Smoking Age to 21 - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/cigarettes-ashtray-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Cigarettes, Electronic Cigarettes, Hawaii Smoking Age, Tobacco,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Tobacco", "published_time": "2015-04-25T02:30:52-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a5f\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHONOLULU (AP) \u2014 A bill that would make Hawaii the first state to raise the legal smoking age to 21 cleared the Legislature on Friday and is headed to the governor.\nSmoking prevalence would fall an estimated 12 percent if the minimum smoking age was raised to 21, according to a report by the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences.\nAccording to the state Department of Heath, 5,600 kids in Hawaii try smoking each year, and 90 percent of daily smokers begin the habit before age 19.\nThe bill would prevent adolescents from smoking, buying or possessing both traditional and electronic cigarettes.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cIt\u2019s definitely groundbreaking legislation,\u201d said Jessica Yamauchi, executive director of the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii, which pushed for the bill."}
