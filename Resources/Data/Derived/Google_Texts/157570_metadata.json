Rick Scott announced Thursday that his administration will file a lawsuit against the federal government for threatening to withhold more than $1 billion in funding for hospitals if the state fails to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt is appalling that President Obama would cut off federal health care dollars to Florida in an effort to force our state further into Obamacare,\u201d Scott said, citing a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that said the federal government couldn\u2019t put a \u201cgun to the head\u201d of states to force them to expand Medicaid under the health care law.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Obama administration quickly accused Scott of misconstruing that court decision because the state is not being forced to do anything. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest blasted the governor for putting politics above people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain how somebody would think that their political situation and their political interest is somehow more important than the livelihoods of 800,000 people,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nScott\u2019s announcement is the latest salvo in a lengthy battle he has waged with the federal government over health care money \u2014 a legacy that stretches from his days as a hospital CEO to his 2010 campaign for governor. Florida was the lead state on the initial lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn an extra twist, Scott\u2019s latest move further inflamed intra-party tensions in the Republican-controlled Legislature, with the leader of the conservative House backing his action while the president of the moderate Senate denounced it as counterproductive and the Senate\u2019s budget chief questioned whether Scott was pulling \u201ca political stunt.\u201d\n\nAlready at an impasse over the Medicaid fight, the two chambers are close to failing their state constitutional duty to balance Florida\u2019s more than $76 billion budget by May 1. Their two versions are more than $4 billion apart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tea party gone wild,\u201d quipped Mark Pafford, who leads the House Democrats.\n\nAdding to the high-stakes national politics of it all: The hospital program in question was established in 2005 under then-Gov. Jeb Bush, a likely presidential candidate who might now see one of his achievements \u2014 Medicaid reform \u2014 put at risk.\n\nAsked about the situation during a New Hampshire stop, Bush told The Miami Herald that the leaders should find a \u201ccompromise.\u201d But as for Medicaid expansion, Bush said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe surprise announcement by the governor follows weeks of escalating tensions between state and administration officials over Florida\u2019s opposition to Medicaid expansion. Florida has insisted that the federal government continue to give about $1.3 billion for a safety-net hospital program called the Low-Income Pool, which will run out of funding on June 30. When state dollars are added, the program gets about $2.2 billion annually.\n\nBut federal officials \u2014 who warned last year that LIP would not continue in its present form after this summer \u2014 have said the program\u2019s future is connected to the state\u2019s decision on Medicaid expansion. The state has one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation, with about a quarter of its non-Medicare-eligible population lacking coverage.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \u201cWe led the lawsuit that stopped the federal government from forcing states to expand Medicaid, and we will not sit by while the Obama administration holds hostage LIP funding in an effort to force expansion here in Florida.\u201d\n\nState officials wouldn\u2019t say exactly when or in what venue they would file their lawsuit. Scott is scheduled to appear on FOX News Thursday evening.\n\nNegotiations between the state and federal officials about LIP funding have stretched on for a year, partly poisoned by an atmosphere of mistrust between the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Scott\u2019s administration said it discussed multiple LIP models with federal officials, but it never officially submitted a plan amid the talks.\n\nAs Florida\u2019s 60-day legislative session started in early March, the Senate grew increasingly concerned that the governor\u2019s administration wasn\u2019t moving fast enough. So late last month it dispatched two Republican members to meet with federal officials in Washington and show its own LIP plan, which linked the program to Medicaid expansion.\n\nScott, angered by what he saw as interference, said the two undercut negotiations. But the state agency then adopted the tenets of the Senate plan \u2014 even as Scott continued to insist that the issues of LIP and Medicaid expansion were separate. The House also remains adamantly opposed to expansion.\n\nOn Tuesday, CMS made its position clear.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the future of the LIP, sufficient provider rates, and Medicaid expansion are linked in considering a solution for Florida\u2019s low-income citizens, safety net providers, and taxpayers,\u201d CMS Acting Director Vikki Wachino wrote to Florida\u2019s deputy Medicaid director, Justin Senior.\n\nWithin hours, Scott and his advisers began seriously discussing the lawsuit he announced Thursday. They referenced the 2012 Supreme Court ruling that upheld Obamacare\u2019s constitutionality but made Medicaid expansion optional. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said Obamacare\u2019s proposal to deny all Medicaid funds to a state if it refused to expand Medicaid further was unlawful coercion that amounted to \u201ceconomic dragooning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has already ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius that the president cannot force Medicaid expansion on states,\u201d Scott said in his public statement. \u201cIn fact, the court ruled that the president could not use \u2018gun to the head\u2019 approaches in pushing for Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nCMS countered Thursday afternoon that the state is not being forced to do anything. The LIP program is optional and \u201chas long been scheduled to expire June 30,\u201d agency spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement. Nor is CMS threatening to withhold the billions in federal dollars that help to fund Medicaid in Florida, Albright added.\n\n\u201cFlorida, like all states, is free to implement Medicaid expansion or not,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFlorida is requesting an additional optional extension, which raises a different question: whether it promotes the objectives of the Medicaid statute to use demonstration authority when the state has statutory options that would better serve the low-income population.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s Republican Senate president, Andy Gardiner, sides with CMS. \u201cThe federal government has no obligation to provide LIP funding, or to work within our timeframe,\u201d Gardiner said in a written statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we respect Gov. Scott\u2019s authority to protect the state\u2019s interests in the way he sees fit, we have a constitutional responsibility to pass a balanced budget by a specific deadline,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cFrom where I sit, it is difficult to understand how suing CMS on Day 45 of a 60-day session regarding an issue the state has been aware of for the last 12 months will yield a timely resolution to the critical health care challenges facing our state.\u201d\n\nOthers also question whether a lawsuit would have merit. Deborah Bachrach, a former New York Medicaid Director and at attorney at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, says she doesn\u2019t think the situation in Florida is coercion. The arrangement through which the state receives LIP is discretionary, and there\u2019s no obligation for the Department of Health and Human Services to renew it.\n\n\u201cWhatever the practical ramifications are, legally, I think the [HHS] secretary has the discretion to change the conditions under which the pool is granted or reduce the value of the pool,\u201d Bachrach said. Federal officials have very clearly stated that they believe providing coverage to individuals is a better mechanism than providing money directly to hospitals, she added.\n\nBut House Speaker Steve Crisafulli endorses Scott\u2019s maneuver.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s office reached out to our office just moments before the announcement was made. I believe the governor is doing what is best for the state, and he has the support of the House,\u201d Crisafulli said in a written statement.\n\nScott described the fight as an issue of fairness. Other states that have expanded their Medicaid programs still receive supplemental federal funding to help pay for uncompensated care because Medicaid expansion doesn\u2019t completely eliminate those costs, the governor argues.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has decided that the state must take on a larger Medicaid program, forcing our taxpayers to pay even more to government, before they get their own federal tax dollars back,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis is outrageous and specifically what the Supreme Court warned against.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s decision to tangle with the federal government over health care stretches back decades to his days leading the Columbia/HCA hospital chain. He became a leading critic of what was dubbed \u201cHillarycare\u201d during President Bill Clinton\u2019s first term in office in 1993. Four years later, the federal government accused Columbia/HCA of rampant fraud \u2014 political retribution, Scott defenders said. Scott was forced to leave the company, which paid a record $1.7 billion fraud fine.\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s sweeping victory in 2008, as Democrats pushed again for comprehensive health care legislation, Scott rose to fight the proposal with a group he funded. It was called Conservatives for Patients Rights, or CPR, and became the political seed of his 2010 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nScott abruptly reversed his opposition to expanding Medicaid under Obamacare before his election in 2014. But he didn\u2019t talk about it much, and the conservative House opposed the plan anyway. Earlier this month, Scott reversed course again and said he opposed Medicaid expansion \u2014 this time because of the federal government\u2019s LIP negotiations, which he said weren\u2019t being conducted in good faith.\n\n\u201cHow can you trust them?\u201d Scott asked POLITICO rhetorically.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It's the latest salvo in Gov.
