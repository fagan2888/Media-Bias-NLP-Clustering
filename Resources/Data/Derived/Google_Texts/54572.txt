Anderson County deputies said a man who was fatally shot while trying to rob the shooter.

Investigators with the Anderson County Coroner's Office said Herman Scott, 33, died from a shot to the chest Saturday around 4:30 p.m.

Sheriff John Skipper said Scott was trying to rob a man who lives at 1705 Belton Street, where the shooting happened.

"It was apparently a botched robbery," Skipper told WYFF. "At this time it appears that the individual at the home was defending himself."

Deputies interviewed a second man who arrived at a hospital with a gunshot wound. That man is not suspected to be the shooter.

Deputies said the injured man was nearby as Scott and the shooter struggled for the weapon.

Authorities have not filed any charges as they try to untangle what happened.
