Jenny Horne drew national attention this summer for her impassioned speech to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds.\n\nTo stay up-to-date on South Carolina politics, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android.\n\nNow she\u2019s ready to write a book about it.\n\nA week after Horne, R-Summerville, appeared at a \u201cchange-the-flag\u201d rally in Jackson, Miss., she confirmed plans to publish her account of what transpired.\n\n\u201cThey were inspired by what South Carolina did,\u201d Horne said last week of the various messages of support she\u2019s received since the flag came down.\n\nFollowing the June 17 shooting at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church, Horne took up Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s call for lawmakers to remove the rebel emblem from the Statehouse grounds where it had flown since the compromise of 2000. As the House debate bogged down, Horne took to the microphone and focused on the loss of state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor at Emanuel, and one of nine people killed in the racially motivated attack.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body,\u201d she said, pausing to sob before raising her voice, \u201cto do something meaningful, such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds.\u201d She added, \u201cRemove this flag and do it today because this issue is not getting any better with age.\u201d\n\nHorne, who said she has an agent, said her phone has been busy ever since. \u201cMy speech inspired the entire country,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s changed perceptions about the South, too.\n\nHorne\u2019s trip to Mississippi last week was her first speech outside the state, but she expects there would be more appearances elsewhere. She also believes that her grandfather\u2019s oft-repeated story that she is related to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis is for real.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not, I have no idea,\u201d she said.\n\nHorne was in Mississippi to attend a 400-person rally aimed at doing away with the Confederate emblem in that state\u2019s official flag. She\u2019s also been mentioned as candidate for higher office, including Congress, but for now is non-committal. \u201cIt could be just about anything,\u201d she said of her future.\n\nFrom dissing Haley to hugging her\n\nThe S.C. Chamber of Commerce has gone from opposing Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s first election bid to naming her the 2015 \u201cPublic Servant of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are blessed to live in a place where our governor has put her heart and soul into making our state and the business community better,\u201d S.C. Chamber President Ted Pitt said in making the announcement. \u201cWe especially applaud Governor Haley for her leadership after the Charleston tragedy in bringing our state together at a time when we could\u2019ve easily been divided.\u201d\n\nThe chamber previously backed Democrat Vincent Sheheen for governor during Haley\u2019s first run, in 2010. In a reversal of that support, the chamber then sided with Haley in their 2014 rematch.\n\nHaley is the only sitting governor in the past 25 years to get the award, the chamber said. The last governor who received it was Carroll Campbell.\n\nPitts is Haley\u2019s former chief of staff.\n\nMoney in politics explainer\n\nThe League of Women Voters of the Charleston Area is sponsoring a \u201cMoney in Politics\u201d forum Wednesday at the College of Charleston.\n\nThe discussion will include a history of campaign financing as well as insight in Supreme Court rulings on the habit today.\n\nAmong those taking part will be local state Rep. Jenny Horne; state Sens. Marlon Kimpson and Paul Thurmond; and Phil Noble, a consultant and activist.\n\nThe event begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Wells Fargo Auditorium, 5 Liberty St.\n\nPresidential visits this week\n\nRepublicans\n\nNew York businessman Donald Trump will be at the Anderson Civic Center in Anderson on Monday for a rally that begins at 6 p.m. The venue was changed from T.L. Hanna High School.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., will make two stops. On Friday he will join S.C.

Jeb Bush will be on Daniel Island on Saturday morning as part of U.S. Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s Town Hall series for presidential candidates. The event begins at 9 a.m. at Bishop England High School, Daniel Island, Berkeley County.\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will have a two-day swing through the state this week.
