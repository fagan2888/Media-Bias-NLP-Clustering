But it isn't,\" Pearl writes, later adding: \"One reason the U.S. ranks so poorly globally is that health outcomes for certain racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups fare so poorly domestically.\"\n\nA particular focus of late has been on the care access disparities experienced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, struggles that are particularly acute in rural areas, according to CNN. In states like Nebraska, LGBT patients in rural areas not only are less likely to have health insurance than their urban counterparts, but they often face health issues related to discrimination and are treated by providers whose lack of knowledge about these issues can lead to poor outcomes, the article states.\n\nHope has arrived, however, in the form of expanded insurance coverage due to the Affordable Care Act, as well as creative solutions at the community level, he says. Examples of the latter include the Crossroad Health Center in Cincinnati's efforts to foster diabetes management in the Latino community; Harlem Hospital's addition of patient navigators and free breast cancer screenings; and Detroit community groups' initiative to improve blood-pressure control among African-Americans, according to Pearl.\n\nAnd Kaiser Permante's own efforts have put the company in the 10 top percent in the nation for all racial groups across several clinical areas, Pearl notes. In the company's ongoing efforts to eliminate disparities, it has found particular success with some of the following practices, according to Pearl:\n\nDevelop health education tools that cater to different segments of the population\n\nInvest in translation and interpretation services for bilingual patients\n\nUse electronic health records (EHRs) to track and measure the health outcomes of patients, and use this information to design better treatments\n\nPartner with the community to foster outreach and care coordination\n\nAt least one of these recommendations is backed up by the Department of Health and Human Services, which has encouraged providers to harness the power of EHRs to close health gaps, FierceEMR reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Forbes article\n\n- here's the CNN report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n3 ways hospitals can address disparities among diverse patient populations\n\nHealthcare fails women of color in states across the country\n\nEthnic disparities in care continue to trouble researchers\n\nEHRs can boost health of low-income, minority populations\n\nWill health disparities drive economic change?\n\nGroup says needs of LGBT patients not being met\n\nHospital-community partnerships: Be the spark", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research leaves little doubt that significant care quality disparities\u00a0due to race,\u00a0income,\u00a0gender\u00a0and even\u00a0sexual orientation\u00a0continue to trouble the U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Research leaves little doubt that significant care quality disparities\u00a0due to race,\u00a0income,\u00a0gender\u00a0and even\u00a0sexual orientation\u00a0continue to trouble the U.S.", "title": "4 ways to tackle healthcare disparities", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/4-ways-tackle-healthcare-disparities/2015-03-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Harlem Hospital,healthcare access,Healthcare Disparities,Kaiser Permanente,LGBT patients,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f4c\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the Forbes article- here's the CNN reportRelated Articles:3 ways hospitals can address disparities among diverse patient populationsHealthcare fails women of color in states across the countryEthnic disparities in care continue to trouble researchersEHRs can boost health of low-income, minority populationsWill health disparities drive economic change?\nGroup says needs of LGBT patients not being metHospital-community partnerships: Be the spark\nA particular focus of late has been on the care access disparities experienced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, struggles that are particularly acute in rural areas, according to CNN.\nBut it isn't,\" Pearl writes, later adding: \"One reason the U.S. ranks so poorly globally is that health outcomes for certain racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups fare so poorly domestically.\"\n\"Politicians, pundits and executives proudly declare America's medical care is the best in the world."}
