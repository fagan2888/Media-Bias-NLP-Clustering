He said he picked up tips from veteran Ryan Clark and learned to take better angles to the ball. At one point, he called the difference between last season and this season \u201cnight and day.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday afternoon in Houston, however, Rambo showed that he still has room for improvement. In the second quarter of Washington\u2019s 17-6 loss to the Texans, the second-year safety was the victim of a blown coverage and then missed an open-field tackle on wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who went on to score what was a 76-yard touchdown pass.\n\nRambo took responsibility for the missed tackle Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to make a play,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just playing my side of the field, doing my responsibility. I didn\u2019t see the guy. I\u2019ll take the blame for that. I should\u2019ve been better on that play.\u201d\n\nFirst-year coach Jay Gruden indicated that Rambo\u2019s missed tackle was the final mistake of several on the play. He said the defense \u201cfouled up\u201d the coverage.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple guys break it,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBut ultimately when they make a big play we\u2019ve got to get them on the ground for a 25-yard gain, and missed tackles twice was unfortunate. But we were supposed to have somebody trail him underneath and blew the coverage.\u201d\n\nDefensive captain DeAngelo Hall was the only cornerback on Rambo\u2019s side of the field on that particular play, but he shaded toward the middle of the field. It\u2019s unclear whether he, or someone else, was supposed to provide support in front of Rambo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blown coverage,\u201d Hall said Sunday night. \u201cWe should have had a man underneath. Bacarri was trying to read the quarterback and, you know, [Texans quarterback Ryan] Fitzpatrick did a good job of going one way and then taking his eyes right back. You know, we\u2019ve got to get the guy on the ground. Get the guy on the ground and, you know, we\u2019ll get a chance to play another down. \u201d\n\nRambo said he did not see Hopkins until the ball left Fitzpatrick\u2019s hand. And when he did see the Hopkins, Rambo was caught off balance and lost his footing.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve saw him coming across the field instead of reading the quarterback for as long as I did,\u201d said Rambo, who finished with two tackles in the game. \u201cI\u2019ll take the blame for that. But the only thing I can do is correct myself on it and now allow it to happen again.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins signed strong safety Duke Ihenacho, who started 17 games for the Denver Broncos last season, on a waiver claim a little more than a week ago. Ihenacho only played a handful of snaps on special teams but could start in Rambo\u2019s place Sunday against the Jaguars, according to Gruden.\n\n\u201cI think Duke, with another week of practice, will be able to give us some production on defense and on special teams more so than he did, obviously, this week,\u201d Gruden said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Jay Gruden said there was a blown coverage on DeAndre Hopkins' 76-yard catch-and-run Sunday, Rambo took responsibility for his missed tackle. \"I should've been better on that play,\" he said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "While Jay Gruden said there was a blown coverage on DeAndre Hopkins\u2019 76-yard catch-and-run Sunday, Rambo took responsibility for his missed tackle. \u201cI should\u2019ve been better on that play,\u201d he said.", "title": "Redskins\u2019 Bacarri Rambo assumes blame for Texans\u2019 lengthy touchdown pass", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/8/redskins-bacarri-rambo-assumes-blame-texans-length/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/07/1355144038270a235f0f6a7067000850.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/07/1355144038270a235f0f6a7067000850.jpg", "description": "While Jay Gruden said there was a blown coverage on DeAndre Hopkins' 76-yard catch-and-run Sunday, Rambo took responsibility for his missed tackle. \"I should've been better on that play,\" he said.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins\u2019 Bacarri Rambo assumes blame for Texans\u2019 lengthy"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Bacarri Rambo, Deandre Hopkins, Jay Gruden, Ryan Clark"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd621\"", "article_summary": "From training camp to the preseason, Redskins safety Bacarri Rambo insisted that he had improved as a tackler.\nI should\u2019ve been better on that play.\u201dFirst-year coach Jay Gruden indicated that Rambo\u2019s missed tackle was the final mistake of several on the play.\nRambo took responsibility for the missed tackle Monday morning.\nHe said he picked up tips from veteran Ryan Clark and learned to take better angles to the ball.\nAt one point, he called the difference between last season and this season \u201cnight and day.\u201dOn Sunday afternoon in Houston, however, Rambo showed that he still has room for improvement."}
