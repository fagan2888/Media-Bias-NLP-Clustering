(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nHouse Republicans are moving on to a new round of budget fights after failing on Tuesday to overturn President Obama\u2019s veto of legislation to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nRepublicans were not able to rally the support of two-thirds of the House necessary to overturn the veto, leaving conservatives to turn their attention to a final year of budget fights with the president. The 241-186 vote, appropriately scheduled for Groundhog Day, was the 63rd time the House has voted to overturn all or part of Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\n[Sign up for The Washington Post\u2019s must-read political tipsheet, The Daily 202]\n\nRepublican leaders are hoping for a smooth and speedy budget process in 2016. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wisc.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) are promising to release the GOP\u2019s official spending blueprint within the next several weeks (Obama will release his own budget next week). But GOP leaders are battling a small group of conservatives who want them to retreat from last year\u2019s budget deal with Obama and fellow Democrats, which increased spending by $30 billion over the coming year.\n\nSome hard-line Republicans are quietly complaining the new budget should jettison the increases agreed to in the two-year deal. In response, McCarthy and other House Republican leaders are discussing ways to again turn to the reconciliation process that set up the Obamacare repeal vote, allowing conservatives to vote on priorities like overhauling the tax code and reforming welfare policy as a consolation for spending hikes.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t looked at exactly what reconciliation would be used for,\u201d McCarthy told reporters on Monday. \u201cThere are a lot of opportunities out there.\u201d\n\nThe budget process also marks a key test for Ryan, who promised conservatives who helped elect him that he would institute regular budget order and listen more closely to their demands. Ryan supported the $1.1 trillion budget deal, despite calling it a \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d and promising to slash spending and balance the budget in ten years. The former Budget Committee chair\u2019s previous budgets included sweeping proposals to overhaul entitlement programs while also cutting taxes.\n\n[Congress scrambles to cut deals on spending and taxes]\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if Ryan can meet conservative demands. That task was made more difficult last month when the Congressional Budget Office announced the deficit is expected to climb to $544 billion this year. The $105 billion increase was mostly due to tax cuts enacted as part of the budget deal Ryan helped pass last year.\n\nAnd McCarthy on Monday tried to tamp down talk of a GOP proposal that would decrease the spending agreed to in last year\u2019s deal. He argued the best way to slash spending is to reform entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. The upcoming budget should be focused on balancing the existing commitment, he said.\n\n\u201cWe all know the big problem is entitlement and mandatory\u201d spending, McCarthy said. \u201cI look to us sticking to the number we have.\u201d\n\nLast year, GOP leaders used reconciliation as a safety valve to deflect conservative steam from the budget process, and there are signs they may need to do so again.\n\nUnlike typical legislation, budget reconciliation bills cannot be filibustered in the Senate where Republicans have a 54 to 48 majority. But the political context is different in 2016, with a lame duck Congress and president. Obama would likely veto a bill that aims to undermine policies passed during his presidency. Lawmakers may be better off waiting to work with the next president.\n\nRight now, the fight is over how \u2014 or whether \u2014 to spend the $30 billion spending hike in last year\u2019s budget deal. Obama will outline his vision for how to spend the additional money when he releases his fiscal 2017 budget. Obama is also expected to include expanded funding for computer education and cancer research in his pitch.\n\nRepublicans want their budget bid to be focused on cutting spending and ending the deficit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important that we hit the ground right this year,\u201d said. Rep. Ted Yoho, (R-Fla.). \u201cThirty billion dollars, that\u2019s a ton of money,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said nobody liked being forced to pass a massive omnibus spending bill last year \u2014 explaining that passing this year\u2019s budget is the first step to preventing that from recurring.\n\n\u201cI would see the budget committee getting done at the end of February and having it on the floor in March.\u201d McCarthy predicted.\n\nThen, Congress would turn to writing the 12 annual appropriations bills.\n\nYoho said the only way the spending increases spelled out in the 2015 deal could be acceptable is if they are offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. Yoho said he was confident that Ryan has a vision for making that happen.\n\nBut vague promises might not be enough for conservatives, who expect leaders to pursue a more conservative agenda this year \u2014 especially Ryan. Several members of the House Freedom Caucus say they want leaders to challenge Obama on basically all of his proposals, including the budget.\n\nNone of the most conservative House members voted for last year\u2019s budget agreement, which was spearheaded by then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on his way out of the job.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pushback against this higher number,\u201d said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.).\n\nMulvaney said he and most conservatives wouldn\u2019t even consider voting for\n\n\u201cWhy would you vote against the [2015] budget deal, against the omnibus and then vote for this new budget that reinforces the things you already voted against?\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican budget leaders and aides said they may not like adding $30 billion to an already strained federal budget. But they conceded the deal passed last year is now law.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t walk away from that commitment,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) told reporters last month.\n\nMulvaney said the House budget reflects Republican promises to cut spending, even if it means the spending bills that pass later this year still include the $30 billion increase.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s happened before,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cWe have to find a budget we can pass.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy avoided offering any specific explanations of how the upcoming budget would stick to previous commitments. He said he and Ryan met with House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) and they are looking to move things as quickly and collaboratively as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are looking over all that we want to balance,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found ways that we can find the savings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP leaders are battling a small group of conservatives who want them to back down from last year's budget deal with Obama and fellow Democrats.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "GOP leaders are battling a small group of conservatives who want them to back down from last year's budget deal with Obama and fellow Democrats.", "title": "After veto vote on Obamacare repeal, GOP moves on to another budget fight", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/02/02/after-tuesday-veto-vote-on-obamacare-repeal-gop-moves-on-to-another-budget-fight/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/09/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Congress_Republicans-04842-1639.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "kevin mccarthy, paul ryan, veto, veto override, reconciliation, obamacare, obamcare repeal, affordable care act, gop leaders, budget, deficit, congressional budget, gop budget, house freedom caucus, conservatives", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "kevin mccarthy, paul ryan, veto, veto override, reconciliation, obamacare, obamcare repeal, affordable care act, gop leaders, budget, deficit, congressional budget, gop budget, house freedom caucus, conservatives"}, "article_summary": "Right now, the fight is over how \u2014 or whether \u2014 to spend the $30 billion spending hike in last year\u2019s budget deal.\nRepublican budget leaders and aides said they may not like adding $30 billion to an already strained federal budget.\nThe $105 billion increase was mostly due to tax cuts enacted as part of the budget deal Ryan helped pass last year.\nRyan supported the $1.1 trillion budget deal, despite calling it a \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d and promising to slash spending and balance the budget in ten years.\n\u201cWe all know the big problem is entitlement and mandatory\u201d spending, McCarthy said."}
