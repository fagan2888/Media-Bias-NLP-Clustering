That much was clear from last night\u2019s head-to-head debate in Southold.\n\nThe debate, like the election, comes down to this: Which candidate is better able to accomplish those objectives and \u2014 more pointedly \u2014 which candidate can unseat Zeldin in his first re-election bid this November?\n\nThere are plenty of differences between Anna Throne-Holst of Bridgehampton and Dave Calone of East Setauket and the candidates worked to stay focused on those differences during the 90-minute debate in the Southold Junior-Senior High School auditorium.\n\nThrone-Holst, a three-term Southampton Town supervisor who stepped down to run for Congress, repeatedly stressed her electability and her proven ability to \u201cget the job done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the only one up here that has run and won in four elections\u2026and actually gotten the job done \u2026 the only one who\u2019s put forward a progressive agenda and gotten it done,\u201d Throne-Holst said.\n\nCalone, a venture capitalist focused on technology start-ups, former federal prosecutor and former chairman of the Suffolk County Planning Commission, pointed to his experience in forging public-private partnerships, in prosecuting fraud and terrorism cases and his expertise on land use and development matters, and stressed his local roots as a lifelong Long Islander and party pedigree as a lifelong Democrat.\n\n\u201cI am so angry about the work that\u2019s being done in Washington,\u201d Calone said. \u201cLee Zeldin and the Tea Party Republicans are putting our health care at risk, they\u2019re putting our environment at risk, they\u2019re putting our education system at risk and they\u2019re putting our\u2026 economic system at risk,\u201d Calone said. \u201cWith my background in job creation and environmental leadership, I\u2019m looking forward to taking him on in November.\u201d\n\nLeague of Women Voters moderator Catherine Peacock posed questions on 10 different topics of both national and local import.\n\nCalone and Throne-Holst were polite even as they sparred over personal capabilities and experience \u2014 with Throne-Holst jabbing Calone for his time as a LIPA trustee and Calone bringing up his endorsement by \u201cevery Democratic elected official who served with her on the town board.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of where they stand on the issues raised in questions at last night\u2019s debate, hosted by the Southold Town Democratic Club:\n\nThe economy and jobs\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand what this economy is built on. It\u2019s built on the service industry, the health care industry and yes, tourism, second-home ownership and the environment. If we don\u2019t support and build that job base, we are letting down what is the basis for our economy here.\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cWe must make sure our environment is working. Our environment is critically important, for tourism and other critical industries. Aquaculture is one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgriculture is important. We have an aging farming population. One of the reasons is how expensive it is to go into farming, which requires buying equipment like tractors and hoop houses. I helped local farmers access a state program that provided 20 percent of the funds for capital equipment purchases.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have experience identifying the problems and helping create jobs through public-private partnerships.\u201d\n\nMinimum wage\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cI support raising the minimum wage, making it predictable as New York state has done, and making it indexed to inflation so we don\u2019t have this fight every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would expand the earned income tax credit for working families.\u201d\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cI support raising the minimum wage. Economic research demonstrates it helps businesses do better. They become more profitable. There\u2019s a net positive in cost to the society- people no longer reliant on social service benefits funded by taxpayers.\u201d\n\nClimate Change\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cLee Zeldin is on record as a climate change denier. How do you live on \u2014 let alone represent Long Island as a climate change denier. It\u2019s unfathomable. This is an economy that\u2019s threatened by climate change. There simply isn\u2019t a business on the East End that is unaffected by climate change.\u201d\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cWe are on the front lines of climate change. It is real. It is caused, or at least exacerbated, by man\u2019s activities. Lee Zeldin has voted against the EPA\u2019s clean power plan to reduce carbon emissions across the country. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a leader in renewable energy in Suffolk County. Solar providers came to us about every town in Suffolk County having different rules for solar installations. We put together a [model]code that streamlined the process for solar panels. We also wrote a wind code and geothermal code.\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cWe went further in Southampton. We did not adopt that code because it created more red tape. We handled it differently. We put a list of vetted solar providers on our website, so residents and neighborhoods could opt in to it easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opponent as a LIPA trustee led the RFP process for the second Caithness plant, a $5 billion fossil fuel burning plant.\u201d\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cAs a federal prosecutor, I investigated and prosecuted folks in oil and gas. I saw how they\u2019re benefiting from federal subsidies. We need to eliminate them and put more money into renewable energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was responsible for the largest renewable energy RFP in LIPA\u2019s history. I support moving to a more decentralized system and moving away from a carbon-based economy.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cThe federal government does not legislate anything around male reproductive rights. Why the federal government thinks it has any place legislating around women\u2019s reproductive rights is not only a mystery, it is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cI can speak from personal experience. Planned Parenthood also provides breast cancer screening and my mom survived breast cancer twice. It\u2019s only because of early screening that she\u2019s alive today. Planned Parenthood is not just an important issue, it\u2019s a matter of life and death. We need to do a better job of getting the types of services Planned Parenthood provides to all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nTick borne diseases\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cThere has been mixed success with the things that have been utilized. The sharpshooting effort was not particularly successful. At the end of the day we need to do more on the four-poster side of things. Also need to make sure we do screenings, including our pets, to remove ticks before they can infect.\u201d\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cSharpshooting was very controversial. We put together a group \u2013 including the hunting, medical and animal protection communities \u2014 to work out a deer management plan. We looked at everything \u2014 four-poster, sterilization, culling \u2014 to come up with a comprehensive plan that\u2019s based on science. And we know it\u2019s not so much a deer problem as a rodent and bird problem.\n\nBalancing privacy and national security/law enforcement\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cThe government needs to work with the tech industry to make sure technology is being developed that meets those needs and protects privacy rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure guns are out of the hands of terrorists, out of the hands of people who are not able to make sound decisions, who have a violent past. We need common sense gun safety legislation closing the loopholes \u2014 the internet and gun shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must make sure our private information is protected, but that people who are perpetrating terrorism and crimes are held accountable.\u201d\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cWe must retain a warrant-based system and protect the role of the judiciary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn speaking with the technology community on this issue, I believe the solution a will be a single key for each person\u2019s phone that\u2019s not allowed to be touched by the government unless a court-ordered warrant is issued for that phone.\u201d\n\nWastewater treatment\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure the federal government gets back in the field with funding for infrastructure \u2014 sewage treatment plants and advanced septic systems.\u201d\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cWe need town boards to make sure their comprehensive plans are updated regularly, to make sure new sewer capacity doesn\u2019t result in increased density.\u201d\n\nImmigration\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cA path to citizenship is critically important. Our economy depends on it. I support Presiden Obama\u2019s executive orders. I support the Group of Eight plan, which is sage and sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifteen million people \u2014 to think we\u2019re going to round them up and ship them out as Lee Zeldin wants to do. Look at the balance sheet \u2013 look at the cost of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a business on Long Island that doesn\u2019t understand how critically important labor is to us and how critically important the immigrant community is to that labor.\u201d\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cI support DACA and DAPA. Lee Zeldin voted to shut down Homeland Security because he opposes DACA and DAPA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have people who graduate from our schools who then have to leave after getting that great education in the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should staple a green card to every engineering degree we issue in the United States. If folks want to stay here and build the next generation of American jobs and the next generation of American companies, we should let them.\u201d\n\nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid\n\nCalone:\n\n\u201cWe need to strengthen our systems. I support extending the cap on income for social security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to allow the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices, which it is now not allowed to do.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at the possibility of allowing people to buy into the Medicare system as an option. We need to allow people to purchase insurance across state lines. And we should establish a reinsurance ptorgram for catastrophic illness.\u201d\n\nThrone-Holst:\n\n\u201cWe need to put the next step of the Affordable Care Act in place, to reduce the cost of health care and expand the availability.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth Republic went out of business because the Republicans refused to release the funds that were part of the Affordable Care Act to stabilize the marketplace plans as they were figuring out risk when just underway. Everyone knew it but it was not appropriated for them \u2014 or it would still be there today.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wot-verification": "15191109ecd7f772357e", "og": {"site_name": "RiverheadLOCAL", "description": "The two Democrats who want a shot at the First Congressional District seat held by freshman Republican Lee Zeldin mostly agree on what the key issues are and where they stand on them.
