Their affiliation agreement allows UNC to manage operations at Nash.\n\nNash Health CEO Larry Chewning will now be on UNC Health's payroll, but Nash will continue to be governed by its independent board of directors.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that really excited us about the relationship with UNC is that we feel like we get most of the resources that hospitals that have been fully-merged into their system get, but yet we\u2019re able to maintain local control and local governance of our community hospital here,\u201d said Chewning.\n\nChewning said UNC and Nash will have increased access to equipment and medical discounts, and can share resources and best practices. Chewning said that\u2019s especially important, as federal health care reform will penalize hospitals where Medicare recipients are frequently re-admitted.\n\nHospital mergers are accelerating as they navigate rising health care costs and Affordable Care Act requirements. But the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice worry about health care monopolies driving up patient costs.\n\nDavid Strong is UNC's COO responsible for affiliate hospitals. He said the partnerships get more resources into rural communities. For example, Strong said, UNC's partnership with Johnston Health brought a radiation oncology clinic to Johnston County.\n\n\u201cSo what you have is a patient who no longer has to drive to Raleigh or to Durham to receive services everyday twice a day, but they're able to stay in their community and receive that service,\u201d Strong said. \u201cAnd so, obviously, that saves time, money.\u201d\n\nRex Health spokesman Alan Wolf adds that a larger system can bargain for cheaper medicine and equipment, and those savings are passed on to patients.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business & Economy", "description": "Nash Health Care in Rocky Mount is the newest hospital to join the UNC Health System.
