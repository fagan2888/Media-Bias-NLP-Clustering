It wasn’t just Obamacare.

Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber had his research assistants at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study the federal government’s TARP program, President Obama’s stimulus bill and other Obama administration policies while he was working for the administration.

As Congress tries to track down Gruber’s research assistants ahead of his next call-back before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, The Daily Caller exclusively identified one of his closest research assistants and identified the work the man did for Gruber during the period in which Gruber was working as a consultant for the Obama administration.

University of Pennsylvania business graduate student Andy Wu worked for Gruber as a research assistant at MIT.

“Worked closely with Professor Gruber on health care reform; Professor Gruber is a leading health economist and advisor to the Obama Administration,” Wu wrote on his LinkedIn page for the period May 2009 to June 2010.

“Conducted data collection, data analysis, and literature reviews on several pressing policy issues, including Medicare Part D, unemployment insurance, TARP executive bonuses, and stimulus bill,” Wu said. “Researched empirical and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the liquidity of personal income, in support of Professor Gruber’s work on health care reform and the Cadillac tax.”

Wu did not elaborate further on why he was doing research on Obama administration policies through Gruber.

“Thanks for the email. I have no comment at this time,” Wu told TheDC.
