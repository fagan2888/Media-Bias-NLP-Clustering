It was his close that caught my eye, however, and led to a request (and his gracious approval) for a guest post refuting the idea that not backing nominee Trump \u201cis the business of cowards.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Jazz wrote:\n\nAnd none of this touches on the fact that each and every Republican and conservative reading his advice will have to walk into a voting booth on November 8th, close the curtains, stand alone in the darkness and\u2026 vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton. As for me, I prefer to win, or at least go down swinging. Surrendering the battle for the White House uncontested is the business of cowards and I want no part of it.\n\nBack at CPAC, I told PBS (which misidentified me as a Rubio supporter) that I would never back Trump in the general election. Trump\u2019s liberal policies \u2014 including, but not limited to, not tackling entitlement reform, support for abortion, and opposition to free trade \u2014 make him nearly as unfit for the White House as Hillary Clinton. Add that to his shamefully boorish behavior, and the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d argument implied by Jazz and others should be woefully inadequate to the task of convincing anyone that America\u2019s decline under Trump would be substantially slower than under Clinton.\n\nAnd while Will\u2019s argument isn\u2019t the best, he\u2019s right that Republicans should focus on stopping Trump while pushing for victories down the card. Concentrated efforts to maintain conservative and GOP holdings across the country would help mitigate the disaster that would be either a Trump or Clinton presidency.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, however, contrary to Jazz\u2019s contention that those of us too principled to vote for a narcissistic charlatan are \u201ccowards,\u201d Will put it well that it\u2019s the GOP sell-outs who are the truly spineless:\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s damage to the Republican Party, although already extensive, has barely begun. Republican quislings will multiply, slinking into support of the most anti-conservative presidential aspirant in their party\u2019s history. These collaborationists will render themselves ineligible to participate in the party\u2019s reconstruction.\n\nExactly. And while #NeverTrump is probably going to go down swinging in defeat \u2014 party influencers are abandoning it in droves, and grassroots conservatives at CPAC weren\u2019t fans \u2014 for me this is just the latest effort to use defeat as a way to propel the GOP in a conservative direction.\n\nIn 2008, I convinced myself to vote for John McCain for president after three months of careful consideration \u2014 only to watch in unmitigated shock as he partnered with Bush and Obama to use Main Street\u2019s dollars to bail out the banks. I ended up conducting a write-in vote because of McCain\u2019s support for TARP.\n\nIn 2012, I was faced with a similar problem \u2014 do I vote for Romney \u2014 the first GOP presidential nominee to run an ad touting his support for abortion, whose opposition to the Affordable Care Act and the HHS abortifacient/contraceptive mandate were huge question marks in my mind \u2014 in order to stop a second Obama term?\n\nIn the end, after eight months of prayer and thought, I again conducted a write-in. It was one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve had to make in a decade of politics. I made it literally in the voting booth, but I applied the advice of a priest who explained to a Bible study group that a Catholic\u2019s vote should go to the candidate who would best swing the dial in the Catholic direction.\n\nSince Romney would merely slow the pendulum\u2019s swing away from Catholicism, not stop or reverse the direction, I again conducted a write-in. (To be fair, the priest was actually encouraging a \u201clesser of two evils\u201d vote.)\n\nThis is now the third election cycle in which my voting decision has, to paraphrase Jazz, been accused by some of collaborating to put a Democrat in the White House. In fact, a different priest said in 2012 that I committed a sin by not backing Romney against Obama due to the anti-Catholic HHS Mandate.\n\nIf I had simply not voted, those critics would be right. But by conducting a write-in vote, I am making clear to party bosses, candidates, and others that I want to send a worthy candidate to the White House. They just have to put one forth.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Cowards vs. sell-outs?", "title": "#NeverTrump is the business of principles", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/05/01/nevertrump-is-the-business-of-principles/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-01T21:01:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-02T02:02:07+00:00"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, Dustin Siggins, George Will, Hillary Clinton, nevertrump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Surrendering the battle for the White House uncontested is the business of cowards and I want no part of it.\nBut by conducting a write-in vote, I am making clear to party bosses, candidates, and others that I want to send a worthy candidate to the White House.\nI ended up conducting a write-in vote because of McCain\u2019s support for TARP.\nTrump\u2019s liberal policies \u2014 including, but not limited to, not tackling entitlement reform, support for abortion, and opposition to free trade \u2014 make him nearly as unfit for the White House as Hillary Clinton.\nBack at CPAC, I told PBS (which misidentified me as a Rubio supporter) that I would never back Trump in the general election."}
