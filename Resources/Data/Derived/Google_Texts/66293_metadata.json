Scott Brown speaks in November 2012, a week after he was unseated by Elizabeth Warren. Brown is now weighing another Senate bid -- in New Hampshire. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nBack in 2009, it took Scott Brown only days to go from a would-be candidate, for the late Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s U.S. Senate seat, to actual candidate, in a race Brown eventually won.\n\nPresently, though, it\u2019s taking a lot longer for Brown to decide if he\u2019ll run for the U.S. Senate again. This time, it would be in New Hampshire against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d Brown said about two weeks ago, addressing a group of college Republicans \u2014 not in New Hampshire, but in New York. He was speaking at Cornell University, where you could almost hear the grind of the decision-making inside his head.\n\n\u201cSo on the one hand I\u2019m saying, \u2018Yeah, you need people like me down there. You need hard-working, independent, good people who want to put our country\u2019s interests first,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nAnd then Brown argued the other side.\n\n\u201cReally? \u2026 So I\u2019m gonna go down to Washington again. I\u2019ve already been a senator, for the rest of my life I\u2019ll be a senator,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna go down to the dysfunction and the lack of respect and the inability to even talk to each other. Really?\u201d\n\nDespite the apparent reluctance, Brown has taken some steps. He\u2019s sold his home in Wrentham, Mass., and moved into his vacation house in Rye.\n\nHe has registered to vote in Rye, and Brown\u2019s famous pickup truck, parked in his driveway, even has a New Hampshire plate on on it.\n\nBut whether Brown actually runs or not is a mystery, even to the most seasoned of New Hampshire Republicans.\n\n\u201cI have no clue, and I\u2019ve been at this business a long time,\u201d said Concord attorney Tom Rath, a former state attorney general. Rath has advised a long list of Republicans, including Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential bid. Not even Rath can pinpoint Brown\u2019s intention.\n\n\u201cHe certainly has the opportunity to run,\u201d Rath said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see him having done anything yet that tells me a decision\u2019s been made. There\u2019s no organization in place. There\u2019s no ground game being put together, that I can see. But he\u2019s done a good job of putting his name out there and creating the option.\u201d\n\nAbout a mile down the road from Rath\u2019s Concord office \u2014 also waiting on Brown\u2019s decision \u2014 is the New Hampshire Democratic Party. In case they need it, the Democrats are sowing the seeds of an anti-Scott Brown campaign.\n\n\u201cYou know, the folks here in New Hampshire really don\u2019t know him, other than the TV commercials that played on Boston television those two campaigns he was in,\u201d said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Raymond Buckley.\n\nBuckley said state Democrats aren\u2019t particularly worried about a Brown candidacy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re any more concerned about Scott Brown than we are with anyone else,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cHe barely moved here a couple of weeks ago.\u201d\n\nIn other words, is Brown a carpetbagger and is he vulnerable on the carpetbagger issue in New Hampshire, where thousands of expats from Massachusetts now live?\n\nOn that question, we took the temperature of some New Hampshire residents in the Seacoast area, where Brown now lives. The response was mixed. Here\u2019s a sample:\n\n\u2013 \u201cI like the guy and I\u2019d like to see him run. I think it\u2019d be a nice option for New Hampshire voters to have. I do.\u201d \u2013 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to vote for someone who didn\u2019t think they could win in their, kind of, hometown, where they kind of started their political ground, and they move to a smaller state where he thought he had a better position with Republicans. So I think it\u2019s gonna hurt him.\u201d\n\nWell, it hasn\u2019t hurt Brown yet in the New Hampshire polls. The latest shows Brown \u2014 who, remember, is not a candidate \u2014 running only about 10 points behind Shaheen.\n\nUndoubtedly, pundits say, it\u2019s part of the reason the liberal-leaning League of Conservation Voters is on the offensive. It has run $200,000 worth of TV ads in New Hampshire, pounding Brown\u2019s Senate voting record \u2014 ads that picture a dirty oil barrel floating in water.\n\n\u201cBrown took thousands from Big Oil just weeks before voting to keep giving them billions in special government handouts,\u201d an ad says. \u201cNow Brown\u2019s shopping for a Senate seat in New Hampshire. Good for Big Oil, not so good for us.\u201d\n\nBut polls in New Hampshire also show Shaheen vulnerable. Her approval rating is sinking, down below 50 percent, largely because of her initial support of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s made Shaheen the target of a half-million-dollar TV ad buy from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity.\n\n\u201cTell Senator Shaheen, it\u2019s time to be honest,\u201d an ad says. \u201cObamacare doesn\u2019t work. New Hampshire families deserve better.\u201d\n\nThat ad was designed not only to hurt Shaheen but also to motivate Brown, says analyst James Pindell, political director at WMUR-TV in Manchester.\n\n\u201cObamacare is very unpopular in New Hampshire,\u201d Pindell said. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about that is that that ad wasn\u2019t so much about the Affordable Care Act, and it wasn\u2019t so much about Jeanne Shaheen, it\u2019s so much about Scott Brown and trying to encourage him to get into this race.\u201d\n\nThe interest in Brown comes as Republicans taste the possibility of winning control of the U.S. Senate if they win just a handful of Senate races this fall.\n\n\u201cPolling is very clear on this question,\u201d Pindell said. \u201cIf Scott Brown is in this race, New Hampshire will have a competitive race for Senate. TWEET If he is not, it will not. That\u2019s why so many Republicans are excited about the idea of him possibly joining the race and they\u2019re willing to put up with this long flirtation just to hope he does it.\u201d\n\nSo, how long can Brown flirt with New Hampshire voters? Pindell points out the filing deadline for the U.S. Senate race isn\u2019t until June, so he thinks Brown will decide in May.\n\nBut even Rath, the GOP activist, cautions Brown that the waiting game has a shelf life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna work until one of two things,\u201d Rath said. \u201cEither a) he files, or b) somebody else who\u2019s taking a look at the race says, \u2018I don\u2019t care what he\u2019s gonna do. I\u2019m gonna get in\u2019 and forces his hand. That will change things. And I believe one of those two things will happen.\u201d\n\nAs for Brown, he had his political fans buzzing this past weekend when he wrote on Facebook: \u201cBig night tonight. I will keep you all posted.\u201d Several people commented, hoping it was the announcement.\n\nNope. Turns out he played guitar on stage with the rock band Cheap Trick \u2014 but not in New Hampshire. Rather, he rocked the night away in Lynn.\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I'm not sure what I'm gonna do,\" the former Massachusetts U.S. senator said recently about a potential bid for office in New Hampshire.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "\"I'm not sure what I'm gonna do,\" the former Massachusetts U.S. senator said recently about a potential bid for office in New Hampshire.", "title": "Will He Or Won\u2019t He?
