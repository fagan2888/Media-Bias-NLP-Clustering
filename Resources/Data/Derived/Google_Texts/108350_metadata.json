Chris Christie to declare a state of emergency, officials said.\n\nGloucester, Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland counties are expected to get the worst of the storm, but Central New Jersey residents can expect up to 6 inches of snow, and Essex and Union counties will receive as much as 3 inches, said Larry Nierenberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one storm, but there are several waves or several pieces,\u201d he said.\n\nAround 9 o'clock tonight, Christie declared a state of emergency and ordered all state buildings closed to non-essential employees today.\n\n\u201cThis winter storm is expected to arrive tonight and last through Monday, bringing heavy snow and creating hazardous travel conditions throughout the state,\u201d the governor said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve authorized state officials to take all necessary actions, and my administration will monitor conditions throughout the remainder of the storm.\u201d\n\nTemperatures will plunge into the 20s early Monday and dip into the single digits Monday night, Nierenberg said, meaning standing water on roadways could quickly turn to ice and make for a dangerous rush-hour commute.\n\nThat could be especially dangerous in South Jersey, where the first portion of the storm dumped persistent rain yesterday, Nierenberg said.\n\n\u201cThe worst part of the storm is going to be from early morning (Monday) to maybe late morning/early afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start off as more of a wet snow, then transition to a fluffy snow. Certainly, the morning commute can be quite treacherous.\u201d\n\nThe storm was already wreaking havoc on flights this afternoon, with nearly 1,600 flights in the United States canceled and another 1,515 delayed. According to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com, 85 flights were canceled and 97 were delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport. Another 82 were already canceled for Monday.\n\nThe frigid temperatures could also cause problems during Tuesday\u2019s commute if black ice forms, Nierenberg said.\n\n\u201cIf there happens to be any standing water, or water that gets there from salt on the road, that\u2019s going to potentially freeze (Tuesday) night,\u201d he said.\n\nTemperatures will climb back into the 30s Wednesday, but another storm front could produce snow late Thursday night if the mercury drops again, said Nierenberg, who added it\u2019s still too early for New Jerseyans to put away their shovels.\n\n\u201cThe window is closing for snow as we get through March, but certainly the way this winter has been, I\u2019m not going to say there isn\u2019t any more snow coming,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','nj-snow','nj-weather'", "title": "Chris Christie declares state of emergency, storm aims for South Jersey", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Chris Christie declares state of emergency, storm aims for South Jersey\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/gov_christie_declares_state_of_emergency_storm_expected_to_slam_south_jersey.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/nj-snowstorm-sundayjpg-916601a30712960e.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12336202\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-03T02:56:25Z\", \"author\": \"James Queally/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"nj-snow\",\"nj-weather\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/14396925-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@JamesQueallySL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The storm is expected to create hazardous road conditions through Tuesday and dump nearly 10 inches of snow on the southern part of the state."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, March 03, 2014,  1:57 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/nj-snowstorm-sundayjpg-916601a30712960e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jqueally\", \"author_nickname\": \"James Queally/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5781\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The storm is expected to create hazardous road conditions through Tuesday and dump nearly 10 inches of snow on the southern part of the state.", "title": "Chris Christie declares state of emergency, storm aims for South Jersey", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/gov_christie_declares_state_of_emergency_storm_expected_to_slam_south_jersey.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, March 02, 2014,  9:54 PM", "article_author": "James Queally/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "The storm is expected to create hazardous road conditions through Tuesday and dump nearly 10 inches of snow on the southern part of the state."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2575\"", "article_summary": "Around 9 o'clock tonight, Christie declared a state of emergency and ordered all state buildings closed to non-essential employees today.\nThat could be especially dangerous in South Jersey, where the first portion of the storm dumped persistent rain yesterday, Nierenberg said.\nChris Christie to declare a state of emergency, officials said.\n\u201cThe worst part of the storm is going to be from early morning (Monday) to maybe late morning/early afternoon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to start off as more of a wet snow, then transition to a fluffy snow."}
