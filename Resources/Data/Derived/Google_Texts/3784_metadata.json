A disease that attacks your central vision, macular degeneration can lead to difficulties in completing daily tasks like reading, driving, and walking across the street, and can ultimately make you virtually blind.\n\nDespite the fact that the disorder mainly affects older individuals, one 29-year-old suffers from a type of macular degeneration called conrad dystrophy. He\u2019s struggled with partial blindness his entire life. Mark Muszynski describes his condition in a video, saying that his disorder is defined by a genetic mutation in his ABCA4 gene, which causes a loss of photoreceptor cells.\n\n\u201cWhat I see is\u2026 The central vision is sort of a blurred mish mosh of colors that is indistinguishable,\u201d Muszynski says in the video. \u201cThen around that, the rest of it\u2019s pretty bad too.\u201d Both of his eyes are of a different depth of vision as well, meaning on top of blurred vision, neither eye can properly focus on anything: \u201cIf you can imagine having one eye in a magnifying glass and one eye not in a magnifying glass, and trying to walk around like that. They\u2019re constantly fighting for focus.\u201d\n\nOn top of sharp sensitivity to light \u2014 which causes pain and extreme brightness whenever he goes outside \u2014 Muszynski also struggles with daily tasks. \u201cNot being able to see well\u2026 It affects so many other parts of your life that you don\u2019t even think about,\u201d he says. He describes the difficulty of small things like being able to see the light change for the cross walk, differentiating between shampoo and conditioner bottles at hotels, and telling what\u2019s happening in people\u2019s facial expressions when he\u2019s talking to them. But you\u2019ll find that Muszynski is able to see his condition in a positive light, noting that the people around him are what matter.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blind, mark muszynski, macular degeneration", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A young man describes his daily life with a form of macular degeneration, which leaves him with blurred vision and daily struggles.", "title": "This Is What It\u2019s Like To Go Blind [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/young-man-macular-degeneration-describes-what-its-go-blind-304078", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/19/blind.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A young man describes his daily life with a form of macular degeneration, which leaves him with blurred vision and daily struggles.", "title": "This Is What It\u2019s Like To Go Blind [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/young-man-macular-degeneration-describes-what-its-go-blind-304078", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/19/blind.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/19/blind.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-19T17:49:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T18:10:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A young man describes his daily life with a form of macular degeneration, which leaves him with blurred vision and daily struggles."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10f5\"", "article_summary": "Macular degeneration \u2014 often called age-related macular degeneration \u2014 is typically found in Americans aged 60 or older.\nDespite the fact that the disorder mainly affects older individuals, one 29-year-old suffers from a type of macular degeneration called conrad dystrophy.\nMacular degeneration causes blurred vision in the center of your eyesight, making it difficult to accomplish daily tasks like walking, reading, or even seeing people's facial expressions.\nA disease that attacks your central vision, macular degeneration can lead to difficulties in completing daily tasks like reading, driving, and walking across the street, and can ultimately make you virtually blind.\nThey\u2019re constantly fighting for focus.\u201dOn top of sharp sensitivity to light \u2014 which causes pain and extreme brightness whenever he goes outside \u2014 Muszynski also struggles with daily tasks."}
