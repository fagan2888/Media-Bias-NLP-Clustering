On “Hannity” Wednesday evening, Sean Hannity hosted a heated discussion about the #BlackLivesMatter movement with Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke — who was last seen on the program rechristening the group “Black Lies Matter” — and Fox News contributor Juan Williams.

The discussion focused on the Democratic candidate’s answers on Tuesday as to whether “all lives matter” or “black live matters.” All but Jim Webb answered that the #BlackLivesMatter movement is significant, given that it is founded on a specific set of complaints about the treatment of the black community by law enforcement.

But Sheriff Clarke could barely contain his disdain for what he called the “plantation politics” of “the Democrat Party that continues to enslave” the black community.

“They’re whoring for votes,” he added. “They know what they’re doing. The liberal ideology has been very destructive for the black community for the last fifty or sixty years. Poverty is now generational — it’s a lifestyle.”
