Maine\u2019s Republican Senator Susan Collins was the fifth-top recipient of cash from Dartmouth College, just $2,000. And U.S. Senator-elect Joni Ernst was the fifth-top funded candidate from Princeton University employees, $5,200.\n\nAt Harvard University, where employees donated more than any other Ivy League at more than $1 million, the university earned the designation of \u201cheavy hitter\u201d from OpenSecrets.org. The Democratic National Committee was the biggest beneficiary at five of the eight schools.\n\nHistoric explanations for political leanings of academics are complex. But not too long ago, academia was more ideologically balanced.\n\nIn a 1998-99 survey by the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute, just 47.5 percent of university professors identified themselves as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cfar left.\u201d By the 2007-08 academic year that had increased to 55.8 percent. And in the most recent 2010-2011 study, 62.7 percent of American professors identified themselves that way. At the same time, the number of professors identifying themselves as \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d declined in both more recent surveys.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend Inside Higher Ed called an \u201cevolution away from the center.\u201d\n\nDaniel Klein is an economics professor at George Mason University in Virginia, and he has published his research on the subject in a paper, \u201cGroupthink in Academia: Majoritarian Departmental Politics and the Professional Pyramid.\u201d\n\nThe trend toward the left shouldn\u2019t be surprising, Klein said. Ivy League colleges set the trend for America\u2019s other schools.\n\nLike virtually any other group that gets to select its members, college departments tend to choose people who are like them. Once a majority of decision makers see the world a particular way, they\u2019re naturally likely to weed out people who aren\u2019t like them in favor of those who are.\n\n\u201cOnce you sort of get a department above 50 percent (in ideology), they\u2019ll tend to keep people out who oppose them,\u201d Klein said. \u201cSo, it\u2019ll tend to go from 50 to 60 to 70 to 80 percent, is what I\u2019m suggesting.\u201d\n\nChoosing like-minded people may be a natural human behavior, Klein said, but it isn\u2019t necessarily the best thing for the world of ideas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important belief to people, their politics,\u201d Klein said. \u201cSo it goes very much to who they are and their identity, and that\u2019s why they really do want to protect and insulate themselves, which I think is what we\u2019ve been doing more and more in the university.\u201d\n\nThe lack of diversity in thought means ideas can\u2019t be challenged, strengthened, or honed, as students may not be exposed to other ideas.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a tragedy that way,\u201d Klein said.\n\nBut politics don\u2019t just influence academics \u2014 academics influence politics and policy, Klein said. Without conflicting viewpoints within an administration or counsel, things don\u2019t come to light.\n\nLook at Jonathan Gruber, Klein said, the now-infamous MIT economist who helped craft the framework for the Affordable Care Act. In multiple videos, Gruber explained to audiences how the lack of transparency in the law and the \u201cstupidity\u201d of the American voter were key to passing the president\u2019s signature health-care law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not irrelevant,\u201d Klein said of academia and its influence. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the ivory tower. It\u2019s totally a problem.\u201d\n\nHere are the top donations and donors from the eight Ivy League schools \u2014 Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University, as of Tuesday.\n\nBrown, Providence, R.I.\n\nBrown University employees were modest with their donations, giving just under $50,000 in the 2014 cycle. Democratic National Committee ($20,300), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($17,300), Democratic Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline ($3,300) and Democratic Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin ($1,250) received the most.\n\nThe biggest donor was Christina Paxon, the university\u2019s president, who gave $15,000 to the DCCC, $1,000 to Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed.\n\nColumbia, New York City\n\nColumbia employees donated roughly $400,000 in the 2014 cycle, with the most dough going to the DNC ($68,621), Cory Booker ($33,200), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($28,575), the obscure X-Fund super PAC ($20,500), and the Connecticut Democratic State Central Committee.\n\nThe single-largest donation, $20,500 came from Donald Green, a political science professor. He donated the cash to the X-Fund.\n\nCornell, Ithaca, N,Y.\n\nCornell employees donated roughly $291,000 in the 2014 cycle, with New York Democratic congressional candidate Martha Robertson benefiting the most ($145,232), followed by the DNC ($29,764), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($17,646) and Illinois Democratic Congressman Bill Foster ($14,700).\n\nDartmouth, Hanover, N.H.\n\nDartmouth employees contributed roughly $90,000 in the 2014 election cycle.\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s Democratic Congresswoman Ann Mclane Kuster benefited the most ($25,500), followed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee ($20,000), New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen ($6,350), and the DNC ($4,900).\n\nHarvard, Cambridge, Mass.\n\nHarvard employees donated so much that they earned Harvard the designation \u201cheavy hitter\u201d on Open Secrets. Harvard employees contributed more than $1 million in the 2014 election cycle.\n\nThe largest recipient was the DNC ($133,313), followed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($105,083), Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey ($93,500), Women Vote! ($60,000), and the Republican Party of Massachusetts ($36,500).\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania employees donated about $233,000 in the 2014 election cycle. The Pennsylvania recipients who benefited most from the cash were Democratic congressional candidate Val Arkoosh ($60,709), Democratic congressional candidate Manan Trivedi ($18,250), Democratic congressional candidate Daylin Leach ($11,870), and Democratic congressional candidate Shaughnessy Naughton ($11,050).\n\nPrinceton, Princeton, N.J.\n\nPrinceton employees spent roughly $213,000 in the 2014 election cycle, the largest beneficiaries being Rush Holt ($38,350), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($37,350), the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ($35,250), and the DNC ($14,950). Princeton employees have been Holt\u2019s single-largest backer since 1995.\n\nYale, New Haven, Conn.\n\nYale employees spent more than $210,000 in the 2014 election cycle. The DNC topped the recipient list with $54,575 in donations, followed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ($36,550), Connecticut Democratic Congresswoman Elizabeth Etsy ($20,076), and the Kentucky State Democratic Central Executive Committee ($15,500).\n\nKathryn Watson is an investigative reporter for Watchdog.org\u2019s Virginia Bureau, and can be found on Twitter @kathrynw5.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Donations in the 2014 campaign cycle offer insight into views of Ivy League faculty.", "title": "Ivy League professors, staff donate more than $2 million in 2014 \u2014 mostly to Dems - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/Campus.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-12-05T07:01:41+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/185892/ivy-league-donate-political/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Connecticut", "tag": "2014,Conservative,Democrat,donations,Harvard,independent,ivy league,left,Liberal,money,Political Science,Politics,professors,Republican,Right", "published_time": "2014-12-05T04:00:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-05T07:01:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Donations in the 2014 campaign cycle offer insight into views of Ivy League faculty.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/Campus.jpeg"}, "title": "Ivy League professors, staff donate more than $2 million in 2014 \u2014 mostly to Dems - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Donations in the 2014 campaign cycle offer insight into views of Ivy League faculty."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf898\"", "article_summary": "The Pennsylvania recipients who benefited most from the cash were Democratic congressional candidate Val Arkoosh ($60,709), Democratic congressional candidate Manan Trivedi ($18,250), Democratic congressional candidate Daylin Leach ($11,870), and Democratic congressional candidate Shaughnessy Naughton ($11,050).\nIt\u2019s totally a problem.\u201dHere are the top donations and donors from the eight Ivy League schools \u2014 Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University, as of Tuesday.\nAt Harvard University, where employees donated more than any other Ivy League at more than $1 million, the university earned the designation of \u201cheavy hitter\u201d from OpenSecrets.org.\nDemocratic National Committee ($20,300), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($17,300), Democratic Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline ($3,300) and Democratic Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin ($1,250) received the most.\nThe largest recipient was the DNC ($133,313), followed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($105,083), Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey ($93,500), Women Vote!"}
