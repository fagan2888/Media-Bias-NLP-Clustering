They affect the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), the Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\n\nEEOC: No bias testers. The bill gave the EEOC almost every dollar of funding it requested, but it also specifically prohibited using any federal funds for so-called \u201ctesters.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the EEOC would send members of a particular protected class to apply for jobs, armed with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s precisely reflecting advertised qualifications. If the tester was rejected, the EEOC would use that as the basis for proceeding with a discrimination investigation. Under the new budget bill, that can\u2019t happen.\n\nDOL enforcement unfunded. The bill increased the DOL\u2019s budget to $12.2 billion. It did not, however, provide funding for 300 more enforcement employees or 15 new employees dedicated to implementing recent executive orders on equal pay and safe workplaces.\n\nNo new curbs on NLRB. The NLRB received the same level of FY2016 funding as it did last year. The bill, however, did not include a provision some employers had sought that would have restricted the NLRB\u2019s efforts to push joint employer liability and quickie \u201cambush\u201d union elections.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "4994136bc793ed9927db8cecc3707c22"}, "twitter": {"description": "What do the EEOC, DOL and NLRB have in store with the $1.1 trillion budget bill passed just before the end of 2015?", "title": "Federal budget has treats, tricks for employers", "site": "@bizdaily", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bizdaily"}, "description": "The $1.1 trillion bipartisan budget bill that President Obama signed just before the end of 2015 prevented yet another budget-crisis induced federal government shutdown, funding Uncle Sam\u2019s operations through the end of fiscal year 2016 in September.
