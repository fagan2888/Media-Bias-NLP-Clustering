People are still enrolling because there is no deadline, so even as county workers process applications, new ones come in.\n\nThe state's aging computer system was overwhelmed by demand, according to Norman Williams, spokesman for the state Department of Health Care Services, noting 1.9 million people have enrolled in Medi-Cal.\n\n\"We are devoting a lot of resources to resolving the pending application pool,\" he said.\n\nVerifying residency\n\nBy law, counties are supposed to complete Medi-Cal applications within 45 days of receipt.\n\nWilliams said the residency of Medi-Cal applicants must be verified, and in some cases an address has not been provided, creating a delay.\n\nOne upgrade is a process to verify residency electronically, although Williams said that is not the entire answer.\n\nAccording to California Health Report, the same contractor was hired to create two interfaces for the state computer enrollment system, one for Covered California, which launched Oct. 1, and one for Medi-Cal, which wasn't ready until Jan. 21 and as of May 4 was rendering wrong answers due to programming errors or taking up to 40 hours to produce answers.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the problem was getting the state computer enrollment system to communicate with county computers, with stability hampering progress.\n\nA mid-April report to the Covered California board said \"defect resolution\" in the Medi-Cal system is ongoing.\n\nSanta Cruz resident Steve Fuehrer got enrolled in Medi-Cal in February. He started at the Covered California website and was referred to Medi-Cal. He ended up visiting the Human Services Department, at 1400 Emeline Ave., where a county employee provided personal service, which Fuehrer said was \"fantastic.\"\n\nAnxious applicants\n\nOne example of the anxiety cited by Scheiner was evident at Dominican Hospital on Wednesday when a woman in the lobby was hoping social service staff would see a doctor about a worrisome lump.\n\nShe said she used to have an $80,000-a-year job and now works part time, making her eligible for Medi-Cal. She did not want to go to the county's Emeline clinic because she thought an X-ray was needed.\n\n\"That's a situation we want to address as quickly as possible,\" said Williams, suggesting the woman obtain a temporary card from the county Human Services Department or look for a doctor who is a Medi-Cal provider who would see her pending eligibility.\n\nIn Santa Cruz County, the Central California Alliance for Health, which serves Medi-Cal enrollees, lists on its website a handful of primary care providers in Santa Cruz seeing new patients.\n\n\"It's not an easy situation, we're not suggesting that at all,\" Williams said.\n\nA Santa Cruz woman who did not want her name used said her son, 28, \"has health concerns that are waiting to be addressed,\" and has been waiting months for his Medi-Cal card to arrive.\n\nShe said her son told her he was directed to apply at the homeless shelter and that the enrollment counselor who assisted him neglected to process a number of applications and was fired. He told his mother he re-applied, but that was more than a month ago, and he has heard nothing.\n\nShe said she would advise her son to visit the county Human Services Department for a temporary card.\n\nPamela Fugitt-Hetrick of DCD Financial & Insurance Services in Santa Cruz said two people walked in Wednesday morning \"out of desperation\" for Medi-Cal enrollment.\n\n\"I felt obligated to enroll those who qualified for Medi-Cal that came my way,\" she said, noting she is not compensated for that.\n\nWhat to do\n\nTIPS FROM STATE: Visit county human services office, 1020 Emeline Ave., Santa Cruz, or 18 W Beach St., Watsonville, to get a temporary Medi-Cal card.\n\nLook for a provider who will see you pending eligibility. See providers accepting new patients at www.ccah-alliance.org/\n\nTIPS FROM COUNTY: If emergency, call 888-421-8080 for help getting Medi-Cal benefits. If approved, Medi-Cal coverage will be retroactive to the date the application was submitted. For questions about start date of coverage, eligibility determination or \"notices of action,\" call 888-421-8080.\n\nSource: County Human Services Department, California Department of Health Services", "article_metadata": {"description": "SANTA CRUZ >> About 7,000 Santa Cruz County residents who applied for Medi-Cal, the state's health care program for the poor, are waiting to be enrolled, caught in a backlog that is affecting about 900,000 Californians.", "title": "7,000 Santa Cruz County residents caught in Medi-Cal backlog", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20140518/NEWS/140518007", "image": {"width": "470px", "identifier": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016", "height": "247px"}, "type": "article", "title": "7,000 Santa Cruz County residents caught in Medi-Cal backlog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "SANTA CRUZ >> About 7,000 Santa Cruz County residents who applied for Medi-Cal, the state's health care program for the poor, are waiting to be enrolled, caught in a backlog that is affecting about 900,000 Californians.", "title": "7,000 Santa Cruz County residents caught in Medi-Cal backlog", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20140518/NEWS/140518007", "image": {"src": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "News, Santa Cruz news, CA news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Santa Cruz news, CA news, US news, world news."}, "article_summary": "SANTA CRUZ >> About 7,000 Santa Cruz County residents who applied for Medi-Cal, the state's health care program for the poor, are waiting to be enrolled, caught in a backlog that is affecting about 900,000 Californians.\nSource: County Human Services Department, California Department of Health Services\nIn Santa Cruz County, the Central California Alliance for Health, which serves Medi-Cal enrollees, lists on its website a handful of primary care providers in Santa Cruz seeing new patients.\nShe said she would advise her son to visit the county Human Services Department for a temporary card.\nScheiner said county human services staff are \"handling an incredible volume of applications,\" not only working through the backlog but also taking new applications and helping existing clients."}
