With one bad police-citizen interaction, it is not a giant step to large-scale social unrest. News of police working with gang members on a \u201ccease-fire\u201d shows that Denver\u2019s leadership are paying attention.\n\nSome argue that riots represent a long-suffering community\u2019s legitimate reaction to police officers who treat them as guilty until proven innocent. The death of Freddie Gray while in Baltimore police custody plays squarely into that narrative.\n\nBut regardless of what may be legitimate complaints about any given police department and despite President Obama\u2019s calling for police \u201csoul searching,\u201d the injuries to people and destruction of property that we\u2019ve seen in Baltimore \u2014 a city with roughly the same population as Denver \u2014 are intolerable.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, claims to have been misunderstood when she said that her policy \u201cgave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.\u201d I\u2019m skeptical, having seen lines of police retreating in the face of rock-hurling protesters and watching as looters went from store to store, destroying their neighbors\u2019 livelihoods.\n\n\u201cCharm City\u201d law enforcement agencies were aware of social media conversations among high school students planning civil unrest once the afternoon school bell rang. City leadership knew \u2014 not just should have known \u2014 what was coming. Yet Baltimore\u2019s police commissioner said the rioters had \u201coutnumbered us and outflanked us.\u201d Reports also suggest an explicit \u201cstand down\u201d order from the mayor. Unacceptable.\n\nPublic display of weakness invites misbehavior. It\u2019s true in foreign affairs, in parenting, and in the policing of our cities. People, especially young people, need limits. When parents, pastors and peer pressure don\u2019t provide those limits, all that\u2019s left is the police.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s was so dangerous for Baltimore to have emphasized \u201cbalance\u201d and \u201cgiving space\u201d; it was, as the Beastie Boys might have put it, a \u201clicense to ill.\u201d\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and Denver Police Chief Robert White should heed the lessons of Baltimore.\n\nIn February, vandals participating in an anti-police protest in Denver poured red paint on a memorial to fallen police officers. Denver police union president Nick Rogers told CBS Channel 4 News that \u201cofficers monitoring the protest were told by their superiors to not to interfere and to let the vandalism happen.\u201d\n\nThis excessive desire to show the softer side of law enforcement invites criminality and chaos. It\u2019s universal: Would-be bad actors will always take a mile when given an inch.\n\nBeyond inspiring misbehavior, impeding law enforcement\u2019s fundamental mission with roadblocks of political correctness leaves officers wondering whether city or police leadership adequately value their safety.\n\nPoliticians who expect cops to risk life and limb must not rationalize for thugs assaulting the Thin Blue Line with bricks and bottles and cannot \u201cgive them space\u201d for bedlam and destruction.\n\nThere must be a balance between avoiding a police state and maintaining order. I don\u2019t envy those who must find and maintain that balance. But Baltimore shows the perils of passive policing and the enormous costs that such a strategy can suddenly impose on innocent citizens, business owners, and other residents of ineffectively policed cities.\n\nLeaders around Colorado, particularly those in cities with active gangs, should hope for the best but plan for the worst, working with community leaders and publicly setting expectations for, as a wise man once said, \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t expect that Denver will be the next Baltimore. But then, Baltimore didn\u2019t expect they would be, either.\n\nRoss Kaminsky is host of \u201cThe Ross Kaminsky Show\u201d on Saturday mornings on 850 KOA and writes a monthly column for The Denver Post.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kaminsky: Don\u2019t let Denver become Baltimore", "title": "Kaminsky: Don\u2019t let Denver become Baltimore", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/30/kaminsky-dont-let-denver-become-baltimore/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150430__20150503_Z00_OP03C_KAMINSKYp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150430__20150503_Z00_OP03C_KAMINSKYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-30T16:28:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:51:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "John Hickenlooper, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and Denver Police Chief Robert White should heed the lessons of Baltimore.\n\u201cCharm City\u201d law enforcement agencies were aware of social media conversations among high school students planning civil unrest once the afternoon school bell rang.\nCity leadership knew \u2014 not just should have known \u2014 what was coming.\nRoss Kaminsky is host of \u201cThe Ross Kaminsky Show\u201d on Saturday mornings on 850 KOA and writes a monthly column for The Denver Post.\nIn February, vandals participating in an anti-police protest in Denver poured red paint on a memorial to fallen police officers."}
