The Justice Department is investigating the deals.\n\nIn their attempt to convince senators of the mergers\u2019 virtues, the CEOs of Aetna and Anthem each said healthcare should be viewed within a local context and that the mergers would lead to robust competition without raising prices for consumers.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the combination of Anthem and Cigna will allow us to provide better health insurance to more people,\u201d said Joseph Swedish, CEO of Anthem.\n\n\u201cThere would be no material change in the competitiveness of the commercial insurance market,\u201d said Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna.\n\nHowever, some senators, including Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), expressed skepticism about the concentration of power in fewer hands. The mergers, Blumenthal said, appear to be more the \u201ctriumph of hope over experience.\u201d\n\nHe recalled Aetna\u2019s billion-dollar acquisition of Prudential Health Care in 1999. Leemore Dafny, a professor at Northwestern\u2019s business school, testified that the deal cut both jobs and wages in the locations where the two companies overlapped, as well as reduced payments to healthcare providers.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that mergers have led to improved quality or more innovation,\u201d said Dafny, who noted that public data on such mergers is limited.\n\nSenators from both parties raised concerns about how the deals would affect healthcare costs. According to a new survey, American workers saw their out-of-pocket medical costs jump again this year, as the average deductible for an employer-provided health plan grew nearly 9% to more than $1,000.\n\nThe American Hospital Assn., a powerful hospital lobby, has also challenged the consolidation plans. Richard Pollack, the group's president and CEO, testified that he was concerned about the possibility of rising prices and limited choices under an Aetna/Humana merger, especially for the millions of seniors who buy Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter >>\n\nFurthermore, with Anthem\u2019s affiliation with the extensive Blue Cross and Blue Shield system, a merger with Cigna, he said, could all but eliminate competition and entrench the system\u2019s domination in nearly every state.\n\nIf the deals are approved, Pollack said, the top three insurers would cover 131 million people, or 40% of Americans with health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned that both deals could result in fewer choices for consumers, narrower networks and providers in what few choices remain and higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs,\u201d said Pollack.\n\nUnited Health Group Inc., which would round out the top three largest insurers if the mergers proceed, did not participate in the hearing.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chairman of the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said Tuesday\u2019s hearing was not about President Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 healthcare law.\n\nSince then, there has been a trend in hospital mergers. More than 70 deals have been announced this year alone, and 2015 is on track to surpass the 100 hospital transactions announced in 2014, according to research company Irving Levin Associates. Proponents of hospital consolidation say conslidation leads to cost savings and others believe the mergers are a response to healthcare reforms.\n\nSome upsides to insurance mergers include reduced administrative costs, alternative payment models and investments in data and analytics to support providers, said Paul Ginsburg, a public policy professor at USC.\n\nTwitter: @marcusehoward\n\nALSO:\n\nConsumers can check medical prices, quality scores on new state website\n\nHillary Clinton previews plan to expand Obamacare and lower health costs\n\nThe cost of defunding Planned Parenthood: Reduced healthcare for 650,000 women", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Health insurance CEOs vow mergers won't make marketplace less competitive", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Proposed mega-mergers between health insurance giants prompted by the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t harm the level of competition in the market, two chief executives pledged Tuesday to skeptical lawmakers.", "title": "Health insurance CEOs vow mergers won't make marketplace less competitive", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-health-mergers-20150922-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5601d508/turbine/la-fi-health-mergers-20150922", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "health insurance, mergers, affordable care act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84493266", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-22", "Description": "Proposed mega-mergers between health insurance giants prompted by the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t harm the level of competition in the market, two chief executives pledged Tuesday to skeptical lawmakers.
