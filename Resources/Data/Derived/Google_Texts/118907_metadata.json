Mary Landrieu, D-La. But it fell one vote short of the 60 needed to pass.\n\nWith nine fewer Democrats in the new Senate that convenes in January, including the replacement of Landrieu with Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, the Keystone bill is expected to pass both houses easily, but probably not by a margin that could override a presidential veto.\n\nObama took over the reading of Colbert's regular \"The Word,\" monologue, giving him a chance to poke fun at himself.\n\n\"Nation,\" Obama said, channeling Colbert. \"As you know, I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our president. The guy is so arrogant. I bet he talks about himself in the third person.\"\n\nHe then continued to, again playing Colbert, talk about how Republicans could kill his Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"They could pass a bill repealing Obamacare,\" the president said, via Colbert's monologue. \"But the president still has the veto, and if, I know that guy, he is willing to use it. \"And let's face it, even if Republicans somehow did repeal it, they would have to replace with their own health care plan. Once they touch it, they own it, and then if anything goes wrong, suddenly everybody will be complaining about Mitch McConnell-care.\"\n\nWhen Obama read that there are parts of Obamacare that people from both parties actually like -- such as allowing children up to age 26 to remain on their parents health insurance coverage -- the text shown to the audience and viewers read, \"Everything but Obama.\"\n\nYou can watch the segment here.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack obama, bill cassidy, br-business, br-homepage, br-news, business, congress, energy, entertainment, health care reform, homepage, mary landrieu, news, politics", "title": "President Obama plays Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central and downplays Keystone Pipeline benefits", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"President Obama plays Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central and downplays Keystone Pipeline benefits\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/12/post_575.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/barack-obama-953ea7e14d5730ff.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14709554\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-09T14:26:47Z\", \"author\": \"Bruce Alpert, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"@aggregation\",\"barack obama\",\"bill cassidy\",\"br-business\",\"br-homepage\",\"br-news\",\"business\",\"congress\",\"energy\",\"entertainment\",\"health care reform\",\"homepage\",\"mary landrieu\",\"news\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/barack-obama-953ea7e14d5730ff.jpg", "creator": "@AlpertDC", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama&nbsp;downplayed the benefits of the Keystone XL Pipeline during an appearance Monday night on the Colbert Report in which he traded places with his host to read a monologue poking fun at his presidency.
