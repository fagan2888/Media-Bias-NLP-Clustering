He also said delays will affect the security of the Middle East.\n\n\u201cNo one should doubt that compromise and agreement on this issue is in the best interest of everyone especially that of the nations of the region,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nThe P5+1 nuclear talks include the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom) plus Germany.\n\nThe talks began in 2006, with the Security Council passing numerous resolutions since then imposing sanctions on Iran for its defiance of nuclear regulation. Iran denies that it is using the technology not to create a nuclear weapon, but for energy purposes only.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to continue our peaceful nuclear program, including enrichment, and to enjoy our full nuclear rights on Iranian soil within the framework of international law,\u201d said Rouhani. \u201cA final accord regarding Iran's peaceful nuclear program can serve as the beginning of multilateral collaboration aimed at promoting security, peace and development in our region and beyond.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhotos: U.N.

General Assembly, with under secretary for political affairs Wendy Sherman attending meetings Thursday. Last year, there was speculation that Obama and Rouhani would shake hands on the sidelines of the General Assembly, but the two leaders did not end up greeting one another. The U.S. administration has not announced any bilateral meetings at this year\u2019s gathering and Obama declined to answer when asked Thursday if he would meet with Rouhani. The Iranian did meet Wednesday with British Prime MInister David Cameron.\n\nThe Iranian president said that his country has so far complied with all requirement of the negotiations, and that the West must avoid \u201cexcessive demands\u201d during the process. Sanctions, said Rouhani, are only an impediment to reaching an accord.\n\nThe Iranian president also blamed the West for causing instability in the world, including the rise of Islamic extremism, while calling his nation one of the \u201cmost tranquil, secure and stable nations\u201d in the world.\n\n\u201cThe strategic blunders of the West in the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucuses have turned these parts of the world into a haven for terrorists and extremists,\u201d said Rouhani.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "United Nations", "title": "Iranian Leader Rouhani Says Nuclear Deal Possible", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani says an agreement can be reached with the major powers before the November deadline.", "title": "Iranian Leader Rouhani Says Nuclear Deal Possible", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/25/iranian-leader-rouhani-says-nuclear-deal-possible", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ad/2b/abc445944f14837ac6e778afe32e/140925-rouhani-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Hassan Rouhani says an agreement can be reached with the major powers before the November deadline.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Iranian Leader Rouhani Says Nuclear Deal Possible"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 25, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Teresa Welsh,Pulse,Iran,Rouhani, Hassan,nuclear weapons,United Nations", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani says an agreement can be reached with the major powers before the November deadline."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28a4\"", "article_summary": "Bryan Thomas/Getty Images x of x A woman dressed as Captain Planet joins a group of protesters on Monday.\nBryan Thomas/Getty Images x of x A protester joins thousands of people calling for action against global warming ahead of Tuesday's U.N.\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images x of x President Obama shakes hands with the U.N.
