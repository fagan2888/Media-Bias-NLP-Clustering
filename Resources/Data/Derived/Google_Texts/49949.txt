62-year-old man killed outside Joliet Township home

A 62-year-old man was beaten to death Thursday night outside his southwest suburban home in Joliet Township.

Deputies found Robert J. Bielec at 10:52 p.m. unresponsive in the driveway of his home in the 1700 block of Houston Avenue in unincorporated Joliet Township, according to the Will County coroner’s office and a statement from the Will County sheriff’s office.

He had suffered “considerable trauma” and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Someone who lives in the home told deputies they heard the victim talking to someone outside, then heard a loud noise, the sheriff’s office said. That person went outside and found the victim lying on the ground unresponsive.

Bielec died from blunt force head trauma in an apparent homicide, the coroner’s office said.
