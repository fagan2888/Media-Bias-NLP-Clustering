I Lost My Insurance,\u201d is a manual for House Republicans on how to highlight the recent issues with the health care law and how to best \u201ccommunicate in your district about the disastrous Obamacare rollout.\u201d\n\nOf particular interest to Republicans is the president\u2019s oft-repeated line that \"if you like you health insurance, you can keep it.\"\n\nIn the \u201cBroken Promises\u201d section, Republicans point to two promises the president used to sell the Affordable Care Act: \u201c1) If you like what you have, you can keep it. Period. And 2) Health care costs will go down for all Americans, and \u2018save a typical family an average of $2,500...\u2019 Each of these promises has now been broken,\u201d the playbook says.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans will lose the plan they have and like: Despite President Obama\u2019s promise that you can keep the plan you have and like, we now know at least 7 million Americans will lose their employer provided insurance as a result of Obamacare,\u201d the memo said in its Talking Points section.\n\nThat particular talking point links to a May 2013 Congressional Budget Office document on the effects of the health care law, which, in a footnote, estimates that 7 million people will \u201cnewly enroll\u201d in employment-based coverage under Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans also seem to use that footnote in the Fast Facts section, where the playbook claims the administration \u201cknows it needs seven million individuals to enroll in 2014 to be financially sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe memo says 6,200 people completed health care applications on the first day HealthCare.gov went online. In the first week, 51,000 people completed applications, it asserts. And the administration, the memo said, has spent $267 million on the \"underlying system\" and $500 million on the \"online effort.\" Republicans, however, do not provide sources for those claims.\n\nWhile Republicans clearly believe HealthCare.gov is a floundering mess, they see their own online efforts as a primary way to highlight the other flaws in the law.\n\nFor instance, the 17-page playbook encourages House Republicans to use the Republican Conference\u2019s #YourStory project to encourage their constituents to submit Obamacare feedback.\n\n\u201cObamacare is much more than a bad website; it\u2019s a bad law,\u201d the #YourStory section said. That\u2019s an increasingly common talking point among Republicans recently as they have tried to show HealthCare.gov is just a symptom of the overall problems with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cYou know, the problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t just the website, it\u2019s the whole law,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, said in his opening lines of an Oct. 29 news conference with GOP leaders.\n\nRepublicans seem to be shifting their focus from website woes to overall problems, and the playbook suggests that very move.\n\n\u201cPremiums are increasing,\u201d the memo said, and the administration \u201cnow acknowledges premiums will increase as a result of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nTo prove that talking point, the memo links to a March 2013 news story where Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters \u201cthere may be a higher cost associated with getting into [the health insurance] market.\u201d\n\nTime will be the ultimate test of that claim, though it does appear that some could be facing higher costs for insurance.\n\n\u201cMillions more uninsured,\u201d a talking point said. However, that statement does not make clear that the law itself will not cause people to be uninsured. Instead, the memo relies on data showing that fewer people are likely to take advantage of Obamacare than originally estimated.\n\nThe GOP packet also features a \u201cSample Op-Ed,\u201d heavily cribbed from an opinion piece from Republican Rep. Cory Gardner of Colorado on losing his private health insurance; about a dozen sample Tweets and Facebook posts from members that \u201ccommunicate our position\u201d; videos for Republicans to post on their various social media; digital flyers bashing the health care law; and an Obamacare Timeline, a calendar for when various aspects of the law are being implemented.\n\nThe playbook \u2014 which literally has a clip-art image of an Xs-and-Os football play in it (albeit with 10 Os and eight Xs) \u2014 is chock-full of Republican strategies for poking holes in the health care law and pointing out the number of measures Republicans have taken to dismantle it.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, suggested Republicans were distorting the truth and only focusing on the negative.\n\n\u201cAre House Republicans so blinded by their obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act that they\u2019ll ignore any and all stories of Americans who are already benefiting from the health care law?\u201d a Democratic leadership aide asked CQ Roll Call. \u201cThe American people expect their elected leaders to work together to implement and improve the health care law, but it appears House Republicans are only interested in sabotaging it. House Republicans need a new playbook.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also accused the GOP of attempting to \"mislead.\"\n\n\"Brought to you by the authors of death panels, a guide to mislead the American people and discourage their own constituents from getting access to affordable health care,\" said Drew Hammill. \"House Republicans need to stop the misinformation, abandon their obsession with repeal, and work with Democrats to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nSee the playbook here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans have handed out an internal GOP playbook on how to best score political points against Obamacare, the White House and Democrats in general.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "House Republicans have handed out an internal GOP playbook on how to best score political points against Obamacare, the White House and Democrats in general.", "title": "GOP Playbook Looks to Capitalize on Obamacare Woes", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/gop-playbook-looks-to-capitalize-on-obamacare-woes", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/2/2013/11/screenshotGOPplaybook-260x335.png", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2013-11-08T20:24:57Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "House Republicans have handed out an internal GOP playbook on how to best score political points against Obamacare, the White House and Democrats in general.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,author,category,CQToday Topic,health-care,john-boehner,messaging,heal", "article": {"section": "policy", "published_time": "2013-11-08T20:24:57Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-08T20:24:57Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans have handed out an internal GOP playbook on how to best score political points against Obamacare, the White House and Democrats in general.", "title": "GOP Playbook Looks to Capitalize on Obamacare Woes", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/gop-playbook-looks-to-capitalize-on-obamacare-woes", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/2/2013/11/screenshotGOPplaybook-260x335.png"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa93\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans have handed out an internal GOP playbook on how to best score political points against Obamacare, the White House and Democrats in general.\nHouse Republicans need a new playbook.\u201dA spokesman for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also accused the GOP of attempting to \"mislead.\"\nFor instance, the 17-page playbook encourages House Republicans to use the Republican Conference\u2019s #YourStory project to encourage their constituents to submit Obamacare feedback.\nThe memo obtained by CQ Roll Call, titled \u201cHouse Republican Playbook: Because of Obamacare ...\n\"House Republicans need to stop the misinformation, abandon their obsession with repeal, and work with Democrats to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.\""}
