The study, published in the journal Health Affairs, found that New Jersey ranks 15th among the states in the number of medical residents it has per 100,000 population.\n\nWith a federal cap of 29.31 medical residents per 100,000 people, New Jersey is slightly above the national average.\n\nBut the report points out problems with the national system of allocating Medicare funding to pay for residency slots. A 1997 federal law caps the number of residency positions at each hospital, leaving some hospitals in New Jersey with a limited number of young doctors training to meet the state\u2019s future heathcare needs.\n\nWhile the number of medical residents \u201cis pretty well-matched to the population of New Jersey, the question always is, what does that mean for your workforce,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Candice Chen, an assistant research professor at George Washington University\u2019s School of Public Health and Health Services.\n\nThe federal government pays for most funding for medical residencies. By capping each program at the same number as they had in 1997, there is limited flexibility to address changes in the healthcare landscape.\n\nChen noted that northeastern states like New Jersey train relatively few primary-care doctors, particularly at hospitals affiliated with medical schools. With a larger share of medical residents focusing on various other specialties, these states end up with healthcare systems geared more toward inpatient care. This in turn can raise the cost of healthcare.\n\nChen noted that a separate study she worked on earlier this year found that, from 2006 to 2008, many of New Jersey\u2019s largest residency programs had a small number of primary care residents. An online tool provides summaries of each of these graduate medical education (GME) programs.\n\n\u201cYou look at these big GME programs and you got to start to ask, \u2018Are they producing the doctors that you want them to produce?\u2019 \u201d Chen said, adding that they run the danger of subsidizing teaching hospitals rather than focusing on future healthcare needs. While she said the hospitals are responding to the incentives that the federal government has provided, \u201cthe problem is, we\u2019ve so closely linked our graduate medical education to a focus on hospitals that they\u2019re not ready to staff the primary care.\u201d\n\nChen noted that many of New Jersey\u2019s smaller hospitals are focused on primary-care education for their medical residents, but the 1997 law limits the number of residency positions that they have.\n\nShe pointed to the example of a small hospital focused on primary care.\n\n\u201cAs a state you might say, \u2018Gosh, we really need more doctors in that area; the most intelligent thing we could do is train more doctors at that program so they could stay in that area,\u2019 \u201d Chen said, but then added: \u201cMedicare wouldn\u2019t fund it.\u201d\n\nDeborah S. Briggs, president and CEO of the New Jersey Council of Teaching Hospitals, pointed out another challenge detailed in the new report. While New Jersey is above the national average in the number of medical residents, it\u2019s at a competitive disadvantage with its neighboring states of New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nNew York leads the country with a cap of 77.13 medical residents per 100,000 people, while Pennsylvania is fourth with 54.48.\n\n\u201cThat can be a disadvantage for us,\u201d Briggs said, noting that residents may choose to pursue their training elsewhere.\n\nBriggs said the rapid changes in the healthcare system, including the expected increase in the number of patients newly insured under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, make it difficult to foresee where medical residents will be needed in the future.\n\n\u201cI do believe that ultimately there is probably on some level a need for redistribution,\u201d of residents from programs in areas that are well served to areas with fewer new doctors, Briggs said.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors recommend that a new national body be given the power to make decisions about where federal funding for graduate medical education will be spent.\n\nHowever, Briggs said it\u2019s more important to develop such bodies at the state level, adding that a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach from a national body would be disastrous to states trying to address their unique needs. She noted that Georgia\u2019s state government has provided money for a state-level organization to fund new medical residency positions, which she sees as a potential model for New Jersey.\n\nBut Briggs said numerous visits to lobby members of Congress have taught her that there won\u2019t be any additional federal funding for medical residencies any time soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen -- they\u2019re not going to expand the number of residency slots,\u201d Briggs said, adding that this situation means New Jersey must find other ways to improve the system for training doctors.\n\n\u201cWe as medical stakeholders have to come up with other avenues to improve the system beyond saying, \u2018Poor us, we\u2019re not getting the resources we need,\u2019 \u201d Briggs said.\n\nBriggs has been working on other ways to improve graduate medical education.\n\nOne approach could be to blend the medical school experience with residency training. She noted that students who started medical school this fall and who have three-year residencies will complete their training in 2020.\n\nIf the stakeholders aren\u2019t focused on \u201cthe attributes of the physician of 2020, then we\u2019re doing ourselves a disservice,\u201d Briggs said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/13/1106/0028"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "National study points to outdated system for filling hospital spots while state expert calls for new approach", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "New Jersey may have more medical residents than the national average, but a national study points to problems that an outdated system causes for the state.\nWith a federal cap of 29.31 medical residents per 100,000 people, New Jersey is slightly above the national average.\nNew York leads the country with a cap of 77.13 medical residents per 100,000 people, while Pennsylvania is fourth with 54.48.\nWith a larger share of medical residents focusing on various other specialties, these states end up with healthcare systems geared more toward inpatient care.\nWhile New Jersey is above the national average in the number of medical residents, it\u2019s at a competitive disadvantage with its neighboring states of New York and Pennsylvania."}
