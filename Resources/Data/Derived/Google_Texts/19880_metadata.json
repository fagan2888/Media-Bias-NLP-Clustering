Whistleblowers are armed with inside corporate knowledge, internal documents, and a list of key potential witnesses to corroborate their claims. In some instances, professional whistleblowers with specialized knowledge about the alleged fraudulent financial practices or the company\u2019s industry may be added to a case to bolster the whistleblower\u2019s claims. Although defendants often claim that the statute stacks the deck against them, knowledge of the procedural and legal hurdles they will face can help companies better arm themselves to fight the uphill battle of qui tam litigation.\n\nMaking Your First Move: Determining Whether to Go on the Offensive\n\nOnce the complaint is unsealed, companies must determine whether and to what extent they will challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the qui tam action or make affirmative claims against the whistleblower. In general, the quickest way to dismiss an FCA case is to prove that the court lacks jurisdiction or is statutorily barred from hearing the case. While these types of challenges are common place in ordinary civil litigation, there are procedural and legal differences that complicate them in qui tam litigation. For example, the public disclosure bar that precludes an FCA claim based on information disclosed to the public in certain situations is one of the strongest affirmative defenses to an FCA action. However, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) made changes to the public disclosure bar that give the government the right to stop a court from dismissing a claim on this basis. Thus, a court may be prohibited from dismissing an FCA action based on the public disclosure bar \u2014 even if valid grounds for dismissal exist \u2014 where the government opposes the motion to dismiss.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Savaria Harris, Mitka Baker, Michael Dee", "description": "Companies engaged in whistleblower litigation can often feel as though they are facing an uphill battle, and nowhere is this more apparent than in False Claims Act qui tam litigation.", "og": {"url": "http://www.insidecounsel.com/2015/10/07/lessons-from-the-year-of-the-whistleblower-part-5", "image": "http://origin.media.sbmcloud.com/social-icons/social-share-ic-716x372.png", "type": "website", "description": "Companies engaged in whistleblower litigation can often feel as though they are facing an uphill battle, and nowhere is this more apparent than in False Claims Act qui tam litigation.", "title": "Lessons from the 'Year of the Whistleblower,' part 5: Whistleblower litigation: Considerations for defense counsel in a false claims case"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-07", "sailthru.tags": "insidecounsel, article, 560d8089160ba088478b45ff, Counsel Commentary, Regulatory, whistleblower,False Claims Act,qui tam,FCA,ACA,Affordable Care Act", "keywords": "Regulatory, whistleblower, Affordable Care Act, ACA, False Claims Act, FCA, qui tam", "google-site-verification": "taA-AsTDqnL-gUE2YkrQ-AE8bLsQz3HBlhUTtFyJPas", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca879\"", "article_summary": "Companies engaged in whistleblower litigation can often feel as though they are facing an uphill battle, and nowhere is this more apparent than in False Claims Act (FCA) qui tam litigation.\nWhile these types of challenges are common place in ordinary civil litigation, there are procedural and legal differences that complicate them in qui tam litigation.\nIn some instances, professional whistleblowers with specialized knowledge about the alleged fraudulent financial practices or the company\u2019s industry may be added to a case to bolster the whistleblower\u2019s claims.\nWhistleblowers are armed with inside corporate knowledge, internal documents, and a list of key potential witnesses to corroborate their claims.\nIn general, the quickest way to dismiss an FCA case is to prove that the court lacks jurisdiction or is statutorily barred from hearing the case."}
