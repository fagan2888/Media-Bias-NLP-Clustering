By the day he was kidnapped and murdered, Thomas Ray Carpenter had been a Colorado state trooper for five years. The 31-year-old man had become a trooper in 1968 after serving three years in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was a highly regarded and decorated trooper.

Carpenter was married to Phyllis and the couple had three young children, ages 9, 7, and 4. They lived in Lafayette. He was a quiet, religious man who didn’t drink alcohol. He wanted to make a career of being a CSP trooper.

Carpenter was assigned to the Colorado State Patrol’s Broomfield district that Thursday, Dec. 27, 1973. He worked the Interstate 25 corridor.

9:58 a.m.

He drove to the side of U.S. 36 near Broadway that morning. A car was pulled off on the shoulder of the highway. Carpenter was either intending to see if he could help a stranded motorist or he had seen something that appeared to be suspicious.

He did not make a radio report that he had pulled over at the time. Witnesses would later tell police that they saw Carpenter driving a patrol car with two men in the back seat at about the same time.

That morning at 9:58 a.m., Carpenter received a call from a dispatcher to go to an accident at East 58th Avenue and I-25. He told the dispatcher that he was at Interstate 70 and Havana at the time.

That was somewhat odd. He was about eight miles east from the area he was supposed to patrol.

10:04 a.m.

A dispatcher called again six minutes after the first call to ask Carpenter if he was going to the accident.

“10-4…I’m on my way,” he replied tersely.

Minutes later, a Denver police officer saw the patrol car in a parking lot behind the Lakes apartment complex at 13870 Albrook Drive in Montbello in northeast Denver.
