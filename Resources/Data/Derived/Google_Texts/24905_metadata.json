Our tax dollars are actually used to make our society sicker and keep our health insurance costs high.\u201d\n\nFuhrman \u2013 a member of Jewish Vegetarians of North America (JVNA), author of six books, frequent PBS show host, and former world-class figure skater \u2013 tells JNS.org that he does not consciously apply Jewish values or any religious preference to his scientific decision-making regarding preventing and treating disease with superior nutrition.\n\nHe was, however, featured in the film \u201cA Sacred Duty: Applying Jewish Values to Help Heal the World,\u201d a 60-minute JVNA documentary from 2007 that was written and produced by Lionel Friedberg. The film focuses on Jewish teachings about caring for the earth, treatment of animals, and the environment, with a focus on vegetarianism.\n\nAmericans, Fuhrman says, have a diet of mostly animal products and processed foods.\n\n\u201cFive percent of calories from fruits and vegetables isn\u2019t sufficient,\u201d he says. \u201cThe diet, to be healthy, has to be mostly fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds. We have these weapons of mass destruction on every street corner and they\u2019re called donuts, cheeseburgers, French fries, potato chips, junk food. Our kids are living on a junk food diet.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fuhrman, if people don\u2019t change their diets, they can expect a shorter life, and if they do live into their golden years, they will have an increased likelihood of dementia and physical ailments.\n\nCelebrities like singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette and primatologist Jane Goodall say they have been influenced by Fuhrman\u2019s work.\n\nIn Goodall\u2019s book, Harvest for Hope: A Guide to Mindful Eating, the famous chimp researcher notes, \u201cIn his excellent book on family nutrition and healthy appetizing recipes, Disease-Proof Your Child, [Fuhrman] points out that we have been conditioned to believe that animal products are the best source of protein. In fact, peas, green vegetables, and beans have more protein per calorie than meat.\u201d\n\nMorissette, in a 2009 interview with People magazine, calls reading Eat to Live a \u201credefining moment\u201d in her life. The singer had battled eating disorders her whole life and was mocked for being fat. After following Fuhrman\u2019s lifestyle change and diet plan, she lost weight and exercised more, running 20 miles a week.\n\nFuhrman laments growing rates of obesity and diseases resulting from unhealthy diets in America, saying, \u201cwe\u2019re destroying the land, we\u2019re destroying people\u2019s health, people are getting more sick, which is requiring more medical attention and care.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur population can\u2019t walk and can\u2019t perform; it\u2019s ruining their intellectual abilities on the job,\u201d he tells JNS.org. \u201cWe cannot compete worldwide and we are paying so much for medical care costs. If we\u2019re going to expect to compete in the world marketplace, and even to survive as a nation or as a species for hundreds of years, we have got to take better care of the earth and our health.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mark Epstein, president of the National Health Association, Fuhrman presents a nutritional roadmap to optimum health.\n\n\u201cHis information is painstakingly researched and supported, yet he presents the results with an easy-to-follow style,\u201d Epstein says. \u201cHe states the facts and educates us to make the food choices that will help us overcome disease and regain health. His book Eat to Live marks the beginning of a genuine, scientifically-based health revolution.\u201d\n\nEat to Live is not just about counting calories and eating less, but also about protecting the body against disease, says the author.\n\n\u201cI go through the biology and the physiology showing how higher nutrient consumption suppresses appetite and reduces food addictions and food cravings,\u201d Fuhrman says. \u201cThe diet I recommend is much more promotion of long life, heart attack protection, reduction of cancer risk, and prevention of dementia and strokes. It\u2019s much more aggressive as far as disease protection.\u201d\n\nFuhrman coined the word \u201cnutritarian\u201d for those who adopt a diet based on his simple formula: Health = Nutrients/Calories. Simply, your health is predicted by your nutrient intake divided by your intake of calories, in Fuhrman\u2019s estimation.\n\n\u201cYour key to permanent weight loss is to eat predominantly those foods that have a high proportion of nutrients to calories. Every food can be evaluated using this formula,\u201d he says.\n\nHealthy food can also taste great, notes Fuhrman.\n\n\u201cYou like what you get used to eating,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you start eating healthy, you start liking it. It\u2019s all about changing your habits and giving your taste buds a chance to adapt.\u201d\n\nExercise is another key element to Fuhrman\u2019s proposed \u201cnutritarian\u201d lifestyle. A former member of the U.S. World Figure Skating Team, Fuhrman placed second in the U.S. National Pairs Championship in 1973. He came in third place at the 1976 World Professional Pairs Skating Championship in Jaca, Spain, with partner Gale Fuhrman. At nearly 60, he still enjoys physical activities, such as tennis and skiing.\n\n\u201cIf we eat these foods that are dramatically protective, we can be protected,\u201d Furhman says. \u201cWhen you are protected, you feel well, you have energy, you maintain your youthful vigor, and you can live life and do what you want to do. You can exercise, you can climb mountains.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Jewish Ledger", "description": "By Robert Gluck/JNS.org While the national debate on \u201cObamacare\u201d rages on, bestselling Jewish author Dr. Joel Fuhrman says the \u201ccurrent disease care model of what we call \u2018health care\u2019 cannot possibly be sustained.\u201d \u201cThere is simply not enough money available to support a system in which the lion\u2019s share of expenditures is devoted to acute [&hellip", "title": "\"Eat to Live\" author dishes on health care, nutrition, disease prevention - Jewish Ledger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.jewishledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Fuhrman-pic1.jpg", "url": "http://www.jewishledger.com/2015/01/eat-live-author-dishes-health-care-nutrition-disease-prevention/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Top Stories", "published_time": "2015-01-07T16:41:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb053\"", "article_summary": "health care,\u201d Fuhrman says in an interview.\n\u201cWhen you are protected, you feel well, you have energy, you maintain your youthful vigor, and you can live life and do what you want to do.\n\u201cEat to Live\u201d author dishes on health care, nutrition, disease preventionBy Robert Gluck/JNS.orgWhile the national debate on \u201cObamacare\u201d rages on, bestselling Jewish author Dr. Joel Fuhrman says the \u201ccurrent disease care model of what we call \u2018health care\u2019 cannot possibly be sustained.\u201d\u201cThere is simply not enough money available to support a system in which the lion\u2019s share of expenditures is devoted to acute care, with virtually nothing being spent on preventive medicine, i.e.\n\u201cHe states the facts and educates us to make the food choices that will help us overcome disease and regain health.\nHis book Eat to Live marks the beginning of a genuine, scientifically-based health revolution.\u201dEat to Live is not just about counting calories and eating less, but also about protecting the body against disease, says the author."}
