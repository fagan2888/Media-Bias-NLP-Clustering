Scott Applewhite, File House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)\n\nOn Monday, President Obama announced that he would commute 46 \u201cunduly harsh sentences\u201d as the first wave of what his administration has promised will be an aggressive effort to expand its (up unto this point fairly rare) grants of mercy. This decision did not sit well with several key House Republicans, including some who have recently indicated that they are willing to work with Democrats on criminal justice reform. In a letter addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday, 19 members of the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 including its chair \u2014 attacked the president\u2019s grants of clemency.\n\nMuch of the letter consists of a list of questions about the particular individuals who received clemency; the lawmakers want to know, for example, \u201cwhat quantity of narcotics did each offender possess?\u201d The letter\u2019s primary substantive critique of the administration, however, is a novel constitutional argument that Obama and the Justice Department are discriminating in favor of drug offenders in a manner that is somehow legally objectionable. \u201c[T]he fact that the Department\u2019s clemency initiative is focused solely on federal drug offenders continues this Administration\u2019s plainly unconstitutional practice of picking and choosing which laws to enforce and which to change,\u201d the letter claims.\n\nThe suggestion that the Obama administration is crossing a line because they\u2019ve decided to focus their efforts on drug offenders is unusual as an historic matter. President Gerald Ford discriminated in favor of disgraced former presidents in his exercise of the executive\u2019s power to grant mercy, while President George W. Bush discriminated in favor of former high-ranking aides to Vice President Dick Cheney. Presidents have historically exercised their power to grant pardons or clemency as they please, and they are not required to get Congress\u2019s permission in order to do so.\n\nIndeed, the president\u2019s broad discretion to grant mercy to whoever they choose, when they choose, so long as the beneficiary of that mercy is an alleged or convicted federal offender, is part of America\u2019s constitutional design. The Constitution itself lays this power out in broad terms, providing that the president \u201cshall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\u201d As the Supreme Court explained in Schick v. Reed, the drafters of this constitutional provision \u201cspoke in terms of a \u2018prerogative\u2019 of the President, which ought not be \u2018fettered or embarrassed.'\u201d Moreover, the Court added, \u201cthe power flows from the Constitution alone, not from any legislative enactments, and that it cannot be modified, abridged, or diminished by the Congress.\u201d\n\nShould the signatories to the House Republicans\u2019 letter distrust the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution, perhaps they will trust the conservative Heritage Foundation. According to The Heritage Guide to the Constitution, \u201c[t]he power to pardon is one of the least limited powers granted to the President in the Constitution,\u201d and its scope \u201cremains quite broad, almost plenary.\u201d\n\nSo the accusation that President Obama has somehow misused his powers by giving particular attention to federal drug offenders is frivolous. There\u2019s also a very specific policy reason which explains why the administration would target drug offenders over people convicted of a different crime \u2014 federal sentencing law has changed significantly with respect to drug offenders in recent years. As the House Republicans\u2019 letter itself explains, former Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the administration would prioritize drug offenders who, among other things, \u201clikely would have received a substantially lower sentence if convicted of the same offense(s) today,\u201d when determining whether to issue a grant of clemency.\n\nIn any event, the letter suggests that bipartisan progress on criminal justice reform could prove fragile in the face of some lawmaker\u2019s overarching need to attack leaders of the other party. Outside of Congress, there are encouraging signs for advocates eager to see traditional opponents come together to reduce excessive sentences and otherwise reform the criminal justice system. Liberal groups such as the Center for American Progress (which is the partner organization of ThinkProgress\u2019s parent organization) and the ACLU have joined with conservative groups such as FreedomWorks and Americans for Tax Reform to push for wide-ranging reforms. The Koch brothers are a major supporter of this effort.\n\nThere have also been hopeful signs for supporters of criminal justice reform within Congress. Reps. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), for example, partnered with Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) to draft legislation that, among other things, would reduce many sentences and steer low-level offenders towards probation as an alternative to prison. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) belongs to a bipartisan caucus seeking to educate \u201cthe public and Members of Congress on crime mitigation, rehabilitation, community collaboration, reform of the prison system, and the advancement of safety and justice in the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd, yet, both of these lawmakers signed the letter to Attorney General Lynch.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A letter from several House Republicans suggests that bipartisan progress on criminal justice reform could prove fragile in the face of some lawmakers' overarching need to attack leaders of the other party.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A letter from several House Republicans suggests that bipartisan progress on criminal justice reform could prove fragile in the face of some lawmakers' overarching need to attack leaders of the other party.", "title": "House Republicans Are Outraged That Obama Is Too Merciful", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/07/15/3680759/house-republicans-clemency-letter/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bob-Goodlatte.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A letter from several House Republicans suggests that bipartisan progress on criminal justice reform could prove fragile in the face of some lawmakers' overarching need to attack leaders of the other party.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bob-Goodlatte-321x214.jpg", "title": "House Republicans Are Outraged That Obama Is Too Merciful", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bob-Goodlatte.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bob-Goodlatte.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T12:00:52+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca812\"", "article_summary": "Justice House Republicans Are Outraged That Obama Is Too Merciful CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\nThere\u2019s also a very specific policy reason which explains why the administration would target drug offenders over people convicted of a different crime \u2014 federal sentencing law has changed significantly with respect to drug offenders in recent years.\nThis decision did not sit well with several key House Republicans, including some who have recently indicated that they are willing to work with Democrats on criminal justice reform.\nThere have also been hopeful signs for supporters of criminal justice reform within Congress.\nThe suggestion that the Obama administration is crossing a line because they\u2019ve decided to focus their efforts on drug offenders is unusual as an historic matter."}
