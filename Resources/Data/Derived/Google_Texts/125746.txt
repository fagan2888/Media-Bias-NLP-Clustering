SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - In the tranquil Sugar House Park pond, ducks are dying.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1LBLC7r ) that a disease known as avian botulism is killing birds that live in the water there.

The Salt Lake County Parks and Recreation department doesnâ€™t have an estimate on the number of deaths, but spokeswoman Callie Birdsall says they have seen between one and a dozen dead birds per day lately.

There is no public health threat, she said, because the disease will only make humans sick if they eat the birds. But she advised against touching the dead animals.

The National Wildlife Health Center says the disease is caused by a toxin produced by a common bacterial species. Birds ingest the toxin from water or by eating maggots or flies.
