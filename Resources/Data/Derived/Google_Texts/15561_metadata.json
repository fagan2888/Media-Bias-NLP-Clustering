Sometimes unified, sometimes not. The people have changed, the organizations have changed, leadership among them has changed. But it was always the community that was moving the ball forward, with the help of straight and cisgender allies, on all fronts - legislative, legal, scientific, medical and cultural.\n\nThis week that changed. In a week reminiscent of the period during 1963-64 - when the Kennedy White House first began to seriously grapple with the African-American civil rights movement, followed by the Johnson White House's action on the Civil Rights, Voting Rights and Fair Housing Acts - the Obama administration's Departments of Justice, Education and Health and Human Services took control of the trans civil rights movement. All this past week.\n\nThis bold action did not arise spontaneously. The Obama administration has been taking steps since its inception in 2009 to make its own EEO policies trans inclusive. They took seriously the evolving medical and legal consensus that gender identity was a subcategory of \"sex.\" Since Title VII in 1964 first protected people \"because of sex,\" followed by other federal laws including Title IX and the Affordable Care Act, it became just a matter of time before this change became fully evident. That we reached this day because of \"chance accidents, improbable circumstances and unimagined consequences\" does not matter, either legally or culturally.\n\nWhile the government has been cautious in its pronouncements over the past eight years, with occasional historic public acts such as the EEOC's Macy v. Holder decision in 2012 which set the stage for a raft of trans legal victories to this day, and the signing of the LGBT Federal Contractor Executive Order 13672 in 2014, that caution disappeared last week, and picked up steam this week. From Assistant Attorney General Gupta's notice to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory last Wednesday, to the federal lawsuit against North Carolina on Monday announced at the historic press conference at the Department of Justice, to Thursday's announcement of new rules protecting public school and university students nationwide and yesterday's codification of rules affecting trans health care and insurance coverage (ACA Rule 1557), this has been a week of booming voices and stunning clarity, all in the service of civil rights in the grand American tradition.\n\nNot only have the voices of the Attorney General and her Assistant AG been booming in their own right, they've been even more so relative to the voice of the community. As my activist colleague, Sarah McBride, pointed out this week in the Advocate, the Feds had been speaking in whispers about trans civil rights for years. As Sarah wrote,\n\nEach step forward was announced with a whisper -- and met with a shrug by many of our allies. We've noticed that we have been unnoticed by so many whose passion for justice and equality for others should have led them to our side but didn't.\n\nIt was only last year that the President, in the State of the Union message, first uttered the word \"transgender\" as a standalone word (not as part of \"LGBT\").\n\nThere's a reason, though, those advances were announced by the federal government in a whisper. It's because we, the trans community leadership and our LGB allies, modeled it for them. We were often crippled by fear, and stood just off to the side, sometimes in the shadows. We were afraid that we would lose in the Supreme Court, so we said that we couldn't embrace our rights until we got there, knowing that was unlikely to happen for years, if ever, and hoping no one would notice the inherent contradiction. We were afraid that the \"ick factor,\" which had crippled our gay friends for years, would transfer to us, so we remained demure. We were afraid that speaking out would lead to a rift with the gay community and the creation of major disputes among the trans community both nationally and in the states. So we generally preferred not to be seen, or heard, fully.\n\nFor the past four years, whenever the federal government has won us a major victory, the community basically remained silent. Worse, at times some misrepresented the state of the law and protections to which trans people all around the country were entitled. We did not dance in the street when the Macy decision was announced (the Transgender Law Center and Freedom to Work being the major exceptions), nor did we celebrate the legal victories of Diane Schroer, Vandy Beth Glenn or Tamara Lusardi, to name a few. More importantly, we did not learn from those victories that what we had believed for many years was true - that \"because of sex\" in Title VII included us. We remained mired in fear and anxiety, and in so doing deprived those who most needed the legal and emotional support the help to which they were entitled.\n\nApparently the Obama administration feels no such fear. They are not only fully responsive now, they are highly proactive. While it's true that this progress would not have occurred without the daily grind of our staffers, trans and allies, working with the federal government during this administration, led by Mara Keisling and Harper Jean Tobin at NCTE, and Kellan Baker at CAP, to name just a few, all that work was occurring virtually under a cone of silence.\n\nThe main lesson we learned from the marriage equality battles is that it is the dignity of each individual which should be foremost in the minds of those whom we're trying to win to our side. Rather than list tax benefits or legal documentation burdens we came to understand that if we were going to persuade America that gay men and women were entitled to full citizenship and the right to marry whomever they chose, we needed to humanize them to their neighbors. They needed to be in the spotlight.\n\nThe same holds for the trans community, and our right to come out of the shadows and be full members of the American community. Today we have allies in some of the strangest of places, including Megyn Kelly on Fox News who has joined others like MSNBC's Chris Matthews and CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nAs Attorney General Lynch said:\n\n\n\nWe see you. We stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward.\n\nThat was the game changer. She continued,\n\nPlease know that history is on your side.\n\nIt is, indeed. All those years organizing, demonstrating, lobbying, collaborating. All the recent celebrity comings out, award-winning television shows and films. It has all led to this week, where the federal government took off its gloves and made the issue bigger than us. It is now about rights, fairness and dignity across this country.\n\nAnd this simple fact, as stated clearly by AAG Gupta:\n\nTransgender men are men. They live, work, and study as men. Transgender women are women. They live, work, and study as women.\n\nMaybe now we will all live our daily lives with a little more pride, a deeper sense of self worth, and a willingness to speak out not in a whisper but a shout-out. Liberty and justice for all now formally includes the trans community; we should never forget that.\n\nFollow Dana Beyer on Twitter: www.twitter.com/DanaBeyerMD", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the last 47 years the fight for LGBT equality, in general, and trans equality, in particular, has been led by the community.
