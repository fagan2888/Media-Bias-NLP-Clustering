Everyone remarked about how their sides were aching from laughing. It was a terrific evening hosted by Chely Wright and the fabulous Melinda Ryder. I owe a special thanks to the LIKEME Lighthouse for selecting me to be a 2014 Shine a Light honoree along with the owners of the home furnishing store Mitchell and Tim Gold who received the National Shine A Light award.. This very philanthropic gay-owned home design studio has designated LIKEME Lighthouse as a recipient of its fundraising, and they are planning a huge launch party in 2015 when they open their first Kansas City store in the Leawood Town Center mall. newsbriefs Kansas City gets a score of 100 on Municipal Equality Index A report on LGBT equality in U.S. cities by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u0092s largest LGBT civil rights organization, rated 353 cities across the nation, including six in Missouri. The 2014 Municipal Equality Index (MEI) is the third edition of the only nationwide rating system of LGBT inclusion in municipal law.\n\n\n\nKansas City made great strides this year to earn a perfect score on the MEI -- up from 89 in 2013. Improving benefits for same-sex spouses and appointing an LGBT liaison were among the changes Kansas City implemented to achieve the honor.\n\n\n\nMayor Sly James is happy to hear that Kansas City ranked so high and is proud of his team for making it happen. \u0093I am proud of the progress our city has made to ensure the inclusion and fair representation of the LGBT community. Although we received a perfect score, we know we still have work to do to further embrace this valuable part of our community.\u0094\n\n\n\nThe MEI rates cities based on 47 criteria falling under six broad categories: non-discrimination laws; relationship recognition; municipality\u0092s employment policies, including transgender-inclusive insurance coverage, contracting non-discrimination requirements, and other policies relating to equal treatment of LGBT city employees; inclusiveness of city services; law enforcement; and municipal leadership on matters of equality.\n\n\n\nLast year, five cities in Missouri were rated: Columbia (74), Jefferson City (7), Kansas City (89), St. Louis (100), and Springfield (37). This year, Columbia (70), Jefferson City (10), Kansas City (100), St. Louis (100), Springfield (27), and Independence (14) were rated.\n\n\n\nA.J. Bockelman, executive director for PROMO, Missouri\u0092s LGBT advocacy organization, believes the timing is just right for this report. \u0093The Municipal Equality Index has become an incredible tool for advocates on the ground. The road map it provides to local officials is a sensible way for supporters to advance basic equality issues and, at the same time, provide education on the impact of these broader issues.\u0094\n\n\n\nThe full MEI report can be found at HRC MEI report.
