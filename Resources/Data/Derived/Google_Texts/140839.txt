One of the reasons abortion is losing support among the American people is the improvement in fetal imaging. The ability to see the "clump of cells" or "tissue mass" on a screen is enough to convince many people that a real human being lives inside the womb.

If a two dimensional picture is powerful, how about something like this?

It is now possible to use 3-D printers to create a custom model of the baby developing inside a mother's womb. Victoria Taylor of the New York Daily News reports:

California-based 3D Babies uses 3D or 4D sonograms to create a doll that resembles your baby while he or she is still in the womb.

"Our ultimate goal is to bring a smile to the faces of parents, grandparents, and other family members as they recall the day that they met their little one," the company's Indiegogo page reads. "This product will become a treasured family heirloom."

The fetus figurines are available in three sizes: life-size (8 inches, $600), half-size (4 inches, $400) and mini (2 inches, $200). You can choose from one of two positions depending on whether you want the baby's gender to be clear.

Of course, mothers planning an abortion are unlikely to commission a $600 model of the victim. But the existence of these models will surely become known, and they will eventually be seen by more and more people as the price comes down. At a minimum, it puts the lie to the gross euphemisms employed by the pro-abortion movement to disguise the nature of the act they support as a "right."
