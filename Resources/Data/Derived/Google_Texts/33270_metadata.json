Marco Rubio\u2019s entrance into the 2016 presidential race Monday is in many ways an audacious act of political defiance.\n\nAfter the freshman Florida Republican\u2019s botched attempt at bipartisan immigration reform in 2013, his polling numbers hemorrhaged.\n\nWhen Jeb Bush sent signals late last year he was stirring to fulfill his own White House ambitions, the chances of a Rubio run were roundly downgraded by party strategists in his own home state.\n\n\n\nAnd when word trickled out last week that Hillary Clinton would beat him to the campaign starting gate by a day, there was speculation he would get bigfooted.\n\n\n\nBut Rubio hasn\u2019t flinched.\n\nAnd his formal launch Monday evening \u2013 complete with a straightforward speech at the historic and decadent Freedom Tower in Miami \u2013 shows that if nothing else, Rubio is confident enough in his own raw talent to believe he can prove the naysayers wrong again.\n\n\u201cNow the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American century,\u201d Rubio said in the climax of an announcement speech that produced chants of \u201cMarco, Marco.\u201d \u201cThis election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.\u201d\n\nAt 43 \u2013 the precise age John F. Kennedy was when elected to the presidency \u2013 Rubio is expected to be the youngest contender in the hunt for the White House in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s already becoming apparent his youthfulness is what his team will use to separate him from the rest of the emerging Republican pack \u2013 as well as from Clinton, who at 67 is 24 years his elder.\n\n\u201cThe contrast on that with Marco and Hillary is excellent,\u201d says Sid Dinerstein, a former chairman of the Palm Beach County Republican Party in Florida, who says he is neutral in the primary at this point. \u201cShe\u2019ll look older in a head-to-head with Marco than with other candidates. It\u2019s always been important in American optics.\u201d\n\nThe theme of Rubio\u2019s bid \u2013 \u201cA New American Century\u201d \u2013 conjures up an eagerness to turn the page away from a generation of leaders who have dominated the past two decades, most pointedly the Clintons and Bushes.\n\nHe made one reference to Clinton in his speech, without mentioning her name.\n\n\u201cNow just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over,\u201d he said, delivering the sound bite that will be played in contrast to Clinton\u2019s newly minted candidacy.\n\nAs early as last summer, Rubio dubbed Clinton \u201ca 20th-century candidate\u201d \u2013 a label he could easily affix to Bush but won\u2019t until he has to. When he\u2019s been asked about the former Florida governor \u2013 a supporter, mentor and friend \u2013 he retreats to the customary answer that his candidacy is about him, not anyone else.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running against Jeb Bush,\u201d he told reporters in February.\n\nBut he will eventually need to confront that thorny conflict once Bush pulls the trigger on his budding candidacy in the coming months. And his move into the race despite public pressure from Florida\u2019s top political players to stand down indicates he won\u2019t be reluctant to make a crisp distinction if and when it\u2019s required.\n\nBeyond the generational chasm, Rubio associates believe their candidate\u2019s powerful oratory, compelling Cuban-American heritage and disciplined, policy-driven focus will carve out a unique niche for him in a sprawling field. But there\u2019s a limit to that calculation.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, the first GOP entrant into the 2016 race, is arguably just as rhetorically gifted and also is the son of Cuban immigrants, as he mentioned in a statement Monday welcoming Rubio to the fray. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is Indian-American and arguably equally as wonky.\n\nRubio begins the GOP primary contest muddled in single digits in the early nominating states as well as nationally, but his growth potential is apparent. Republican voters like him, as demonstrated by his high personal favorability ratings and the reactions he yields after he performs in a room.\n\nHe can speak fluidly about foreign policy and has advocated for a mighty, active response to the world\u2019s most insidious threats. He will also have money. One Miami donor has floated spending $10 million on his behalf through a super PAC, and Rubio has molded a reputation for being able to woo well-heeled contributors in private settings.\n\nBut youth can easily be tied to inexperience, and that\u2019s the risk Rubio\u2019s bid ultimately faces. Is he too fresh-faced to manage the towering threats that face the country? After Barack Obama \u2013 once a first-term senator who won the presidency at the age of 47 \u2013 is the country ready to take another chance on someone so unseasoned?\n\n\n\nThere were hints of Rubio's political naivet\u00e9 in his handling of his immigration position, which he switched in order to tend to the political reality of conservative recalcitrance. When he eventually came out in opposition to the bill he helped craft, it looked like a flip-flop akin to John Kerry\u2019s infamous 2004 remark on war funding: \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s allies like to cite that unlike Obama, he was speaker of the Florida House before advancing to the U.S. Senate. But if Rubio convinces voters he\u2019s ready, it\u2019s difficult to imagine it\u2019ll be due to his tenure at the helm of a legislative body in Tallahassee.\n\nHis candidacy is truly audacious because it holds considerable risk. He is giving up his Senate seat in a pivotal swing state that Republicans will have to scramble to defend. In 19 months, Rubio will either be president or a private citizen, and it could be over much quicker than that.\n\nBut just as he was an overwhelming underdog in his initial 2010 race to get to the U.S. Senate, he will relish the underdog role in the wide-open 2016 race.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Florida Sen.
