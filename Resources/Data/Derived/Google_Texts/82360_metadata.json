Medicaid is not right way to do it.\u201d\n\nThe White House says Louisiana\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid leaves 265,000 people uninsured. Louisiana is one of 23 states that are not expanding Medicaid, an option provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n3.8 million Americans in states not expanding Medicaid fall into a \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d Most of them make too much money to qualify for the health care program, but not enough to receive the tax subsidies for plans on the insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201c[Medicaid] was a program designed to take care of the disabled, of vulnerable children. It was never designed to be there for able-bodied adults,\u201d Jindal explained\n\nAccording to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Louisiana ranks 48th in overall health and 42nd in children\u2019s health quality. Arkansas, a state that expanded Medicaid had a 45.9% drop in their uninsured rate from 2013 to mid-2014, while Louisiana\u2019s uninsured rate decreased 15.2 in the same period.\n\n\u201cBy expanding and creating a new entitlement when we can\u2019t afford the ones we\u2019ve already got,\u201d Jindal sad, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act, the president is basically doubling down on a failed approach to providing health care. There\u2019s a better way to help the uninsured.\"\n\nJindal also criticized President Obama\u2019s expected executive action on immigration, saying he agrees with using government funding to try and block the president.\n\n\u201cNo we shouldn\u2019t shut down the government, but absolutely Republicans should do everything we can to force the president to follow the law,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cLet\u2019s secure the border. No the president shouldn\u2019t shut down the government so that he can break the law.\u201d\n\nJindal told moderator Chuck Todd that he will make a decision about a presidential run in the first half of 2015, saying \u201cwe are praying about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were to run for president, it\u2019s because I believe in our country, the American dream is at jeopardy,\u201d Jindal explained.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Gov.
