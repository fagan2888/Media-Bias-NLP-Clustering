Since 2000, the percentage of foreign-born adults in the U.S. has jumped by 46 percent, while the number of native-born adults rose only 14 percent. (Native-born Americans are still, as a category, seven times larger than foreign-born.)\n\nHowever, labor force participation among those two groups has diverged sharply over that time. In 2000, both reported a labor force participation rate of 67 percent. Since then, the foreign-born population\u2019s participation rate has dropped only slightly, to 66 percent, while the native-born rate has dropped all the way to 62 percent.\n\nIt makes for a compelling argument that the increased presence of foreign-born workers is keeping native-born workers from finding jobs. However, says Megan, that argument is flawed.\n\n\u201cContrary to campaign rhetoric, there is no clear evidence that immigration has brought forth a decline in native-born employment or labor force participation,\u201d he writes.\n\nRelated: Big Surprise \u2013 Hispanic Voters Can\u2019t Stand Donald Trump\n\nFor one, the unemployment rates for both categories of workers have moved in tandem, separated only by a fraction of a point, for the entire period in question. That means, essentially, that for foreign-born and native-born workers looking for a job, their prospects are roughly equal.\n\nThe big driver of the difference in workforce participation is that, faced with a frustrating job search or other life events that make dropping out of the workforce a possible choice, native-born workers are simply more likely to have appealing alternatives.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of these trends lies the fact that native-born individuals generally have a greater amount of options than the foreign-born population with regard to their labor market decisions,\u201d Megan writes.\n\nRelated: Bush Warns that Trump\u2019s \u2018Unrealistic\u2019 Wall Will Cost Hundreds of Billions\n\n\u201cImmigrant families have lower median incomes, and are more likely to be living below the poverty line\u2014thus they are less likely to have the means to enroll in college. Immigrants also tend to have lower levels of retirement savings. And undocumented immigrants\u2014which comprise around 28 percent of the foreign born population\u2014are unable to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance.\u201d\n\nThe persistent belief that foreign-born workers are stealing jobs from native-born Americans is the product of a well-documented fallacy that has been repeatedly debunked by economists, Megan reports.\n\n\u201cBlaming immigration for declining employment ultimately rests on the flawed belief that economies can only produce a fixed number of jobs and that for every job occupied by an immigrant, a native-born worker must be unemployed,\u201d he writes.\n\nWill the issue continue to burn on the campaign trail, though? Almost certainly yes, as long as there are candidates like Donald Trump willing to keep stoking the fire.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to labor force participation, the argument that immigrants are taking jobs away from native-born Americans has a lot of superficial appeal.
