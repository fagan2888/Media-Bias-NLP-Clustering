Ted Cruz (R-TX) was picked as the 2016 presidential nominee.\n\nOn the Wednesday episode of WMUR\u2019s On Point radio program, a caller from Sioux City named Tom said that he had firsthand experience with the Republican senator\u2019s grassroots support in Iowa.\n\n\u201cThese guys do not suffer dissension well,\u201d Tom pointed out, explaining that he had recently been invited to a Republican focus group in Sioux City.\n\n\u201cThere was about 10 of us in the room,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd at one point we were talking about electability of candidates. And I just said that I think Sen. Cruz is way to meat-cleavery \u2014 he\u2019s going to take a meat cleaver to all the social programs, do away with Medicare, Obamacare, I mean, everything.\u201d\n\nTom said that he ended his remarks by saying that he would \u201cleave the party\u201d if Republicans selected Cruz as the presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cAt that point the moderator said let\u2019s take a short break. And then about 10 seconds after that, the guy that\u2019s running the program came in and tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u2018Can you follow me out into the hall for a second and bring your stuff with you,'\u201d Tom continued. \u201cHe threw me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so what they want to do is they just want to preach the Gospel. You talk about a revival.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa resident observed that conservatives in his state had a disproportionate amount of power when it came to selecting Republican presidential nominees.\n\n\u201cIt just proves that Iowa has no right being a kingmaker,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s my point. You\u2019re letting a bunch of people that \u2014 I mean, they don\u2019t even care \u2014 the people in the focus group I was with don\u2019t even care if the president has got a college education. Now, my God, the guy is running a $15 trillion economy and a huge budget, and they don\u2019t even care if he has a college education?\u201d\n\nListen to the audio below from WMUR, broadcast April 8, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ted-Cruz-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Iowa voter says GOP booted him for calling Ted Cruz extreme: \u2018They just want to preach the Gospel\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41d5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThese guys do not suffer dissension well,\u201d Tom pointed out, explaining that he had recently been invited to a Republican focus group in Sioux City.\nYou talk about a revival.\u201dThe Iowa resident observed that conservatives in his state had a disproportionate amount of power when it came to selecting Republican presidential nominees.\nAn Iowa man said this week that he was invited to a Republican focus group and then was kicked out because he threatened to leave the party if Sen.
