Ryan (R-Wis.) was named Speaker of the House last month his rapid rise to the top of House Republican leadership set off a domino effect of promotions in the House Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Kevin Brady announced on Wednesday a complete overhaul of the subcommittee assignments for committee Republicans. The Hill has the details:\n\nNew Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) announced the changes that includes adding Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) and adjusts the names and sizes of several subcommittees. \u201cThese Republican subcommittee chairs and members will play a crucial role in taking real steps toward fixing our country\u2019s broken tax code, reining in the IRS, reforming the nation\u2019s welfare programs, expanding trade, replacing the Affordable Care Act and saving Social Security and Medicare for the long term,\u201d Brady said in a statement. Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.) will lead the tax policy subcommittee moving from the human resources panel with tax reform topping the agenda of Ryan and Brady.\n\nAN EITC MOMENT FOR OBAMA AND RYAN. President Obama and Ryan don\u2019t agree on much when it comes to reforming the individual side of the tax code but one potential area of agreement is an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Both men would like to include more single individuals in the program which acts as a financial incentive for low-income workers. Chuck Marr at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has a new analysis of how the two could come together on some policy changes.\n\nThe EITC, however, largely excludes workers who aren\u2019t raising children and completely excludes them if they\u2019re under age 25. A young man just out of school who\u2019s in an entry-level job gets nothing, and a middle-aged woman with grown kids who works for the minimum wage at the local nursing home gets close to nothing. Speaker Ryan and President Obama propose to change that \u2014 in almost exactly the same way. They would phase in the credit more quickly as a worker\u2019s earnings rise, raise the maximum credit to about $1,000, and lower the eligibility age from 25 to 21. These changes would make a big difference. Currently, as the chart shows, a childless worker with poverty-level wages receives an EITC of $172, not nearly enough to offset the $1,188 he or she owes in income tax and the employee share of payroll taxes (to say nothing of the employer share, which economists generally agree ultimately falls on workers in the form of lower wages). The Ryan/Obama proposals would give that worker an $841 EITC, a major step towards lifting the worker back to the poverty line.\n\nFINDING A LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO THE BUDGET CRISIS CYCLE. Economists and budget watchers often debate the idea of shifting to a tw0-year budget cycle in hopes of creating more certainty in the system, but Rudy Penner at the Tax Policy Center says that shift wouldn\u2019t be a great idea, according to TPC\u2019s Howard Gleckman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Your daily roundup of budget and tax news.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Your daily roundup of budget and tax news.", "title": "Shaking up the Ways and Means Committee; an EITC moment for Obama and Ryan, and fixing the budget process", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/19/shaking-up-the-ways-and-means-committee-an-eitc-moment-for-obama-and-ryan-and-fixing-the-budget-process/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/26/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Estate_Tax_Fact_Check_-0b09d-1449.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "will lead the tax policy subcommittee moving from the human resources panel with tax reform topping the agenda of Ryan and Brady.\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)\nThe Ryan/Obama proposals would give that worker an $841 EITC, a major step towards lifting the worker back to the poverty line.\nThe EITC, however, largely excludes workers who aren\u2019t raising children and completely excludes them if they\u2019re under age 25.\nAN EITC MOMENT FOR OBAMA AND RYAN."}
