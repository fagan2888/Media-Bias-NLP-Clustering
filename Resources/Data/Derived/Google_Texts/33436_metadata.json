According to Linda Nablo, chief deputy director of the Department of Medical Assistance Services, \u201cThe policy around not verifying zero income was a holdover from the days when we had to rely on pay stubs . . . to verify income; there is no paper to verify zero.\u201d However, \u201cthat is no longer the case in the advent of electronic sources, and we should and will be maximizing their use and treat zero-income reporters the same as we treat people who report $1 of income.\u201d\n\nThe Commission \u201calso faulted Virginia\u2019s \u2018passive\u2019 approach to recovering money owed from the estates of certain deceased Medicaid patients.\u201d As part of federal law, when a Medicaid recipient dies, the state is required to \u201cseek recovery for long-term care expenses, and Virginia also may seek recovery for other Medicaid services.\u201d But the audit found that Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program \u201cdoes not proactively identify those recipients,\u201d instead, relying upon the voluntary reporting of that information from estate attorneys or the heirs of the deceased recipient, meaning money that should be returned to strengthen our public safety nets is being handed over as part of an inheritance.\n\nThis report comes in the midst of a continuing debate in Virginia over the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. The Commonwealth\u2019s Governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, has been pushing for Medicaid expansion during the past several legislative cycles. But Republicans have held the line, citing the need for reform as well as the cost of their ballooning Medicaid budget.\n\n\u201cDespite Terry McAuliffe\u2019s best efforts, Virginia\u2019s legislative leaders continue to rebuff Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 and for good reason,\u201d said Christie Herrera, VP of State Affairs for the Foundation for Government Accountability. \u201cNow, Virginia must take the next step and prevent fraudulent people from bilking the Medicaid system in the first place.\u201d\n\nHerrera has seen the effects of Medicaid fraud in other states and while this is a great first step, there\u2019s more work to be done.\n\nThe state\u2019s report suggested recommendations for the Virginia legislature to consider to combat the fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, which includes stronger asset testing by cross-checking available income data from banks, accessing to employment databases, and streamlining the application and renewal process in order to more easily identify those Medicaid enrollees who are no longer eligible to be receiving benefits.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s legislators, Delegate Steve Landes, has introduced a bill, HJ 637, \u201cwhich gives the Commonwealth access to modern tools to combat fraud and waste in its welfare systems, such as Medicaid.\u201d\n\nReforms like those Landes has proposed have saved other states millions of dollars and helped rid their rolls of ineligible recipients.\n\nBudget-challenged Illinois recently reduced its costs by clearing out ineligible Medicaid enrollees. In just one year, audits that were authorized with bi-partisan approval found over 300,000 ineligible enrollees in their Medicaid system. In the second year, the audit removed another 400,000 ineligible enrollees. Among these were 8,000 dead folks who were somehow still receiving benefits. All totaled, ineligible enrollees were siphoning off $350 million in funds every single year.\n\nVirginia Senator Janet D. Howell, a Democrat agrees with the need for real reforms telling The Washington Post, \u201cI think we\u2019re all in agreement that we need to be more aggressive. Not only is it wrong, but we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nBlue states and red states alike are beginning to take on the task of stopping welfare fraud, and there\u2019s no reason Virginia shouldn\u2019t seize this opportunity to preserve scarce resources for both the truly needy and taxpayers alike.\n\n___________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
