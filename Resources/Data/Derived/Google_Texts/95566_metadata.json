A survey from the Harvard Institute of Politics released last year determined that only 31 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds trust the federal government overall, a figure that had been declining since March 2012.\n\nAnd, with more revelations about the Department of Veterans Affairs, Obamacare, and ultimately Clinton\u2019s private e-mails, this figure has likely continued its decline.\n\nSo what does this all mean for Clinton at the start of her 2016 presidential campaign?\n\nPlainly, her concealment of her personal and professional e-mails \u2014 out of \u201cconvenience\u201d or whatever other unapparent reason \u2014 makes it difficult for the public, and Millennials who are particularly concerned about government accountability, to trust her.\n\n\u201cI think that the public is feeling an increased sense of mistrust toward the government because such an active politician in the government and probably even a presidential candidate has breached accountability and transparency of the government by using her personal e-mail system,\u201d Patty-Jane Geller, the communications director for the Georgetown College Republicans, said of the newest Clinton scandal.\n\n\u201c[Individuals\u2019] main issues with government leadership are that the government is not accountable to the people and not always transparent, i.e. subject to corruption. Since Clinton\u2019s use of her personal email system undermines these two concepts, this exacerbates the frustration over poor government leadership,\u201d added Geller.\n\nShe emphasized that, no matter the validity of Clinton\u2019s excuse for exclusively using a personal e-mail system, her decision to not to release the entirety of her e-mails \u2014 and better yet delete those deemed personal and wipe her server \u2014 \u201cimplies that she has something to hide, or did not do her job right.\u201d\n\nAmericans, Geller explained, will therefore \u201cthink the worst\u201d of the controversy.\n\nNicholas Hunt, the president of the American University College Republicans, explained that young Americans\u2019 frustration with poor government leadership stems from their distrust of the fact that \u201cpublic servants\u201d in Washington are truly there to serve the regular population.\n\n\u201cThe thought that our high officials are motivated by anything but the raw pursuit of power as well as the prestige and future earnings potential after leaving office is a joke,\u201d Hunt declared.\n\n\u201cAmericans are tired turning on the television and seeing their elected leaders spew rhetoric, rather than unveiling plans to address the myriad of issues our nation faces,\u201d he later added.\n\nOf course, this means that, when young Americans view Clinton in a press conference insisting that she employed a personal e-mail system to avoid carrying two phones out of convenience, they see her as merely \u201cspew[ing] rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe fact that it was later reported that Clinton used an iPad and a BlackBerry \u2014 two devices \u2014 makes this \u201crhetoric\u201d ring ineffective and false.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing Millennials value, it\u2019s authenticity, and Secretary Clinton\u2019s outrageous scheme involving her home-grown sever is the absolute antithesis of this core principle,\u201d explained Alex Smith, the National Chair of the College Republican National Committee (CRNC).\n\n\u201cThis sort of secrecy is part of the reason why young voters helped to catapult a much more open President Obama to victory in the 2008 primaries,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s evasive tactics represent an old style of politics that just does not work in our modern world anymore.\u201d\n\nAlas, as Hillary\u2019s secrecy throughout campaign season inevitably increases, one will undoubtedly notice her favorability \u2014 and trustworthiness \u2014 among Millennials begin its descent.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Though many desperate Democrats have dismissed Hillary Clinton's private e-mail controversy as a fleeting bleep on her otherwise successful record, evidence shows that the scandal may haunt the former of secretary of State into the 2016 election, especially when it comes to Millennial voters.", "title": "A perfect storm for Hillary Clinton?
