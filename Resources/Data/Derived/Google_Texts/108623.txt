Fad, or trend, diets are built on short-term solutions. They tend to restrict calories, incorporate meal replacement bars, or focus solely on one major food group. This doesn’t mean dieters don’t experience success; it means they’re taught a very limited approach to what it means to be healthy.

Healthy eating is more nuanced than fad diets — The Paleo diet, The Mediterranean Diet, Weight Watchers, Atkins, and NutriSystem all count — would have you believe. This is why when Abby Langer, RD, of Abby Langer Nutrition in Toronto, breaks down a lot of what’s popular for her clients, she emphasizes how people can really eat anything and still be a healthy eater.

“When people come into my office and ask me for a meal plan, it won’t teach them how to make healthy choices,” she told Medical Daily. “When you learn how to cook real food, it’s a real tool you can use forever. It’s not going to do any good if I spoon feed you information.”

Kim Larson, nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, agreed with Langer. She told Medical Daily people need a more consistent, satisfying, flexible, and healthy eating approach they can stick with long-term. Diets, she said, are futile.
