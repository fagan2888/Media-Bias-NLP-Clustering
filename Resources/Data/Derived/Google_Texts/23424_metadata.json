Hopefully this is a wake-up call.\u201d\n\nRice, a star running back formerly with the Baltimore Ravens, was arrested in February on simple assault charges for an incident involving his then-fiancee, now-wife Janay Rice. Rice was later indicted on aggravated assault charges, but applied for a pretrial intervention program for first-time offenders that could eventually clear him of the charges.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell initially gave Rice a two-game suspension, which was widely criticized for being too lenient. Goodell then made the suspension indefinite after a graphic video of Rice punching his fiance became public this summer.\n\nRice appealed the indefinite suspension and was reinstated by the NFL late last month after an arbitrator ruled that the player had been punished twice for the same offense.\n\n\"The NFL was behind the curve as a lot of institutions have been behind the curve in sending a clear message,\" Obama said during the radio appearance meant to promote sign-ups for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. \"You don't want to be winging it when something like this happens. You want to have clear policies in place.\"\n\nThe league announced Wednesday a new personal conduct policy that includes more specific guidelines on how domestic violence cases will be handled.\n\n\"The fact that policies have now been established I think will be helpful in sending a message that there's no place for that kind of behavior in society, whether it's in sports or any place else,\" Obama said.\n\nThe NFL responded, \"\"We greatly appreciate the president\u2019s endorsement of our new conduct policy.\"\n\nTwitter: @chewkiii", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama calls NFL an 'old boys network' in handling of Ray Rice case", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "President Obama took aim Friday at the NFL and the mentality that led to the mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic abuse case.", "title": "Obama calls NFL an 'old boys network' in handling of Ray Rice case", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-obama-nfl-ray-rice-20141212-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-548b4382/turbine/la-sp-sn-obama-nfl-ray-rice-20141212", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "President Obama, NFL, domestic violence", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82268076", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-12", "Description": "President Obama took aim Friday at the NFL and the mentality that led to the mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic abuse case.   \u201cThere has been a little bit of an old boys network in terms of how [the NFL] operates,\u201d Obama said on ESPN Radio's \u201cThe Herd with Colin Cowherd.\u201d \u201cThere have been some...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "President Obama, NFL, domestic violence"}, "article_summary": "President Obama took aim Friday at the NFL and the mentality that led to the mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic abuse case.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell initially gave Rice a two-game suspension, which was widely criticized for being too lenient.\nYou want to have clear policies in place.\"\nGoodell then made the suspension indefinite after a graphic video of Rice punching his fiance became public this summer.\nThe NFL responded, \"\"We greatly appreciate the president\u2019s endorsement of our new conduct policy.\""}
