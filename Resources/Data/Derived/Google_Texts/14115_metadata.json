He said the company had detected other similar \u201cbrute-force attacks on Point-of-Sales terminals\u201d in the U.S., Canada and Australia before the holiday seasons attacks on Target and Nieman Marcus.\n\nClements told NBC News that company researchers also determined that \"BlackPOS,\" also known as \"Kaptoxa\" (pronounced \u201ccartosha,\u201d Russian slang for \u201cpotato\u201d), had been installed on at least six other Internet Protocol addresses, indicating that other retailers were apparently targeted.\n\nClements said the company had not identified the other targets of the malware, and could not say whether they were major retailers like Target \u2013 no. 3 in the U.S. \u2013 or small operators.\n\nIntelCrawler\u2019s report closely matches a report by another cybersecurity firm provided Thursday to NBC News and reported by Investigative Correspondent Jeff Rossen on TODAY on Friday.\n\nThat report on the Target intrusion specifically, prepared for the U.S. Secret Service by iSIGHT Partners, also indicated that the malware was a variation of \u201cBlackPOS\u201d that had been re-engineered to snatch the data from networked cash registers during a brief period when it is decrypted during the authorization process.\n\nThe report said the hack was both technically and operationally sophisticated and that the retailer\u2019s cyber defenses had no chance of detecting the intrusion.\n\n\u201cAt the time of discovery and analysis, the malware had a zero percent anti-virus detection rate, which means that fully updated anti-virus engines on fully patched computers could not identify the malware as malicious,\u201d it said.\n\nTarget did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. The Secret Service declined comment.\n\nRelated: Massive Target data breach strategy 'new to eCrime': security report\n\nIt remains unclear how the thieves were able to insert the malware into the retail systems, but IntelCrawler\u2019s Clements said the crooks most often \u201cscan for certain parameters looking for easy passwords or they use brute force password hacking.\"\n\nCyberthieves have increasingly focused on developing malicious software to attack point-of-sale, or POS, terminals in recent years, Clements said.\n\n\"This niche has become one of the most attractive for modern cybercriminals,\" he said.\n\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\n\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The malware used to steal the personal data of 70 million Target customers was an altered version of an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d hacker tool known as \u201cBlackPOS\u201d that apparently was used to infect the computer networks of si", "author": "Investigations", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The malware used to steal the personal data of 70 million Target customers was an altered version of an &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo; hacker tool known as &ldquo;BlackPOS&rdquo; that apparently was used to infect the computer networks of si", "title": "Thieves tweaked 'off-the-shelf' malware for Target data heist, security firm says", "url": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/17/22341717-thieves-tweaked-off-the-shelf-malware-for-target-data-heist-security-firm-says", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/140117-register-hmed-7p.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22341717, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"investigations\",\"displayName\":\"Investigations\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/investigations.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"5187\",\"articleCount\":\"1225\",\"seedCount\":\"147\",\"memberCount\":\"4\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1279868940,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1460216486,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Thieves tweaked 'off-the-shelf' malware for Target data heist, security firm says - Investigations", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"Open Channel\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22341717\",\"headline\":\"Thieves tweaked 'off-the-shelf' malware for Target data heist, security firm says\",\"pageSource\":\"Investigations\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"Investigations\",\"tags\":[\"featured\",\"data\",\"theft\",\"target\",\"malware\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "165.254.127.164", "nv": {"contentId": 22341717, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 23, 2016, 4:22 pm", "server": "web04", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/17/22341717-thieves-tweaked-off-the-shelf-malware-for-target-data-heist-security-firm-says"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d61\"", "article_summary": "Clements said the company had not identified the other targets of the malware, and could not say whether they were major retailers like Target \u2013 no.\nThe malware used to steal the personal data of 70 million Target customers was an altered version of an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d hacker tool known as \u201cBlackPOS\u201d that apparently was used to infect the computer networks of six other retailers, a computer security firm reported Friday.\nVISA, a global payment technology company, did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on Friday.\nIntelCrawler\u2019s report closely matches a report by another cybersecurity firm provided Thursday to NBC News and reported by Investigative Correspondent Jeff Rossen on TODAY on Friday.\nMore from NBC News Investigations:Follow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook"}
