Harrisburg, SD

Even though the leaves are changing colors, families are still getting out and enjoying the nice weekend weather.

It was a busy day at the Country Apple Orchard near Harrisburg. Kathy Grow of Yankton came up to Sioux Falls to enjoy the nice weather, although she would rather see some cooler temperatures.

“I'm looking forward to about 10 degrees cooler, but it can look just like this but just a little bit more edge on that,” Grow said.

The average temperature at this time is usually in the 60's. The apple orchard is open until Halloween.
