A rollover crash that injured at least two people Sunday on southbound Highway 45 in Milwaukee is no longer blocking lanes, according to a state Department of Transportation's incident alert.

Crashes were also reported earlier on Interstate 94 and Interstate 894, but both have since been cleared.

The crash on Highway 45 occurred at about noon as a severe storm system passed through the area, prompting a tornado warning that expired at 11:30 a.m. The crash was cleared around 3:15 p.m.

Two people were thrown from the vehicle and have been taken to a local hospital, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office said. Emergency responders from Wauwatosa and West Allis are on the scene.

The state Department of Transportation says the one left lanes at Burleigh St. remains blocked.
