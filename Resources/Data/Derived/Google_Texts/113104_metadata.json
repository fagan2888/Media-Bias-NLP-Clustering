Swift, HealthNow\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nHealthNow officials said they had braced themselves for a weaker financial performance in 2014 for several reasons.\n\nFor one, the Affordable Care Act brought $55 million in new taxes that boosted the company\u2019s general administrative expenses from $197.1 million in 2013 to $245.7 million in 2014, Swift said.\n\nFurther, the rising cost of prescription drugs took a toll on HealthNow\u2019s bottom line. One new drug for hepatitis C, Gilead Sciences\u2019 Sovaldi, costs $85,000 for an eight-week course of treatment.\n\nHealthNow spent $15 million in 2014 on the drug, which wasn\u2019t on the market in 2013.\n\nAnd payments from the federal government to reimburse the cost of medical, hospital and pharmacy care delivered to Medicare members, and payments from the federal and state governments to reimburse the cost of care provided to Medicaid members, did not keep up with rising expenses in those categories, he said.\n\nFor example, HealthNow paid out $740.3 million in medical costs for Medicare members but received only $731.3 million in reimbursements for that care; for Medicaid, premiums of $219.3 million slightly outpaced medical costs of $213.3 million.\n\nLast July, HealthNow announced its intention to exit the Medicaid managed care program, citing steep financial losses, before putting those plans on hold in October.\n\nSwift said the insurer remains in negotiations with another, unnamed entity to administer the program through a strategic partnership. HealthNow stopped accepting new Medicaid members but continues to serve existing members.\n\nOverall, HealthNow\u2019s premium payments fell from $2.48 billion to $2.46 billion as its enrollment fell from 457,869 to 428,856, in part because more employer clients switched to self-insurance, Swift said.\n\nTo try to turn around its finances, Swift said the insurer is looking to shift its network of hospital and physician providers from a fee-for-service model to one that pays based on outcome; is seeking further use of home health care, where appropriate; and is advocating for increased payments from state and federal governments.\n\nFor Excellus, premium payments fell to $5.94 billion, from $6.29 billion, as enrollment fell to 1.6 million, from 1.8 million, across its upstate territory, with 135,000 members in the Western New York region covered by Univera.\n\nThe insurer blamed the enrollment drop on two changes: It stopped offering Medicaid-related products in 14 counties, primarily in Central New York, where it lost 150,000 members as a result; and it lost 150,000 state-employee members who now are self-insured.\n\nA new ACA tax of $137 million drove a sharp rise in general administrative expenses for Excellus, from $472.5 million in 2013 to $570.2 million in 2014. But stronger-than-expected investment income of $115.2 million last year helped the insurer report a net income of $24.2 million.\n\nThe financial filings also disclosed payments to current and former executives for 2014.\n\nHealthNow paid $3.8 million to former CEO Alphonso O\u2019Neil-White, who had received $6.4 million in compensation, including a retirement payout, in 2013.\n\nThe insurer also paid $3.5 million last year to Cheryl A. Howe, the former executive vice president of operations, and $1.3 million to Thomas A. Fentner, its former senior vice president for human resources and administrative services.\n\nThe highest-paid current employee was Swift, who earned $1.2 million in salary and compensation tied to the company\u2019s performance in 2013. CEO David W. Anderson was paid $1.1 million under the same formula.\n\nAt Excellus, CEO Christopher C. Booth earned $1.8 million, and Dorothy A. Coleman, the chief financial officer, was paid $852,255.\n\nThe highest-ranking employee at Univera\u2019s Amherst campus, President Arthur G. Wingerter, was paid $438,996.\n\nIndependent Health of Amherst, the region\u2019s other major insurer, will file its statement at the end of the month.\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The parent companies of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York and Univera Healthcare reported operating losses for 2014 as the first year of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplaces brought shrinking revenues, declining enrollment and a higher tax burden for the comp...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "The parent companies of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York and Univera Healthcare reported operating losses for 2014 as the first year of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplaces brought shrinking revenues, declining enrollment and a higher tax burden for the comp... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Health insurers report 2014 losses  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/business/health-insurers-report-2014-losses-20150303", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20150303/BUSINESS/150309693/AR/0/AR-150309693.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s a significant slide from the $6.5 million operating loss \u2013 and $31.7 million in net income \u2013 that the Buffalo-based parent of BlueCross BlueShield had in 2013.\nBut stronger-than-expected investment income of $115.2 million last year helped the insurer report a net income of $24.2 million.\nIndependent Health of Amherst, the region\u2019s other major insurer, will file its statement at the end of the month.\nAt Excellus, CEO Christopher C.
