Hub International Continues Insurance Consolidation Streak

The company's purchase of MGA Partners gives it 16 locations in Canada

Hub International Ltd. has acquired MGA Partners Inc. on the heels of several other acquisitions.

MGA Partners, headquartered in Ontario, Canada, is a managing general agency. The company has six locations in Windsor, London, Ottawa and Font Hill, Ontario, and offices in Prince Edward Island and Halifax. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal gives Hub more than 16 locations in Canada. In July, Hub bought Gibson's Insurance Agency, a Manitoba, Canada-based insurance brokerage firm.

The company has been on a buying spree in 2014. In November, Hub picked up Fotek Insurance Agency, a New Jersey provider of employee benefits. In October, the group bought Marrs Maddocks & Associates Insurance Services Inc., which provides insurance in the San Diego Area.

Hub isn't the only insurance company contributing to industry consolidation. Confie Seguros - backed by private equity firm Abry Partners - has also been scooping up insurers, including Insurance Market Agency, Action Auto Insurance Agency and Fast Quote Insurance, which it bought in November.
