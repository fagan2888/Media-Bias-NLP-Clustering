Indeed, English folk seemed to prize the voices of its women, and to erect fewer barriers to their greatness than was the case on this side of the Atlantic.\n\nAnd yet of the great voices of early British folk, Linda Thompson\u2019s is the one that has most endured. Notwithstanding a grueling struggle with dysphonia that has slowed her output, she has just released the third album, \u201cWon\u2019t Be Long Now\u201d (on Pettifer Sounds) since her return to performing in 2002, and it brims with the same heartache, good humor and wisdom that has always characterized her work, but with an added measure of yearning and human wisdom that adheres to singers who have come back from significant reversals.\n\nIf Thompson is still remembered to some degree for the great albums she made with her former husband Richard Thompson (\u201cI Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight,\u201d et al.), \u201cWon\u2019t Be Long Now\u201d casts an eye further back at the traditional sounds that first animated the British folk scene, and even includes some of the players of that time \u2014 like Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick \u2014 as well as a helping of her extended family, including son Teddy Thompson, dauther Kami Thompson and grandson Zak Hobbs. (The album also includes one electrifying performance with Richard Thompson on the opening track, \u201cLove\u2019s For Babies and Fools.\u201d) The result is a serene and confident recording that is more about the joy of being able to make music, 40 years on, than it is about needing to prove anything otherwise.\n\nThe interview that follows was recorded in the first week of October at Teddy Thompson\u2019s apartment in downtown NYC, with grandson Zak, who tagged along and answered a few questions, the afternoon before Linda\u2019s recent appearance at the Living Room, in which Teddy and Zak (and fiddler extraordinaire Dave Mansfield) performed some of the songs from the new album. As you would imagine, Linda Thompson is funny, wise, earthy and unapologetic, all of which are apparent even in a transcript.\n\nLet\u2019s begin at the beginning. From your point of view what\u2019s different about this album, \u201cWon\u2019t Be Long,\u201d when compared to the albums of your \u201ccomeback\u201d period?\n\nI think this one\u2019s a little traddier. I wanted it to have a slightly traddier feel, and I think it has\u2026 I tend to work with more or less the same people. I\u2019m very happy with Martin Carthy I\u2019m very happy with Richard [Thompson] playing the guitar, obviously, and John Doyle. I sort of a have a rep company, and they all sort of come in. So I don\u2019t know how much different it is, but I think it is slightly more acoustic and it has slightly more family on it. Zak [Hobbs, Thompson\u2019s grandson, who plays on the album] is old enough to pay his way now.\n\nI definitely want to talk about the family aspect of the recording because it\u2019s so central to the album.\n\nIt is.\n\nDid you simply want family to play on it because you enjoy having family around, or does it amount to a sort of statement about music making generally at this point?\n\nDefinitely the former. The thing about a family singing together: it\u2019s a good sound. It\u2019s a nice, good thing to do. And I\u2019ve got three \u2013 well, Zak\u2019s my grandchild but I think of him as my kid \u2013 I\u2019ve got three musical kids, and it is a way of keeping in touch with them as well. I get to see them more often! Besides, I love Teddy\u2019s playing, and I love Kami\u2019s singing. Zak is just incredible to work with. It\u2019s incredible working with family. We sometimes have strops. Did we have any strops yesterday in the studio?\n\nZak: No, I think we were pretty good actually.\n\n\u201cStrops\u201d is the British slang for\u2026\n\nFor like, flouncing out. Like, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t work like this!\u201d But we didn\u2019t have any strops yesterday at all. Zak and I had written a song and we put it down and we were very happy with it.\n\nBut family singing is also part of British folk tradition \u2014 as with the Watersons \u2014 and of the folk tradition generally. The Carter Family\u2026\n\nYeah, you have American traditional families, as you say, the Carters, and we have all these families like the Watersons and the Copper family and all these families going back generations. I think it started when people worked together, when they worked on the land together, and started singing and started collecting songs. God knows how it\u2019s evolved to, you know, living in a high rise in New York. Teddy\u2019s not a very folk-y musician, but he still has it in him. And Zak, who is 18, I never would have thought he\u2019d really like it, but he loves it. It must be some sort of horrible genetic deficiency. [laughs]\n\nZak, you must have heard folk music your entire life because it\u2019s been around, but is it your sort of thing?\n\nZak: Well, no one thought I was musical at all. I wasn\u2019t that sort of kid. But then I went to a very musical sort of school and I thought, well I have to know an instrument. So I picked it up when I was 11. And all that music that I listened to, all that guitar-y folk-y music that I listened to, that was just what I wanted to play.\n\nLinda: As much as I tried to talk you out of it, as much as I tried to tell you you were never going to make a damn dime\u2026 you didn\u2019t listen!\n\nIs family singing effective because of some spooky ESP-like ability to phrase well together, or is it because you share a certain timbre?\n\nThese are all terrific questions\u2026 I think its all timbre. Because in my family, we all phrase things pretty differently. You know, it\u2019s called \u201cblood singing\u201d when family sings together. And it sounds like blood singing, it sounds like these people are connected. You can listen to people who aren\u2019t related and they sound wonderful, but never quite as good as the Carter family. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s something there. Like Ralph Stanley and his family, and I think you\u2019ve hit it on the head, I think it\u2019s just the timbre.\n\nThe harmony arrangements on this record are really extraordinary; there are a couple of those wall-of-backing vocals moments . . .\n\nWell, that would be Teddy mostly. Teddy arranged the backing vocals. Except on \u201cMr. Tam.\u201d That was me and Eliza Carthy just working out, you know, not quite as refined as Teddy\u2019s backing vocals, just kind of belting it out.\n\nIs that an inclination that comes naturally to you, to arrange vocals with such precision?\n\nYeah, I think it comes quite naturally to me. I think in fact when I first started \u2013 Emmylou [Harris] and I have talked about this a lot, Emmylou loves singing harmonies, everybody knows, and I do too, and really I preferred singing harmony. But Richard said I had to sing the lead. He said your voice is more suited. But I like harmony, I don\u2019t quite have the harmonic ability that I did, but it\u2019s nice to be able to say to the kids, \u201cCould you go up there?\u201d I like doing that.\n\nSo Kami sings lead on the Anna McGarrigle song. And how did that come about?\n\nI didn\u2019t want to do it! We had done it live, in a tribute to Kate McGarrigle, and Kami had sung the lead, and I was so happy doing the harmony, and it\u2019s a very high harmony that I\u2019m singing, and it was very relaxing, I could sing it in my head, so you\u2019re up here [sings a note] and you\u2019re not in your throat [sings a note], and it was just a joy for me to sing the harmonies. In fact I\u2019ve been lobbying with my producer for years saying, let\u2019s get Tom Waits in to sing the lead and I\u2019ll sing the harmony. And the record company and the producer are saying, No no no, you have to sing your own lead vocals. But I\u2019ve made a big step on this record; I\u2019ve managed to get someone else to sing one of them. She sings it well.\n\nGetting ready to do the record did you have material piled up that you wanted to record?\n\nYou know, we did actually have a bit of a stockpile. Because of what happened last time we were making a record, we over-recorded a little bit, and I said let\u2019s leave off that trad stuff, and the next time we do a record, let\u2019s try and make it more that way focused. So I think we may have had five or six. When you\u2019ve got that many, even four, you feel as if you\u2019re halfway there. So we had a direction and the bones of some things. I mean, \u201cNever the Bride\u201d was completely recorded for the last record but we never put it on.\n\nDid you tinker with it?\n\nOh, we didn\u2019t touch it.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cLove\u2019s For Babies and Fools,\u201d is the track with Richard Thompson. And it\u2019s really striking, overpowering even. It showcases the sound you\u2019re going for, just one guitar, no overdubs. How many takes does something like that require these days?\n\nOh we just banged it out. It\u2019s so \u2026 visceral. We don\u2019t play together very often, so when we do, there\u2019s some kind of race memory there. Whenever I write something like that I think, Oh, who could play the guitar on that? And then I think, Only Richard, really. He loved the song, and that was nice, that was gratifying for me. I wrote it about Rufus Wainwright and I played it for Kate [McGarrigle] and she said, I love it, you\u2019ve got to finish it. So I did finish it, and Richard played on it, and I was happy with the results.\n\nYou wrote it for Rufus? Or about Rufus?\n\nNo, no, about rather than for. I wrote it about it him. I\u2019d love it if he sung it one day, that would be amazing. It was just a tale of a young man, starting out in life and Rufus is, as you know, a supremely talented being, and you know, those people are difficult, there\u2019s ups and downs . . . I hope he likes it. He hasn\u2019t heard it yet, so\u2026\n\nSuch an incredible lyric, such a very moving lyric. From my point of view, I think it\u2019s slightly risky to make it the opening track. It\u2019s emotionally demanding, but I like that.\n\nWell, I\u2019m glad you like it, but there\u2019s no risk involved, because there\u2019s no record industry, there\u2019s nothing, so that was the tone I wanted to set, and not only do I know my audience, I know most of them friggin\u2019 personally. It\u2019s not depressing, it\u2019s art. Good art just can\u2019t be depressing. I just thought that was a good opening tone for the album, and I just thought it was strong. I hope it was the right move; we\u2019ll see.\n\nHow do you write a song like that?\n\nThat happened very quickly. I\u2019d actually started writing it a long time ago. Rufus and Teddy are great friends. They were all living in New York. Rufus and Teddy. And Martha, too. They\u2019re all great friends and very good musicians and they were in their twenties at the time, and it was a sort of a dog-eat-dog kind of world. And you know, Rufus was par-taying. He was young, and he\u2019d signed a big record deal, and it was party time.\n\nAnd you know how that\u2019s fun for a while, but even he, towards the end of his twenties, he thought, You know, this really is boring. And it is boring. And sometimes people think that when they\u2019re young, they think I can do what I like \u2013 what\u2019s love, love is for babies. He\u2019s very different now; he\u2019s a happily married man. That came incredibly quickly, that song.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever have put it out if Kate hadn\u2019t come to stay with me in London. And I said, This is about Rufus. And the great thing about the Wainwrights and the McGarrigles is that you could write something about them\u2026 \u201cMartha is a hooker, Rufus is a son of a bitch\u2026\u201d and if it\u2019s a good song, they\u2019ll go, Ah, fantastic. And I feel the same about certain songs that Richard wrote about me. People would ask me, aren\u2019t you mortified, and I\u2019d go, Are you kidding me, that\u2019s a great song! So, I may never have finished it without Kate, God rest her soul.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon exclusive: A legend on losing her voice, those amazing Richard Thompson albums and her brilliant new CD", "title": "Linda Thompson: Good art can\u2019t be depressing!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon exclusive: A legend on losing her voice, those amazing Richard Thompson albums and her brilliant new CD", "title": "Linda Thompson: Good art can\u2019t be depressing!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/27/linda_thompson_good_art_cant_be_depressing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/linda_thompson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon exclusive: A legend on losing her voice, those amazing Richard Thompson albums and her brilliant new CD", "title": "Linda Thompson: Good art can\u2019t be depressing!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/linda_thompson.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rick Moody", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Eliza Carthy, Kate McGarrigle, Linda Thompson, Music, Richard Thompson, Teddy Thompson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, Eliza Carthy, Kate McGarrigle, Linda Thompson, Music, Richard Thompson, Teddy Thompson, Entertainment NewsUnlike its American counterpart, the British folk scene of the middle and late sixties was noteworthy for its profusion of great female voices: Sandy Denny, Maddy Prior, Shirley Collins, Jacqui McShee.\nI\u2019m very happy with Martin Carthy I\u2019m very happy with Richard [Thompson] playing the guitar, obviously, and John Doyle.\nIf Thompson is still remembered to some degree for the great albums she made with her former husband Richard Thompson (\u201cI Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight,\u201d et al.\nBut family singing is also part of British folk tradition \u2014 as with the Watersons \u2014 and of the folk tradition generally.\nThe opening track, \u201cLove\u2019s For Babies and Fools,\u201d is the track with Richard Thompson."}
