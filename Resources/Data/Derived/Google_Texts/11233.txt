If you're looking for a place to spend your golden years and keep money in your pocket, South Dakota is a good option.

According to a report from GOBankingRates, South Dakota ranks 7th in the best 10 states to retire rich in the United States based on its low tax rates.

New Hampshire topped the list based on its absence of sales, estate, inheritance or Social Security income taxes. Delaware and Idaho round out the top 3.

New York tops the list as the worst state to retire rich, claiming some of the highest healthcare premiums in the country. New Jersey and Massachusetts are in the top 10 worst states for the same reason.
