Louisiana Sen. Mary L. Landrieu launched the first TV ad of her re-election campaign on Wednesday, highlighting her bill that would allow individual health care plan holders to keep their insurance under Obamacare.

The ad is an effort to defend the third-term Democrat from GOP attacks over the president's health care law that have already hit the Bayou State airwaves â€” with more sure to come.

"Thousands of Louisianians and millions of Americans that carried individual policies will now have an opportunity to keep those health care plans," Landrieu campaign manager Adam Sullivan said in a statement. "The President made a promise, and Sen. Landrieu is working to make sure it is kept and will continue her legislative efforts to fix and improve the Affordable Care Act."

According to a release, the ad, backed by a $250,000 buy, will air in the Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Alexandria, Shreveport and Monroe media markets.
