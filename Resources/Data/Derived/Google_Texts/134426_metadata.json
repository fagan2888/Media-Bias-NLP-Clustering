Additionally, 70% of employers expect their budgets for benefit plans to increase, as human capital and health and productivity remain key issues for businesses to manage.\n\nHalf of the employers in the study said they will continue to make changes to their plans either this year or in 2017 by adding a high deductible plan option (52%), increasing the employee contribution percentage (56%), or increasing co-insurance features (55%). Employers are also making strategic changes to plans that address not only the physical well-being of their employees, but also chronic condition management and mental, financial, and social well-being.\n\nFor example, as more employers offer high deductible health plans, the C-suite is also aware of the financial exposure that employees face with these types of plans. As a result, they are looking to mitigate those costs by offering voluntary benefits solutions (e.g. critical illness and accident insurance). In addition, employers of all sizes are seeking ways to encourage a healthier and more productive workforce.
