Kick-scooter fans attempt to break world record in Batavia

hello

With spirits as bright as their raincoats, about 175 kick-scooter enthusiasts 10 and older took to the Fox River Trail in Batavia Saturday morning in an attempt to break a world record.

Organized by Batavian Randy Simonian, the goal was to become a new entry in "Guinness World Records" by beating the kick-scooter parade record of 490 people set in December 2013 in New Plymouth, Taranaki, New Zealand.

While they fell short of the goal, that didn't phase Simonian.

"I'm feeling good that we really had this many considering this lousy day," he said.

The event raised money for CHIP-IN Batavia, he said, which provides help to low-income and homeless students in the Batavia school district, and to a Batavia United Way Chapter. The groups received the kick-scooter entry fee of $5. "That's what it's all about," he said.

Despite the rain and the chill, "the energy is really, really good," he said. "People are enjoying it; I think it's a great thing for the community and for the people who need the money."

Wearing a red raincoat and earmuffs, Kendall Knecht, 10, of Batavia said she came because she wanted to be a part of the community and just have fun. Donna Downing-Schneider of Batavia said she participated "because I think it's great somebody like Randy takes the initiative to get people together." She added that at age 70, she likely was the oldest to participate. She borrowed a neighbor's scooter that had been in storage, cleaned it up and practiced on sidewalks in her neighborhood.

Will Simonian try it again?

"I'm going to rethink any world record that has to do with weather. There's so many that can be broken and I like doing it for the community ... so we can find something that's a little bit easier to break now that I've kind of learned my lesson with the bad weather. We'll give it a whirl again -- we'll see!"
