(Photo: TANYA BREEN/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)Buy Photo\n\nLast Christmas, David Dixon spent the holiday living in the woods.\n\nThis year, the Sayreville native planned to cook a ham and serve it to his mother inside his Berkeley apartment.\n\n\"Ahh, I ate too much,\" Dixon recalls his mother saying last month on Thanksgiving, after he served her turkey, mashed potatoes, collard greens, stuffing and other trimmings. \"I told her, 'Ma, that's how you're supposed to feel during the holidays.' \"\n\nBut by next Christmas, Dixon fears he will be living outside again.\n\n\"I don't know what's coming around the corner,\" said Dixon, 52, as one of his three cats stretched her legs after emerging from under his couch. \"I'm just trying to appreciate what I have for the time being.\"\n\nDixon is one of dozens of people who were living until recent months in Lakewood's Tent City \u2014 a homeless camp in the woods that the township emptied out this summer.\n\nBuy Photo David Dixon, 52, who lived in Lakewood\u2019s Tent City for three years, now has an apartment in Berkeley.

You're running out of time.' \"\n\nProblems remain\n\nWhile moving people out of Tent City's woods and into actual dwellings was a blessing, advocating for the rights and the needs of the homeless in Ocean County has been more challenging now that the camp is shuttered, said Paul Hulse, outreach director of nonprofit HAVEN Inc.\n\n\"There's a sense that now that Tent City is gone, the homeless are gone as well,\" Hulse said. \"Believe me, nothing could be further from the truth.\"\n\nMany homeless are now living in smaller camps in the woods of Ocean County, trying to minimize their numbers so as to not attract attention from the police, Hulse said. Others are living inside vehicles or are trying not to overextend their welcomes at the homes of friends or relatives, he said.\n\nBrigham said he splits his time between a small camp near the border of Lakewood and Howell that existed before this summer and a mattress that he has set up inside a vehicle.\n\n\"I'm trying to minimize my overhead costs as I determine my next move,\" said Brigham, noting that his only fixed monthly costs are his car insurance and cellphone bills.\n\nOn Christmas, Brigham said he planned to hold a small dinner and perhaps a religious service at the camp, which he said has five or fewer people.\n\nBrigham organized Tent City for over seven years. The camp drew homeless from throughout the country, attracted a filmmaker, and even had a website.\n\nLakewood's attempts to shutter Tent City ended up in court, costing taxpayers at least $400,000, Deputy Mayor Albert Akerman has said.\n\nAkerman, who oversaw Lakewood's response to Tent City and has estimated that the final bill may add up to over $600,000, could not be reached for comment.\n\nJeffrey Wild, a Roseland lawyer who represents those who were relocated out of Tent City, said he, township officials, McNeil and other advocates involved with Tent City meet regularly to monitor the progress of those who were placed this year.\n\n\"Sixty to 70 people are currently in housing because of this unprecedented effort,\" Wild said. \"The people who need help will get it.\"\n\nOf the 125 who were counted in the census, some are currently unaccounted for and so have not been placed, while others died or accepted \"buyout\" checks of up to $4,000, McNeil said.\n\nVariety of issues\n\nGenerally, those with fewer personal issues to overcome agreed to be placed first, while those battling more complicated hardships \u2014 combinations of mental illness, substance abuse issues and poor employment and education skills \u2014 waited until the last moment, McNeil said.\n\nThe camp was officially shuttered on June 26. Brigham was allowed to stay for an additional week, until sundown on July 3.\n\nThe general order of the placement means that those with the greater issues to overcome currently have the most time to look forward to a roof over their heads, McNeil said.\n\n\"For some people, we've had to do practically everything,\" McNeil said. \"We've tried to avoid it, ... it doesn't give them much of an incentive to go out and do something.\"\n\nDixon said he has tried to find a job amongst the retail outlets along Route 9, but has not gotten callbacks. The jobs Dixon could do were limited several years ago, he said, after he suffered a back injury while in a car accident.\n\nMore recently, Dixon said he has been able to do even less because he broke his thumb while wrestling with a friend.\n\n\"I must've heard people tell me, 'I'll call you,' a thousand times,\" Dixon said.\n\nDixon does not miss Tent City. The challenges of living in the woods were nothing compared to living amongst a large group of people with mental health and substance abuse issues, he said.\n\n\"Me and a couple of other guys, we tried to band together, insulate ourselves from the crazies,\" Dixon said. \"You never knew what was going to happen out there.\"\n\nCurrently, Dixon shares his apartment in the Bayville section of Berkeley with another former Tent City resident. Across the parking lot of the apartment complex lives a third person who also used to live at the camp, he said.\n\nThe strong scent of stale cigarette smoke hits the nose upon entering his apartment, which is furnished with used sofas and wood tables that have seen better days.\n\nBut there is no clutter to the place. It has a sparkling Christmas tree and a television hooked up with cable channels. Dixon, who loves to cook, proudly showed off his refrigerator, which was stuffed recently with food waiting to be prepared and eaten.\n\n\"If I got it, I'm going to give it to you,\" said Dixon, who sets his culinary boundaries around only one item. \"Anything but liver. Absolutely no liver in this house.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/16QTZxo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tent City's former residents are indoors this holiday season.
