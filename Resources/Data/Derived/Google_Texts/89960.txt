"I'm not guilty. I didn't shoot nobody," shooting suspect Marquez Green says as he is taken into the Lauderdale County Detention Facility Saturday afternoon.

Green has been arrested for shooting a 21-year-old man. Detective Dareall Thompson says with help from the community patrol officers were able to capture Green not long after the shooting happened.

It all went down around 5:45 Friday afternoon. Police received a 911 call about someone being shot at Valley View apartments on 5th St. when emergency personnel arrived on scene they discovered a black male had been shot. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Marquez Green didn't have much to say as he was being transported to the county jail. He denied any involvement in the shooting death of the 21-year-old saying he is not guilty.
