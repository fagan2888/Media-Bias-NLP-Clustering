The Zimbabwean government accused American dentist Walter Palmer of luring the lion out of a protected national park to shoot him, but Palmer blames the misunderstanding on his guides.\n\nThe senators asked the Airlines for America and International Air Transport Association for a list of their members\u2019 policies regarding hunting trophies.\n\nThey also demanded the airline industry prohibit the transportation of hunting trophies.\n\n\u201cAs long as even one carrier will transport trophies into the United States, these individuals have a way to bring their ill-gotten goods home for display,\u201d the senators said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sens.
