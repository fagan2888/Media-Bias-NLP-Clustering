Especially when the free-for-all goes into overtime.\n\nMake that, double overtime.\n\nColorado got a school-record 521 yards of total offense and seven touchdown passes from sophomore quarterback Sefo Liufau, including three to Nelson Spruce, but Liufau was stopped on a fourth-down keeper on a busted play from the 1-yard-line in the second overtime Saturday and California rallied from a halftime deficit for a 59-56 victory.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on the losing team, it\u2019s gut wrenching,\u201d Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre said.\n\nBoth teams scored on touchdown passes in the first overtime. Colorado had the ball first in the second overtime. After the Buffs failed to score, California only needed a field goal for the victory and got it \u2014 a 34-yard field goal by James Langford.\n\nColorado\u2019s last play was not intended to be a carry by Liufau. Evidently, the play was designed for Liufau to pitch the ball to running back Tony Jones.\n\n\u201cThere was a miscommunication,\u201d said Spruce, who set a school record with 19 catches, breaking his former mark of 13 a week earlier against Hawaii. \u201cSefo was supposed to flip it to one of our backs.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre said \u201cthat play didn\u2019t cost us the game. We just didn\u2019t make a few plays in regulation.\u201d\n\nA Memorial Stadium crowd of 39,821 watched California (2-2, 1-1 Pac-12) win its first Pac-12 game under second-year coach Sonny Dykes. This was the highest-scoring game in Cal history.\n\nIt also prevented Colorado (2-3, 0-2) from claiming its first Pac-12 road win under MacIntyre, who also is in his second year in the league.\n\nCalifornia sophomore quarterback Jared Goff also passed for seven touchdowns and matched Liufau\u2019s total of 449 passing yards. Following an interception by linebacker Jake Kearney, Goff hit Chris Harper for a 40-yard TD with 2:29 remaining in regulation to put the Golden Bears up 49-42.\n\nBut Liufau marched the Buffaloes down the field and hit Bryce Bobo for a 30-yard touchdown with 21 seconds remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime.\n\n\u201cI was just mentally focused to go down and score,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d given the game away (with the interception). I had to right the wrong.\u201d\n\nColorado twice led by 14 points before halftime but couldn\u2019t build on its early lead and California dominated the third quarter to catch up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably up there with the craziest game I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d Cal\u2019s Goff said.\n\nUsually dependable senior kicker Will Oliver missed three field-goal attempts for the Buffaloes. Langford missed a 42-yarder with 7:21 remaining that could have broken a 35-35 tie.\n\n\u201cMy teammates told me they completely support me,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThat made it hurt worse.\u201d\n\nColorado jumped to a 21-7 lead, but California\u2019s offense is too explosive to keep down for long. The Golden Bears cut the deficit to a touchdown with the longest touchdown pass play in school history \u2014 a 92-yarder from Goff to fleet running back Daniel Lasco down the left sideline and along the California bench.\n\nColorado\u2019s defense got sloppy on the play, which appeared to be a short gain. But three Buffs defenders overran the play, and then two others missed tackles for an improbable breakaway play.\n\nThe Buffs finished the first half without two key starters who went out with injuries. Sophomore safety Tedric Thompson, who set up Colorado\u2019s first score with an interception, injured some ribs and was replaced by Marques Mosley. And sophomore linebacker Kenneth Olugbode hurt a shoulder and was replaced by Ryan Severson.\n\nOlugbode returned for the second half but the Buffs felt the absence of Thompson.\n\n\u201cWe just have to learn to finish (games),\u201d CU defensive back John Walker said.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nGame balls\n\nSefo Liufau, Colorado, QB: Set CU single-game records with seven TD passes and 521 yards of total offense.\n\nNelson Spruce, CU, WR: Broke his own school record with 19 catches.\n\nJared Goff, California, QB: Matched Liufau with seven TDs, 449 yards passing.\n\nTom Kensler, The Denver Post\n\nRecord-setting day\n\nCU set numerous school records Saturday against California, including:\n\n521 yards of total offense for a game by QB Sefo Liufau with 449 passing, 72 rushing.\n\n7 touchdown passes in a game by Liufau.\n\n19 catches in a game by WR Nelson Spruce, breaking his single-game record of 13 set a week earlier against Hawaii.\n\n46 completions and 67 pass attempts by Liufau.\n\n7 straight games with at least one TD catch by Spruce.\n\n56 points in a loss.\n\nSource: CU sports information office", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs lose in wild double-OT thriller at Cal Bears", "title": "CU Buffs lose in wild double-OT thriller at Cal Bears", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/cu-buffs-lose-in-wild-double-ot-thriller-at-cal-bears/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927_052058_christian-powell.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927_052058_christian-powell.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T18:26:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:20:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1023\"", "article_summary": "Jared Goff, California, QB: Matched Liufau with seven TDs, 449 yards passing.\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkenslerGame ballsSefo Liufau, Colorado, QB: Set CU single-game records with seven TD passes and 521 yards of total offense.\n19 catches in a game by WR Nelson Spruce, breaking his single-game record of 13 set a week earlier against Hawaii.\nCalifornia sophomore quarterback Jared Goff also passed for seven touchdowns and matched Liufau\u2019s total of 449 passing yards.\nBut three Buffs defenders overran the play, and then two others missed tackles for an improbable breakaway play."}
