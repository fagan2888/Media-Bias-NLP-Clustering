He was a six-year veteran of the police department of the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. The father of two, he was married to his wife, Rachel, for 17 years.\n\nHe responded to calls about an active shooter about 11:50 a.m. Friday. According to reports, he raced 10 miles to the clinic after the call came in. He was one of the first responders on the scene.\n\nRobert Lewis Dear, 57, is accused of storming the clinic and opening fire, killing Swasey and two others and wounding nine before a lengthy standoff with police. Dear surrendered hours later.\n\nThe two others who died were Ke\u2019Arre Stewart, 29, an Iraq war veteran, and Jennifer Markovsky, 35, a mother of two. Both were accompanying friends to the clinic at the time of the shooting.\n\nKurt Aichele, one of Swasey\u2019s close friends and another co-pastor at Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs, told The New York Times that Friday\u2019s shooting was not the first time Swasey responded to a high-risk call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time that he\u2019s been placed in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Aichele said.\n\nAlthough Swasey disagreed with \u201cthe abortion industry,\u201d Aichele said, his personal views would not have dissuaded him from responding to the dangerous situation.\n\n\u201cHe was there to save lives. That\u2019s the kind of guy he is,\u201d Aichele said.\n\nTributes to Swasey poured in over the weekend as friends, family, and fellow churchgoers celebrated his selflessness and enthusiasm for life at multiple memorial services.\n\nJason Churchill, who attended a service Sunday in honor of Swasey at Hope Chapel, told CNN affiliate KCNC that if Dear \u201cwere to repent and believe \u2026 Garrett would be the first one to greet him as he came into heaven, because Garrett believed in forgiveness.\u201d\n\nSwasey\u2019s sister, Kimberly Swasey Noveletsky, wrote of her fallen brother on Facebook: \u201cMy brother was a hero in every sense of the word. He showed the world what kind of man he was yesterday when he made the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Rachel Swasey released a statement calling her husband \u201cdevoted\u201d and a \u201cwonderful father\u201d to their 11-year-old son Elijah and 6-year-old daughter Faith.\n\nAn online fundraiser set up for Swasey\u2019s children so far has raised over $100,000.\n\nA tribute to Swasey on the website for Hope Chapel, where Swasey was a member since 2001, reads:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Garrett Swasey, the police officer killed in a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic shooting, was a devout Christian who \u201cwas there to save lives.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Garrett Swasey, the police officer killed in a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic shooting, was a devout Christian who \u201cwas there to save lives.\u201d", "title": "Cop, Pastor Victim of Planned Parenthood Shooting", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/swasey2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-01T13:13:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NjacsC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Garrett Swasey, the police officer killed in a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic shooting, was a devout Christian who \u201cwas there to save lives.\u201d", "title": "Cop, Pastor Victim of Planned Parenthood Shooting", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/swasey2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "civil society", "published_time": "2015-11-30T17:30:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T13:13:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Garrett Swasey, police officer, Planned Parenthood shooting, Colorado, Colorado Springs"}, "article_summary": "He was a six-year veteran of the police department of the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.\nA tribute to Swasey on the website for Hope Chapel, where Swasey was a member since 2001, reads:\nGarrett Swasey, the 44-year-old police officer killed Friday in a shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic, also was a devout Christian pastor who \u201cbelieved in forgiveness\u201d and \u201cwas there to save lives,\u201d those who knew him say.\nKurt Aichele, one of Swasey\u2019s close friends and another co-pastor at Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs, told The New York Times that Friday\u2019s shooting was not the first time Swasey responded to a high-risk call.\nAlthough Swasey disagreed with \u201cthe abortion industry,\u201d Aichele said, his personal views would not have dissuaded him from responding to the dangerous situation."}
