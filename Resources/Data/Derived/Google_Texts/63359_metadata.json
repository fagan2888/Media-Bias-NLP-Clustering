In a city that\u2019s home to international institutions including the European Union and NATO, they came from Belgium and around the world. Among the confirmed dead:\n\n___\n\nPatricia Rizzo\u2019s family hails from a tiny town in Sicily, but she was as broadly European as they come.\n\nBorn in Belgium to a family originally from Calascibetta, near Enna, Sicily, Rizzo graduated from a Belgian university and worked for several Belgian companies as an executive secretary before joining European institutions in 1995.\n\nThe Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed Friday that Rizzo, 48, was among the dead from the attack on the Brussels subway at Maelbeek.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Patricia is no longer with us,\u201d a man who identified himself as Rizzo\u2019s cousin, Massimo Leonora, wrote on Facebook. His final post capped days of anxious updates recounting his search of Brussels hospitals in hopes that Rizzo might have been among the injured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but at least now we\u2019re beyond this unending race against time to find you.\u201d\n\nRizzo moved back to Italy from 2003 to 2008 to work as the assistant to the executive director of the European Food Safety Authority.\n\nIn 2008, she was named human resources assistant for the EU\u2019s education and culture agency in Brussels and for the past five months had worked in the human resources department of the European Research Council.\n\n\u201cAfter a few days of excruciating waiting and angst, our worst fears have been confirmed,\u201d the ERC\u2019s executive leadership said Saturday, praising Rizzo\u2019s energy, attitude and spirit.\n\nThe Research Council said Rizzo is survived by a son and her parents.\n\n___\n\nJennifer Scintu Waetzmann was a coach for a youth handball club in Aachen, Germany.\n\nHer uncle, Claudio Scinto, told the German newspaper Bild that she and her husband were checking in at the American Airlines counter at Brussels Airport Tuesday morning when the first extremist bomb exploded. He told the newspaper they were going on a belated honeymoon to New York.\n\nThe blasts killed her and left her husband, Lars Waetzmann, among the 270 wounded in Brussels on Tuesday.\n\nHer final post on Facebook came right after the November extremist assaults on Paris. It said: \u201cPray for Paris.\u201d Other pictures show her and her husband in romantic seaside settings with the inscription: \u201cLove of my life.\u201d\n\nGerman Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Friday his thoughts are with Waetzmann\u2019s family and vowed Germany \u201cwill not rest until the murderers and those who aided them are held responsible.\u201d\n\n___\n\nElita Borbor Weah, who was heading to Rhode Island for her stepfather\u2019s funeral, had texted family members a photo of herself Tuesday at Brussels Airport.\n\nA short time later, two suicide bombers struck the airport, leaving Weah among their victims.\n\nThe 40-year-old had been living in the Netherlands with her 13-year-old daughter after her extended family from Liberia had dispersed across West Africa, Europe and the United States following Liberia\u2019s civil wars.\n\nHer brother Oscar Weah, of Providence, Rhode Island, was shaking and in tears Friday as he described how his older sister helped care for him over the years. Other relatives also sang her praises.\n\n\u201cShe had a good heart,\u201d said 14-year-old niece Eden Weah. \u201cShe was always worried about everybody.\u201d\n\nNow, in addition to holding a funeral for her 87-year-old stepfather, the family was making arrangements to care for her teenage daughter.\n\n___\n\nDavid Dixon had texted family members to say he was safe after two bombs severely damaged Brussels airport, but he was killed shortly after when a bomber attacked the subway system.\n\nDixon, 53, a British citizen, was working as a computer programmer at the time of his death, which was confirmed Friday by Britain\u2019s Foreign Office.\n\nFriends and family had been searching for him since he failed to arrive at work Tuesday morning in the hours after the bomb attacks. Press reports indicated he lived in Brussels with his partner and their son.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brussels attack victims came from Belgium and around world", "title": "Brussels attack victims came from Belgium and around world", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brussels attack victims came from Belgium and around world", "title": "Brussels attack victims came from Belgium and around world", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/26/brussels_attack_victims_came_from_belgium_and_around_world_2/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/belgium-attacks.jpeg44-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brussels attack victims came from Belgium and around world", "title": "Brussels attack victims came from Belgium and around world", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/belgium-attacks.jpeg44-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nicole Winfield and Gregory Katz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed Friday that Rizzo, 48, was among the dead from the attack on the Brussels subway at Maelbeek.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsROME (AP) \u2014 Victims of the attacks on Brussels\u2019 airport and subway included commuters heading to work and travelers setting off on long-anticipated vacations.\nIn a city that\u2019s home to international institutions including the European Union and NATO, they came from Belgium and around the world.\nAmong the confirmed dead:___Patricia Rizzo\u2019s family hails from a tiny town in Sicily, but she was as broadly European as they come.\nHer uncle, Claudio Scinto, told the German newspaper Bild that she and her husband were checking in at the American Airlines counter at Brussels Airport Tuesday morning when the first extremist bomb exploded."}
