Some parents are instead giving baby disc jockey classes a spin.\n\nThe tots are experimenting with turntables and DJ equipment to electronic music and techno at Baby DJ School in Brooklyn, a new program developed by composer and performing artist Natalie Elizabeth Weiss.\n\n\u201cThe midi-trigger\u2019s connected to the laptop, the laptop\u2019s connected to the PA,\u201d Ms. Weiss crooned in a sing-songy voice to the tune of \u201cDem Bones\u201d this week. It was the first session of the class\u2013which has garnered some national attention \u2013 even before a single class had taken place \u2013 as an example of Brooklyn being almost too cool for itself.\n\nSix children, ages nine to 20 months, along with their parents and caregivers, sat, crawled, and walked as Ms. Weiss went over the basics of DJing.\n\nMs. Weiss, 31 years old, has taught classes for children at the School of Rock in Manhattan, but she had never worked with infants. One night she took her DJ equipment to a friend\u2019s house and watched as the friend\u2019s baby began to express interest in the machines. Soon, she began writing original songs that would teach kids about DJing and electronic music.\n\n\u201cI enjoy teaching kids because there\u2019s a lot of joy and no judgment,\u201d Ms. Weiss said, comparing it to her experience in the \u201clow key\u201d indie rock scene. Though she originally was wary of electronic dance music (EDM) and its stereotypical drugs-and-partying culture, she met some EDM musicians and began to understand their work. \u201cIt\u2019s intense, but it\u2019s not scary,\u201d she said.\n\nThe class took place in Cool Pony, a Crown Heights store that opened in March whose co-owners, Ari Ben Eli and Craig Judelman, met while volunteering with superstorm Sandy relief efforts. They hatched the idea of a vintage store (they sell clothes, records, and books) that could also hold events, and Baby DJ School is their first series. Mr. Judelman, who lives down the street, wanted to open something in his neighborhood that would appeal to locals, as well as the nearby Park Slope stroller set.\n\nKeith Bedford for The Wall Street Journal Natalie Elizabeth Weiss shows infants Julien Al-Fayez, right, and Liam Goldsmith, left, DJ equipment.\n\nMs. Weiss and the store owners realized they opened themselves up to Brooklyn hipster backlash with the classes. But Ms. Weiss points out that children are often interested in both music and electronics young\u2013while Ms. BENEli\u2019s main concerns was whether the class schedule would work around nap times.\n\nAnd to be sure, the children at the first class certainly weren\u2019t scratching or mixing beats in any way recognizable to fans to hip hop and house music. But some were eager to push buttons and play with the equipment. The kids were exposed to the terminology \u2013 master, beat matching \u2014 and eagerly bopping to the tunes.\n\nParents were just as excited about the music\u2013a far cry from dull lullabies\u2013as their kids. Samantha Al-Fayez beamed as her one-year-old son, Julien, eagerly danced and pressed buttons on the DJ console. \u201cHe loves gangsta rap,\u201d she explained. He joined in as Ms. Weiss led the students in a round of the ABC Song set to a gentle techno beat.\n\nAudrey Beerman, who took her son, Ari, to the class, said that most of the baby programs that she\u2019d participated in were \u201cso boring,\u201d which is why the DJing class seemed promising. \u201cI think anything that gets kids loving music early is great,\u201d she said.\n\nKeith Bedford for The Wall Street Journal Samanthat Al-Fayez puts headphones on her son Julien during the class.\n\nMs. Weiss refuses to use any music with profanity or sexism in her DJing work, and that ethos stuck for the class, with kids dancing around to The Jackson Five\u2019s \u201cI Want You Back\u201d and The Emotions\u2019 \u201cBest Of My Love.\u201d She watched as the one girl in the class \u2013 who was there with her father \u2013 began to sway with the music. \u201cGirls learn those lessons early, and it\u2019s important for them to hear this,\u201d Ms. Weiss said.\n\nAlthough some parents were initially skeptical about introducing babies to electronic music, others pointed out that their kids became comfortable with technology early. (\u201cThey already love Mommy\u2019s iPad,\u201d Ms. Weiss explained.) Though there was a record player next to the DJ console, most of the babies were more interested in playing with the records than actually playing them.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t only the kids who were glued to their gadgets \u2013 shortly after returning home from class, Ms. Beerman posted a photo of her son in his DJ headphones to her Facebook page.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Mommy and baby yoga, music and sign language classes are apparently so over.
