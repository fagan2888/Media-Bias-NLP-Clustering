Jim Tomes, R-Wadesville, has proposed a bill that would make it a Class A misdemeanor \u2014 punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of as much as $5,000 \u2014 for a transgender person to enter a public bathroom that does not conform to their gender at birth.\n\nLONG-TERM ROADS FUNDING: Among other provisions, the measure sponsored by Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, would charge a $1 \u201cuser fee\u201d per pack of cigarettes and allow the state\u2019s gas tax to keep pace with inflation. The state\u2019s gas tax has not been increased in over a decade, while the amount collected has plummeted due to more fuel-efficient cars.\n\nPharmacist Dick Dovidas talked to a customer in 2014 at the Blue River Pharmacy in Shelbyville, where Dovidas said he kept careful control over pseudoephedrine sales.

Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, would require a prescription to purchase cold medicine that contains pseudoephedrine \u2014 an ingredient used to make methamphetamine.\n\nFOUR WORDS AND A COMMA: \u201cGender identity, sexual orientation\u201d would be the four words added to Indiana\u2019s anti-discrimination law under a measure proposed by Sen. Tim Lanane, D-Anderson. His approach is preferred by LGBT rights supporters, including much of the business community, because it does not offer religious exemptions.\n\nSupporters cheer during the Freedom Indiana rally at the Statehouse, Tuesday, November 17, 2015.

Instead, the bill by Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, includes significant exemptions for small businesses and religious institutions that object to working with gay people. Still, Republican Senate President Pro Tem David Long has said that the bill is a good \u201cfirst attempt\u201d at bridging the gap between LGBT rights supporters and religious opponents.\n\nPENCE\u2019S ROADS PLAN: Gov. Mike Pence unveiled his \u201c21st Century Crossroads Plan\u201d in October, which would boost state spending on highways in 2017 by roughly $481 million. Pence spokesman Matt Lloyd says legislation that includes that plan will be sponsored by Sen. Carlin Yoder, R-Middlebury.\n\nISTEP reminders are posted on a middle school bulletin board.

Teachers\u2019 merit pay is tied to those scores, which have yet to be released as a result of glitches by the testing vendor.\n\nTEACHER SHORTAGE: One idea to alleviate the shortage, which was suggested by GOP House Speaker Brian Bosma, would create a free-ride college scholarship for students who agree to teach in Indiana schools for at least five years.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1R5qzjP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Proposals addressing everything from civil rights protections for LGBT people to requiring a prescription for a common cold medicine.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Proposals addressing everything from civil rights protections for LGBT people to requiring a prescription for a common cold medicine.", "title": "8 bills proposed for Indiana's legislature in 2016", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2016/01/03/8-bills-proposed-indianas-legislature-2016/78230476/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Proposals addressing everything from civil rights protections for LGBT people to requiring a prescription for a common cold medicine.", "title": "8 bills proposed for Indiana's legislature in 2016", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f4c4c5e32e3d058ed41b17b5f3c446bb0d63f91/c=652-0-3363-2711&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "8 bills proposed for Indiana's legislature in 2016", "author": "The Associated Press", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5a1172f45acaa0ea90cdcaee5f49893ebb6bedf/c=991-0-3024-2711/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f3b9c66918b2de1394ee02f40f7a91f91e632a10/c=652-0-3363-2711/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5c5905fd2fc50c49c61acee7138970f48cfd2a8/c=205-0-3811-2711/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/62140ed270d8f84b6093ecb598093126de42062a/c=0-221-4015-2489&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-03T13:21:35.670000-05:00", "shorthed": "8 bills for Indiana's legislature in 2016", "articleid": 78230476, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0863ec91d735105e320c02eef5ee112adbc0f461/c=0-221-4015-2489/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57ef634368a0c266db195d461dda905fa73ae51b/c=1248-0-2766-2711/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Louisville/Louisville/635707630844055714-pence.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Indiana, legislature, 2016, legislature session, general Assembly, transgender bathrooms, roads, teacher shortage, ISTEP, cold medicine, Indiana Gov.
