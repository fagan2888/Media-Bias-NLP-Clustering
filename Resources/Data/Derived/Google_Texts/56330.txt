MARY MATALIN: Can I -- please, 7 percent unemployment, the new normal. If the labor force participation rate were really calculated in there were was what it was in the pre-recession, we would be somewhere between 9 percent and 11 percent of unemployment. This is the worse recovery in almost seven decades. The duration of unemployment. These are not -- this is the new normal is not a good...



GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But those are not incompatible. I guess one of the questions I have is how does the Republican Party get ahead of this, Mary? It seems like if you look at what happened in the last presidential campaign, Mitt Romney, maybe stylistically it was very difficult for him to address this. But won't the party have to have a more populist feel to be success the next time around?



MATALIN: Populist? It has to be common sense and it has to be full-throated. The biggest challenge of our time is not income inequality, it is job creation, which the president's signature issues, domestic, starting with the Affordable Health Care, have reduced unemployment.



Do you think people who are unemployed or making low wages care more about -- they don't have a job than how much you're making or any of us are making? I don't think so. That does not grow the economy.
