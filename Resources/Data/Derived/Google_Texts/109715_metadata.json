Pixabay, public domain\n\nWhether you\u2019re drawing cat whiskers on your cheeks or you\u2019re covering your entire face with ghoulish fake blood for a zombie look, face paint is a common practice on Halloween, and we often don\u2019t think twice when applying it. But there are some things to look out for when you\u2019re buying your cheap costume supplies: mainly, the ingredient labels.\n\nWhile most contents in face paints have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is calling for the FDA to tighten regulations and be even more careful in testing for \u201ctoxic ingredients.\u201d He\u2019s also warning parents to be wary of these chemicals, hoping to prevent kids from breaking out in rashes or other skin problems after using face paints.\n\n\u201cEvery Halloween we worry about the candy we\u2019re putting in our kids\u2019 mouths, but nowadays, we need to worry about the face paint we\u2019re putting on our kids\u2019 faces,\u201d Schumer said, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nToxic ingredients in Halloween face paint can make our kids sick. Urging @US_FDA to tighten regulations. http://t.co/LJWvzhOmj9 \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 19, 2015\n\nThe FDA has to test what\u2019s in cosmetics before approving them to be marketed and sold. The tips include basic things like following all the directions on the label, avoiding face paints that smell really bad, and avoiding putting them in your eyes.\n\nBut in 2009, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found that nearly all of the face paints they tested contained lead, and six out of 10 face paints contained nickel, cobalt, and/or chromium \u2014 all of which are known skin allergens. The same report also notes that \u201cthe FDA also does not require companies to list heavy metals or other harmful contaminants on product labels, even though they are commonly found in a wide array of personal care products.\u201d Many of these products contain levels of chemicals that far exceed what the FDA recommends, and perhaps this is why you should double-check the ingredient list on your Halloween purchases in advance.\n\nSo while you\u2019re out shopping for face glues, paints, fake blood and skin, read the labels and avoid anything that screams sketch.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is simply not doing enough to protect our children from these harmful ingredients, and that\u2019s a scary thought,\u201d Schumer said, according to the NY Daily News.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "are, halloween, face, paints, dangerous, sen, chuck, schumer, calls, testing, toxic, chemicals", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Some holiday face paints may contain higher levels of lead and other chemicals than are safe to use \u2014 so it\u2019s important to be wary of ingredient labels.", "title": "Are Halloween Face Paints Really Dangerous?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/are-halloween-face-paints-dangerous-sen-chuck-schumer-calls-testing-toxic-chemicals-357852", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/10/19/devil.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some holiday face paints may contain higher levels of lead and other chemicals than are safe to use \u2014 so it\u2019s important to be wary of ingredient labels.", "title": "Are Halloween Face Paints Really Dangerous?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/are-halloween-face-paints-dangerous-sen-chuck-schumer-calls-testing-toxic-chemicals-357852", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/10/19/devil.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/19/devil.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-19T14:50:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T14:50:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Some holiday face paints may contain higher levels of lead and other chemicals than are safe to use \u2014 so it\u2019s important to be wary of ingredient labels."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb775\"", "article_summary": "But in 2009, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found that nearly all of the face paints they tested contained lead, and six out of 10 face paints contained nickel, cobalt, and/or chromium \u2014 all of which are known skin allergens.\nMany face paints don't list the harmful ingredients on their labels \u2014 putting kids at risk of exposure to lead and other chemicals.\nSo while you\u2019re out shopping for face glues, paints, fake blood and skin, read the labels and avoid anything that screams sketch.\nThe tips include basic things like following all the directions on the label, avoiding face paints that smell really bad, and avoiding putting them in your eyes.\nToxic ingredients in Halloween face paint can make our kids sick."}
