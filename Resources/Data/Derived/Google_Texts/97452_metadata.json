Cruz spoke to local media, taking questions about his policies on fighting terrorism, his sometimes contentious relations with his fellow Republicans, and a Washington Post cartoon that depicted his daughters as monkeys.\n\n\"Not much ticks me off,\" Cruz said, \"but making fun of my girls - that'll do it.\"\n\nHe said he personally typed out a Tweet in response to the cartoon on his iPhone.\n\n\"All of us learned in kindergarten, don't hit little girls,\" he added. \"It's not complicated. Don't make fun of a five-year-old girl and a seven-year-old girl.\"\n\nThe Washington Post did pull the controversial cartoon, although it's readily available to anyone with Internet access.\n\nThe themes Cruz stressed Wednesday remained consistent with his message all along during the campaign.\n\nHe would like to abolish the IRS, repeal the Affordable Care Act, initiate a federal investigation of Planned Parenthood, and wipe ISIS out entirely.\n\nHis strategy for winning the election, he told KRMG, hinges on two main tactics.\n\n\"Number one, we bring back to the polls the millions of conservatives that stayed home in 2008 and 2012. We bring back the millions of evangelical Christians, the millions of Reagan Democrats. But number two, we stand and fight for the working men and women of this country.\"\n\nKRMG asked about the role American Muslims play in helping to defend the nation against Islamic terrorism, especially \"lone wolf\" attackers not necessarily funded, trained or controlled by ISIS or al Qaeda.\n\nThe Senator responded by saying that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have been \"ostriches with their heads in the sand\" on the issue of terrorism.\n\nHowever, he did not directly respond to the question about American Muslims, nor about Donald Trump's call to ban all Muslims from entering the country.\n\nThis was Cruz's third visit to Tulsa this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidential hopeful Sen.
