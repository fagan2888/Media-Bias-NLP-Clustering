At top of Longs Peak. 13400 feet. Whiteout snowstorm. No injuries. Iced over risk of hypothermia.\u201d\n\nThe pair noted their mobile battery was dying. Calls from rangers and friends have failed to reach the pair. A website has been assembled to update friends and family on their status.\n\nTurell is the director of product design and Connie Yang is the director of engineering for the New Hampshire tent and sleeping bag company Nemo Equipment.\n\n\u201cThey are very experienced but they didn\u2019t have mountaineering equipment,\u201d said Nemo spokeswoman Kate Ketschek. \u201cWe are really worried. They wouldn\u2019t call for help if they didn\u2019t really need it.\u201d\n\nKetschek said the duo was equipped with fall hiking equipment. Thirty-degree sleeping bags and a double-wall tent. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were prepared for winter conditions,\u201d Ketschek said.\n\nKetschek said Rocky Mountain National Park rangers sent a small search party in Thursday but they were turned back by flooded roads and closures before reaching the trailhead. A ground rescue was scheduled for early Friday but road closures remain on the eastern edge of the park. Phone and power appear to be out for the park as well. Phone calls to the park headquarters did not go through.\n\nTurell and Yang\u2019s text noted their precise GPS coordinates. They were hunkering down in a yellow tent near the Keyhole Notch, a rocky pass between Longs Peak and Storm Peak.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t move because of ice storm. Don\u2019t know how long it will last. Been here for one day and trying to wait it out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Longs Peak,mountaineers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Two experienced mountaineers are trapped below the summit of Longs Peak after recent storms blanketed the 14,259-foot peak in snow and ice.", "title": "Mountaineers trapped in ice storm on Longs Peak", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/09/13/experienced-mountaineers-trapped-in-ice-storm-below-longs-peak/25526/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/09/CONNIE.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Two experienced mountaineers are trapped below the summit of Longs Peak after recent storms blanketed the 14,259-foot peak in snow and ice.", "title": "Experienced mountaineers trapped in ice storm below Longs Peak", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/09/13/experienced-mountaineers-trapped-in-ice-storm-below-longs-peak/25526/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/09/CONNIE.jpg", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Two experienced mountaineers are trapped below the summit of Longs Peak after recent storms blanketed the 14,259-foot peak in snow and ice."}, "article_summary": "Two experienced mountaineers are trapped below the summit of Longs Peak after recent storms blanketed the 14,259-foot peak in snow and ice.\nThey were hunkering down in a yellow tent near the Keyhole Notch, a rocky pass between Longs Peak and Storm Peak.\nAt top of Longs Peak.\nSuzanne Turell and Connie Yang \u2013 both from York, Maine \u2013 sent a mobile phone text at 7:07 a.m. Thursday reading \u201cWe need help.\n\u201cCan\u2019t move because of ice storm."}
