Cheney, the Politico reporter who wrote last Friday\u2019s discredited hit piece on Republican presidential frontrunner Ben Carson, has a flair for hyperbole, writing about a 2004 arrest: \u201cI was in Guant\u00e1namo for 12 Hours.\u201d\n\nCheney was arrested during an anti-war protest at the Republican National Convention in 2004. Though he was, at the time, an editor for the student newspaper at Boston University, he seems to have joined the protest as a demonstrator.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLater, Cheney wrote an angry op-ed about his detention. He attacked \u201cthe Bushies\u201d and \u201cRepublican demagogues.\u201d He decried the \u201camBush\u201d in which he was arrested\u2013during a protest he admits he knew had no permit\u2013and attacked \u201cthe New York City Police Department and its henchmen,\u201d slamming \u201cthe steady stream of outright lies and unmitigated praise for the law enforcement effort spewing from the bowels of Madison Square Garden.\u201d\n\nCheney complained about his detention with dozens of others in Pier 57, \u201cGuantanamo on the Hudson.\u201d He later agreed to a deal, along with other defendants, in which charges were dismissed \u201cif we stay out of trouble for half a year.\u201d Still resentful weeks later, Cheney claimed that America \u201ccan never claim to be what it once was: A land that cherished freedom of expression, distinguished between peaceful protesters and malicious terrorists\u2026\u201d.\n\nAt Politico, Cheney has covered Obamacare, but his most recent efforts have included wide-ranging political coverage, including premature cheerleading for Donald Trump\u2019s decline. Cheney\u2019s original article claimed Carson admitted misleading the public about applying and being accepted to West Point, but in fact Carson never made those claims, and never admitted wrongdoing. Politico was forced to revise the initial claims in Cheney\u2019s story.\n\nOver the weekend, Cheney took to Twitter to defend his reporting, claiming that he had caught Carson claiming falsely that he had a \u201cscholarship offer\u201d to West Point\u2013though that was uncertain, as West Point does recruit with offers of financial aid, and there is no evidence to suggest Carson lied about being recruited.\n\n.@RealBenCarson said for 25 years he had scholarship offer to W. Point. Yesterday he said that was false. Everything else is semantic. \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) November 7, 2015\n\nCheney also claimed Carson\u2019s \u201cclaim of scholarship offer diminishes cadets who went through rigorous process to get offer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kyle D.
