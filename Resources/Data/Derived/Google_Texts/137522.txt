Wednesday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Joy Behar said there is so much agreement between Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on issues like taxing the rich, single payer health care and the Iraq war that she is “starting to warm up to Trump.”

Behar said, “You know, I’m starting to warm up to Trump a little bit now … I’m not voting for him, and I don’t like the race-baiting. Let’s get that out of the way. And he’ll never replace my arousal feelings for Bernie, but the guy is not as bad as the rest of them. First of all, he may not be pro-choice but Rubio, for example, believes no abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. Trump doesn’t say that. Trump does not say that. He believes in single payer. He wants everybody to have health care from the government. He agrees with Bernie. He wants to raise taxes on the rich. He believes in Bernie. I mean, I looked this up, I couldn’t believe it, you know. But — and he was against the Iraq war, and he said so in one of his books before 9/11 even happened. So he was like ‘Nostratrumpus,’ ou know what I’m saying.”

She added, “He’s not as bad as the rest of them on that team.”
