That is 90 percent of all new VA patients.\n\nAnother 64,000 vets who enrolled for VA health care over the past decade have never even been seen by a doctor.\n\nThirteen percent of VA schedulers were told to give false appointment-request dates to give the impression that wait times were shorter.\n\nThe controversy forced VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign May 30.\n\nActing VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said a preliminary review released last month showed the problems exist across the entire VA system.\n\nHe said VA officials have now contacted 50,000 veterans across the country to get them off waiting lists and into clinics and are attempting to contact an additional 40,000 veterans.\n\nThe new audit said a 14-day agency target for waiting times was \u201cnot attainable\u201d because of poor planning and an increased demand on the VA system as Vietnam-era vets age.\n\nThe report said it was a mistake, or \u201corganizational leadership failure,\u201d to decide in 2011 to base bonuses for VA employees on meeting targets for waiting times.\n\nA previous inspector general\u2019s investigation into the troubled after being kept off an official, electronic waiting list.\n\nQuestioning of witnesses was much more combative the last time the committee held an evening hearing, May 28, and provided perhaps the most dramatic moment so far in the deadly VA scandal.\n\nHaving lost all patience with the witness, Chairman Miller cut off a witness at the top of his voice, bellowing, \u201cMaam, maam, maam! Veterans died!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet us the answers, please!\u201d he implored.\n\nMiller had become completely exasperated with Assistant VA Secretary Joan Mooney when she began giving a bureaucratic answer to his question as to why so many veterans had died after what should have been routine colonoscopies at a VA facility in Georgia.\n\nWhen Mooney began another rote answer, Miller interrupted again, telling her, \u201cThat\u2019s what you said three months ago.\u201d\n\nMiller added that Congress couldn\u2019t do its job if the VA would not provide the information it had demanded.\n\nThe scene was a hearing in which three top VA administrators were called on the carpet to answer questions following accusations that at least 40 U.S. veterans died waiting for appointments at the Phoenix facility.\n\nAssistant Deputy VA Undersecretary Thomas Lynch testified that, initially, he did not think there were secret waiting lists for VA care. He said he thought there were \u201cworking lists\u201d and an initiative to reschedule canceled appointments, which could be be easily misunderstood as secret lists.\n\nHowever, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers weren\u2019t buying that, especially after the VA\u2019s inspector general preliminary report, released earlier in the day, confirmed the existence of the secret wait list.\n\nA poignant hush fell over the hearing room when Rep. Dan Benishek, R-Mich., simply asked, \u201cWho destroyed the list?\u201d\n\nWhen Lynch replied that he didn\u2019t have the names, the congressman asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the first thing you\u2019d ask?\u201d\n\nBenishek said he could not understand how Lynch could do an investigation into whether someone had destroyed important documents and not even bother to find out who did it.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you have any interest?\u201d he asked.\n\nLynch responded that it did not seem important when he was in Phoenix looking into the problem, causing the congressman to counter, \u201cMaybe I am simple minded, but it seems like first thing you\u2019d ask.\u201d\n\nBenishek asked Lynch if he wasn\u2019t concerned that VA managers may have used secret waiting lists to qualify for bonuses by making it appear that wait times for care were far shorter.\n\nWhen Lynch replied that the VA\u2019s inspector general was discussing the issue, the congressman shot back, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nOne of starkest moments came when Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., a veteran of the Army Medical Corps, said he couldn\u2019t fathom how VA officials could receive big paychecks and live with themselves as vets in their care were dying.\n\nRep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., said all three witnesses should lose their jobs.\n\n\u201cYou are not being forthright in your testimony,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are here to serve yourselves and not the men and women who have made extraordinary sacrifices to serve this country.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can look in the mirror in the morning and shave, and not throw up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Department of Justice is looking into whether anyone acted criminally in the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal.
