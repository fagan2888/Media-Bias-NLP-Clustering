REUTERS/Darren Staples\n\n(Reuters Health) - Pets can be a source of infection, and newborns, the elderly, children with leukemia and adults with cancer are especially vulnerable, according to a new review of data from previous research.\n\nSelecting the right pets and using safe strategies to care for them can reduce the risk, the authors write.\n\n\u201cPets have a number of really important health benefits,\u201d including emotional and social support, said lead author Dr. Jason Stull of the Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine at Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nAnd actually contracting an infection from a pet is relatively uncommon, he and his colleagues say.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue comes down to really recognizing when individuals are at greater risk,\u201d Stull said.\n\nPeople with compromised immune systems are at increased risk for these infections and may have more severe disease, the authors write. Also at increased risk are kids under age five, adults over age 65, and pregnant women. Pet-sourced infections have also been reported in organ donors and recipients, according to Bruno Chomel, who researches veterinary public health and zoonoses at University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Chomel was not part of the new review.\n\nMore than half of households in the U.S. have pets, Chomel noted.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that you should get rid of the pet,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. But if your immune system is compromised, he added, \u201cdon\u2019t take in a stray pet or a kitten with fleas, and if you have young toddlers, don\u2019t take an iguana as a pet.\u201d\n\nMany people don\u2019t realize their pets can be a source of infection, Stull told Reuters Health by phone. Reptiles, amphibians, hedgehogs, chinchillas, rodents and young chickens are some of the \u201chighest risk\u201d animals, he said.\n\nThere aren\u2019t good data on actual rates of so-called zoonotic infections, because governments don\u2019t generally track diseases transmitted by companion animals, other than rabies. But pets can theoretically transmit more than 70 human diseases via bites, scratches and contact with body fluids (such as saliva, urine, or feces, or infectious aerosols or droplets), the authors write in the medical journal CMAJ.\n\nThe new review covered more than 300 articles on infections originating in companion animals. Most of the studies were small, the authors note.\n\nThe review also included guidelines developed by other experts. Cats are the definitive host for the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can lead to congenital defects, encephalitis or meningitis when a pregnant woman is exposed.\n\n\u201cYour risk of toxoplasma is much higher from gardening or eating undercooked meat,\u201d Stull noted.\n\nBut in any case, it seems that neither doctors nor veterinarians are asking their human clients about pets or about young children, elderly people, or other vulnerable family members in the home.\n\n\u201cMost patients do not ever recall being asked if they have pets,\u201d Stull said. When a child is diagnosed with cancer, the family may go out and get a new pet to help cope.\n\n\u201cIn most situations there are options for finding a pet for that household, but it requires having a conversation with physicians and veterinarians,\u201d Stull said.\n\n\u201cIt really requires strong integration and communication between all of these different groups,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most frequent mode of transmission is fecal-oral, Stull said, and care strategies can minimize that risk. He and his coauthors recommend wearing protective gloves to clean aquariums and cages and remove feces, proper handwashing after pet contact, discouraging pets from face licking, covering playground boxes when not in use, avoiding contact with exotic animals, regular cleaning and disinfection of animal cages, feeding areas and bedding, locating litter boxes away from areas where eating and food preparation occur and regularly scheduling veterinary visits for all pets.\n\nHouseholds with immunocompromised people or very young children (under a few months of age) should avoid contact with puppies and kittens that are younger than six months, and avoid adopting a cat younger than a year old, the authors suggest.\n\nThese people should also avoid young farm animals at petting zoos.\n\n\u201cOther practices will be important for all children under five years, such as strict hand washing and ensuring pets are healthy and receive preventive veterinary care,\" Stull said.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily one \u2018safest\u2019 animal, but mature dogs and cats who are well cared for are a lower risk,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is also important to teach children how to interact with pets to minimize the risk of bites, Stull added.\n\nMany people today treat pets as children, and allow the pets to lick them and sleep in their beds, Chomel said.\n\n\u201cIf pets are healthy, the risk is low, but your dog and cats walk outside and they bring things back,\u201d he said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1ATHfzi CMAJ, online April 20, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "care, needed, reduce, pet, human, infection, risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pets can be a source of infection, and newborns, the elderly, children with leukemia and adults with cancer are especially vulnerable.", "title": "Care Needed To Reduce Pet-To-Human Infection Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/care-needed-reduce-pet-human-infection-risk-329966", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/dog-source-infection.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pets can be a source of infection, and newborns, the elderly, children with leukemia and adults with cancer are especially vulnerable.", "title": "Care Needed To Reduce Pet-To-Human Infection Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/care-needed-reduce-pet-human-infection-risk-329966", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/dog-source-infection.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/dog-source-infection.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-20T12:54:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T12:54:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pets can be a source of infection, and newborns, the elderly, children with leukemia and adults with cancer are especially vulnerable."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe biggest issue comes down to really recognizing when individuals are at greater risk,\u201d Stull said.\nSelecting the right pets and using safe strategies to care for them can reduce the risk, the authors write.\n\u201cMost patients do not ever recall being asked if they have pets,\u201d Stull said.\nIt is also important to teach children how to interact with pets to minimize the risk of bites, Stull added.\nPets can be a source of infection, and newborns, the elderly, children with leukemia and adults with cancer are especially vulnerable."}
