Amari walked across a bike path and off a rocky cliff before falling into the water below. He was found there by emergency responders, lying face down in the river.\n\n\u201cHe just took off,\u201d Angelina Vallejos, a 25-year-old cousin of the toddler, said Sunday. \u201cHe wanted to play.\u201d\n\nFamily and friends of the young boy gathered Sunday afternoon on the river\u2019s edge around a makeshift memorial. Planted in the mud at the base of a small tree \u2014 in the shadows of Interstate 25 and downtown Denver \u2014 were tiny toy cars, stuffed animals and countless candles.\n\nDozens of children climbed on the rocks above where Amari was found, their happy screams muted by the hush of the nearby interstate.\n\nAmari\u2019s parents called police Saturday about 11:20 a.m. to report the boy missing from his home in the area of West 9th Avenue and Alcott Way. He was found unresponsive and rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nPolice said they are not assuming the family did anything wrong, though they are investigating the incident.\n\nNeighbors told The Denver Post hours after Amari\u2019s death that they saw a boy in diapers wandering the area just before the 911 call was made. One man said that a gate from the playground the river had been left open by crews working on the Platte River Trail.\n\nFamily said Amari was an outgoing youngster whose smile was contagious and lit up a room. The boy was one of four children living in the family\u2019s Denver Housing Authority apartment.\n\nThe family posted a message on the door of their home asking for privacy Sunday and thanking the community for their \u201cprayers and good thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just really hurt right now,\u201d Vallejos said of the boy\u2019s mother. \u201cShe\u2019s in shock right now. She just doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Family mourns 3-year-old boy who died in the South Platte River", "title": "Family mourns 3-year-old boy who died in the South Platte River", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/17/family-mourns-3-year-old-boy-who-died-in-the-south-platte-river/", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140817__081714Drowning004p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140817__081714Drowning004p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T19:10:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:54:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc250\"", "article_summary": "One man said that a gate from the playground the river had been left open by crews working on the Platte River Trail.\nFrom there, he slipped through a gap in a chain-link fence surrounding the swings, monkey bars and slides and headed towards the western bank of the South Platte River.\nAmari Furqan, 3, pushed out a screen window in his family\u2019s split-level, sand-colored public housing home Saturday morning before waddling off in the direction of a nearby playground, family said.\nFamily said Amari was an outgoing youngster whose smile was contagious and lit up a room.\nNeighbors told The Denver Post hours after Amari\u2019s death that they saw a boy in diapers wandering the area just before the 911 call was made."}
