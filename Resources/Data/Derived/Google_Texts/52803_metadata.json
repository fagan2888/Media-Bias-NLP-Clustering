NBC's national investigative correspondent Jeff Rossen reports.\n\nMore than 80,000 football fans are expected to brave near-freezing temperatures to attend the New York region\u2019s first Super Bowl on Sunday, and more than 3,000 security guards, 700 cops and hundreds of high-tech gadgets will be on hand to greet them.\n\nSimilar armies of human and technological watchdogs will keep eyes and lenses trained on the tens of thousands of other people who will descend on the city to enjoy other festivities associated with America's top sports event \u2013 making it the biggest and most-expensive security net in the 48-year history of the game.\n\nThe $1.6 billion Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., where the game will be played, will be the most tightly guarded venue \u2013 with a 2.5 mile chain-link perimeter fence and cameras trained on every section and corridor inside. But multiple game-related events planned New York and New Jersey add several degrees of difficulty to the job of keeping fans and participants safe, security experts say.\n\nThis Super Bowl, says Ed Hartnett, former head of the New York Police Department\u2019s Intelligence Unit, \u201ctruly defines the word \u2018challenge\u2019 when it comes to security.\u201d\n\nThere is no intelligence indicating that terrorists have targeted the game or related events, but Hartnett says that doesn\u2019t mean that threats don\u2019t exist : \u201cI would list them in priority order being a suicide bomber, a vehicle laden with explosives and a mass shooter or mass shooters similar to the Kenyan mall, or the Mumbai incidents,\u201d he said. His concerns are echoed by law enforcement officials overseeing the game.\n\nExtensive mass transit, bridge and tunnel networks in the vicinity are a particular area of concern, according to a review of sensitive law enforcement documents detailing the Super Bowl security plan and intelligence by NBC News. The game is being billed as the \u201cMass Transit Super Bowl\u201d by the New Jersey Transit system, and rail officials say the security experience for fans taking the train on game day will rival that of an airport, with bag-screening, K-9 teams and random searches for trains to and from the game.\n\nThe documents also discuss an emerging threat: computer hacking. Could criminals use a cyber-attack to hit the infrastructure and control systems for the game? While not considered likely, officials recall what an accidental blackout did to last year\u2019s game. Many of the key players in developing this year\u2019s security plan attended the game in New Orleans and learned from the Superdome outage, which delayed the game for 34 minutes early in the third quarter.\n\nBebeto Matthews / AP A temporary surveillance camera hangs on a Times Square light post on Thursday.\n\nLaw enforcement is also concerned that \u201chacktivists\u201d \u2013 hackers with social or political aims -- could exploit social media to \u201cspread disinformation, sow confusion.\u201d\n\nLt. Col. Edward Cetnar of the New Jersey State Police is the man in charge of security at the game itself. His task as incident commander is to make sure the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos goes off without a hitch. That requires planning for a triple threat: \u201cEverything that we're doing has an air, land and sea concept,\u201d he said.\n\nThe need for aquatic security arises from the fact that the 750-acre stadium complex is almost entirely surrounded by waterways and thick marsh.\n\n\u201cIf you go through that marsh area, within feet, you're on Meadowlands stadium complex property,\u201d Cetnar said. To prevent anyone from approaching the stadium that way, he said he\u2019ll have helicopters scanning the area, troopers guarding the perimeter and boat patrols working the waterways.\n\nOn Monday, officers with the federal Customs and Border Protection began checking all commercial vehicles arriving at MetLife Stadium for weapons, explosive devices and dirty bombs.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re supposed to see about 240 trucks \u2013 beer trucks, seat cushions, merchandise, food products \u2013 everything going into the stadium has to go through screening,\u201d said Chief Kevin McCabe.\n\nCetnar said he appointed 27 separate subcommittees to develop the security plan, with members drawn from all the law enforcement agencies involved, including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the NYPD. In addition to sharing information and resources with those agencies, the State Police have attended the last three Super Bowls to ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stolen absolutely everything that has gone right,\u201d said State Police Col. Rick Fuentes.\n\nThe security force will be aided by an array of high-tech gadgets capable of spotting anything unusual. Thermal cameras on the helicopters, for example, would pick up even camouflaged individuals in the marsh. The marine patrols will be equipped with devices that \u201csniff\u201d the air for radiation. Black shoebox-sized license plate scanners will check cars as they enter the parking lot.\n\nSimilar devices will be deployed in New York City. Times Square, a crossroads for football fans and tourists, will be hosting a full-size toboggan run and football events leading up to game day. Police there will use security cameras there to keep watch on the crowds and an artificial intelligence system to help spot any unusual behavior. The latter system, which is controlled by the NYPD, can spot abandoned packages and bags and even circle the suspicious items in screen grabs from video so that police officers know exactly where to look.\n\nSecurity officials say most of the precautions they have taken will be invisible to the fans, and express confidence that the weather, with temperatures in the low 30s with the possibility of snow, will be the bigger distraction.\n\nAnd that\u2019s as it should be, says Jeff Miller, the National Football League\u2019s chief security officer.\n\n\u201cThis is the Super Bowl of football and not security,\u201d he said.\n\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\n\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 80,000 football fans are expected to brave near-freezing temperatures to attend the New York region\u2019s first Super Bowl on Sunday, and more than 3,000 security guards, 700 cops and hundreds of high-tech gadgets will be on hand to greet", "author": "Investigations", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "More than 80,000 football fans are expected to brave near-freezing temperatures to attend the New York region&rsquo;s first Super Bowl on Sunday, and more than 3,000 security guards, 700 cops and hundreds of high-tech gadgets will be on hand to greet", "title": "Super Bowl security net cast wide to protect game and related events", "url": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/28/22470990-super-bowl-security-net-cast-wide-to-protect-game-and-related-events", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/140127-super-bowl-nyc-security-jms-1750.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22470990, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"investigations\",\"displayName\":\"Investigations\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/investigations.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"5187\",\"articleCount\":\"1225\",\"seedCount\":\"147\",\"memberCount\":\"4\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1279868940,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1460216486,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Super Bowl security net cast wide to protect game and related events - Investigations", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"Open Channel\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22470990\",\"headline\":\"Super Bowl security net cast wide to protect game and related events\",\"pageSource\":\"Investigations\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"Investigations\",\"tags\":[\"sports\",\"security\",\"featured\",\"football\",\"super-bowl\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "208.185.118.4", "nv": {"contentId": 22470990, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 26, 2016, 12:18 am", "server": "web03", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/28/22470990-super-bowl-security-net-cast-wide-to-protect-game-and-related-events"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc30d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the Super Bowl of football and not security,\u201d he said.\nAs the Super Bowl gets closer, authorities in New York and New Jersey are mounting a massive security operation to make sure game day is secure.\nTimes Square, a crossroads for football fans and tourists, will be hosting a full-size toboggan run and football events leading up to game day.\nExtensive mass transit, bridge and tunnel networks in the vicinity are a particular area of concern, according to a review of sensitive law enforcement documents detailing the Super Bowl security plan and intelligence by NBC News.\nBut multiple game-related events planned New York and New Jersey add several degrees of difficulty to the job of keeping fans and participants safe, security experts say."}
