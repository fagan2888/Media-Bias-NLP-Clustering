There's a tradition in the Senate that the passage of the annual budget will be accompanied by a slew of votes on amendments either somewhat or not-at-all related to the content of the full bill. Often, it's a way for members of one political party to put the screws to members of the other, by introducing politically tricky topics and demanding that they receive a vote.

So, on Thursday night — late into the night — the Senate voted on scores of amendments to the budget, putting the six possible 2016 candidates in the chamber on record on a number of issues. (The six? Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.) And we, always seeking to provide a public service to the world, created this handy clip-and-save guide to how the six voted. (How do you clip-and-save a Web site? You print it out and cut it up with scissors and then you stop asking rude questions.)

We've pulled the language about each amendment from the Senate Web site, and linked to the full breakdown of each vote as well with the key parts bolded. But of course, if you're just looking to score political points, the less detail the better. So here's the summary.
