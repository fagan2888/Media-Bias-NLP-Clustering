We see it today from the extremist doctors who refuse to \u201csubmit\u201d to being reimbursed for their services by Medicaid, or even the government-tainted private insurance companies. They\u2019re organized in a 4,000-member group called the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons. Senator Rand Paul is a member; its website features him asserting that if you believe in a \u201cright to health care,\u201d then \u201cyou believe in slavery.\u201d And what kind of moral person believes in slavery?\n\nThen there\u2019s the old saw that the deal the Democrats supposedly offer African-Americans\u2014you vote for us; we give you free stuff\u2014returns them to \u201cslavery.\u201d The first use of that metaphor I\u2019ve identified was by Ronald Reagan in 1968. A black reporter asked him why there were so few blacks at Republican events. The California governor politely but forcefully replied that it wasn\u2019t Republicans who were racist but the supposedly liberal Democrats who \u201chad betrayed them\u2026. The Negro has has delivered himself to those who have no other intention than to create a federal plantation and ignore him.\u201d The New York Times reported, \u201cReagan handled the situation so smoothly that some of the newsmen aboard his chartered 727 suggested, half-seriously, that the Reagan organization had set up the incident.\u201d\n\nWhat does this insight\u2014that conservatives are immune to charges of \u201cimmorality\u201d when it comes to denying citizens government services because they believe \u201chooking\u201d people on government services is profoundly immoral\u2014mean in terms of practical politics? For one thing, that Democrats will never get political credit from conservatives for downsizing or \u201creinventing\u201d government. Just to speak of the state as something other than the source of all evil is enough to send chills down right-wing spines. Had JFK lived to give the speech he was scheduled to give at the Dallas Trade Mart on November 22, 1963, he intended to set conservatives straight: \u201cAt a time when the national debt is steadily being reduced in terms of its burden on our economy, they see that debt as the greatest single threat to our security. At a time when we are steadily reducing the number of Federal employees serving every thousand citizens, they fear those supposed hordes of civil servants far more than the actual hordes of opposing armies.\u201d But I don\u2019t think Texans were going to turn in their John Birch Society membership cards, the scales falling from their eyes, when they learned of the facts. Ad Policy\n\nAnd given the rank anti-empirical irrationalism that undergirds such convictions, it\u2019s not like the White House can now avoid brickbats by somehow \u201csubmerging\u201d progressive action by the state. Which, unfortunately, is what the Obama Administration has habitually tried to do. \"Design of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d as The Washington Post reported in a major investigation last month, \u201cwas hampered by the White House\u2019s political sensitivity to Republican hatred of the law\u2014sensitivity so intense that the president\u2019s aides ordered that some work be slowed down or remain secret for fear of feeding the opposition. Inside the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, the main agency responsible for the exchanges, there was no single administrator whose full-time job was to manage the project.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not like their overabundance of caution earned a single Republican vote in Congress, or kept Republican attorney generals from suing to end its implementation, or four conservative Supreme Court justices from seeking to strike down the entire act (and a fifth, John Roberts, from ruling on its legality in away that set a precedent that might make future major government initiatives harder to constitutionally defend). It couldn\u2019t have. Conservatives\u2019 deepest moral convictions determined their reaction in advance. Anything liberals do to use the government to help people will be judged by genuine conservatives as an abomination; always have, always will. But genuine conservatives are in the American minority, as I wrote here last month. Isn\u2019t it better to simply sin boldly and let our conservatives devils have the hindmost? Use the state to make people\u2019s lives better. Do it without apology. That\u2019s our moral imperative that should be beyond compromise.\n\nIn Part Five of this series, Rick Perlstein discusses conservatives' complicated relationship to the truth.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/teapartynut_rtr_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Rick Perlstein", "description": "If you\u2019re a liberal, a politician working to deny his constituents government-subsidized healthcare is immoral.
