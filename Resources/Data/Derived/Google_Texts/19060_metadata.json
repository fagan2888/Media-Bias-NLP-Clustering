The retired U.S. Navy veteran was left a paraplegic after suffering a spinal cord injury in a diving accident almost two decades ago.\n\nNow, the award-winning wheelchair athlete helps run REVolutions Dance Inc., a Bay Area company that teaches dancing to both disabled and able-bodied young people.\n\nBecause of that background, Scheuneman was asked to travel to the Palestinian territories in June to share his lessons with teachers and students at Sareyyet Ramallah, a dance program based in a community center in the West Bank.\n\n\"The first five days was just working with dancers and dance teachers, when they brought in the students with disabilities, we had 15 students who were teenagers who were deaf and we had three people in wheelchairs who came and took the class,\" he said.\n\nWorking with New College of Florida dance instructor Leymis Wilmott, Scheuneman and his fellow teachers crafted a number of pieces that blended everyone\u2019s abilities together.\n\nIn one, the deaf dancers gathered together tightly in a circle, arms raised in unison. At the same time, Scheuneman and the other wheelchair dancers circled them, pretending to hit them with their fists in an effort to break into their group.\n\n\"Basically we created two pieces that talked about barriers and the things that come between people connecting and being together, that\u2019s kind of what came out of our conversations with them,\" Scheuneman explained.\n\nHe also admitted the lessons came with their own challenge: most of his students spoke two languages he doesn\u2019t: Arabic AND sign language!\n\n\"I\u2019ll add to that is trying to teach them some movements maybe that involve their legs when I\u2019m in a wheelchair and they\u2019re deaf and I speak English and their interpreter is Arabic, it just was a matter of patience!,\" he said. \"It was a lot of this!\" he added, miming dancing with his fingers across his palm.\n\n\n\nSee a documentary that Scheuneman and Sareyyet Ramallah produced on Palestinians living with disabilities.\n\nBut those challenges were nothing compared to what came a few days into the trip when tensions erupted into violence following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens.\n\n\"While I was there, the Israeli guard had raided the city a few times, arresting people and a couple people would get shot,\" Scheuneman said. \"On the first day, the city shuts down and people don\u2019t come out; by the third day, the Palestinians are back to life as normal and their city is getting raided and people are getting shot!\"\n\nAnd in speaking with dance colleagues in Israel during that time, \"I found on both sides, there were people who really just wish the war and the fighting and the tension just didn\u2019t exist.\"\n\nBut there was a place where those problems disappeared\u2014even if only for a few hours. Escape could be found inside the dance studio.\n\n\"All the tension that was going on outside, they didn\u2019t speak about it, it seemed as if it didn\u2019t exist,\" Scheuneman said. \"In fact, I remember one day when the city was shut down, only one dancer showed up, and so we were in there, working with him, working on some choreography, and when we came out, and everything was quiet, he said to me, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I forgot that the city was shut down today, that today\u2019s a martyr day.'\u201d\n\nThe experience reinforced a belief that Scheuneman has long held: dance has a healing power, for the body and the spirit.\n\n\"This experience for me has really helped me understand that when I go and teach dance and do these workshops for populations that don\u2019t have the opportunity to dance,\" Scheuneman said, his voice breaking. \"I\u2019m giving them inspiration and love really through dance, more than I\u2019m teaching them any dance technique that they\u2019re going to hold onto for a lifetime.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "University Beat report on USF St. Petersburg student Dwayne Scheuneman&#039;s visit to the West Bank to teach dance to disabled and able-bodied Palestinian", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/usf-student-palestinians-share-healing-power-dance", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201408/341953889.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "University Beat report on USF St. Petersburg student Dwayne Scheuneman&#039;s visit to the West Bank to teach dance to disabled and able-bodied Palestinian", "title": "USF Student, Palestinians Share the Healing Power of Dance"}, "story_id": 341953842, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Mark Schreiner", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "USF Student, Palestinians Share the Healing Power of Dance"}, "nid": 7557, "datePublished": "2014-08-21", "keywords": "paraplegic, spinal cord injury, spinal cord", "wordCount": 1037, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9045\"", "article_summary": "University Beat report on USF St. Petersburg student Dwayne Scheuneman's visit to the West Bank to teach dance to disabled and able-bodied Palestinian teachers and students.\n\"This experience for me has really helped me understand that when I go and teach dance and do these workshops for populations that don\u2019t have the opportunity to dance,\" Scheuneman said, his voice breaking.\n'\u201dThe experience reinforced a belief that Scheuneman has long held: dance has a healing power, for the body and the spirit.\nThe power of dance was on display for a group of Palestinians in the West Bank recently, and they had a University of South Florida St. Petersburg student to thank for that.\n\"I\u2019m giving them inspiration and love really through dance, more than I\u2019m teaching them any dance technique that they\u2019re going to hold onto for a lifetime.\""}
