The Most Transparent Administration In History strikes again.\n\nMaybe an Iran nuclear deal really is the ObamaCare of foreign policy, as White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes once quipped to liberal activists.\n\nFox News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday asked State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki a very basic question about the Iran nuclear deal that Secretary of State John Kerry is in Europe this week to make the final push for.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a proposed deal, will the American people get sort of a real strong briefing on it before it\u2019s actually signed, sealed and delivered, so that we can have our thought whether it\u2019s a good deal, bad deal, so we can have some input?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is this going to be signed and then we are going to hear about it?\u201d\n\nPsaki replied that it is a pact \u201cnegotiated between leaders of countries. That\u2019s traditionally and historically how international negotiations have worked.\u201d\n\nIn other words: no way, Jose.\n\nThis, amazingly, sounds exactly like the position taken by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi when she was speaker of the House five years ago, using every legislative trick to impose socialized medicine on the American people.\n\nPelosi infamously claimed, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nSixteen months ago, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Pelosi doubled down: \u201cI stand by what I said there: When people see what is in the bill, they will like it.\u201d\n\nBehold the apparently boundless arrogance of our rulers, who claim to govern us democratically. This is not the way representative government is supposed to work. The people are supposed to be able to examine proposed laws thoroughly before enactment.\n\nThis is why we have committees in both the House and Senate, a panel or subcommittee for nearly every matter under the sun, from our armed forces to fisheries. They call experts or subpoena witnesses, place them under oath and then hopefully ask tough questions from various philosophical viewpoints.\n\nThe senators and congressmen are expected, both in committee and on the floor of their chamber, to debate and take well-considered positions on the details of such legislation, especially major bills that have profound effects on citizens\u2019 lives.\n\nHow much more so is this the case when it comes to negotiated pacts with enemy powers, as in the case of the world\u2019s leading terrorist sponsor state as it hurtles toward producing weapons of mass destruction?\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\u2019 overseer of illicit nuclear weapons activities, says that Tehran has answered just one of the agency\u2019s dozen questions on the military aspects of its nuclear activities. This is the body expected to make sure that Iran doesn\u2019t cheat.\n\nYukiya Amano, head of the IAEA, told the Washington Post: \u201cRecently, the progress is very limited.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t \u201crecent\u201d at all. It\u2019s much worse than that.\n\nIran agreed all the way back in 2003 to provide information and access to its nuclear program. But in 2006 \u2014 nine years ago \u2014 it stopped doing so.\n\nA dangerous nuclear deal based on appeasement cannot be forced down a blind America\u2019s throat because we have a president seeking a foreign policy legacy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nuclear Terror: \"Mind your own business\" is the State Department's message to the public on previewing a deal that may let Iran get a nuclear bomb.
