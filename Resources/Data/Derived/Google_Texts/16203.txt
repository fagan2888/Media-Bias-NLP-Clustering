Police in Cañon City on Monday plan to release more details in a weekend officer-involved shooting that happened after an officer shot a robbery suspect on Saturday afternoon after the suspect allegedly stabbed the officer.

The suspect, who has not been identified, is accused of robbing a police supply store on Saturday afternoon before fleeing on foot when an off-duty Cañon City patrol officer located him based on a description.

An altercation ensued, police say, and the suspect stabbed the officer in the arm. The officer then shot the suspect in the torso.

The officer and suspect were taken to St. Thomas More Hospital in Cañon City. The suspect was then taken via helicopter to a Colorado Springs hospital, the release said.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation has been contacted to help with the investigation.

Police have scheduled a press conference for 2 p.m. on Monday to release more details in the case.
