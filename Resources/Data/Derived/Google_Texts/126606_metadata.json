In the study, \u201cMaternal Diet Alters the Sensory Qualities of Human Milk and the Nursling\u2019s Behavior,\u201d in the journal Pediatrics, nursing mothers who ate garlic produced breast milk with a stronger smell. When the garlic effect was there, the babies stayed longer on the breast, and nursed more vigorously.\n\nJulie Mennella, a biopsychologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, was the lead author on the 1991 study.\n\n\u201cAmniotic fluid and mother\u2019s milk have a lot of sensory information,\u201d she said. \u201cThe baby gets the information when they feed on the milk.\u201d\n\nAnother study, in 2001, showed that babies who had been exposed to a flavor in utero or while nursing were more likely to like that flavor when they were weaned.\n\nWhat goes into your stomach goes into your bloodstream, broken down into protein, carbohydrate, fat. The flavors cross as well, including potent molecules called volatiles, which carry scent, which in turn heavily influences taste.\n\nThe variety of flavors you eat during pregnancy go into your blood and then into the amniotic fluid, which the baby is constantly drinking, in utero, and the flavors that you eat while nursing cross from the blood vessels that supply the mammary glands into the breast milk. So instead of restricting the maternal diet, there is now good evidence that by eating a wide variety of healthy and tasty foods, we are doing our babies a major favor.\n\n\u201cBreast-fed babies are generally easier to feed later because they\u2019ve had this kind of variety experience of different flavors from their very first stages of life, whereas a formula-fed baby has a uniform experience,\u201d said Lucy Cooke, a psychologist at University College London. \u201cThe absolute key thing is repeated exposure to a variety of different flavors as soon as you can possibly manage; that is a great thing for food acceptance.\u201d\n\nWhat about the idea that some foods can make a baby fussy or gassy or colicky? By definition, the foods that cause gas in the mother do so because they are not absorbed, and sit in her intestine, making trouble. On the other hand, studies suggest that some colicky babies do better if their mothers stay away from cow\u2019s milk, while making sure they still get plenty of calcium.\n\nCaffeine is sometimes also a culprit, pointed out Dr. Pamela High, medical director of the Infant Behavior, Cry and Sleep Program at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. But mothers of colicky babies often restrict their diets further and further, and many ultimately give up nursing, High said, even though this usually doesn\u2019t help.\n\nSo yes, the flavors we eat when we\u2019re pregnant, or when we\u2019re nursing, go to the baby, aromatics and all. But this should be a positive message rather than a list of thou-shalt-nots, since it means that we are providing something beyond protein and calories; we\u2019re actually letting our babies, unborn and born, into some of the joys of our human omnivory.\n\n\u2014 Perri Klass, M.D., The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cAmniotic fluid and mother\u2019s milk have a lot of sensory information,\u201d she said.\nA: Twenty-five years ago, researchers asked a group of nursing mothers to load up on garlic.\nIn the study, \u201cMaternal Diet Alters the Sensory Qualities of Human Milk and the Nursling\u2019s Behavior,\u201d in the journal Pediatrics, nursing mothers who ate garlic produced breast milk with a stronger smell.\nSo yes, the flavors we eat when we\u2019re pregnant, or when we\u2019re nursing, go to the baby, aromatics and all.\nWhen the garlic effect was there, the babies stayed longer on the breast, and nursed more vigorously."}
