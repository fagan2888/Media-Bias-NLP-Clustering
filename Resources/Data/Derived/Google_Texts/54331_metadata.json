If that is indeed the case, Eggers might consider selling ideas to Silicon Valley startups; much of his speculation is already fact. Here are a some of Eggers\u2019 imagined technologies, followed by excerpts from contemporary news reports.\n\nNovelist Dave Eggers takes a dim view of Silicon Valley\u2019s techno-utopia. His new book, The Circle, is a 500-page grump about the dangerously seductive powers of internet culture and all the gormless catchphrases that go with it: transparency, openness, sharing. In the book, one single company, called The Circle, has taken over the consumer internet: it does everything Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay do. But it also invents trinkets of the sort startups excel at. For all practical purposes, the Circle is the internet.\n\nDIY mass surveillance\n\n\u201cThis is a video camera, and this is the precise model that\u2019s getting this incredible image quality. Image quality that holds up to this kind of magnification. So that\u2019s the first great thing. We can get high-def-quality resolution in a camera the size of a thumb. Well, a very big thumb. The second great thing is that, as you can see, this camera needs no wires It\u2019s transmitting this image via satellite.\u201d ~Eamon Bailey, co-founder of the Circle, p.60.\n\nThe Dropcam Pro is a wireless video surveillance camera with a lot of great features. It costs $199 and the DVR service costs $10 per month. This lets you record everything that happens for seven full days, offering a 24/7 view on your world. ~TechCrunch, Oct 10.\n\nNational genetic databases\n\n\u201cWell, because Iceland has this incredibly homogenous population, most of the residents have roots many centuries back on the island. Anyone can trace their ancestry very easily back a thousand years. So they started mapping the genomes of Icelanders, every single person, and were able to trace all kinds of diseases to their origins. They\u2019ve gotten so much valuable data from that pool of people.\u201d ~Dr. Villalobos, doctor, the Circle, p.156.\n\nIslendingabok, or the Book of Icelanders, tracks 1,200 years worth of the country\u2019s genealogical data. Beyond reconnecting with aunt Brynhildur, some Icelanders are using the site to avoid romancing the bloodline. ~Globe and Mail, Feb 10.\n\nTracking long-lost parents\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know where you lived?\n\n\u201cNo Clue. Even having pictures is pretty rare. Not all the foster families would give you photos, but when they did, they made sure not to show anything that could help you find them. No exteriors on the house, no addresses or street signs of landmarks.\u201d \u201cSo you haven\u2019t tried to contact them? I mean with facial recognition\u2014\u201d\n\n~Mae Holland, Circler, talking to Francis, Circler and former foster child, The Circle, pp. 200-201.\n\nWhen he was five years old, Saroo Brierley got lost on a train in India and was separated from his family. He spent weeks wandering Calcutta until he was adopted by a young Australian couple who gave him a happy and comfortable life. In 2009, when Brierley was a recent college graduate, he thought it might be interesting to try to find his birth family, using nothing but his photographic memory and Google Earth. ~Business Insider, Oct 17.\n\nLife logging\n\nShe pushed a button on the device around her neck, and there it was, the view from the camera. ~p.209 (Narrative)\n\n\u201cStarting today, I will be wearing the same device Stewart wears. My every meeting, movement, my every word, will be available to all my constituents and to the world.\u201d \u2026. A technician emerged from the wings and hung a necklace around Santos\u2019s head\u2014a smaller version of the camera Stewart had been wearing. ~Olivia Santos, US Congresswoman, pp.208-9.\n\nHe knew what I\u2019d eaten without me saying, because that had been the weekend I spent as a lifelogger, wearing around my neck a lightweight digital camera that takes a picture every seven seconds from morning until night. The result is a jerky time-lapse video of my life, made up of about 25,000 photos. ~Research Magazine, March 2011.\n\nTech billionaires with a thing for reusable space rockets", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you don&#39;t do any research, you may wind up \"predicting\" the present.", "author": "Leo Mirani", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "If you don&#39;t do any research, you may wind up \"predicting\" the present.", "title": "7 Supposedly Futuristic Technologies From Dave Eggers's The Circle That Already Exist", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/dropcam-product-ipad-300dpi/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://qz.com/136548/seven-technologies-predicted-in-dave-eggers-dystopian-new-novel-that-already-exist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7d4\"", "article_summary": "DIY mass surveillance\u201cThis is a video camera, and this is the precise model that\u2019s getting this incredible image quality.\nSo that\u2019s the first great thing.\nThe second great thing is that, as you can see, this camera needs no wires It\u2019s transmitting this image via satellite.\u201d ~Eamon Bailey, co-founder of the Circle, p.60.\nLife loggingShe pushed a button on the device around her neck, and there it was, the view from the camera.\nNovelist Dave Eggers takes a dim view of Silicon Valley\u2019s techno-utopia."}
