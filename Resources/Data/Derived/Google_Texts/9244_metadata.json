The event, which is open to the public, also includes belly dancing and sideshow acts, tattoo contests and live entertainment, organizer Troy Timpel said.\n\nThis year's tattoo convention is Louisville's third, and Timpel said the city is great for a regional event because of its thriving downtown and \"rich tattoo culture.\"\n\nTimpel said he expects up to 4,000 to attend the event.\n\nSideshow act \"The Enigma,\" along with other acts, are performing various stunts with power tools, fire and electricity throughout the weekend.\n\n\"In the sideshow, you see natural-born wonders,\" said The Enigma, who is tattooed head to toe in puzzle pieces, has horns implanted in his head and had his eyeballs tattooed black.\n\nTV celebrities James Vaughn from Spike's \"Ink Master\" and Alli Baker from Oxygen's \"Best Ink\" are also at the convention inking customers.\n\nBaker said she mostly does appointments at conventions but is open to walk-ins this weekend. She said she thrives at these events because she is able to travel, meet new people and pick up different ideas.\n\n\"There's no way you can't learn\" while on tour, Baker said.\n\nFor first-time convention-goer Christy Strauss, the event was an opportunity to get a bride tattoo on her left wrist to match a groom tattoo her husband has.\n\n\"This was the perfect place to get it,\" she said as an artist stenciled the outline on her arm.\n\nReporter Patrick T.
