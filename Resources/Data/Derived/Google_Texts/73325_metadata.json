Today she is offering our BizPac Review readers an opportunity to showcase creativity and humor by submitting your own captions and \u201cthought bubbles.\u201d Then a BizPac Review winner will be announced in a future post. Please take a minute and register as a commenter so you can enter the contest and allow millions of readers around the globe to be dazzled by your brilliance.\n\nExclusive report from NBC News:\n\nObama personally apologizes for Americans losing health insurance.\n\nThe Drudge Report displayed our contest image from Chuck Todd\u2019s interview with this caption: SO SORRY, HE SAYS.\n\nLet us take a moment and reflect upon this scene.\n\nIt was one year ago, on November 6, 2012, when President Obama was reelected with 332 electoral votes to Mitt Romney\u2019s 206, a blow-out victory, even though the popular vote was much closer \u2014 65 million to 60 million.\n\nNow, are any of the 60 million who voted for Romney surprised that on November 7, 2013, President Obama sat down with his in-house cheerleader network, otherwise known as NBC, and apologized for misspeaking about his signature program now wreaking havoc on millions of Americans?\n\nAs one of those 60 million Romney voters, I fully expected Obamacare to be a disaster, but never believed it would be this bad, this soon \u2014 which brings us to our contest.\n\nThis image is \u201ccrying out\u201d for captions that surpass Drudge\u2019s in creativity and non-political correctness.\n\nFurthermore, is it only my imagination, or do I see tears in George Washington\u2019s eyes while he is listening to this conversation? Tears or no tears, George still needs some \u201cthought bubbles,\u201d because you may remember our Founding Father died due to some bad health care involving excessive bloodletting.\n\nOur normal rules of \u201cbe nice and stay classy\u201d are suspended for this contest, since the Obama administration demonstrated it had no rules and no class when it sold Obamacare to the American people. (If Obamacare was a product offered by any American company, the Federal Trade Commission would be shutting it down.)\n\nHowever, this being a \u201cfamily contest\u201d your entries must still display a certain degree of decorum.\n\nHave fun, and will somebody please research if bloodletting is covered under Obamacare?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0\u00a0Here is a Photo Caption Contest from one of our guest writers, Myra Adams, that is currently posted on\u00a0PJ Media.\u00a0Today\u00a0she is\u00a0offering our\u00a0BizPac Review\u00a0readers an opportunity to showcase creativity and humor by submitting your own\u00a0captions and \u201cthought bubbles.\u201d\u00a0Then a BizPac Review winner will be announced in a future post.\u00a0 Please take a minute and register \u2026", "title": "Photo Caption Contest: Is George Washington Crying While Obama Apologizes For Obamacare?", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Obama-sorry.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-09T10:09:24+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2013/11/08/photo-caption-contest-is-george-washington-crying-while-obama-apologizes-for-obamacare-86790", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "tag": "PJ Media", "published_time": "2013-11-08T14:05:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T10:09:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc29\"", "article_summary": "As one of those 60 million Romney voters, I fully expected Obamacare to be a disaster, but never believed it would be this bad, this soon \u2014 which brings us to our contest.\nEditor\u2019s note: Here is a Photo Caption Contest from one of our guest writers, Myra Adams, that is currently posted on PJ Media.\nThe Drudge Report displayed our contest image from Chuck Todd\u2019s interview with this caption: SO SORRY, HE SAYS.\n(If Obamacare was a product offered by any American company, the Federal Trade Commission would be shutting it down.)\nHowever, this being a \u201cfamily contest\u201d your entries must still display a certain degree of decorum."}
