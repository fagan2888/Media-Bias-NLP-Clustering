Although the protein is regularly found in some cancers, its function in cancer development was unclear. So researchers at Oxford University set out to understand the mechanisms by which this protein is involved.\n\n\"As our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation has increased, interest in PAD enzymes as targets for treatments has grown,\" researcher Nick La Thangue, professor from Oxford University's oncology department, said in a statement. \"PAD4's presence in cancer was well known but its role was not \u2014 rather like continually seeing someone at crime scenes but not being able to prove they're involved.\"\n\nFor the study, researchers found cancer cell proliferation is a result of PAD4\u2019s interaction with another protein called E2F-1 \u2014 part of a family of cell regulators that coordinate gene expression during cell proliferation. PAD4 changes an amino acid part of the E2F-1 protein, called arginine, into another amino acid called citrulline; this expression attracts another protein, BRD4. Although E2F-1 plays a role in cancer spread, researchers found PAD4 and BRD4 could switch E2F-1 from promoting proliferation to promoting inflammation, and vice versa.\n\nThis isn't the first time inflammation has been linked to the development of cancer. For example, past research has linked chronic inflammation to a doubled risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\n\"Inflammation plays a key role in a number of cancers. For example, bowel cancer has an early inflammatory stage,\" La Thangue explained.\n\nAfter establishing that PAD4 and BRD4 could play a role in cancer development, scientists conducted a mice study to look at what happens when the two proteins are suppressed. They administered two treatments that inhibited PAD4 and BRD4 expression.\n\nThe results revealed treatment suppressed the cytokine gene expression \u2014 a function behind the movement of cells towards sites of inflammation, infection and trauma \u2014and reduced symptoms of arthritis. And suppressing both proteins proved to be a \"clinically efficacious in preventing disease progression.\"\n\n\"Our results shed light on a new transcription-based mechanism that mediates the inflammatory effect of PAD4,\" researchers wrote.\n\nThey believe understanding the role both PAD4 and BRD4 play in switching E2F-1 to an inflammatory role could better place them to find effective cancer treatments.\n\nSource: Ghari F, Quirke A, Munro S, et al.
