Personally, I\u2019m not happy with the bill, but the way that Congress handled the issue I think was very unprofessional.\u201d -Keegan Etter, sophomore, engineering\n\nMadeline Hardy\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really the biggest fan of it.

I don\u2019t see another option that the other party is presenting as far as what it is going to be available for all people who aren\u2019t of the same class and don\u2019t have the same money available to them. Obamacare provides an alternative and better option.\u201d -Ashaa Russell, senior, athletic training\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "obamacare,quinnipiac,students speak up", "fb": {"app_id": 201509296584634}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "description": "Madeline Hardy \u201cI can see how it can help people because it is going to allow people to get insurance with dire conditions, but I also think that it is going", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9096\"", "article_summary": "If you are making more money than you should have better health care than people who don\u2019t.\u201d -Doug Cassetta, freshman, biologyMadeline Hardy\u201cI think it will help people.\nObamacare provides an alternative and better option.\u201d -Ashaa Russell, senior, athletic trainingComments\nWe might as well make it a real thing because I think it is happening anyways.\u201d -Reshma Joseph, sophomore, international businessMadeline Hardy\u201cIt gives free health care to people who don\u2019t work for it.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not happy with the bill, but the way that Congress handled the issue I think was very unprofessional.\u201d -Keegan Etter, sophomore, engineeringMadeline Hardy\u201cI\u2019m not really the biggest fan of it.\nI feel like it is just going to be harder to find doctors, appointments and things like that, but I never thought it should have escalated to the point that it has come to.\u201d -Danielle Marino, freshman, broadcast journalismMadeline Hardy\u201cI think Obamacare is a good thing so that everyone has healthcare."}
