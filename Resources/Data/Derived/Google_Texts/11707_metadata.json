Scott Walker might be too \u201cintimidated\u201d to defend his healthcare plan against Jindal\u2019s criticisms on the same stage.\n\nJindal using the word \u201cintimidated\u201d to describe Walker is meant to cut into Walker\u2019s campaign messaging, where he frequently argues his battles with labor unions in Wisconsin prove he is \u201cunintimidated\u201d as a leader. Walker\u2019s book title is \u201cUnintimidated,\u201d and that\u2019s also the title of the pro-Walker Super PAC.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s obviously up to him,\u201d the Louisiana Governor said when asked by Breitbart News in the question-and-answer session of the call what he thinks of Walker continuing to refuse to appear on stage with him to defend his new healthcare policy.\n\nI\u2019m happy to talk to anybody anywhere to defend my ideas. This is an audition to become commander-in-chief, this is the most important job in terms of wrecking the future of our country. We\u2019re at a critical point in our nation\u2019s history. Every politician will tell you the next election is the most important one\u2014this one really is. The idea of America in front of us is slipping away. Just think about what we\u2019ve seen in the last seven years\u2014Planned Parenthood is using our tax dollars to dismember babies and sell organs across the country, $18 trillion in debt, a president who\u2019s declared war on trans fat and a truce with Iran who\u2019s on the verge of becoming a nuclear power, our president won\u2019t stand with Israel, our country won\u2019t secure our southern border, we\u2019ve got the Supreme Court trying to redefine marriage and the reality is this: These are important times.\n\nJindal went on to say that Walker seems to be either scared to defend his position, or not ready for primetime for a debate with Jindal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than happy to debate anyone, anywhere, any time, and on this issue his team has tried to respond to some of our thoughts on healthcare,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJust to cut to the chase, I\u2019m more than happy to debate with him or anybody else. This is an important issue and I hope that every candidate\u2014I do want to applaud him for offering a plan even though I disagree with it, I think every candidate should offer their ideas not just on Obamacare but other issues. We\u2019ve offered detailed plans on energy, on defense, on education. That\u2019s one of the reasons I think I\u2019m uniquely positioned. I have the backbone, the experience, and the bandwidth to get this job done. I can\u2019t speak for Scott, maybe he\u2019s intimidated, maybe he\u2019s not ready to debate, but we are.\n\nEarlier in the press call, Jindal explained why he believes that Walker\u2019s plan is a tax increase.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, well a couple of things. First of all, they don\u2019t tell us how they\u2019re going to pay for all of it so obviously I think it\u2019s going to add to the debt and deficit,\u201d Jindal said when Breitbart News asked him why\u2014as a campaign graphic he released argues\u2014Walker\u2019s plan raises taxes.\n\nSecond point, if you actually look at the details, and this is an important point\u2014some Republicans have fallen into this trap\u2014what Walker\u2019s plan does is give a refundable tax credit, gives a refundable tax credit and makes every American potentially eligible for a government subsidy for their healthcare and so they pay for that by capping\u2014one thing, their numbers don\u2019t add up, and they don\u2019t provide enough detail\u2014but one way they try to pay for some of that is to cap the extension that people get currently for their healthcare coverage. But what they\u2019re doing is giving people more money than they pay to the government via a refundable tax credit. That\u2019s not a tax credit, that\u2019s government spending.\n\nJindal compared Walker\u2019s plan for healthcare to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cJust think about this fundamental premise: One of the things we criticized President Obama for is he raised taxes and he redistributed money from, all he wanted to do was redistribute money\u2014he didn\u2019t want to grow the economy,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nWell that is the core of the Walker healthcare plan: It is raising taxes by cutting people\u2019s, capping people\u2019s employer-provided exclusion in terms of their current tax status, and then it is giving some of that money back in terms of a refundable tax credit above and beyond people\u2019s actual tax liability. That has become a clever way for people in D.C. to hide welfare spending and tax credits should only be used in a tailored way or to replace entitlement programs, but one this is a tax increase\u2014and that doesn\u2019t even get to how this doesn\u2019t even cover the full cost. One analyst says the full cost will be a trillion dollars\u2014and so one, you\u2019ve got that concern: Raising taxes to give money back to people who may not have any tax liability. And secondly the bigger concern is instead of talking about how to get rid of or reform existing entitlements\u2014like getting rid of Obamacare or reforming existing entitlements\u2014instead they\u2019re creating a brand new entitlement. I just don\u2019t think as conservatives we should be trying to outbid the Democrats. If this election becomes about who\u2019s willing to give away more free stuff, the other side wins. And let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s not free stuff. We can pretend like we\u2019re paying money, but we\u2019re borrowing it from China and stealing from our children and grandchildren. So, for those two reasons, you\u2019re taking away the tax-exempt status from employer-provided health carriers, capping it and reducing it, and giving government money to folks who don\u2019t have tax liability\u2014and secondly it doesn\u2019t fully detail how they\u2019ll pay for the whole thing, and again one estimate is a trillion dollars, so it looks to me the most likely solutions are tax increases and debt.\n\nWhen a Washington Examiner reporter asked Jindal about previous statements he\u2019s made in favor of some tax credits, Jindal laid out how what Walker wants is substantially different from what he supports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying tax credits are never a good idea,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nWhen they are used in a narrow, tailored way or when they are used to reform an existing program\u2014for example if this program is we\u2019re going to take Medicaid, and turn it into a program of tax credits to help people buy their healthcare, that\u2019s very different from saying as the Walker plan does that we\u2019re going to give tax credits to potentially every American. Remember, that\u2019s breathtaking in its scope. Every American from birth to death could have the government paying for their healthcare under this plan\u2014so from cradle to grave you could have the federal government paying for every American\u2019s healthcare.\n\nAt that point, Jindal again compared Walker\u2019s plan to Obamacare\u2014and questioned why the Wisconsin governor is unwilling to debate him one-on-one to defend his healthcare plan:\n\nThis isn\u2019t saying that tax credits can never be used or are never a good thing, but it\u2019s saying creating a new entitlement program when we are $18 trillion in debt and then saying that we\u2019re going to have the government pay for coverage and we\u2019re going to have the government pay for coverage of potentially every American, this is what President Obama defines as success in healthcare reform. That\u2019s not what conservatives define as success. We define as success reducing the cost of healthcare, making healthcare affordable\u2014and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a mistake. Hey look, I\u2019ve been\u2014I know the Walker team has said some things about my approach. I\u2019m more than happy to debate Scott any time, any where about healthcare. I offered to do it\u2014I\u2019m happy to do it any place, any time and contrast our approaches. My plan which came out over a year ago involves a standard tax deduction, it involves very targeted help to help those who are truly vulnerable, and its real focus is on reducing cost and making healthcare affordable. If we concede the premise, if we say to President Obama and the Democrats \u2018ok, you guys are right, the way we\u2019re going to judge success is we\u2019re going to have a new entitlement program, redistribute, we\u2019re going to raise taxes, and we\u2019re going to judge success by how many people get insurance cards whether they have real access or not,\u2019 then we\u2019ve lost. That\u2019s what the Walker plan does\u2014it\u2019s fighting on the Democrats\u2019 terms. We got to stop doing that as a party, and Obamacare is one example of that but unfortunately we\u2019ve got leaders in D.C. who do that across the board.\n\nOver the course of several hours on Friday afternoon, at least four Walker aides refused to answer yes or no whether Walker was \u201cintimidated\u201d by Jindal\u2019s challenge. They also repeatedly refused to answer whether Walker would in fact appear opposite Jindal on a stage to defend his healthcare plan in the face of Jindal\u2019s criticisms, and eventually provided Breitbart News with a statement from spokeswoman AshLee Strong\u2014a statement identical to one they provided in response to the first line of attack from Jindal on this exact topic several days ago. At that point, Jindal had called Walker\u2019s plan \u201cObamacare-lite.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernor Walker\u2019s plan is getting rave reviews from the conservative movement for being a thoughtful, substantive, and viable plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare and make health care affordable and accessible for Americans,\u201d Strong said\u2014again the exact same quote she gave earlier in the week. \u201cThe refundable health care tax credits the governor includes have been supported by many conservatives because they put health care decision making in the hands of the American people where it belongs.\u201d\n\nWhen Breitbart News noted the oddity of Walker\u2019s team not providing a new quote in response to Jindal\u2019s new quotes\u2013providing the exact same quote Breitbart News previously printed\u2013Walker\u2019s team still wouldn\u2019t provide a new quote. But they did share an interview the governor gave to Fox\u2019s Greta Van Susteren from the night before in which Walker deflected a question from the Fox anchor about whether he\u2019d debate Jindal on healthcare policy.\n\n\u201cI think in the end I\u2019m going to debate people who are on the panel with me at the next debate,\u201d Walker said when Van Susteren asked him if he\u2019d defend his healthcare plan by debating Jindal.\n\nIf he makes the cuts or anybody else does, I will be debating them how they mix it up. Whether they mix it up or do it by the top ten. I\u2019m ready to talk about this with the American people. I\u2019m looking not to pick fights with one candidate or the other. I\u2019m looking to go out and talk to the American people. I\u2019m not intimidated by anything. The best debate I would love to have is with Hillary Clinton on this. Hillary Clinton was for this kind of plan before Barack Obama even pushed Obamacare. In 1993, the early 1990s, she was pushing Hillary Clinton\u2014she talked about the government mandate in primary election. She would make this even worse.\n\nWhen asked if Walker saying on that show that he\u2019s \u201cnot intimidated by anything\u201d meant that he would accept Jindal\u2019s challenge rather than cower away from it, Walker\u2019s team of press consultants again refused to answer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jindal calling Walker \"intimidated\" aims to cut into his messaging, as argues his battles with labor unions prove he is unintimidated.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jindal calling Walker \"intimidated\" aims to cut into his messaging, as argues his battles with labor unions prove he is unintimidated.", "title": "Bobby Jindal: Scott Walker Too \u2018Intimidated\u2019 To Debate Healthcare Plan - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/bobby-jindal-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/22/bobby-jindal-scott-walker-too-intimidated-to-debate-healthcare-plan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jindal calling Walker \"intimidated\" aims to cut into his messaging, as argues his battles with labor unions prove he is unintimidated.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/bobby-jindal-AP.jpg", "title": "Bobby Jindal: Scott Walker Too \u2018Intimidated\u2019 To Debate Healthcare Plan - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Bobby Jindal, healthcare, obamacare, Scott Walker,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,jindal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Scott Walker", "published_time": "2015-08-22T05:09:57-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc12\"", "article_summary": "Scott Walker might be too \u201cintimidated\u201d to defend his healthcare plan against Jindal\u2019s criticisms on the same stage.\nJindal compared Walker\u2019s plan for healthcare to Obamacare.\nEarlier in the press call, Jindal explained why he believes that Walker\u2019s plan is a tax increase.\nJindal went on to say that Walker seems to be either scared to defend his position, or not ready for primetime for a debate with Jindal.\n\u201cI\u2019m more than happy to debate anyone, anywhere, any time, and on this issue his team has tried to respond to some of our thoughts on healthcare,\u201d Jindal said."}
