In his first public remarks since the release of a damning Senate report on the use of torture by intelligence officers, CIA Director John Brennan on Thursday called into question the fairness of the committee that reviewed the agency’s activities and cast doubt on one of the report’s central findings: that torture never produced useful information.

Brennan, a career spy who has served as the agency's director since 2013, hearkened back to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, during a rare public news conference at the cloistered CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. He recounted the fear and anger within an agency he said had been “ringing the bell” on the al-Qaida threat “for many months,” and the sudden rush to arms to prevent potential further attacks.

The CIA's response included getting authorization from the White House and Department of Justice to use what the agency refers to as "enhanced interrogation techniques" and what others consider methods of torture.

“The previous administration faced agonizing choices over how to pursue al-Qaida and prevent additional attacks against our country,” Brennan said. “There were no easy answers. And whatever your views were on EITs, our nation, and in particular our agency, did a lot of things right during this difficult time to keep the country strong and secure.”
