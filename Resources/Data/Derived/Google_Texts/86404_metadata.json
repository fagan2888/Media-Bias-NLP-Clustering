More than half of the representatives missed one to nine days during the session, with congressional hopeful Rep. Jenny Horne, R-Summerville, acquiring the second-most-days absent, primarily for family medical reasons.\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 Summerville Republican Rep. Jenny Horne was the second-most-absent state House lawmaker in 2015, but, like others, she doesn\u2019t expect juggling family, work and legislative obligations will interfere with her 2016 congressional campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for eight years. I can certainly do it,\u201d Horne said. \u201cI\u2019ve juggled a lot of different responsibilities over the years, and I\u2019m looking forward to my campaign for Congress.\u201d\n\nAbsences and late arrivals are the norm for most state House lawmakers who travel to the capital city weekly and work Tuesday through Thursday from January to June or longer. But changing that norm was part of a shift by Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Hartsville, in his first year leading the House.\n\n\u201cPunctuality should be a cardinal virtue,\u201d Lucas told The Associated Press before leading the 2015 session. \u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s time. Let\u2019s make sure we use it wisely.\u201d\n\nAttendance votes alone don\u2019t show the full story. While lawmakers like Rep. Joe Neal and Rep. Mia McLeod missed 44 and 40 attendance votes, respectively, by signing in later in the day as present, the House journal shows Neal absent 6 times and McLeod once. Besides establishing a quorum, the attendance votes note whether a member qualifies for the $140 per diem for their daily expenses.\n\nMost senators have similar attendance records to their House peers, but Senate record-keeping makes a direct comparison to House records difficult.\n\nOut of 64 House attendance votes, between Jan. 13 and July 9, Horne missed 8 and had 14 excused absences. Aging family members with medical problems caused an increase in absences for Horne, as well as a planned trip to New York with her daughter during the last week of session in early June.\n\nHorne, a third-term delegate, is challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford for the 1st Congressional District seat. Sanford won a 2013 special election for the seat and was re-elected in 2014.\n\n\u201cCertainly I\u2019m going to be busy running for Congress and I\u2019ll be doing a lot of campaigning,\u201d Horne said. \u201cBut I always try to be there and I always take my job very seriously.\u201d\n\nAs a lawyer, Horne said occasional court appearances prevent voting present during a roughly 30-minute window at the start of session. She isn\u2019t alone; several other lawyer-lawmakers \u2014 such as Richland County Democratic Reps. Chris Hart, Todd Rutherford and James Smith \u2014 show up late more often than their peers, on average.\n\nRep. Leon Stavrinakis, D-Charleston, said it was tough handling similar responsibilities along with his Charleston mayoral run in 2015.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of demands on my time; between running my law practice, my commitment to serve in the Legislature, trying to campaign and balancing it all to make sure Charleston was taken care of,\u201d Stavrinakis said.\n\nWith announcements, bill introductions and recognitions occurring at the start of the daily session, many lawmakers know they have wiggle room to finish up constituent or committee meetings. Stavrinakis said that mentality shifts for a week in early March when the budget is debated, something he thinks could be replicated other weeks of the session, especially if it were shortened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we could. There are some ceremonial things that are part of any legislative body, so you\u2019re not going to eliminate that completely,\u201d Stavrinakis said. \u201cShortening the session would force us to streamline the use of our time and I\u2019ve supported that.\u201d\n\nStavrinakis missed four days, as did fellow Lowcountry colleagues Democrat Rep. Wendell Gilliard and Republican Reps. Jim Merrill and Seth Whipper.\n\nBut even if lawmakers clock in on time or late, they may also leave early.\n\nHorne, for example, voted present the morning of May 28 and Stavrinakis came later, but neither were still around for the afternoon vote to send the criminal domestic violence bill, which they both supported in prior votes, to Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s desk.\n\nLawyer and Rep. Chris Murphy, R-North Charleston, who missed 17 days, also came late and left early, missing the same vote.\n\nMedical issues and court appearances were given for his multiple absences, according to the House journal.\n\nA severe spinal cord injury put Myrtle Beach Republican Mike Ryhal out of office for the first two months of 2015 contributing to the 23 days he missed \u2014 just a day more than Horne.\n\nOnly seven lawmakers had double-digit absences, whereas only nine out of 124 House lawmakers were present for all attendance votes and had no excused absences during the 2015 session.\n\nReps. Stephen Goldfinch, R-Murrells Inlet, and Mike Sottile, R-Isle of Palms, were among the nine. Sottile, an insurance agent serving his fourth term, said his flexible schedule allows him to manage obligations and maintain the punctuality he learned in the military.\n\n\u201cWe go in about 10 o\u2019clock in the morning and sometimes by the time you take roll call and get a quorum it\u2019s 11 o\u2019clock before we do anything,\u201d Sottile said. \u201cWe just need to make an effort to be there and be there on time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Most House lawmakers are late to work, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLegislature, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Chris Murphy,Jay Lucas,Jenny Horne,Joe Neal,Legislature,Leon Stavrinakis,Mia McLeod,Michael Sottile,Statehouse", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 Summerville Republican Rep.
