A police officer comes along and helps with the search for a while, then asks if it\u2019s certain that the keys were lost in that area.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d the drunk says. \u201cI lost them on the other side of the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are we looking here?!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the light is better!\u201d\n\nIn a way, the joke captures the situation with public oversight of politics and public policy. The field overall is poorly illuminated, but the best light shines on campaign finance. There\u2019s more data there, so we hear a lot about how legislators get into office. We don\u2019t keep especially close tabs on what elected officials do once they\u2019re in office, even though that\u2019s what matters most.\n\n(That\u2019s my opinion, anyway, animated by the vision of an informed populace keeping tabs on legislation and government spending as closely as they track, y\u2019know, baseball, the stock market, and the weather.)\n\nOur Deepbills project just might help improve things. As I announced in late August, we recently achieved the milestone of marking up every version of every bill in the 113th Congress with semantically rich XML. That means that computers can automatically discover references in federal legislation to existing laws in every citation format, to agencies and bureaus, and to budget authorities (both authorizations of appropriations and appropriations).\n\nMachine-readable bills can tell stories that we hadn\u2019t heard before, and Deepbills has interesting information about the 113th Congress. The image above is of a visualization showing partisan interest in existing laws during the 113th Congress.\n\nWhat laws were Republican members of Congress trying to amend the most in 2013 and 2014? What about Democrats? The visualization has your answers. Click to see it. As far as I know, it\u2019s the first time this information has been available.\n\nYes, your expectation of a Republican fixation on Obamacare is generally confirmed (as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). And you won\u2019t be surprised to see Democratic interest in the Family and Medical Leave Act. Democrats legislate more than Republicans; that jibes with expectations.\n\nThe new information here, for many people, is the relative numerosity and bipartisan interest in amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and Social Security Act. These two laws are vastly more important to Congress than pretty much anything else, by this imperfect metric.\n\nIs the public spending its time focused on partisan issues, not realizing where their representatives are spending their time? Knowing this may change the behavior of all actors.\n\nThis data is hard to produce, and I live in fear of gross errors in the data or the creation of the visualization. Happily, a more authoritative source\u2014Congress\u2014has committed itself to providing data like this in the future. They\u2019ll do a much better job originating bills as data than we could possibly do with post-processing. Early this year, aware of our work, the House amended its rules, asking the Committee on House Administration, the House Clerk, and others to \u201cbroaden the availability of legislative documents in machine readable formats.\u201d\n\nI look forward to better data giving political scientists more skillful than me the chance to formulate and test theses about congressional behavior. It will be especially interesting when we have time series data so we can see if it\u2019s really true that senators get magically interested in home-state issues during the year-and-a-half before election time. And\u2014oh yeah\u2014won\u2019t it be neat when the public can oversee Congress directly and clearly through hundreds of web sites, information services, and apps? Yes, it will.\n\nThanks go to Sam Corcos for producing this visualization, and to the Democracy Fund for supporting the Deepbills work that made it possible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Machine-readable bills can tell stories that we hadn\u2019t heard before, and Deepbills has interesting information about the 113th Congress.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Machine-readable bills can tell stories that we hadn't heard before, and Deepbills has interesting information about the 113th Congress.", "title": "Better Data, More Light on Congress", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/better-data-better-light-congress", "image": "http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/acts_in_bills_viz_ii.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/better-data-better-light-congress", "title": "Better Data, More Light on Congress", "description": "Machine-readable bills can tell stories that we hadn't heard before, and Deepbills has interesting information about the 113th Congress.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/10/7", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-13T11:54:27-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/10/13", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Is the public spending its time focused on partisan issues, not realizing where their representatives are spending their time?\nThis data is hard to produce, and I live in fear of gross errors in the data or the creation of the visualization.\n!\u201d\u201cBecause the light is better!\u201dIn a way, the joke captures the situation with public oversight of politics and public policy.\nThey\u2019ll do a much better job originating bills as data than we could possibly do with post-processing.\nMachine-readable bills can tell stories that we hadn\u2019t heard before, and Deepbills has interesting information about the 113th Congress."}
