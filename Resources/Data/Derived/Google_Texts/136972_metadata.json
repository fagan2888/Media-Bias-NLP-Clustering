Sylvie Lamontagne collected herself, then spelled her 22nd word of the evening as she traced each letter in the palm of her left hand.\n\n\u201cO-S-S-I-F-R-A-G-E,\u201d the 13-year-old eighth-grader at Creighton Middle School in Lakewood said evenhandedly.\n\nWith that, Sylvie on Saturday became the first back-to-back winner of the Colorado State Spelling Bee in decades, an honor only possible with a rules change that now allows the previous year\u2019s champion speller to compete.\n\n\u201cI was pretty sure I knew it,\u201d she said of her long pause at the mike while atop the auditorium stage at the University of Denver\u2019s Sturm Hall. \u201cBut I just wanted to be really sure.\u201d\n\nLast year, Sylvie wore the number \u201c1\u201d around her neck. This year, she wore lucky \u201c7.\u201d\n\nSylvie bested 34 finalists in the 22-round competition, the 76th anniversary of the bee, which is put on by The Denver Post Community Foundation. The finalists were whittled from about 280 students in grades 4-8 across the state.\n\nShe\u2019ll head off to the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., in May \u2014 and have another shot at winning $30,000.\n\nLast year, Sylvie finished ninth in the national bee, stumped by the word \u201ccerastes.\u201d\n\nSylvie actually needed to spell two words correctly after second-place finisher Austin McBride, an eighth-grader at Campus Middle School in Greenwood Village, missed \u201cstrychnine.\u201d\n\nPrior to \u201cossifrage,\u201d Sylvie correctly spelled \u201creticle,\u201d which are the cross hairs in the lens of a telescope or other sighting instrument. Then came her winning word.\n\nWith a trophy, medal and new dictionary, Sylvie also receives an all-expenses paid trip to the national bee.\n\nThe competition came with months of practice, according to Sylvie\u2019s father, Jeff, the executive director of the Bluff Lake Nature Center in Denver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate in saying how hard she\u2019s worked for this,\u201d the beaming father said. \u201cShe felt personally responsible for the rule change and didn\u2019t want to do poorly.\u201d\n\nSylvie worked on her spelling skills about 27 hours a week in the four months prior to Saturday\u2019s competition, Lamontagne said. Sylvie will attend Lakewood High School in the fall, he said.\n\nEvent organizers were persuaded to change a rule \u2014 in place about 20 years \u2014 that prevented anyone from becoming a repeat winner. But during the national spelling bee, Jeff Lamontagne said there are a number of competitors who return year after year.\n\n\u201cI can see the reasons for it and not,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Colorado kids couldn\u2019t compete but the one time at the nationals.\u201d\n\nEach pupil used their best device to aid in latching onto a tricky spelling. Some visualized the word; others used a finger to trace each letter on the back of the number placard hanging at their waist. Still others stalled for time, asking for word derivations, parts of speech, alternate pronunciations and uses in a sentence.\n\nLongtime word-reader Charley Samson cheerfully repeated anything the kids needed.\n\nIn the 10th round, Siddarth Ijju of Challenge School in Denver was stymied by \u201cvapor,\u201d spelling it as \u201cvapour.\u201d The disqualification bell dinged, and he quietly walked offstage to applause \u2014 the only time anyone claps during the bee except the very end.\n\nMoments later, the judges reversed themselves to allow for the alternative British spelling, and, to applause, Siddarth was allowed back into the competition. He was undone five rounds later by \u201cmellisonant.\u201d\n\nCo-third-place finisher, Bryn Flanigan, an eighth-grader at Girls Athletic Leadership School in Denver, repeated the same finish as last year, this time tripped up by \u201cnormergic.\u201d The other third-place finisher, Andrew Haapala of Sacred Heart of Jesus in Boulder, erred just after Bryn on \u201cglaucous.\u201d\n\nAn ossifrage, by the way, is an Old World vulture that swallowed and digested bones it is said to have smashed by tossing them onto rocks.\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or @davidmigoya", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado spelling bee champ repeats win at state contest", "title": "Colorado spelling bee champ repeats win at state contest", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/colorado-spelling-bee-champ-repeats-win-at-state-contest/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T20:06:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T20:06:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Consumer news, K-12 education"}, "article_summary": "She\u2019ll head off to the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., in May \u2014 and have another shot at winning $30,000.\nBut during the national spelling bee, Jeff Lamontagne said there are a number of competitors who return year after year.\nWith a trophy, medal and new dictionary, Sylvie also receives an all-expenses paid trip to the national bee.\nWith that, Sylvie on Saturday became the first back-to-back winner of the Colorado State Spelling Bee in decades, an honor only possible with a rules change that now allows the previous year\u2019s champion speller to compete.\nSylvie Lamontagne collected herself, then spelled her 22nd word of the evening as she traced each letter in the palm of her left hand."}
