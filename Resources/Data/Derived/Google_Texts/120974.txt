Americans for Prosperity continued its campaign of standing up against Obamacare with the announcement Thursday of a series of television ad buys in Florida.

Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, joined state director Slade O’Brien in Central Florida to unveil two new ads focusing on Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., and Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Fla., holding the lawmakers accountable for their support of Obamacare.



“President Obama told the lie of the year,” one ad begins. “And Congressman Grayson backed him up.” Grayson is then heard saying, “Everyone will love this bill.”

Thursday’s announcement followed the launch of a television commercial Wednesday in support of U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., for his opposition to Obamacare.

“Nancy Pelosi famously stated we have to pass the bill to find out what’s in the bill,” O’Brien told BizPac Review. “Americans are finally learning just what’s in the bill… and they don’t like it. They are learning they many Americans can’t keep their plan. It time for those that voted for this travesty to put politics aside, put people first and stand up against what is clearly bad public policy.”

Americans for Prosperity is spending a combined $400,000 for the Grayson and Garcia ads, and another $160,000 for the Southerland ad. Since August, the group has spent more than $27 million across the country on similar ads.
