Can tax pros prepare for Obamacare?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service is ramping up to figure out who has health insurance and who doesn\u2019t under Obamacare \u2014 but for now it is giving people the benefit of the doubt.\n\nFor the first time, come January, people will have to indicate on their 2014 tax forms whether they have health coverage. The IRS will have to figure out who is covered and who is fibbing to avoid the Affordable Care Act\u2019s penalty for not holding insurance.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCongressional scorekeepers expect about 4 million individuals to owe the fee in 2016.\n\nA key question is \u2014 how many will be honest and pay it voluntarily? Professional tax preparers \u2014 used by more than half of Americans \u2014 will be the first line of defense.\n\nThe IRS tells the preparers to use current standards and common sense \u2014 just as they always have. But some are worried that won\u2019t be enough to guide them through this new world of coverage, mandates and penalties.\n\n\u201cThose that for whatever reason want to mislead the system \u2014 what do you do about them?\u201d asked Mark Steber, chief tax officer at tax prep firm Jackson Hewitt. \u201cThe IRS tells us to use the current rules. We would have liked to have a little bit more security with such a dramatic change in the tax law in the last 25 years.\u201d\n\nThe key question comes on Line 61 of the 1040 Form, which in its 2014 draft form simply reads: \u201chealth care: individual responsibility.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve got insurance, you check the box. If you qualify for one of the myriad exemptions, you submit a new Obamacare tax Form 8965 (although that process has pitfalls of its own).\n\nThe IRS says it is not issuing new guidance to spell out how preparers must make sure that a taxpayer has a minimum level of health coverage \u2014 or is trying to avoid the 1 percent or $95 first year charge. An agency official told practitioners recently it should use current \u201cdue diligence\u201d standards but also, in some cases, just rely on what the taxpayer tells them.\n\nThe tax agency uses third-party reporting \u2014 in this case, health insurers and the marketplaces \u2014 to verify individuals\u2019 information. Preparers typically ask for supporting documentation, but they have latitude depending on the question.\n\n\u201cTax preparers should follow their normal due diligence in determining if their client has appropriate health coverage,\u201d IRS spokesman Bruce Friedland said.\n\nIt\u2019s a type of honor system the tax system is largely based on.\n\nFor example, a homeowner who claims the mortgage interest deduction doesn\u2019t need to include the proof because the bank is also sending the IRS forms. Most taxpayers know they are taking a risk, though only a fraction of filers are audited.\n\nBut as with most things related to Obamacare, compliance is more complicated than that, especially in the first year.\n\nThe delay in the employer mandate \u2014 it won\u2019t start to go into effect until next year \u2014 means most businesses don\u2019t have to document health care coverage to either employees filing taxes or the IRS for tax year 2014.\n\nAnd smaller businesses aren\u2019t required to cover workers, so they have no reporting requirements.\n\nThe IRS has for months been holding meetings with the slew of professional groups that help consumers file tax returns, including certified public accountants and enrolled agents.\n\n\u201cThis has been a repetitive theme among CPAs and independent practitioners: What are the due diligence requirements?\u201d said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block who has attended many of these calls.\n\n\u201cThere is enough good third-party information to validate \u2014 there really isn\u2019t a lot of obvious areas for fraud here,\u201d she said. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why the CPAs and others are so concerned about this,\u201d though she speculated that law\u2019s newness and enormous size are likely factors.\n\nThe IRS\u2019 Friedland said, \u201cTaxpayers are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the tax returns that they sign.\u201d\n\nThe agency has said it has \u201chundreds of employees\u201d devoted to implementing the tax parts of the law, though at the same time Congress has cut its budget to below 2010 levels.\n\nRepublicans, most of whom make no secret of loathing the entire health care law, have been hounding the administration for the potential for fraud, likening it to the earned income tax credit.\n\nThe agency gives preparers a long list of requirements to ensure against fraud in that tax program for low-income earners. Preparers face a $500 fine if they fail to comply with this due diligence.\n\nBut tax preparers and other experts said the potential for fraud with the Obamacare tax credits \u2014 a separate issue from the individual mandate \u2014 is much lower than with the EITC.\n\nFor starters, the EITC worker tax credit is refundable for cash. But the insurance tax credit works differently. The government usually pays the premium tax credit in advance, directly to the insurer. It doesn\u2019t end up in the consumer\u2019s pocket.\n\nConsumers could pay for health insurance upfront and then try to claim the credits improperly \u2014 but most preparers say that is unlikely.\n\nNot all preparers think they need more guidance from the IRS.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we need is another checklist, the EITC has an enormous checklist, which can be arduous,\u201d said Bob Kerr, senior director for government relations at the National Association of Enrolled Agents, which represents mostly small offices of self-employed tax preparers. \u201cWe are expected to exercise our judgment \u2014 not to pre-audit returns \u2014 and rest assured, we are going to interview our clients and then use our best judgment.\u201d\n\nOne tricky issue for tax preparers is that the law has its naysayers, to put it mildly.\n\n\u201cYou have tax professionals on the front line of something that it is safe to say is fairly controversial \u2014 and enrolled agents will have clients who are not fans of the ACA,\u201d Kerr said.\n\nThe American Institute of CPAs doesn\u2019t have an official position on whether the IRS should issue more guidance on verifying minimum coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be asking probing questions, so you don\u2019t leave yourself open for penalties,\u201d said Kristin Esposito, a technical manager on the AICPA staff.\n\nIt might not be as simple as finding an insurance form \u2014 because that might not spell out how plans actually qualify for minimum essential coverage. Most employer-sponsored insurance and any obtained through the marketplace meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nFor now, preparers are bracing themselves to handle a giant new federal tax program.\n\n\u201cWhether we need more rules depends on how voluminous the bad behavior is \u2014 we just don\u2019t know,\u201d Steber said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The IRS will have to figure out who is fibbing about having health insurance.", "title": "Can tax pros prepare for Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/irs-obamacare-113245.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/01/141201_john_koskinen_gty_6291.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Taxes,IRS,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The IRS will have to figure out who is fibbing about having health insurance.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0393\"", "article_summary": "But tax preparers and other experts said the potential for fraud with the Obamacare tax credits \u2014 a separate issue from the individual mandate \u2014 is much lower than with the EITC.\nIf you qualify for one of the myriad exemptions, you submit a new Obamacare tax Form 8965 (although that process has pitfalls of its own).\nProfessional tax preparers \u2014 used by more than half of Americans \u2014 will be the first line of defense.\nCan tax pros prepare for Obamacare?\n\u201cTax preparers should follow their normal due diligence in determining if their client has appropriate health coverage,\u201d IRS spokesman Bruce Friedland said."}
