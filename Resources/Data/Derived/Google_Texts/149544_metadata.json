Mary Landrieu nor Republican challenger Bill Cassidy winning 50 percent of the vote.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s top two Senate candidates fought to what amounted to a draw on Election Night, leaving one of the nation\u2019s most expensive Senate races undecided for another month.\n\nNone of the candidates crossed the 50 percent threshold needed for victory, the Associated Press projected, so Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy and three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu will proceed to a runoff scheduled for December 6. Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who drew the support of the Senate Conservatives Fund, didn\u2019t get enough support to advance.\n\nThe result of Tuesday\u2019s vote leaves unsettled a campaign that the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports is the state\u2019s costliest Senate race ever.\n\nA staggering amount of cash has flooded into the race, with outside groups dropping more than $17 million and the top three candidates spending a further $25 million as of mid-October. Landrieu\u2019s spending is nearly double that of Cassidy, $14.99 million to Cassidy\u2019s $7.85 million.\n\nDon\u2019t let the money fool you, however\u2014the race has drawn so much attention not for long policy advertorials but for issues of personality and family.\n\n\u201cDaughter\u201d was the second-most Googled search term for the Louisiana race, the Washington Examiner reported. Cassidy, a doctor by trade, announced during the campaign that his teenage daughter was expecting a child.\n\n\n\nFor the senior senator from Louisiana, the lasting image from her fourth Senate campaign will be a keg stand. Not her own\u2014but Landrieu did provide an assist to a man doing a keg stand at Louisiana State University.\n\nCassidy was not amused, responding to the keg stand by slamming binge-drinking as \u201cassociated with DWIs, with traffic facilities, with death on campuses, with rape of young women, with fistfights.\u201d\n\nLandrieu has portrayed herself as a Senate centrist who has led federal policy on the BP oil spill response, while her Republican challenger has painted himself as pro-life and pro-gun, and says will fight the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "timkmak"}, "keywords": "Google, Mary Landrieu, u.s. poli, 2014 Election, Louisiana", "publicationDate": 201411050406, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The state\u2019s costliest Senate campaign ever will last another month, with neither Democratic Sen.
