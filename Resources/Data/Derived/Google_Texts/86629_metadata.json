Officials continue to sound upbeat about the marketplaces, which are scheduled to open Saturday for a second enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we\u2019re going to have a successful open enrollment,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said Monday.\n\nNevertheless, the lower expectations drew criticism from Obamacare\u2019s opponents and supporters.\n\n\u201cThe administration is again trying to rewrite its definition of success,\u201d Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said.\n\nThe new numbers also suggest that the administration is not prepared to reach more uninsured Americans, which administration officials have said is the most important metric, said Jon Kingsdale, who ran Massachusetts\u2019 insurance marketplace from 2006 to 2010. That program was the model for the federal marketplaces.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that there is not a sufficiently sophisticated outreach effort to get people covered,\u201d he said.\n\nSurveys suggest that about 8 million to 10 million uninsured people have gained coverage this year since the marketplaces opened and Medicaid was expanded in many states under the law. Some 30 million people remain uninsured, however.\n\nThe law this year allowed Americans who don\u2019t get health benefits at work to shop among plans on new state-based marketplaces.\n\nConsumers making less than four times the federal poverty level \u2014 or about $94,000 for a family of four \u2014 qualify for subsidies.\n\nTotal enrollment in the marketplaces, although an imprecise metric, has been watched closely because sustained growth is considered vital to reducing the number of uninsured and keeping premiums in check by getting healthier Americans into the market.\n\nBy most measures, the marketplaces\u2019 first year has been a success, with enrollment surpassing the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 2014 estimate of 6 million, and with new insurers joining for 2015.\n\nThe marketplaces beat the estimate even though nearly 1 million people who signed up for health plans this year lost coverage because they didn\u2019t pay or were deemed ineligible, or because they found coverage elsewhere.\n\nAdministration officials said Monday that they had finished terminating coverage for those with unresolved immigration issues, which resulted in some 112,000 people losing their insurance in the federally run marketplace.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which policymakers rely on to assess the effect of legislation, has estimated that 13 million people would enroll in the marketplaces in 2015.\n\nThe CBO projected that 24 million would enroll in 2016, and 25 million every year thereafter.\n\nThe swift increase in enrollment has long made supporters of the law anxious.\n\nTechnological issues, although far less severe than last year, continue to plague the enrollment system.\n\nAt the same time, the second enrollment period is only three months, half as long as the first. Burwell acknowledged Monday that reaching a new group of uninsured would be more difficult because they sat out the first year.\n\nBut administration officials said the lower enrollment estimate also took into account new research that showed more Americans were remaining in employer-provided coverage and more consumers were purchasing health plans directly from insurers, rather than using the marketplaces.\n\nFinally, the health agency notes that previous coverage expansions of government healthcare programs have taken more than three years to be complete.\n\n\u201cThe evidence from the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and early Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act suggest that the long-run steady state may not be achieved for as much as five years,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services noted in a memo explaining the new enrollment estimates.\n\nAdministration officials would not say what they thought enrollment would be in five years.\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Estimates lowered of how many people will sign up for Obamacare in 2015", "date": "2014-11-10", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The Obama administration has substantially scaled back estimates of how many people will sign up for insurance in 2015 through the federal healthcare law, projecting that millions fewer Americans will use marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Estimates lowered of how many people will sign up for Obamacare in 2015", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obamacare-enrollment-projections-20141110-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5460f145/turbine/la-na-obamacare-enrollment-projections-20141110", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obama, Obamacare, ACA, enrollment", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81930965", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Obama, Obamacare, ACA, enrollment", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The Obama administration has substantially scaled back estimates of how many people will sign up for insurance in 2015 through the federal healthcare law, projecting that millions fewer Americans will use marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
