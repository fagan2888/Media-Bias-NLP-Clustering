It ran into immediate, strong opposition from Republicans and business leaders, especially in agriculture, calling it a massive land grab by the federal government.\n\nThe EPA, which is working on the rule along with the Army Corps of Engineers, has said those assertions are dead wrong. Officials have repeatedly said that the rule would not significantly expand the government\u2019s authority, most recently in a series of questions and answers about the rule Monday.\n\nBut those actions fell largely on deaf ears. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed the bill in July to kill the proposal.\n\nThe full House is likely to vote on the bill Tuesday.\n\nThe measure is unlikely to gain the support of a majority in the Senate. Only 30 senators, all Republican, signed on in June to a bill to block the rule.\n\n\u201cIn the end, H.R. 5078 would sow more confusion and invite more conflict at a time when our\n\ncommunities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water regulation,\u201d the White House wrote Monday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill would \u201ccreate significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance,\u201d the White House said.", "description": "The bill would \u201ccreate significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance,\u201d the White House said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill would \u201ccreate significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance,\u201d the White House said.", "title": "White House threatens to veto bill to kill EPA water rule", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/217009-white-house-threatens-to-veto-bill-to-kill-epa-water-rule", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/217009-white-house-threatens-to-veto-bill-to-kill-epa-water-rule", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-08T17:48-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Waters of the United States,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-08T17:48:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/217009-white-house-threatens-to-veto-bill-to-kill-epa-water-rule", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill would \u201ccreate significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance,\u201d the White House said.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House threatens to veto bill to kill EPA water rule"}, "dcterms.title": "White House threatens to veto bill to kill EPA water rule"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd69e\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cClarifying the scope of the [Clean Water Act] helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy,\u201d the White House wrote in a notice to House leaders.\n5078 would sow more confusion and invite more conflict at a time when ourcommunities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water regulation,\u201d the White House wrote Monday.\nCiting the need to protect waterways from pollution and the rule\u2019s scientific grounding, the White House said it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the bill and advisers would recommend that President Obama veto it if it reaches his desk.\nThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed the bill in July to kill the proposal.\nThe EPA, which is working on the rule along with the Army Corps of Engineers, has said those assertions are dead wrong."}
