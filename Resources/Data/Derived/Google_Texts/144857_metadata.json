(C-SPAN cameras captured Trump looking perturbed after the barb, which only added to the toll.) Meyers\u2019 put-down perfectly captured the absurdity of Trump\u2019s grandiose desires. And sure enough, he opted out of running and largely faded into the political background.\n\nBut fast-forward four years and Trump and his divisive brand of nativist, right-wing rants have risen from the political dead to capture the spotlight. Basking in mounting headlines less than one month before the first Republican debate, where Trump and his bombastic immigrant bashing is almost sure to dominate the news cycle, the Republican brand-maker has created massive headaches for the GOP.\n\nAnd note that the emerging Trumpmentum unfurled itself at the same time Republicans have struggled during the national debate about the Confederate flag, coming in the wake of its association with the alleged killer in last month\u2019s South Carolina shooting rampage in an historical black church.\n\nIndeed, the front page of the New York Times last Friday featured two articles detailing a pair of mini crises Republican leaders were forced to grapple with: Trump\u2019s troubling rise in the polls, and the messy debate that broke out in the House of Representatives when Republicans at the last minute tried to introduce an amendment to protect the Confederate flag in national cemeteries, only to then withdraw the controversial measure. A \u201cfiasco,\u201d is how the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank described the GOP\u2019s confederate flag two-step; the Times tagged it \u201can embarrassment.\u201d\n\nThose two issues bedeviling the GOP are inexorably linked. And a key force driving both is Fox News.\n\nContorting itself into ugly dead ends over the issues of race and immigrant bashing, Republicans have themselves to blame for allowing this kind of ugliness to fester unobstructed for years. But Republicans can also blame Fox News for the party\u2019s unfolding summer of discontent.\n\nWhy Fox? Because the cable channel has given Trump a platform for years to spout his loopy, hateful rhetoric, including his \u201cbirther\u201d charade from 2011, which Fox practically co-sponsored. And note that last month, Trump landed more Fox airtime than any other GOP campaign hopeful. So yes, when Fox\u2019s programming regularly pushes out xenophobia to Republican viewers, you can\u2019t be surprised when Republican viewers embrace a xenophobic candidate.\n\nAs for the Confederate flag, Fox News shoulders some blame because of the channel\u2019s hallmark, toxic race-baiting during the Obama years. As conservatives grapple with the historic legacy of slavery and day-to-day racial injustices it\u2019s impossible not to notice that previous pattern of ugly rhetoric lurking beneath the surface of the flag debate, especially while Fox hosts and analysts play down the significance of removing the Civil War artifact.
