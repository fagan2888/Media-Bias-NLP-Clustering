[Editor’s note: The U.S. Geological Survey has revised the magnitude of the quake from a 2.7M to 2.6.]

No, that window-rattling boom-and-shake some of us felt just before 6:30 p.m. wasn’t the celebration surrounding the almost-end to The Worst Football Game Ever Played. Nor was it the football gods mourning the end of Tony Romo’s first half of the season after the Cowboys’ QB broke his left clavicle. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, and my nerves, it was just another earthquake — the latest to rattle Irving since they started swarming at the beginning of the year.

Unlike last week’s quakes, all of which measured 2.5M or smaller, Sunday evening’s temblor showed up immediately on the USGS’s radar.

Per the USGS, Sunday’s quake at 6:25 p.m. measured 2.6M on the Richter scale. And it was located right where you’d expect it at this point — just south of the former Texas Stadium site and along the two-mile fault that, according to SMU seismologists, stretches from Irving to Dallas. This one was far deeper than most: 6.8 miles beneath the earth’s surface, about twice the average depth of most of our quakes in the past year.

And now, this footnote note that we’ll stick with all quake items until we’re told otherwise:

SMU researchers believe the quakes are caused by humans working in the oil and gas industry. Humans in the oil and gas industry, as well as those who regulate them, disagree. The reading material is below.
