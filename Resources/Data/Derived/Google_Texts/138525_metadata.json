If workers decide to strike, the company is likely to lose customers, said Union Steward and Strike Coordinator Dennis Mouser, who has been out of work from the company off and on since December.\n\n\u201cOur existing customers are probably going to go somewhere else to get their steel,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cWe\u2019ll end up losing customers if there\u2019s a strike.\u201d\n\nMouser said the company has been thus far unwilling to make concessions on the contract. Negotiations have been ongoing since the beginning of August. Workers are seeking a three year contract with raises, an increase in pension contributions and maintained healthcare insurance costs. The company offer does not offer any increases except in healthcare costs.\n\nThe union includes about 245 members, and about 62 of those employees have been on layoff for the last four months. Those layoffs are attributable to the slow-down in the steel industry.\n\nAsked if there was any hope of returning full-time to the plant, Mouser said, \u201cOur only hope is that the steel industry picks up.\u201d\n\nFor the employees not on layoff, there is still the hope that the company will make concessions.\n\n\u201cWe remain very hopefuly that this gets resolved,\u201d Mouser said.\n\nAs a result of the layoffs, employees at the plant say they are putting in 12-hour shifts up to four days in a row to make up for the shortage of workers. Alton Steel CEO Jim Hrusovsky said he could neither confirm nor deny that claim.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Telegraph, the CEO declined to comment on details of negotiations, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve had some very productive and meaningful discussions. We continue to negotiate. We\u2019re continuing to run our mill.\u201d\n\nReporter Kelsey Landis can be reached at 618-208-6460.\n\nBy Kelsey Landis [email protected]\n\nMembers of the United Steelworkers wave Friday to passing cars that honked their support for the union which is in negotiations with Alton Steel for a contract.
