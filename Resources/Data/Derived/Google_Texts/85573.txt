On Tuesday, 12 states will hold primary elections or caucuses to choose candidates for president. The so-called "Super Tuesday" states vary greatly in how they handle healthcare issues recently in the news. We've compiled a table showing the current status on those issues in each state: rates of uninsurance (above versus below the national average), whether they have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and whether they require abortion providers to adhere to same standards as surgical centers.

* Arkansas has adopted an 1115 Medicaid waiver; Texas' law is currently enjoined pending an outcome in the courts; Virginia's legislature is currently considering expansion.
