Greenberg, senior vice president of asset management for Minot, North Dakota-based Investors Real Estate Trust, said institutional investors tend to place a high value on the medical office building properties they own.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money out there that would like to be in medical office buildings,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cBut many \u2026 of the owners of quality \u2018MOBs\u2019 have no intention of letting them go right now.\u201d\n\nIRET owns various types of real estate in 11 Midwestern states. Because IRET is publicly traded, Greenberg said he can\u2019t comment on whether the real estate investment trust is looking to acquire more health care properties.\n\nBen Thypin, director of market analysis for New York-based Real Capital Analytics, said the medical office category has been \u201cthe hottest by volume\u201d for real estate investors not only in the Twin Cities but across the nation. The category includes doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care clinics, and diagnostic laboratories and imaging centers. They typically produce stable cash flow that makes them particularly attractive to REITs.\n\nIn the Twin Cities area, 2014 purchase prices of medical office buildings tracked by Finance & Commerce have ranged from nearly $100 per square foot to $330 per square foot.\n\nThypin noted that the medical office building category has become more popular with investors because of the growing populations of insured consumers and senior citizens, and because hospital systems have been shifting more non-acute care to off-campus facilities, away from clinics in or near hospitals. Thypin also thinks sales activity this year has been limited due to a lack of properties available for purchase.\n\nOne major change within the past couple of years is that REITS and other institutional investors in the capital markets, which historically focused on on-campus facilities, have shown more interest in off-campus buildings, said Steve Brown, executive director of Cushman & Wakefield/NorthMarq\u2019s Healthcare Advisory Group.\n\nOn-campus facilities have historically drawn higher prices because they were seen as a \u201csafer bet\u201d than standalone facilities, Brown said. But projects in good locations \u2013 such as suburban, residential areas \u2013 are attracting more interest. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money chasing that type of product,\u201d he said.\n\nBrian Bruggeman, an associate with Colliers International\u2019s Healthcare Services Group in Minneapolis, also sees institutional interest in acquiring health care real estate remaining high, with public entities and private REITS and equity groups \u201call chomping at the bit,\u201d especially for properties anchored by a major health system.\n\nAcross the country, the supply of medical office buildings for purchase has been limited because health care REITS have continued to grow and become \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in looking for places to deploy their capital, Bruggeman said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very high demand, but just no supply,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the growing population of seniors, facilities that serve the Medicare population are also attractive to institutional investors, Bruggeman said. \u201cBut those are also hard to find because a lot of them are still owned by the systems who run them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor nonprofits, there are some tax advantages in continuing to own those senior care facilities, rather than having some third party run them.\u201d\n\nAs a result, some health care REITs have become more active in developing senior care and other types of health facilities across the nation, he said. For example, IRET is investing about $14 million to expand its Southdale Medical Building at 6525 France Ave. in Edina with a 60,000-square-foot addition and five-story parking ramp.\n\nIRET is currently developing one other health care property in the Twin Cities, according to Mark Reiling, executive vice president of asset management. As Finance & Commerce reported in June, IRET is building a $20 million 72,000-square-foot children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 psychiatric hospital in Brooklyn Park for Twin Cities-based PrairieCare. PrairieCare will lease the facility, which is slated to open next year at 9400 Zane Ave. N. IRET paid about $2.62 million in cash for the 10-acre site.\n\nWith construction of stand-alone health care facilities at a high level in the Twin Cities, some of those newer properties may eventually become available for investor purchase. Many of the new, standalone facilities have long-term tenants and leases, giving their developers reason to hold them as long-term assets, Bruggeman said. \u201cBut other groups may look to sell them off, right away.\u201d\n\nGreenberg and others said they are still waiting to see how the Affordable Care Act affects health care delivery.\n\nBruggeman expects to see more consolidation of health care systems in the Twin Cities and elsewhere. \u201cSystems are going to have to consolidate, just to cut costs,\u201d he said, adding the consolidation will likely result in more clinic buildings and other real estate owned by medical groups and systems being put up for sale.\n\nIn addition, Bruggeman says he\u2019s constantly fielding inquiries from landowners who want to get into the health care market as developers.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not quite like the Field of Dreams concept of, \u2018If you build it, they will come,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to have demand from a system or medical group to develop something.\u201d\n\nSampling of 2014 medical office sales\n\nHere are some 2014 sales reported by Finance & Commerce\n\nClosed in January: Woodlake Partners LLC, an entity related to Los Angeles-based Laurus Corp., paid $20.3 million or $103.57 per square foot for the Woodlake Centre at 6601 Lyndale Ave. S. in Richfield.
