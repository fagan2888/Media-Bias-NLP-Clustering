The bounces went the other way, and Colorado was faced with an early two-goal deficit against elite goalie Jonathan Quick.\n\nBut the Avs can\u2019t afford off nights, and the Kings\u2019 5-2 victory at the Pepsi Center severely diminished their already-slim chances of making the playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe got nothing,\u201d Avs forward Alex Tanguay said. \u201cAt this time of year, you need the desperation, and tonight they had more than us. It showed. They got every bounce, every break. Those are crucial points. It\u2019s very disappointing.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles is among five teams Colorado is chasing, and the gaps got wider after the Kings chased goalie Calvin Pickard from the game in the first period and cruised to 2-0 this season against the Avs in Denver. L.A. extended its lead to six points over the Avs, and Minnesota also won Tuesday, putting the Wild 10 points ahead of the Avs.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nThe Avs have 15 games remaining, including 13 against Western Conference teams \u2014 and 10 against conference teams in front of them. So the push for the playoffs is not over. A big winning streak could make it interesting. But Colorado hasn\u2019t won four consecutive games all season, failing to make it four in a row Tuesday.\n\nAnd \u2026 goalie Semyon Varlamov has another groin injury.\n\nPickard, who was called up from the minors Monday and entered the game with a .936 save percentage \u2014 tied for first among NHL goalies with at least 14 games played \u2014 was pulled 14:15 into the game after allowing three goals on eight shots. But he wasn\u2019t to blame. Marian Gaborik (power play) and Brayden McNabb scored on skilled redirections, and Jeff Carter produced his team-high 23rd goal with a magnificent wrist shot after a ghastly defensive-end turnover.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough start for me. The goals weren\u2019t bad goals, but I got a find a way (to stop) at least one of them,\u201d Pickard said. \u201cIt was just one of those nights. I wasn\u2019t getting many bounces going my way early on, and before I knew it, there were three in the back of my net.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche vs. Los Angeles Kings, March 10, 2015\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy didn\u2019t pull Pickard because he was playing poorly.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to change the rhythm of the game,\u201d Roy said. \u201cEvery time Calvin has been called up, he\u2019s played really well for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the story of the night,\u201d Roy said of the Kings\u2019 two quick goals. \u201cTo me, the big surprise is, how come (the Kings) aren\u2019t in the playoffs? They are so good. There is no reason for these guys not to be in the playoff picture right now.\u201d\n\nTyson Barrie scored 12:53 into the game to trim the Kings\u2019 lead to 2-1, but McNabb scored less than two minutes later, and Kyle Clifford made it 4-1 late in the second period.\n\nClifford was tied up with defenseman Brad Stuart, but his one-handed poke check pushed the puck under third-string goalie Reto Berra.\n\nThe Avs got back within two with Tanguay\u2019s tap-in 8:27 into the third, but just as with Colorado\u2019s first goal, the Kings answered on the next shift with Jake Muzzin\u2019s wrist shot past Berra.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche\u2019s playoff hopes fade with home loss to L.A.
