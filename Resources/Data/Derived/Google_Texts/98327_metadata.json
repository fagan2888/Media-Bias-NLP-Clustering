As in 2008, Clinton will have no time for sanguine, Obama-esque fantasies of bridging partisan divisions with inspirational leadership. The keys to success in her mind were and remain indefatigability, and a mastery of partisan bloodsport.\n\nWhen Obama\u2019s theory of change failed, though, he enjoyed an ideal, once-in-a-generation fallback: huge Democratic majorities in Congress. Clinton will not have those. Anyone tried in the partisan fires of the past decades will understandably look at Clinton\u2019s strategy with a jaundiced eye. I, too, ultimately expect that she\u2019ll encounter the same kind of massive Republican resistance Obama has endured.\n\nBut thanks to a constellation of favorable factors unlike any Obama faced, Clinton could eke a handful of progressive victories out of a brief interlude of Republican distraction.\n\n1) It\u2019s unlikely that the next president will enter office against the backdrop of as many crises as Obama inherited. These crises required Obama to expend tremendous political resources on unpopular emergency measures before he could get to work on his forward-looking agenda.\n\n2) Obamacare is already the law. For decades, universal healthcare was the holy grail of Democratic politics, elusive precisely because reforming the health care system is impossible to do without incurring great expense and significant disruption, and thus without courting tremendous blowback. But it\u2019s done now. Which means, absent an unexpected economic or foreign crisis, Hillary Clinton will be able to front load a new, simpler domestic policy agenda.\n\n3) Clinton\u2019s domestic policy agenda is extremely popular, and, unlike Obamacare, made up mostly of simple bargains. People pay their taxes and in return will reap the benefits of child care and preschool, and their children will enjoy the option of tuition-free community college. By fiat, the government can require employers to provide paid sick or family leave, but only if people force their members of Congress to vote for it. Against a weakened political opposition, policies like these will make great wedge issues. Which is of particular note because if Hillary Clinton wins\u2026\n\n4) The right will be in the throes of disconsolate panic. Conservative columnist Philip Klein somewhat hyperbolically suggests that \u201cif Republicans can\u2019t beat Hillary, they should disband the party.\u201d Bill Kristol agrees, but stipulates that \u201cif Republicans don\u2019t win in 2016, GOP civil wars will be so intense there will be nothing left to disband.\u201d Anybody who was skeptical of Obama\u2019s 2012 argument that his reelection would \u201cbreak the fever\u201d of hysterical Republican opposition, and who watched Republicans disprove it, can be forgiven for doubting that they\u2019ll be so disillusioned after 2016 that they\u2019ll start voting for liberal policies.\n\nBut there is historical precedent for members of a badly defeated opposition party to cooperate with their partisan opposites, or to at least stand aside. Like boll weevil Democrats in the early days of Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, a minority of frustrated, undogmatic Republicans could\u2014perhaps temporarily\u2014align with Clinton on a subset of issues. The comparison is imperfect, because boll weevils were part of a dying breed of conservative Democrats, some of whom ultimately became Republicans. Today\u2019s Republican Party has no comparable liberal faction. But the issues Clinton will champion won\u2019t be as contentious or far-reaching as huge tax cuts or universal health care. And with respect to complex issues like immigration and climate mitigation, Clinton will be inheriting entrenched administrative policies that already make significant inroads toward liberal goals. The bargain on offer would allow Republicans to reshape the policies in conservative ways, in exchange for codifying them. This is a more attractive request than asking Congress for something entirely new, which Obama did when he sought cap-and-trade legislation and immigration reform unsuccessfully.\n\nRepublicans may regroup quickly and deny Clinton any legislative accomplishments, the way they\u2019ve denied them to Obama. Little would surprise me less. But her political baseline will be meaningfully different from the one Obama built his administration on, and in the dusty aftermath of their third straight presidential election defeat they might let a couple meaningful reforms sneak by.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Should she win the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will have to contend not just with a Republican opponent, but with two joyless and inescapable specters.From today\u2019s vantage point, Clinton looks likelier than anyone else in America to be elected the next president, but her candidacy carries fewer upsides and far greater downsides than any Republican primary contender will face.
