The deal is expected to close in mid-2015.\n\nVentas, which owns senior housing communities, medical office buildings and hospitals, also said it would spin off most of its portfolio of skilled nursing facilities.\n\nThe spinoff, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2015, will create one of two healthcare real estate investment trusts focused on running skilled nursing facilities.\n\nThe other company is Ensign Group Inc, which spun off its real estate business to focus on running skilled nursing facilities.\n\nVentas' shares were up 5 percent at $77.01 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n(This story corrects paragraph 12 and first bullet point to say Ventas would spin off most, not all, of its portfolio of skilled nursing facilities. The error also appeared in an earlier version.)\n\n(Editing by Simon Jennings and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_innovationNews": "USKBN0MX0IW20150406", "sailthru.author": "Vidya L Nathan", "Author": "Vidya L Nathan", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Ventas Inc, a healthcare real estate investment trust, is buying Ardent Medical Services Inc for $1.75 billion to expand its hospitals business at a time when more Americans are seeking healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Ventas buys private hospital chain for $1.75 billion", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
