Republicans claim that the current law is a burden on job creators, and that it hurts lower wage workers by giving employers an incentive to lower their hours in order to avoid the mandate. Supporters of the new bill claim that most 40-hour employees already have health insurance.\n\nDemocrats maintain that the bill, if it becomes law, will hurt more workers than the current law because most employers can easily decrease current 40-hour workers to 39 hours without a major cut in productivity \u2013 thereby avoiding the health insurance mandate altogether. This will increase the federal deficit by $53 million over the next 10 years by forcing more Americans to go on government-sponsored health insurance.\n\nOpponents of raising the full-time workweek minimum also argue that it will increase the number of uninsured, especially among lower middle-class Americans who, by having that one hour cut from their workweek, will lose insurance benefits but still make too much money to qualify for free or subsidized insurance through ACA marketplaces.\n\nThe Senate vote on the bill has not been scheduled yet, and according to NBC News, will not likely happen until after the vote on the XL Keystone pipeline, which is expected sometime around the end of January.\n\nDo you think the 40-hour workweek bill is a good idea? How do you think it will affect your job and health benefits?\n\n[Image via Fox News]", "article_metadata": {"description": "40-hour workweek bill to ease employer health insurance mandates passes Congress as it fires the first shot of what is expected to be many battles to weaken", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "40-hour workweek bill to ease employer health insurance mandates passes Congress as it fires the first shot of what is expected to be many battles to weaken Obamacare.", "title": "40-Hour Full-Time Workweek Bill Passes As Congress Starts War Against Obamacare", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1740681/40-hour-full-time-workweek-bill-passes-as-congress-starts-war-against-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/40-hour-workweek-e1420816686699-669x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-09T10:32:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T10:58:37+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/40-hour-workweek-e1420816686699-669x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-01-09T10:32:39+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "40 hour workweek,obamacare,affordable care act,congress passes bill,full-time workweek,health insurance,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/40-hour-workweek-e1420816686699-669x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 669}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "40-hour workweek bill to ease employer health insurance mandates passes Congress as it fires the first shot of what is expected to be many battles to weaken Obamacare."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4226\"", "article_summary": "Do you think the 40-hour workweek bill is a good idea?\nThe 40-hour workweek bill aims to ease health insurance requirements for employers under the Affordable Care Act, which currently defines full-time as 30 hours per week.\nThe AFL-CIO, in fact, supports lowering the minimum hours required for a full-time workweek to 20 in an attempt to protect full-time workers from seeing their hours reduced.\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives took the first swipe at weakening Obamacare Thursday, when it voted 252-to-172 to raise the definition of a full-time workweek to 40 hours.\nThis will increase the federal deficit by $53 million over the next 10 years by forcing more Americans to go on government-sponsored health insurance."}
