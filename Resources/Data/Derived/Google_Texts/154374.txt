“The Bolivarian Revolution is self-destructing,” said Mr. Santos in a speech Wednesday, referring to Venezuela’s socialist system, which is named after 19th Century icon Simon Bolivar. “Problems in Venezuela are made in Venezuela, not made in Colombia,” he said.

His comments came three weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro began closing key border crossings and forcing thousands of Colombian immigrants out of Venezuela.
