It\u2019s too close for that. We need your help immediately. Advertisement \u2013 story continues below I\u2019ll put it frankly: If we lose these midterm elections, we\u2019ll just see more obstruction, more lawsuits and talk about impeachment, and more votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act or even shut down the government. That\u2019s why I really need you to get off the sidelines and join me. If we go after every single vote, I know we\u2019ll win. Raising $100,000 by midnight is absolutely critical to our voter mobilization efforts. Will you pitch in to keep the Senate blue? We\u2019ll triple-match gifts for a single day only. It all comes down to this: Advertisement \u2013 story continues below Trending Stories Mark Cuban Says Clinton\u2019s People Want To Talk\n\nGlenn Beck Warns About What Comes Next on The Slippery Slope\n\nWatch: \u2018Shocking\u2019 Response When Mom Confronts Son\u2019s Accused Killer In Court If you think folks who work 40-50 hours a week shouldn\u2019t have to live in poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth and if you don\u2019t want women\u2019s bosses making decisions about their birth control, then you need to step up right now. These races are going to be unbelievably tight. They could be won and lost by a few thousand \u2014 or even a few hundred \u2014 votes. But here\u2019s the good news: We have enough supporters to win these races \u2014 but only if we get folks registered and to the polls in November. It all comes down to whether or not we have the resources we need to get this done. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for your help right now. Will you pitch in before midnight to keep the Senate in Democratic hands so we can keep moving this country forward? Remember: All gifts will be triple-matched and put to work on the ground immediately. Thank you, Michelle Obama\n\nPhoto Credit: shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "...her husband could be on the block for impeachment...", "author": "James Beattie", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "...her husband could be on the block for impeachment...", "title": "What Michelle Just Did Proves She And The Dems Are Desperate To Prevent One Thing", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 995, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/michelleobama.jpg", "height": 902}, "updated_time": "2014-10-03T11:47:29-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/watch-michelle-obama-just-sent-desperate-email-protect-senate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "...her husband could be on the block for impeachment...", "title": "What Michelle Just Did Proves She And The Dems Are Desperate To Prevent One Thing", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/michelleobama.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-03T11:11:56-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Michelle Obama", "published_time": "2014-10-03T11:11:56-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T11:47:29-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "democrats, michelle obama, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement \u2013 story continues belowHere is the body of the email sent on behalf of Michelle Obama:Friend \u2014 You can\u2019t hold your breath and wait to see who wins the Senate.\nIt all comes down to whether or not we have the resources we need to get this done.\nWill you pitch in before midnight to keep the Senate in Democratic hands so we can keep moving this country forward?\nThey could be won and lost by a few thousand \u2014 or even a few hundred \u2014 votes.\nRemember: All gifts will be triple-matched and put to work on the ground immediately."}
