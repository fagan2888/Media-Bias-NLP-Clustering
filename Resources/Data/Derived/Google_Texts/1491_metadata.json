Everyone is welcome to attend and there is no admission charge.\n\n\"My goal is to make a contribution to the community by encouraging people to think, not just believe what they hear,\" said David Currie, chairman of the Tom Green Democratic Party. \"I'm not trying to bring in just Democrats to talk about things like Obamacare. I want speakers who will be objective.\"\n\nFeatured presenters for the religious freedom event include Rabbi Jack Moline, president of The Interfaith Alliance in Washington, D.C., and Brent Walker, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, also headquartered in Washington.\n\nA retired Baptist minister, Currie tried to select a broad variety of current topics, some more personal to him than others.\n\n\"I'm very passionate about religious liberty,\" he said. \"When the First Amendment was created it did not say we were created as a 'Christian' society. We were formed as a secular community that needs to respect and get along with each other.\"\n\nAll of the monthly forums, except June, will be held at the library on the first Thursday of the month and begin at 7 p.m.\n\nQuestion-and-answer periods will be held after each presentation to encourage dialogue.\n\nThe primary goal is to provide an opportunity for people with diverse opinions to dialogue about issues that are of concern to most people, Currie said. Another goal is to raise the visibility of the Democratic Party in Tom Green County.\n\n\"We need more than one party,\" Currie said. \"Although locally we have pretty good leadership, having more than one choice or view is important.\"\n\n\u201cTruth About ...
