But what good is insurance if there are no doctors available to treat them?\n\nThis month, I found out, first hand. I saw a woman falling through the cracks of the new health-care system, and I tried to help her.\n\nThe woman \u2014 let\u2019s call her Isabella \u2014 is a naturalized U.S. citizen and housekeeper for a friend of mine. A few weeks ago, Isabella began having what seemed to be debilitating panic attacks. She was unable to work. She stopped eating. She would frequently burst into tears. She said she thought things would be easier if she were dead. She called at all hours asking for advice. During previous episodes, she had gone to the emergency room or paid doctors out of pocket who gave her prescriptions with no counseling for medicines such as Xanax that provided temporary relief at best. She badly needed mental-health treatment \u2014 and there was none available.\n\nObamacare provides mental-health \u201cparity,\u201d meaning mental health is covered as well as any other condition \u2014 in theory, an important advance. But in practice, parity was meaningless for Isabella. She is enrolled in one of the CareFirst BlueCross plans from the Obamacare exchange, but when my friend and I searched for psychiatrists within 30 miles of Washington who took her plan, the CareFirst Web site returned none.\n\nNext, we took Isabella to Metro Immediate & Primary Care, an urgent-care clinic; after a two-hour wait, a doctor said \u201cI can\u2019t do anything for you.\u201d A nurse provided a list of psychiatrists who, we learned after calling them, also didn\u2019t take her insurance.\n\nWe tried various other places experts suggested: The 35 K Street Clinic: No good, because Isabella lives in Maryland, not the District. Mary\u2019s Center, a community health-care group, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington: Both said they weren\u2019t taking new patients. The Women\u2019s Center, a mental-health counseling nonprofit, said the same but offered to put Isabella on a lengthy wait list.\n\nFinally, we found something called Holy Health Care Services, which said Isabella could see a social worker now and a psychiatrist in the middle of next month. With luck, Isabella will get the treatment that she needs \u2014 and with more luck, CareFirst will reimburse her for it.\n\nBut that\u2019s hardly a reassuring result. Isabella wouldn\u2019t have found psychiatric help without two educated, connected and persistent advocates representing her. (After I made an inquiry for this column, Mary\u2019s Center offered to see Isabella, but we declined.) What if you\u2019re not well-off, well-educated or well-connected and you start hearing voices in your head telling you to shoot people \u2014 but you are told by place after place that no doctor is available to see you?\n\nOne of those we asked for help with Isabella was my college friend John Santopietro, a psychiatrist who is chief clinical officer for behavioral health in the Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, N.C. He said Isabella\u2019s experience is typical.\n\nOne in five of us needs mental-health treatment at any given time, and for those who get good care, the recovery rate is between 60 percent and 80 percent \u2014 higher than in many other medical fields. But only about 40 percent of the people who need treatment get any help, Santopietro said, and those who do \u201coften get bounced around in a system that leaves them feeling misunderstood, stigmatized, brushed aside.\u201d\n\nObamacare aimed to improve this woeful system by requiring mental-health parity. But psychiatrists, many of whom stopped taking insurance because of the paltry reimbursements, have yet to rejoin the system. This leaves the public mental-health system (clinics that charge on a sliding scale) overloaded.\n\n\u201cWhat we had is a major expansion of coverage, at least on paper,\u201d said Mark Covall, president of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, a group of 800 mental-health hospitals. But now, \u201cyou have insurance but you don\u2019t really have access to these services because these services aren\u2019t readily available.\u201d\n\nThankfully, a bipartisan group in Congress is trying to fix this. The \u201cHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act,\u201d introduced by Rep. (and psychologist) Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) and Rep. (and psychiatric nurse) Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), attempts, among other things, to reinforce community mental-health programs. It has 165 co-sponsors and has already cleared a commerce subcommittee. Similar legislation by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) attempts to expand the mental-health workforce.\n\nBoth could close the gap between what Obamacare promises and what those needing mental-health treatment actually receive.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, obamacare, carefirst blue cross, tim murphy, eddie bernice johnson", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Patients urgently in need of care are having trouble finding psychiatrists who take Obamacare insurance.", "title": "The problem with Obamacare\u2019s mental-health \u2018parity\u2019 measure", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-problem-with-obamacares-mental-health-parity-measure/2015/11/27/f2c5fcfc-952b-11e5-a2d6-f57908580b1f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/20/Interactivity/Images/crop-041705431398031981.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "description": "Patients urgently in need of care are having trouble finding psychiatrists who take Obamacare insurance.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-problem-with-obamacares-mental-health-parity-measure/2015/11/27/f2c5fcfc-952b-11e5-a2d6-f57908580b1f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, obamacare, carefirst blue cross, tim murphy, eddie bernice johnson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "f2c5fcfc-952b-11e5-a2d6-f57908580b1f"}, "article_summary": "Both could close the gap between what Obamacare promises and what those needing mental-health treatment actually receive.\nThis leaves the public mental-health system (clinics that charge on a sliding scale) overloaded.\nShe badly needed mental-health treatment \u2014 and there was none available.\nObamacare provides mental-health \u201cparity,\u201d meaning mental health is covered as well as any other condition \u2014 in theory, an important advance.\nObamacare expanded health insurance to millions of Americans."}
