Who doesn’t like hearing from Elders about how things used to be? There is so much knowledge to be gained from hearing stories from Elders. In this video, Cherokee Elder Joe Fourkiller talks about his family, where he grew up, his five sisters, the games they played, and more.

He was asked if it was hard to learn English.

“Well, I learned it pretty good,” he said in the video. He explained how his older sisters helped him with his ABCs, but he grew up only speaking Cherokee.

Fourkiller talks about milking cows, getting water from the well, not having electricity, what it cost to go to the movies, and the simple joys of growing up back then.
