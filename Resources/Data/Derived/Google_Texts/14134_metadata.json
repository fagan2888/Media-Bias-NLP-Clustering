I understand they want to manage their costs also, but sometime cost management doesn\u2019t make for good patient care,\u201d said Moffitt.\n\nSo he has decided to stop taking most insurance and instead charge his patients a membership fee. The prices start at $65 a month for a single adult and includes general services and generic drugs.\n\nThe new policy makes life easier in the office, but it also helps the customer. Moffitt says by doing away with all of that paperwork he has more time to spend with his patients. Patients should not give up their insurance completely though, it\u2019s necessary to pay for accidents and hospital stays.\n\nMoffitt believes there are people in town with certain coverage that could benefit, \u201cWe could fill that niche and help a lot of folks,\u201d he said.\n\nHaskins liked the idea, but says it isn\u2019t for everyone. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go to the doctor frequently, or you\u2019re not on maintenance medications, something like that, it may not be your best option,\u201d she said.\n\nOverall, patients have been receptive to the change. They\u2019ll continue accepting Medicaid and certain private insurances for the next year, but they\u2019ll phase them out on a case by case basis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Dodge City doctor is giving up on traditional insurance and moving on to a growing trend in private practices, he'll be charging patients \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411762914", "og": {"site_name": "KSN-TV", "description": "A Dodge City doctor is giving up on traditional insurance and moving on to a growing trend in private practices, he\u2019ll be charging patients a monthly membership fee.", "title": "Dodge City doctor says goodbye to insurance", "url": "http://ksn.com/2014/10/27/dodge-city-doctor-says-goodbye-to-insurance/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvksnw.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/hospital-instruments-ksnfile.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Dodge City doctor is giving up on traditional insurance and moving on to a growing trend in private practices, he\u2019ll be charging patients a monthly membership fee.", "title": "Dodge City doctor says goodbye to insurance", "image": {"src": "https://lintvksnw.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/hospital-instruments-ksnfile.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@KSNNews", "site": "KSNNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Lindsay Cobb, Lindsay Cobb", "msapplication-tooltip": "Wichita, KS News Weather and Sports | We've Got Your Back", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.ksnw", "fb": {"pages": 92102484724}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://ksn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/079d66e0e6c53e14a5429c524ad3e55d?s=16", "application-name": "KSN-TV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KSNNews", "published_time": "2014-10-28T00:23:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T00:58:10+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "jbNLEolQgA8nCvD85o9rK2CTlZ5C_13qD6LkX7ZpOPQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca015\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s really raised the bar on their cost of doing business.\u201d\u201cThe insurance companies, to a certain extent, want to micromanage what you\u2019re doing.\nMedical (KSN File Photo)DODGE CITY, Kansas \u2013 Jim Moffitt and his wife started practicing family medicine in Dodge City 14 years ago, but with the Affordable Care Act and changes to insurance procedures he says the claims process has gotten to be too much .\nPatients should not give up their insurance completely though, it\u2019s necessary to pay for accidents and hospital stays.\nSo he has decided to stop taking most insurance and instead charge his patients a membership fee.\nI understand they want to manage their costs also, but sometime cost management doesn\u2019t make for good patient care,\u201d said Moffitt."}
