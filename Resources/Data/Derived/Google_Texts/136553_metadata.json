The Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights announced Tuesday that a man identified as Abu Anas al-Libi had killed more than 150 women and girls in Iraq's Fallujah, some of whom were pregnant. \"The women were executed because they refused to accept the policy of Jihad al-Nikah [sexual jihad] that ISIS is enforcing in Fallujah,\" the ministry's statement added. ISIS has carried out \"wide-ranging massacres\" in the Anbar province's Fallujah, the ministry also said, specifying that the jihadist group has been burying the dead in two mass graves in the city's Hayy al-Jolan neighborhood as well as the suburb of Al-Saqlawiyyah.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing and repeating that one man did this. Unlike the tragedy in Peshawar, wherein several Taliban savages butchered some 132 school children, this act of horror was carried out by one man. One man.\n\nLet\u2019s take this stunning horror story -- picked up by a number of different media outlets -- to its logical conclusion: If one man is capable of such barbarism, imagine how dangerous an Army of these savages is. That is, after all, what we're now dealing with.\n\nISIS\u2019 brand of terrorism is defined by its ruthlessness. They roam their \"caliphate\" with reckless abandon killing and torturing at will. And they are recruiting westerners to participate in the bloodletting because they can.\n\nKilling women and children because they will not submit to \u201csexual jihad\u201d -- and burying them in mass graves -- is a new low even for ISIS that, if anything, merits a military response. But for now, as the fight continues, let us hope and pray that good will ultimately triumph over evil, and that the families affected by these paralyzingly awful events will somehow find comfort in their anguish.\n\nUPDATE: Richly deserved:\n\nU.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq have killed three of the militant group's top leaders, the head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Awful..05/26/2016 18:21:32PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Awful.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Pure Horror: One ISIS Fighter Reportedly Killed 150 Women and Girls", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/12/18/pure-horror-one-isis-fighterkills-150-women-n1933719", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/350/4e569733-8864-45ac-beda-c2cf10e077bb.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Awful.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Pure Horror: One ISIS Fighter Reportedly Killed 150 Women and Girls", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/12/18/pure-horror-one-isis-fighterkills-150-women-n1933719", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/350/4e569733-8864-45ac-beda-c2cf10e077bb.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pure Horror: One ISIS Fighter Reportedly Killed 150 Women and Girls, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\"The women were executed because they refused to accept the policy of Jihad al-Nikah [sexual jihad] that ISIS is enforcing in Fallujah,\" the ministry's statement added.\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights announced Tuesday that a man identified as Abu Anas al-Libi had killed more than 150 women and girls in Iraq's Fallujah, some of whom were pregnant.\nSickening and truly upsetting:The Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) group conducted a mass execution of women in Fallujah, according to a statement issued by the Iraqi government.\nKilling women and children because they will not submit to \u201csexual jihad\u201d -- and burying them in mass graves -- is a new low even for ISIS that, if anything, merits a military response.\nUnlike the tragedy in Peshawar, wherein several Taliban savages butchered some 132 school children, this act of horror was carried out by one man."}
