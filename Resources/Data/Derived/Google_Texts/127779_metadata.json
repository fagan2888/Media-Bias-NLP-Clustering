You know it\u2019s going to be bad, but you can\u2019t really take it in until you get here and see the scene.\u201d\n\nLike many people from this area, McGaha paid attention when the Carlton Complex fire broke out earlier this week. But he didn\u2019t think he was in any danger.\n\n\u201cI thought we were going to be ok, it\u2019s far away, we\u2019ll watch it. But with the wind, it just took off and exploded.\u201d\n\nSam Cain was also surprised by the power of the fire.\n\n\u201cThey were 50 or 60 foot tall flames, it was unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there was so much smoke, you couldn\u2019t see a thing.\u201d\n\nHis barn burned to the ground. But somehow, his home and his neighbors were spared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, it is very strange. I\u2019m just glad we are ok and have places to live, but a lot of people don\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of homes got burnt.\u201d\n\nEveryone in town agrees this fire has been especially unpredictable.\n\n\u201cNormal fires we\u2019ve had before,\u201d says Rebecca Lyon, whose mom lives in Malott. \u201cThey just went down the hill. This one they call the checkerboard fire, because it\u2019s jumping from different places, spot to spot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still far from being out, and more homes could be destroyed before firefighters get control. McGaha hopes that doesn\u2019t happen. He doesn\u2019t want other families to go through what his is right now, even though he\u2019s trying to make the best of his situation.\n\n\u201cThose things that were lost can be replaced, we\u2019ll have the memories. And we can hang on to those.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MALOTT - Brad McGaha and his family spent the day looking at what\u2019s left of his home near Malott. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough time, we\u2019ve lived here most of our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cTo come and see this, at this point, it\u2019s overwhelming.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "MALOTT \u2013 Brad McGaha and his family spent the day looking at what\u2019s left of his home near Malott. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough time, we\u2019ve lived here most of our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cTo come and see this, at t\u2026", "title": "Victims of Carlton Complex fire try to cope with loss", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2014/07/19/victims-of-carlton-complex-fire-try-to-cope-with-loss/", "image": "http://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bs9phmncaaaqh71.jpg?w=300", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bs9phmncaaaqh71.jpg?w=240", "site": "@q13fox", "card": "summary", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
