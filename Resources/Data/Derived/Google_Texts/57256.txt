A tractor trailer was stuck on the train tracks in a Louisiana town just a few days ago, and witnesses on the scene captured video of the insane wreck that ensued when the train just crashed right into it.

The YouTube user who posted the video explained, “[Police] heard the crash and came running out. By the time we were able to go around the train and get to the other side, the police were over there and the driver of the truck was there as well. He is fine but we understand that the train engineers were in pretty bad shape.”

One local report says that the engineers were both conscious, but in serious condition and sent to hospitals for treatment.
