After years of pro-abortion administrations that turned a blind eye to the abuses of the abortion industry, including the horrors of Kermit Gosnell\u2019s abortion center in Philadelphia, Corbett took action to protect women and their unborn children.\n\nFollowing the direct recommendations of the Grand Jury report in the Gosnell case, Corbett signed a law ensuring abortion centers meet basic health standards.\n\nElections have consequences. And in Pennsylvania, gubernatorial elections have especially made the difference for women and unborn babies. The Gosnell Grand Jury report notes that under pro-life Governor Bob Casey, abortion centers were inspected. In the report, DOH official Janice Staloski states DOH\u2019s policy under of his successor, pro-abortion Governor Tom Ridge, was \u201cmotivated by a desire not to be \u2018putting up a barrier to women\u2019 seeking abortions.\u201d This mentality persisted in the administration of pro-abortion Ed Rendell. Gosnell, who was convicted last year of three counts of first-degree murder, did not have his Women\u2019s Medical Society abortion clinic inspected for 17 years.\n\nDoes Tom Wolf want Pennsylvania to return to the days when the likes of Kermit Gosnell had virtually no oversight? Wolf\u2019s website claims he \u201cstands with Pennsylvania women.\u201d How do women benefit from substandard, unsanitary facilities run by profiteers, like Gosnell, with a history of botched abortions and a willingness to kill unborn babies past the legal limit and even after birth? Women deserve better than that. And so do their unborn babies.\n\nGovernor Corbett has worked to empower Pennsylvania mothers-in-need through the life-affirming Real Alternatives program, a state program that helps fund pregnancy resource centers.\n\nJust this summer, Corbett also signed \u201cChloe\u2019s Law,\u201d a measure designed to ensure parents receive accurate, evidence-based information about Down syndrome when receiving a prenatal diagnosis and are aware of the resources available to them and their child. [\u201cChloe\u2019s Law\u201d will provide expectant mothers with information about Down syndrome].\n\nSome studies have shown as high as 90% of babies given prenatal diagnoses of Down syndrome are aborted. Hopefully, laws like this one will give hope to parents facing unexpected circumstances in pregnancy and diminish some of the societal preference toward abortion of children with special needs.\n\nGovernor Corbett also signed House Bill 818, which barred coverage of elective abortion in health plans sold in the Pennsylvania exchange created under Obamacare. Dozens of states have also passed similar measures and limits on taxpayer funding of abortion continue to enjoy broad public support.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nDue to his strong pro-life leadership, the National Right to Life Committee and the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation have endorsed Governor Tom Corbett for reelection. By contrast, Tom Wolf is backed by NARAL, a radical pro-abortion group that opposes any and all limits on abortion.\n\nPennsylvania is a pro-life state. However, it is a state where Democratic voter registration exceeds Republican registration by a 50-37 percent margin. It is vitally important that pro-life Pennsylvanians educate their friends and families about where the candidates stand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pennsylvania: Pro-Life Gov.
