Some of his devices resemble the tension-based machines used in modern health clubs.\n\nThe vibrating belts enjoyed their greatest popularity from the 1930s to the 1960s, but no formal scientific studies proved any weight-loss or muscle-toning benefits.\n\nOne study of low-magnitude vibration involved overweight mice. The results, reported in 2012 in The Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, showed improved bone strength and more immune cells, but not weight loss.\n\n\u2013 C.
