Maxine Waters in the 43rd Congressional District is a long shot, to say the least.\n\nThe two will go head to head on the Nov. 4 ballot.\n\nWaters, 76, has been a fixture in Los Angeles and California politics for nearly four decades. She has served in Congress since 1991 and is a member and past chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Before that, she served in the California Assembly, first elected in 1976.\n\nThe congresswoman could not be reached for an interview. As in the past when facing only token opposition at the ballot box, Waters has not engaged in much of an election campaign, preferring to focus on her legislative duties.\n\nWaters has won handily, often with 70 percent of the vote or more, in the South Los Angeles district she\u2019s represented for 24 years. The redrawn 43rd now also takes in parts of Gardena, Hawthorne, Lennox, Westchester, Inglewood, Lawndale, Lomita and Torrance.\n\nWaters, who kicked off a United Small Business Alliance event on Oct. 16, was nicknamed \u201cKerosene Maxine\u201d by some of her detractors for her inflammatory remarks aimed at large financial institutions, the Tea Party and others. She once referred to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as a \u201cplantation owner\u201d and called former President George W. Bush a racist.\n\nIn 2010, the congresswoman was investigated for arranging a meeting with Treasury Department officials to help OneUnited Bank, in which her husband, Sidney Williams, had a financial interest. She was cleared of wrongdoing by the House Ethics Committee in 2012.\n\nShe is critical of Republican spending plans aimed at cutting the nation\u2019s expanding deficit.\n\n\u201cNo one disagrees about the need to reduce the deficit,\u201d she said in 2011. \u201cHowever, Democrats must continue to draw sharp distinctions for their constituents about how each party would go about it: end war, make the wealthy pay their fair share, and uphold the nation\u2019s safety net? Or end Medicare and Medicaid, allow defense spending to balloon, and repeal health care reform for millions of Americans?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same year, she spoke out in an MSNBC interview in support of increasing income taxes on those in the top 1 percent tax bracket.\n\n\u201cThey have been getting away with not paying their fair share. ... I think Republicans are going to have to not do what they\u2019ve been doing in the past and protecting the richest 1 percent in our country. They\u2019re going to have to come on board on this.\u201d\n\nShe voted against the 2002 Iraq War Resolution; Wood, her opponent, also participated in a demonstration against the war at that time.\n\nWaters was born in Missouri, moving with her family in 1961 to Los Angeles, where she worked in a garment factory and as a telephone operator.\n\nShe was hired as an assistant teacher in the Head Start program in Watts in 1966 and later attended what is now Cal State Los Angeles, graduating with a sociology degree in 1970.\n\nHer political career began when she became chief deputy to Los Angeles City Councilman David Cunningham Jr.\n\nWaters has sponsored legislation designed to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and supported the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nWood, who began his political volunteerism working on behalf of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 political campaign, said he\u2019s become more fiscally conservative through the years but stressed that government still plays an important role in providing a safety net for families.\n\nBut he\u2019s also sympathetic to the libertarian wing of the GOP that promotes small business and lower taxes.\n\nIn a district where only about 15 percent of the registered voters are Republican, it\u2019s been a tough sell, he acknowledges. But Wood said he brings an important voice to the Republican Party and would provide a needed voice on the other side of the aisle for struggling low-income citizens and minorities.\n\n\u201cMy purpose in running is to try to uplift the condition of folks, particularly for the folks who need it most,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019d like to see the GOP return to its roots as the \u201cparty of Lincoln,\u201d saying there are a range of issues on which agreement and common ground needs to be sought between the two parties.\n\nWhile saying that Waters has served the community well in many ways, he said she also tends to be among the more polarizing figures in Washington and that voters are looking for a change of guard.\n\n\u201cI consider myself to be fairly middle of the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that really inspired me about President Obama\u2019s candidacy in \u201908 was that he was really pursuing cultural change in the way we approach our politics. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for us to just judge each other right off the bat.\u201d\n\nAccording to the candidate\u2019s online biography, Wood is the grandson of the late record industry pioneer Randy Wood, who founded Dot Records in the 1950s and the nationally broadcast radio show and mail order record store \u201cRandy\u2019s Record Shop.\u201d His father, John Wood Sr., is a noted jazz pianist and his mother, Deonda Theus, an R&B vocalist.\n\nHis grandparents were delegates to the 1960 Democratic convention that nominated John F. Kennedy.\n\nHis Facebook page quotes the Beatles (\u201cThe love you take is equal to the love you make\u201d), identifies his political views as \u201ccenter-right\u201d and lists both Culver City and William Howard Taft high schools as his alma maters.\n\nWood, who is biracial, said he came to value political diversity as a healthy part of the American system.\n\nWood\u2019s father was white and hailed originally from Tennessee, a middle-of-the-road Kennedy Democrat who became more conservative later in life. Wood\u2019s mother was born in Los Angeles to a black family and was more liberal than her husband. His parents didn\u2019t always agree when it came to voting for the same candidates.\n\n\u201cI always look at Democrats and Republicans as \u2018mom and dad,\u2019 \u201d Wood said.\n\n\u201cThe center of American politics needs to be strengthened. I think I\u2019d have more leverage as a black Republican representing a minority district than a politician on the other (Democratic) side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nBread-and-butter economic, education and quality-of-life issues are the most important in the 43rd Congressional District, he said.\n\n\u201cThe economic and education problems that have plagued the inner city haven\u2019t improved over the last 30 or 40 years in some of these areas,\u201d he said.\n\nWood was born in Inglewood and grew up in Culver City. His wife is from Watts and the couple now live in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life, but I don\u2019t think overturning Roe v. Wade is as important as having a broader conversation about the health of the American family,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a political era characterized by partisanship and polarization, John Wood Jr. is hoping to revive some once-respected values: reconciliation, consensus and humility.\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have different perspectives and it\u2019", "title": "Newcomer in quixotic challenge of political veteran Maxine Waters in 43rd Congressional District", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/government-and-politics/20141018/newcomer-in-quixotic-challenge-of-political-veteran-maxine-waters-in-43rd-congressional-district", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20141018/NEWS/141019417/AR/0/AR-141019417.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "791px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Newcomer in quixotic challenge of political veteran Maxine Waters in 43rd Congressional District"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "In a political era characterized by partisanship and polarization, John Wood Jr. is hoping to revive some once-respected values: reconciliation, consensus and humility.\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have different perspectives and it\u2019", "title": "Newcomer in quixotic challenge of political veteran Maxine Waters in 43rd Congressional District", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/government-and-politics/20141018/newcomer-in-quixotic-challenge-of-political-veteran-maxine-waters-in-43rd-congressional-district", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20141018/NEWS/141019417/AR/0/AR-141019417.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Election 2014, Elections", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Election 2014, Elections"}, "article_summary": "Waters has won handily, often with 70 percent of the vote or more, in the South Los Angeles district she\u2019s represented for 24 years.\nWaters, 76, has been a fixture in Los Angeles and California politics for nearly four decades.\nShe once referred to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as a \u201cplantation owner\u201d and called former President George W.
