They can propose something that's more dense,\" provided the developer is \"willing to commit to 30 percent of the units being affordable. In simplified fashion, that's what the law says.\"\n\nFurther, unlike a standard development application, in the event a project proposed under the 8-30g statue is denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the onus falls on the town to support its reasons for the denial. Bloom said these are generally limited to environmental impact and safety issues, which still could potentially be amended by developers to win approval for the application in the courts.\n\nAt the heart of local concerns is the idea that developers can take advantage of the law by building much larger and denser housing projects than local regulations would allow. In some cases, following legal battles, projects have even gone forward without the original requisite number of affordable units.\n\n\"That's really a problem with the law that I see,\" said P&Z Director Larry Bradley. \"Developers don't always build the project they asked for \" They don't even have to build affordable housing.\"\n\nIn Westport, Bradley told the meeting, \"we have about 10,399 dwelling units, so in order to meet that 10 percent burden\" to be exempt from its provisions, would require construction of nearly 1,000 new units. \"We're closer to about 2 percent, two-and-a-half percent.\"\n\nA moratorium\n\nHe explained, however, that credits toward that goal can be accumulated with smaller projects that could allow Westport to be granted a four-year moratorium that exempts it from 8-30g. He said, in view of some current projects underway, the town was potentially only 30 or 40 units away from being able to gather enough \"points\" to make it happen.\n\n\"In order for us to get to the moratorium we probably will have to build another 30 or 40 units,\" he said.\n\n\"Will we ever get to the 10 percent?\" Bradley asked rhetorically. \"Probably not likely because that'll require another 1,000 units.\"\n\nOthers concurred.\n\n\"It'll be smart for us to try to find a way to get to that moratorium,\" said state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-136. \"It may allow us enough time in the Legislature to at least protect towns like Westport from the worst of it. We're very limited with what we can do with the statute as it exists today.\"\n\n\"There are better ways to encourage affordable housing than this statute,\" he said, noting that 8-30g is a punitive law rather than an incentive.\n\nHe and other state lawmakers said they plan to try to get the law changed, if not repealed.\n\nState Rep. Gail Lavielle, R-143, pointed out that the motive behind the law was about bringing the amenities of economic equality to more children and families, including better schools. She said cities like Norwalk -- and their lawmakers -- have no motivation to see the law changed, despite the sentiments of those living in suburban communities.\n\nState Sen. Tony Hwang, R-28, said that as the \"ranking leader on the housing committee,\" he believes a revision of the law can be facilitated.\n\nHe said that Westport and Fairfield are \"way ahead of 8-30g,\" though most of each town's existing affordable housing isn't counted under the statute. \"They don't count anything built before 1990 as part of that 10 percent \" If you look at the housing stock that was built before 1990, we would qualify,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not an example of a community that's trying to keep out affordable housing,\" he said, noting however that the two large projects on the drawing boards in Westport \"are inconsistent with the character of this town.\"\n\nHwang said, \"8-30g is being used as a statute to pursue economic gains.\"", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Plans for two large multiunit housing projects in Westport -- potentially filed under the state law that grants special consideration to \"affordable\" housing developments -- would be difficult to deny, a local forum on the law was told last week.
