The conference is closed to the public and the Kansas City Fed does not make its program available to the public until the day of the event. Here\u2019s what one can find when going to their website:\n\n\u201cThe 2015 Economic Symposium, \u201cInflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,\u201d will take place Aug. 27-29, 2015. (The program will be available at 6 p.m., MT, Aug. 27, 2015).\u201d\n\nThis information is treated as if it\u2019s \u201ctop secret.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not a top secret that the Federal Reserve lacks transparency, is not bound by any monetary rule, has more power than ever before (as a result of the unconventional monetary policies pursued since the 2008 financial crisis), and opposes a congressional audit\u2014even though the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate the value of money.\n\nLuckily, the American Principles Project will be holding a parallel conference near the Fed\u2019s site in Jackson Hole to evaluate the Fed\u2019s performance after more than 100 years and offer alternatives to a regime of pure discretionary government fiat money.\n\nThe topic of the APP conference\u2014\u201cIs Central Banking the Problem or the Solution?\u201d\u2014will give participants the opportunity to offer advice on how to improve the monetary regime, not just monetary policy. (On the same topic, see the Spring/Summer 2015 issue of the Cato Journal: \u201cAlternatives to Central Banking: Toward Free-Market Money\u201d)\n\nMark Calabria, director of Cato\u2019s Financial Regulation Studies, within Cato\u2019s newly established Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, will be speaking at the APP conference on Friday, August 28.
