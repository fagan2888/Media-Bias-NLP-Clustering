And researchers noted that other problems persist, including disproportionately high mortality rates and dependency on government checks.\n\nThe commission\u2019s leaders acknowledge that even after half a century, the need for aid is as great as ever, a sentiment echoed by heads of charities in the region.\n\n\u201cWe have serious work to do,\u201d Earl Gohl, the commission\u2019s federal co-chair, said Friday in a phone interview with The Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the study ahead of its release. \u201cThe report is more about helping us and helping our partners look at the future and understand what we\u2019ve accomplished and what we\u2019ve not accomplished, and we work from there. So it doesn\u2019t do agencies any good to be self-promoters.\u201d\n\nThe report was being presented to the region\u2019s governors in Washington on Sunday afternoon and released on the ARC\u2019s website the next day.\n\nResearchers from West Virginia University and a D.C.-area consultancy analyzed demographic data dating back to 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed a federal law creating the commission as a state-federal partnership. The agency\u2019s sprawling 420-county territory includes 25 million residents and pieces of 12 states stretching from New York to Mississippi.\n\nThe question of how much Appalachian residents have caught up financially yielded a complicated answer. The authors found the region narrowed the gap slightly in per capita income, for example. But that\u2019s at least partly because safety net programs such as social security and unemployment make up about 24 percent of personal income in the region, compared to 17 nationally.\n\nWhile infant mortality rate for the region has dropped significantly, mortality rates overall are close to where they were at the end of the 1960s, even though they\u2019ve dropped for the U.S. as a whole. The report cites higher rates of obesity and diabetes in Appalachia as possible contributors.\n\nResearchers did find that county employment and income levels in the region grew faster than a control group of similar counties elsewhere in the country. Over the 50-year period, counties that received ARC investment averaged 4.2 percent higher employment growth and 5.5 percent higher per capita income growth than the control group counties.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors estimate that more jobs were created by the ARC in its early years when it received higher funding from the government. The commission\u2019s funding level dropped significantly in the 1980s and hasn\u2019t returned to where it was in the 1970s, when measured in inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\n\u201cThe funding levels changed dramatically, and with that the commission changed dramatically as well. We moved from large appropriations funding big public works projects,\u201d said Gohl, who leads the agency with Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear,\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s now I would say a leaner commission that focuses on developing strategic partnerships.\u201d\n\nIn 50 years, the commission has invested an inflation-adjusted $3.8 billion in non-highway projects, which has drawn more than twice that in state, local and federal matching funds.\n\nThe founder of a charity that provides free clinics in Appalachia and elsewhere, Stan Brock of Remote Area Medical, lamented the lack of progress on public health in the 30 years he\u2019s worked in the region. Brock, who was interviewed before the report\u2019s release, said he\u2019s met with the ARC in Washington and is familiar with their work in the region, but he doesn\u2019t work directly with them.\n\nHe said that despite President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and state-level efforts to expand Medicaid, many people still fall through the cracks or can\u2019t find doctors who take government insurance such as Medicaid.\n\nAmong Remote Area Medical\u2019s largest events is a clinic in Wise County, Virginia, that draws about 3,000 people each summer. Many patients tell Brock it\u2019s the only time they see a doctor each year.\n\n\u201cWe are their single source of health care it seems, and that\u2019s not right,\u201d he said.\n\nOther charity workers said statistics don\u2019t do a good job of capturing some aspects of povertyin the mountains \u2014 such as homelessness \u2014 which isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere in the 180-page ARC report. People sleep on relatives\u2019 couches or in their cars in the winter and pitch tents on public land when it\u2019s warmer.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t understand that there are homeless people here because you will not see people out on the sidewalk asking for money, or begging for anything with signs up,\u201d said Christina Smith of Jackson Neighbors in Need, an organization in western North Carolina that helps the homeless.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the mountains are very proud people. They have a hard time asking for help when they need help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "The agency created five decades ago to fight\u00a0poverty\u00a0in Appalachia has helped county economies grow with nearly $4 billion in spending, but the region still lags in key measures of educational, economic and physical well-being, according to a new study.
