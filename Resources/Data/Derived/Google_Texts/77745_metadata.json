Quite a few Americans, probably numbering in the low millions, lost their old policies and are now paying more for replacements\u2014usually because the old plans lacked benefits like maternity and mental health or because insurers can no longer avoid the sickest and most expensive beneficiaries. You\u2019ve read about some of those people in these pages. These people are not happy and it\u2019s easy to see why: The president and his allies promised that everybody who liked their olds plans could keep them. But, as Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik has observed, these stories inevitably have a lot of nuance. These are people who, almost by definition, are healthy enough to have gotten cheap insurance before or make enough money that they don\u2019t qualify for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance discounts. That makes their tales less dramatic.\n\nA better subject for future conservative advertisements might be people with serious, even life-threatening diseases who need access to very specific specialists or hospitals\u2014and are now having difficulty, because their new plans have very narrow networks of providers. But even these stories have mitigating circumstances that media attention would reveal. Most of these people can find their way to comparable, albeit different, doctors and hospitals\u2014and at least some can keep the old ones if they\u2019re able and willing to pay more for it. Also, this kind of thing was a problem long before Obamacare came along. And that\u2019s not to mention the fact that, previously, many of these people lived in fear of losing their insurance altogether.\n\nIn short, these stories may generate sympathy but they are rarely the stuff of tragedy. And that\u2019s because of the protections Obamacare provides\u2014which is to say, the very things that Koch-funded right-wingers want to gut.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s Obamacare that sets a minimum standard for insurance, so that all policies include comprehensive benefits and set limits on out-of-pocket spending. It\u2019s Obamacare that puts coverage within financial reach of many more people than before, by offering those subsidies and then, for some people, reducing out-of-pocket expenses even more. In the old days, it wasn\u2019t so hard to find tear-jerker anecdotes: People without insurance or with inadequate insurance were filing for bankruptcy, losing their homes, and missing out on essential medicine. Now those stories are less common and, for the most part, they are among people who had these same problems previously. Telling the stories of these people would be a rationale for expanding the Affordable Care Act, not repealing it.\n\nAt some point, conservatives will find some tragic stories that are real. It\u2019s a big country, and a complex law, and there are bound to be a few people for whom the new changes work out really badly. But there are also good news stories\u2014lots of them. And while those stories inevitably have complications of their own, some are pretty dramatic. Democrats may not have figured out the politics of Obamacare.
