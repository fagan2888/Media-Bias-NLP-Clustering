promising that the militant group will not rest until Afghanistan is a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to The Associated Press\n\nMullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour vowed his organization will fight on in an audio recording released Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe jihad will continue until we establish the Islamic government in our country,\u201d Mansour said in the clip, AP reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT \u201cThis is a big responsibility for us,\u201d he told fellow Taliban fighters. \u201cThis is not the work of one, two or three people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should keep our unity,\u201d Mansour added. \u201cWe must be united \u2013 our enemy will be happy in our separation.\u201d\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid released the tape recording to news outlets Saturday morning.\n\nIt could not independently verify that Mansour is speaking in the half-hour clip.\n\nMansour called on Taliban forces to remain faithful to their interpretation of Islam in the message.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens must comply with Sharia law, whether that be jihad, or talks, or an invitation to either,\u201d he said of further conflict or peace talks with Afghanistan\u2019s government. \u201cOur decisions must all be based on Sharia law.\u201d\n\nMansour\u2019s remarks follow the confirmed death of Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban\u2019s first leader, earlier this week.\n\nThe White House verified that Omar is deceased in a statement Friday evening.\n\n\u201cWhile the exact circumstances of his death remain uncertain, it is clear that his demise, after decades of war and thousands of lives lost, represents a chance for yet more progress on the path to a stable, secure Afghanistan,\u201d the Obama administration said.\n\nOmar\u2019s death presents Mansour with major leadership challenges, given the Taliban has never had any other chief commander.\n\nHe called on Taliban members to remain cohesive.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be suspicious of each other,\u201d Mansour said. \u201cWe must accept each other.\u201d\n\nMansour was reportedly named Omar\u2019s successor during a Taliban gathering in Quetta, Pakistan, on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe shura held outside Quetta unanimously elected Mullah Mansour as the new emir of the Taliban,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nThe Taliban has appointed Siraj Haqqani, head of its powerful Haqqani militant faction, as Mansour\u2019s deputy.\n\nThe Islamist group also revealed it is postponing its next round of peace talks with Afghanistan following confusion over Omar\u2019s death.", "article_metadata":
