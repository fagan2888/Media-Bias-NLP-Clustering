This also means that the insurance companies are now required to take on more risks.\n\nThus, someone with breast cancer, heart disease, or even acne shouldn\u2019t have to go without coverage or pay a substantially higher premium.\n\nExcept, if you\u2019re taking medication for your pre-existing condition.\n\nAmericans with a pre-existing condition, like HIV/AIDS may not be able to afford their medications in 2014. Under some policies in the insurance exchanges, some common prescriptions for the disease are not covered and others require a much higher out-of-pocket spending than for other drugs.\n\nThe exchange system also makes it easy to compare costs of premiums but not the costs for medications. Thus, a buyer will have to do some research to find out if their meds will be covered and at what cost.\n\nInsurance companies organize medications into \u201ctiers,\u201d and each tier has a different level of cost-sharing. A lowest tier may be free to the patient, while the higher tier requires fixed copay or a percentage paid. HIV/AIDS meds are usually in a higher tier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making sure that formularies are robust, and [insurance companies] are not utilizing management techniques\u2014like tiering or prior approval\u2014that create unfair or undue burdens on people to meet their standard of care,\u201d says Robert Greenwald, director of the Center of Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School, and a co-chair of HIV Health Care Access Working Group.\n\nThe fear is that more insurance companies will place expensive medications at the higher tiers to offset the risk of covering less than healthy people.\n\n\u201cOf the six health plans offered through Illinois\u2019 Obamacare insurance exchange, for example, just two offer accompanying prescription drug coverage that allow HIV patients to obtain prescription medications with copays of $50 or less,\u201d according to says John Peller, vice president of policy at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. But for more expensive HIV medications, some policies require a percentage paid, some as high as 50 percent. This could equally be thousands of dollars.\n\nWith higher drug costs (but not premium costs) this could still leave out the very Americans that the president promised his plan would insure. Obama was able to make small victories: since 2010 the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d or coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug plans, has been shrinking, so seniors won\u2019t have to choose between meds or food. But for the younger, sick, and poor Americans relying on the ACA exchange; will they fall through this doughnut hole?\n\nS.C. Rhyne is a blogger and novelist in New York City.
