A “regular” customer at a Kennedy Boulevard convenience store won $50,000 in a state Lottery scratch-off game last month.

The winning $5 Super Crossword scratch-off ticket was sold at Sarah Deli. Owner Mohammed McElry said the lucky winner comes in often, usually purchases two tickets and then scratches them off in his car. The odds of winning $50,000 in the game are 90,000-to-1.

The store owner said the winner raced back into the convenience store that day, ecstatic about his winning ticket. McElry, who received a $1,000 bonus for selling the lucky ticket, said that this is only the second time that he had a big winner.
