The real estate website projects that median rents will tick up slightly this year to $1,396 from $1,381 in 2015.\n\nThe projected slowdown in rent hikes for 2016 reflects increased supply, as builders bring new multi-family homes to market to meet growing demand. Atlanta, Denver, Portland and Seattle are among the markets that have seen significant increases in rental housing supply, according to Zillow.\n\nRelated: The States With the Hottest Housing Markets\n\nEven with the slowdown, rents will take a big bite out of the budgets of residents of large cities, particularly those on the West Coast. Rents in San Francisco and Los Angeles claim 40 percent of the median income.\n\n\u201cHot markets are still going to be hot in 2016, but rents won\u2019t rise as quickly as they\u2019ve been,\u201d Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell said in a statement. Rents in San Francisco, for example, are projected to appreciate 5.9 percent in 2016 to $3,338, less than half the 12.5 percent rate at which they grew last year.\n\nIn 2013, nearly 21 million renters were living in homes they couldn\u2019t afford (defined as paying more than 30 percent of income on housing), according to report issued last year by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. The number has likely gone up since then as rents have continued to climb while wages remain relatively stagnant.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Renters may finally get some relief in 2016.", "title": "Here\u2019s How Much Your Rent Will Go Up This Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/22/Here-s-How-Much-Your-Rent-Will-Go-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01182013_Tax_Laws_Rentals_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/22/Here-s-How-Much-Your-Rent-Will-Go-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01182013_Tax_Laws_Rentals_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Renters may finally get some relief in 2016.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Atlanta, Denver, Portland and Seattle are among the markets that have seen significant increases in rental housing supply, according to Zillow.\nThe projected slowdown in rent hikes for 2016 reflects increased supply, as builders bring new multi-family homes to market to meet growing demand.\nAfter several years of record increases, rental prices will level off in 2016, according to a new Zillow forecast.\nThe real estate website projects that median rents will tick up slightly this year to $1,396 from $1,381 in 2015.\nThe number has likely gone up since then as rents have continued to climb while wages remain relatively stagnant."}
