Officials cite studies that have found the cameras have a minor impact in reducing accidents, \u201cand in some cases may increase them,\u201d the report noted.\n\nCurrently, 21 states and Washington, D.C., have laws permitting the cameras while another 10 states prohibit their use altogether, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Red-light cameras across Missouri were ordered to a stop this week after the state Supreme Court nullified multiple local laws authorizing the programs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Red-light cameras across Missouri were ordered to a stop this week after the state Supreme Court nullified multiple local laws authorizing the programs.", "title": "Red-Light Cameras Hit Road Bump in Missouri Court Ruling", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150820_RedLightCameras_Johnson1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LmXxJM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Red-light cameras across Missouri were ordered to a stop this week after the state Supreme Court nullified multiple local laws authorizing the programs.", "title": "Red-Light Cameras Hit Road Bump in Missouri Court Ruling", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150820_RedLightCameras_Johnson1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-08-20T14:08:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Missouri Supreme Court, red-light cameras, St. Louis, St. Peters, Kansas City"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb9a\"", "article_summary": "Red-light cameras across Missouri were ordered to a stop this week after the state Supreme Court nullified multiple local laws authorizing the programs.\nThe Missouri rulings highlight a series of legal complications across the U.S. regarding the use of red-light cameras.\nThe number of local and state governments using red-light cameras has fallen since 2012, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\nThe Missouri Supreme Court declared, in one of multiple rulings Tuesday, red-light camera ordinances in Kansas City and St. Peters were invalid because they treated violations as parking tickets and did not deduct driving points as state law requires.\nBut the court did not touch on the legality of the cameras themselves, \u201cleaving open the possibility that municipalities can enact red-light camera ordinances that will withstand future legal challenges,\u201d the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported."}
