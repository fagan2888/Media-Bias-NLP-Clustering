The cells ended up being the first human cells to reproduce in culture \u2014 a massive medical breakthrough \u2014 and have been shared among researchers to play a role in the development of polio vaccine, in vitro fertilization, and other developments. Lacks\u2019s family, however, had no idea these cells (nicknamed HeLa by scientists) even existed.\n\nThe book, published in 2010, was a New York Times Bestseller and was selected for the summer reading list at Knox County Schools\u2019 L&N STEM Academy. Jackie Sims has a 15-year-old son attending the school as a sophomore, and told WBIR that the book did not come with a warning or permission form.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that there was so much graphic information in the book,\u201d Sims said. Her son had brought the book to her when passages he read made him uncomfortable.\n\nSims says the book appalled her, specifically a passage describing infidelity and a passage that describes Lacks\u2019s discovery of a lump on her cervix.\n\n\u201cI consider the book pornographic,\u201d she said, adding that the wording of the book is what bothers her the most. She believes the book could have been written in a less graphic way.\n\nPer district policy, her son has been provided with an alternate text, but his mother says she wants to see the text gone from the hands of all Knox County school students.\n\nSims is not alone in her objection to the book, but not everyone agrees with her condemnation of a text that broaches important topics with students, including bioethics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Shelly Higgins, another eighth grade parent, told WBIR.\n\nHiggins plans on letting her son read the book, and thinks that the book teaches relevant lessons on history and ethics. She does not appreciate the efforts of Sims and others who wish to ban the book district-wide.\n\n\u201cTo try and stop the book from being read by all students is, to me, a modern day kind of book burning,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone comes along and tries to take the book out of the curriculum, then that affects me and my child. \u2026 If the parent doesn\u2019t want the child to read it, the parent doesn\u2019t want the child to read it, but do not take away everybody else\u2019s choice to read that book.\u201d\n\nSims asks parents to read the book before forming an opinion.\n\n\u201cI respect each parent\u2019s right to decide what they want their child to read. I really do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy major point is: Don\u2019t take that opportunity away from all the students.\n\nSims however, plans to take her appeal as far as she can, \u201cbecause I just feel that strongly about it being out of the hands of our children.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tennessee, mother, calls, banning, henrietta, lacks, book, says, it, pornographic", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Parents are at odds about a non-fiction book that was assigned to children in this Tennessee town.", "title": "Tennessee Mom Calls For Ban On 'Pornographic' Henrietta Lacks Book", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tennessee-mother-calls-banning-henrietta-lacks-book-says-it-pornographic-351828", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/henrietta-lacks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parents are at odds about a non-fiction book that was assigned to children in this Tennessee town.", "title": "Tennessee Mom Calls For Ban On 'Pornographic' Henrietta Lacks Book", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tennessee-mother-calls-banning-henrietta-lacks-book-says-it-pornographic-351828", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/henrietta-lacks.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/henrietta-lacks.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-09T16:27:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-09T16:27:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Parents are at odds about a non-fiction book that was assigned to children in this Tennessee town."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf53\"", "article_summary": "Higgins plans on letting her son read the book, and thinks that the book teaches relevant lessons on history and ethics.\n\u201cI was shocked that there was so much graphic information in the book,\u201d Sims said.\n\u201cI consider the book pornographic,\u201d she said, adding that the wording of the book is what bothers her the most.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Shelly Higgins, another eighth grade parent, told WBIR.\n\u201cTo try and stop the book from being read by all students is, to me, a modern day kind of book burning,\u201d she said."}
