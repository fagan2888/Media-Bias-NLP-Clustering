Pamela McLoughlin \u2014 New Haven Register\n\nMILFORD >> With a cut of a ribbon and a prayer to \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d Hobby Lobby held its grand opening ceremony Monday at 1777 Boston Post Road, as customers waited for the doors to open.\n\nThe store, founded by David Green, who still runs the chain today \u201cin a manner consistent with biblical principle,\u201d according to its website, opened Friday to customers, but the grand opening bargains began Monday.\n\nThe store carries fabric, crafting products, home decor items and holiday decorations. The store is located in the former Sports Authority building near the Orange line.\n\nHobby Lobby is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Saturday and closed Sundays \u2014 as the sign on the door says, \u201cTo allow employees time for family and worship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Milford store is the third in Connecticut, with others located in East Haven and, more recently, Manchester.\n\nEven though there\u2019s another Hobby Lobby right in East Haven, many excited customers said they felt it was too long a drive, so this was their first visit.\n\nShopper Tara Kaufman of Milford was one of the first few customers ready to step in the door at 9 a.m. \u2014 her second trip already.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an amazing mixture of Jo\u2011Ann\u2019s (fabric and crafts), Michael\u2019s and Christmas Tree Shops,\u201d Kaufman said.\n\nAlice Anglero of Orange was so excited she was literally bouncing and couldn\u2019t decide which to do first, shop or apply for a job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than a craft store,\u201d she said, holding up a decorative sign for sale that reads: \u201cEven Superheroes Brush Their Teeth.\u201d\n\nMilford Chamber of Commerce President Kathy Alagno said the store will create 35 to 50 full- and part-time jobs at $15 per hour.\n\nHobby Lobby has more than 600 stores across the nation and was started by Green on a much smaller scale in 1972.\n\n\u201cThe jobs are great \u2014 not just for Milford, but on a regional basis,\u201d Alagno said. She said any time a business opens, everyone benefits because jobs are created and there is more put on the local, state and federal tax rolls.\n\nBefore cutting the ribbon, store manager Willie Gray said Hobby Lobby is \u201cthrilled\u201d to be in Milford and he thanked employees for working so hard in recent weeks to get the store ready.\n\nDistrict manager Troy Moore thanked everybody and offered words of prayer, thanking God for the community, the store and wrapped it up with, \u201cIn Jesus\u2019 name we pray.\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby has stirred controversy in Connecticut and the nation by winning the right through a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July to limit the birth control coverage it offers its employees.\n\nThe decision has been cheered by conservatives and opponents of the 2009 federal health care overhaul, but set off a wave of protests at Hobby Lobby stores at the time, including the East Haven store.\n\nBut there were no protesters at the Milford opening and customers said they were not fazed by the company\u2019s position on the Affordable Care Act, although they support the store being closed on Sundays.\n\nBert Belden of Shelton said she loves Hobby Lobby\u2019s fabrics and other merchandise so much she visits the stores wherever she travels, including in Indiana, Georgia and Florida. She\u2019s also been to the East Haven store.\n\nHer friend, Arlene Sambrook, also of Shelton, said the fabrics are great and there is more of a selection than at similar stores.\n\n\u201cAll the different things they have are exciting,\u201d said Sambrook, also bobbing with anticipation. \u201cThe things they have are the things you don\u2019t need, but you want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lifestyle, Lifestyle news, New Haven Lifestyle news, CT Lifestyle news, US Lifestyle news, world Lifestyle news.", "title": "Hobby Lobby in Milford celebrates grand opening with prayer, bargains", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/lifestyle/20141013/hobby-lobby-in-milford-celebrates-grand-opening-with-prayer-bargains", "image": {"width": "800px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141013/NEWS/141019811/AR/0/AR-141019811.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "800px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Hobby Lobby in Milford celebrates grand opening with prayer, bargains"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "MILFORD >> With a cut of a ribbon and a prayer to \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d Hobby Lobby held its grand opening ceremony Monday at 1777 Boston Post Road, as customers waited for the doors to open.", "title": "Hobby Lobby in Milford celebrates grand opening with prayer, bargains", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/lifestyle/20141013/hobby-lobby-in-milford-celebrates-grand-opening-with-prayer-bargains", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141013/NEWS/141019811/AR/0/AR-141019811.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Lifestyle, Lifestyle news, New Haven Lifestyle news, CT Lifestyle news, US Lifestyle news, world Lifestyle news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "MILFORD >> With a cut of a ribbon and a prayer to \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d Hobby Lobby held its grand opening ceremony Monday at 1777 Boston Post Road, as customers waited for the doors to open."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc71a\"", "article_summary": "Alice Anglero of Orange was among the first few customers ready to shop when Hobby Lobby finished its grand opening ceremony in Milford Monday.\nHobby Lobby has more than 600 stores across the nation and was started by Green on a much smaller scale in 1972.\nShe\u2019s also been to the East Haven store.\nEven though there\u2019s another Hobby Lobby right in East Haven, many excited customers said they felt it was too long a drive, so this was their first visit.\nPamela McLoughlin \u2014 New Haven RegisterMILFORD >> With a cut of a ribbon and a prayer to \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d Hobby Lobby held its grand opening ceremony Monday at 1777 Boston Post Road, as customers waited for the doors to open."}
