They are expected to save money through tactics such as well-coordinated care, use of preventive care and taking a proactive approach toward high-risk patients.\n\nPinnacleHealth CEO Michael Young said in a news release, \u201cWe are putting the patient at the center of care, helping them to navigate the healthcare system so they get the right care, from the right provider, at the right time and in the right place.\u201d\n\nPinnacleHealth said in December that affected patients would be receiving letters from their doctors, and that their Medicare coverage and their doctors won\u2019t change.\n\nWhile these patients can still see doctors who aren\u2019t part of River Health ACO, they will receive more coordinated care if they choose a doctor participating in River Health, according to PinnacleHealth.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government announced last week that ACOs saved about $380 million in 2012, their first year of existence.\n\nSince 2012, 360 ACOs have been formed, with the organizations covering 5.4 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','health care'", "title": "Some central Pennsylvania Medicare users receiving care under new Obamacare program", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Some central Pennsylvania Medicare users receiving care under new Obamacare program\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/02/accountable_care_obamacare_aff.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/business/photo/14183765-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12123350\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-03T21:31:40Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"health care\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/business/photo/14183765-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Accountable Care Organizations that save money get to keep part of the money while giving some back to Medicare."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, February 03, 2014,  6:39 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/business/photo/shutterstock-medical2jpg-71de7bb1aea78939.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Accountable Care Organizations that save money get to keep part of the money while giving some back to Medicare.", "title": "Some central Pennsylvania Medicare users receiving care under new Obamacare program", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/02/accountable_care_obamacare_aff.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, February 03, 2014,  4:31 PM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "Accountable Care Organizations that save money get to keep part of the money while giving some back to Medicare."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb27e\"", "article_summary": "In January, about 41,000 Medicare beneficiaries began receiving medical care under a new program being carried about by PinnacleHealth System and five other health care organizations.\nACOs \u2014 Accountable Care Organizations \u2014 are intended promote better coordination of medical care for patients such as people with expensive medical conditions such as diabetes and congestive heart failure.\nThe six organizations joined together to form River Health ACO, a local version of a new type of entity created as a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nWhile these patients can still see doctors who aren\u2019t part of River Health ACO, they will receive more coordinated care if they choose a doctor participating in River Health, according to PinnacleHealth.\nThey are expected to save money through tactics such as well-coordinated care, use of preventive care and taking a proactive approach toward high-risk patients."}
