The fact is, a third of our patients live in Rohnert Park,\u201d said Kathryn Powell, the health center\u2019s CEO.\n\nAt more than 35,000 square feet, the Rohnert Park Health Center includes more than a dozen rooms for dental care, two primary care-focused rooms, a number of rooms for mental health services, a large group room, a pharmacy and optometry services. Launching the facility cost a total of $9 million, paid by a combination of health center revenue, private grants and a $900,000 allocation from the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors.\n\nIt is the fifth location for Petaluma Health Center and the first outside of the city. The health center also operates clinics at Casa Grande High School, San Antonio High School and the Mary Isaak Center, and serves a total of 25,000 patients.\n\nLike the Petaluma location, the Rohnert Park Health Center will focus on serving populations that have historically lacked an ongoing relationship with a primary care doctor \u2014 a key starting point for preventative and specialty medicine. Such individuals are typically low-income, and face challenges including inadequate insurance coverage.\n\nOriginally launched as a department of the Petaluma Health Care District, which owns Petaluma Valley Hospital, the health center was created in part to address the pressure such patients were putting on the hospital\u2019s emergency room.\n\n\u201cIn Petaluma there were thousands of people without access to care, other than on an episode-to-episode basis in emergency rooms,\u201d said Daymon Doss, who retired from his role as district CEO in 2011.\n\nThe program spun off as an independent \u201cfederally qualified health center\u201d in 2001, a designation that allowed it to receive special federal and state funding in exchange for providing primary care to those underserved populations. It has since evolved into an organization that Doss described as one of the best in the United States, offering a wide range of services beyond the scope of many health centers around the country.\n\n\u201cOnce we actually opened a health center in Petaluma, we saw it wasn\u2019t just an issue for medical care, but for mental and dental care, too,\u201d said Doss, who is now an independent consultant having joined the health center as acting chief operating officer in June. \u201cIt has grown and evolved into a complete health care system.\u201d\n\nPowell said the center serves 3,000 to 4,000 patients each year who are not considered low-income.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Petaluma Health Center is just days away from launching a new comprehensive", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Petaluma Argus Courier", "description": "The new location is the first outside of the city for Petaluma Health Center.", "title": "Petaluma Health Center opens Rohnert Park branch", "url": "http://www.petaluma360.com/news/4266303-181/petaluma-health-center-opens-rohnert", "image": "http://www.petaluma360.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=$tYfrDmDcSCDcHtONcYus8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtpVz7$TJ$aA8d3xpJC5rGTWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "description_old": "Petaluma Health Center is just days away from launching a new comprehensive"}, "fb": {"app_id": 175505928793}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-03T00:01:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It is the fifth location for Petaluma Health Center and the first outside of the city.\nPetaluma Health Center is just days away from launching a new comprehensive primary care facility in Rohnert Park, a city that is home to a significant portion of its rapidly growing patient base.\nThe fact is, a third of our patients live in Rohnert Park,\u201d said Kathryn Powell, the health center\u2019s CEO.\nOriginally launched as a department of the Petaluma Health Care District, which owns Petaluma Valley Hospital, the health center was created in part to address the pressure such patients were putting on the hospital\u2019s emergency room.\nLike the Petaluma location, the Rohnert Park Health Center will focus on serving populations that have historically lacked an ongoing relationship with a primary care doctor \u2014 a key starting point for preventative and specialty medicine."}
