Awareness about these benefits can help thousands of Californians who lose their coverage maintain access to important, and sometimes life-saving, medicine.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Assemblymember Jim Wood for introducing AB 2115,\u201d said Sara Radcliffe, President and CEO, California Life Sciences Association (CLSA). \u201cEven with improvements in healthcare brought about by the Affordable Care Act, it is important that people who find themselves without health insurance, such as after losing or changing jobs, have the information necessary to ensure they still have affordable access to the important medications they need. This increased outreach and transparency will help us continue to close the gap among the uninsured, and help ensure all Californians have access to healthcare.\u201d\n\nMany Californians don\u2019t realize the options available to them when they lose their existing coverage. AB 2115 will help people whose insurance may be in limbo obtain the information they need about how to maintain access to key healthcare services for themselves and their families.\n\nAB 2115 passed out of the Assembly Committee on Health by a unanimous vote of 19-0 on April 12.\n\nAbout California Life Sciences Association (CLSA) California Life Sciences Association (CLSA) is the leading voice for California\u2019s life sciences sector.
