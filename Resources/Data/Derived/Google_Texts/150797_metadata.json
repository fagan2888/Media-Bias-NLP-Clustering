If you missed it, the article, based on American Enterprise Institute research, said the typical American family of four should expect $7,450 in additional health care costs, all because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf true, that certainly sounds problematic. With a weak economy and stagnant wages, an average household would struggle to afford those increased costs.\n\nThe problem, as Igor Volsky explained, is that the Forbes piece is entirely wrong.\n\nTo translate that number to a \u201ctypical American family,\u201d [the AEI\u2019s Chris Conover] took \u201cthe latest year-by-year projections, divided by the projected U.S. population to determine the added amount per person,\u201d multiplied that result by four and voila: Obamacare will add $7,450 to average health spending for a family of four between 2014 and 2022! One economist interviewed by ThinkProgress, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities\u2019 Paul Van de Water, described this calculation as one of the stupidest things he\u2019s read in a long time and likened it to arguing that college costs will increase for a \u201ctypical\u201d family if the federal government adopts policies that help lower-income Americans afford college educations. Yes, the nation will spend more on education if more students enroll in colleges and universities, but the \u201ctypical\u201d student already attending college won\u2019t; she or he will continuing paying tuition at more or less the same rate, while the newly-enrolled student will presumably benefit from some sort of subsidized tuition rate. The same is true here. The so-called \u201ctypical\u201d family that Conover describes already receives health care insurance through their employer. The existence of 30 million newly-insured people \u2013 many of whom will receive tax credits if they purchase insurance in the law\u2019s exchanges \u2013 won\u2019t do much to move their premiums in one way or another.\n\nMIT\u2019s Jonathan Gruber went on to Volsky, \u201cThis is a typically misleading use of data by opponents of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nI no longer find myself surprised by developments like these. Conservative opponents of the Affordable Care Act have been pushing easily discredited attacks for quite a while, in some cases because conservative wonks just aren\u2019t very good, and in other cases because the right feels justified in making claims they know to be untrue.\n\nBut I\u2019m always left with the same question: if \u201cObamacare\u201d were really so awful, shouldn\u2019t conservative criticism be a lot easier?\n\nMuch to the chagrin of the right (and to Politico), most of the news surrounding the Affordable Care Act has been pretty encouraging of late. That said, if the law\u2019s critics want to focus on areas of concern, there are legitimate criticisms they can point to.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing, for example, some glitches in the Obamacare exchanges. As Jonathan Cohn explained, they\u2019re not worth freaking out over, but if you\u2019re a Republican desperate to shine a light on implementation problems, you can seize on something like this to advance a partisan cause.\n\nThere are also legitimate concerns about the law pushing private insurers to restrict provider options for those who get coverage through exchanges. If conservatives wanted to jump up and down about this, too, they\u2019d at least be dealing with reality. Does it mean the law is a fiasco, doomed to failure? No. Is it a real problem worthy of attention? Sure.\n\nBut our discourse has become so stunted and unproductive that we\u2019re instead stuck with nonsense such as the Forbes piece, which had been thoroughly debunked before close of business. (Of course, if recent history is any guide, the fact that the claims have been discredited won\u2019t stop Republican members of Congress from repeating them on national television every day for the foreseeable future.)\n\nNote to Obamacare\u2019s detractors: when you cling to evidence that\u2019s wrong, you make the law look better, not worse. If the law was as bad as you claim, you\u2019d have real defects to point to, not made-up stuff.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "One of the more talked about pieces in conservative media yesterday came by way of Forbes, and it caused quite a stir.
