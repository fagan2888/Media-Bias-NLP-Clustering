(AP) - A look at where Pennsylvania\u2019s four Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate - John Fetterman, Katie McGinty, Joe Sestak and Joe Vodvarka - stand on a selection of issues, from abortion to transportation. The primary election is Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nABORTION\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak support abortion rights, and would oppose legislation to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Vodvarka opposes abortion rights.\n\n___\n\nDEFICIT/DEBT\n\nTo close the nation\u2019s deficit and lower the national debt, Fetterman said he supports closing the carried interest loophole, which allows hedge fund managers \u201cto get away with paying one of the lowest tax rates.\u201d He said he also supports ensuring that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes, ending inversions and offshore subsidiaries and legalizing and taxing marijuana.\n\nMcGinty said she supports closing corporate tax loopholes that encourage companies to \u201cship jobs overseas.\u201d\n\nSestak said he would support closing \u201cmany corporate tax credits, deductions and loopholes that allow corporations to pay an effective tax rate of somewhere between 13 and 17 percent.\u201d That includes ending \u201cinversions\u201d to take advantage of tax laws in low-tax countries, instituting a hybrid tax holiday in which companies with money overseas are taxed 10 percent for bringing their profits back onshore, with an option to keep half of it to invest in either workforce training or domestic capital projects.\n\nVodvarka said he would impose tariffs on certain foreign imports and impose a 15 percent tax on the profits U.S. companies overseas.\n\n___\n\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak support President Barack Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s new carbon pollution regulations on power plants, called the \u201cClean Power Plan,\u201d and its agreement to a United Nations accord on global warming in which countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity in the coming decades.\n\nVodvarka opposes both.\n\n___\n\nFINANCIAL REGULATIONS\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak said they support the Dodd-Frank Act of 2011, a new post-recession regulatory scheme for banks.\n\nFetterman and Sestak said they support the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that once separated commercial and investment banking. It was repealed in 1999. McGinty did not say whether she would support its reinstatement or not.\n\nVodvarka said he was unfamiliar with both laws.\n\n___\n\nGAY RIGHTS\n\nAll four support same-sex marriage and civil protection for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.\n\n___\n\nGUN RIGHTS\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak would support requiring background checks for online gun sales and purchases at gun shows; a ban on the manufacture and sale of automatic firearms: a ban on allowing people on the terrorist watch list to obtain a firearm; increasing federal criminal penalties against people who make \u201cstraw purchases\u201d; expanding gun-buying prohibitions to abusive dating partners and convicted stalkers; imposing a federal limit on magazine capacity; allowing federal funding for gun violence prevention research; granting broader authority to the federal government to release firearm trace data; requiring gun dealers to submit their inventories to law enforcement agencies; and repealing a federal law that shields gun manufacturers from liability in cases where their weapons are used in crimes.\n\nMcGinty also would support a ban on the sale of armor-piercing \u201ccop killer\u201d bullets.\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak oppose federal reciprocity legislation to require every state to recognize and allow the use of concealed carry licenses or permits issued by other states.\n\nVodvarka opposes additional gun control measures.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak support Obama\u2019s 2010 federal health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and Sestak voted for it as a member of the U.S. House. All three also voiced support for \u201csingle payer\u201d health care that excludes private health insurance companies. Fetterman said single payer health care \u201cis the ideal that we should all move towards.\u201d McGinty said single payer health care \u201cwould squeeze so much of the excessive costs out of our health care system.\u201d Sestak said he supports the \u201cpublic option\u201d concept that did not make it into the final version of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVodvarka said he believes marketplace coverage under the Affordable Care Act will collapse and that measures need to be taken to improve competition among health insurers to cover more people.\n\n___\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak support the \u201cDREAM Act,\u201d which would establish a path toward citizenship for people who came to the United States illegally as children and who attend college or join the military; a 2012 Obama administration policy of allowing young people in the country illegally who have no criminal history and graduated from high school or served in the military to remain in the county; a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 that would establish a path toward citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States; and Obama\u2019s executive order in 2014 to allow up to 5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally - mainly the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents - to work legally in the United States.\n\nVodvarka said he supports a national referendum on policies that would allow immigrants living in the U.S illegally to stay.\n\n___\n\nLABOR UNIONS\n\nAll four said they support the right to organize and collectively bargain and would oppose efforts to ban unions from collecting \u201cfair share\u201d fees from nonmembers.\n\n___\n\nMARIJUANA\n\nFetterman said he supports the full legalization of marijuana. McGinty, Sestak and Vodvarka said they support the legalization of medical marijuana and the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana possession.\n\nVodvarka said he would support a national referendum on whether to legalize marijuana.\n\n___\n\nMIDDLE EAST\n\nAll four oppose the use of ground troops in Syria.\n\nFetterman, McGinty and Sestak support the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran.\n\nVodvarka opposes the nuclear accord with Iran.\n\n___\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nAll four support an increase in the federal minimum wage, currently set at $7.25 an hour. Fetterman and McGinty support an increase to $15 an hour. Sestak said he supports an increase to $10.80 an hour. Vodvarka supports an increase to around $10 an hour.\n\n___\n\nPOLICE\n\nFetterman and Sestak said they support President Obama\u2019s order last year ending long-running federal transfers of some combat-style gear to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nMcGinty did not say whether she supports it.\n\nVodvarka said he would support a referendum on whether to end the transfers.\n\n___\n\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE\n\nFetterman has endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominating contest. McGinty has endorsed Hillary Clinton. Sestak and Vodvarka are not endorsing a candidate.\n\n___\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY\n\nAll four oppose the diversion of Social Security payroll taxes into privately managed investment accounts. All four said they oppose cutting Social Security benefits or raising the retirement age. Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support raising the income limit for Social Security payroll taxes, currently $118,500. Vodvarka said he would not raise the income limit.\n\nSestak said he supports the creation of a new \u201cConsumer Price Index for Elderly Consumer\u201d to ensure year-to-year benefit increases more closely match rising costs for seniors.\n\n___\n\nTRADE\n\nAll four oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement with 11 Pacific Rim nations that Obama\u2019s U.S. trade representative signed in February and that is awaiting congressional approval. However, Sestak said he believes the trade agreement can be renegotiated to be acceptable - such by as protecting intellectual property - and that it a strong agreement is important to domestic job creation and blunting Chinese economic influence over Asian nations.\n\n___\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nFetterman said he supports Obama\u2019s proposal to impose a $10 fee per-barrel of oil to help fund investments in clean transportation that fight climate change and he would support an increase in the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent, primarily to fix the most desperate repairs.\n\nMcGinty said she would seek to raise the money through closing corporate tax loopholes.\n\nSestak said he would end state and federal subsidies to the oil, gas, and coal industry to subsidize clean and renewable energy sources. For highways, he said he would support reducing or eliminating the gasoline tax in favor of a \u201cfair use-based formula\u201d to improve Highway Trust Fund solvency and create a national transportation infrastructure bank.\n\nVodvarka said he would support imposing tariffs on some foreign imports.\n\n___\n\nFollow Marc Levy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/timelywriter.
