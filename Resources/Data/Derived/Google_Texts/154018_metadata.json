It\u2019s not simply a professional rivalry \u2014 it\u2019s clearly personal.\n\n\u201cMy competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat-Republican talking points,\u201d Savage told POLITICO. \u201cThat\u2019s all he\u2019s ever done. That\u2019s all he can do. He has no education. I\u2019m just going to lay it on the line, I\u2019m not going to mince words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could say, well, I\u2019m a snob,\u201d Savage said. \u201cWell, ok, I\u2019m proud of my doctorate, two master\u2019s degrees, I\u2019m proud of my 28 books, including many in health. And so, yeah, I\u2019m proud of my academic achievements. I believe it\u2019s embarrassing for people to act as experts, even in politics, if they don\u2019t have a rigorous training in anything.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Hannity to be Gohmert State of the Union guest)\n\nHannity attended New York University and Adelphi University, but left both before graduating so he could pursue a broadcasting career, according to a biography.\n\nHannity doesn\u2019t name-check Savage on air, though he has alluded to him. When asked about the feud, Hannity blamed his competitor.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Hannity told POLITICO. \u201cI love everybody in this business. This guy is obsessed with me, I\u2019m not obsessed with him. And, you know, I understand the Dickeys are bitter because I left,\u201d referring to the heads of Cumulus.\n\nSavage, 71, kicked off 2014 with his show \u201cThe Savage Nation\u201d moving into the prime 3-6 p.m. afternoon drive timeslot on Cumulus radio stations. Savage scored the spot when Hannity split with Cumulus last year and re-upped his contract with Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications.\n\nJohn Dickey, the executive vice president and co-COO of Cumulus, told POLITICO in a statement that Savage \u201cis off to the great start we expected in this important timeslot and we\u2019re very pleased about how listeners and advertisers are responding.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Savage is relishing his new time \u2014 and the rivalry with Hannity. Savage says the root of the personal conflict is Hannity, who has told unflattering tall tales about him. Savage would not detail what Hannity has said, saying he \u201cwould rather not repeat the lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving said that, now he says things about me, I\u2019ve heard, that are bordering on slander,\u201d Savage said. \u201cHe\u2019s making allegations about sexual activities, etc., that if he keeps it up, I\u2019m going to sue him. Because he\u2019s making it up out of whole cloth.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Krauthammer: Obama got 'whiny')\n\nHannity has alluded to Savage, although not by name, on several occasions on his own 3-6 p.m. EST show. On April 25, 2013, Hannity was discussing how disgraced politician Anthony Weiner had recently admitted there might be additional personal photographs of himself out there and noted, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, too, about people with the last name Weiner. If you Google \u2018talk show host Weiner Fiji Ginsberg,\u2019 boy is it a shocker. Must be the last name. Just Google it.\u201d\n\nSavage was born Michael Weiner and later changed his last name.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hannity again brought up the reference to the beat poet Allen Ginsberg, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s a mystery that we will one day unfold to you. Who is the phony conservative radio host, who is this guy, who once went \u2014 really old man, bitter, angry, pathetic \u2014 that once went skinny-dipping, claims to be, he\u2019s a phony conservative \u2014 according to reports, we\u2019re only beginning our research, we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it, and then we\u2019re going to have real, real fun.\u201d\n\nThis conservative host, Hannity said, once went \u201cskinny-dipping\u201d in Fiji \u201cwith a liberal poet, Ginsberg.\u201d\n\nHannity is no stranger to controversy himself. He found himself in hot water in 2009, for example, when Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show host Jon Stewart reported Hannity had manipulated video footage to show large crowds at a health care protest. Hannity apologized to his Fox News viewers for the error.\n\nAnd Savage has often found himself embroiled in conflict, both off the air and on. He had a short career as a TV host on MSNBC in 2003, but he was fired for telling a caller on air, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig.\u201d He later apologized, but his incendiary comments have long been a hallmark of his career. In 2009, for example, he was named to a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he was \u201cconsidered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence.\u201d\n\nAnd Savage has brought his battle with Hannity onto the airwaves, calling his fellow radio host one of the \u201cmost shallow men\u201d in media and a \u201cfake conservative\u201d on a show in May 2013.\n\nOne thing you won\u2019t hear Savage fight about on air, however, is President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law: His show is an \u201cObamacare free zone,\u201d he notes.\n\n\u201cBoring, boring, boring, gone,\u201d Savage said. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to it. If I can\u2019t listen to it when I\u2019m scanning the dial, I don\u2019t know how anyone else can hear any more about it. It\u2019s socialized medicine light, we know the website failed \u2014 and? What else is there to know? Tell me why I need to talk about it.\u201d\n\nHannity \u2014 however \u2014 talks at length about Obamacare. His style is to deliver monologues with a conservative take on the day\u2019s political news, and he also peppers his show with talk from a variety of guests and callers.\n\nThe San Francisco-based Savage said his show is more about the \u201cvery into the existential situation we all find ourselves in every day.\u201d Savage has also had a number of other careers throughout his life, including as an author, anthropologist and academic. He\u2019s aiming to make this afternoon drive time \u2014 likely his \u201clast act\u201d in his 20 year radio career, he said \u2014 a good ride for his listeners.\n\n\u201cTo me, everything is political anyway. If I talk about food, ultimately it becomes politics. Because what is more political than health? Nothing,\u201d Savage said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The conservative radio hosts are waging a war for the afternoon drive \u2014 and the moral high-ground.", "title": "Savage, Hannity dial up radio feud", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/michael-savage-sean-hannity-feud-102597.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/24/140124_michael_savage_sean_hannity_courtesy-ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans,Sean Hannity,Michael Savage,Radio", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The conservative radio hosts are waging a war for the afternoon drive \u2014 and the moral high-ground.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Courtesy photo, AP Photo Savage, Hannity dial up radio feudOn the airwaves and behind-the-scenes, two major conservative radio hosts are waging a war for the afternoon drive \u2014 and the moral high-ground.\nI\u2019m just going to lay it on the line, I\u2019m not going to mince words.\u201d\u201cYou could say, well, I\u2019m a snob,\u201d Savage said.\nSavage, 71, kicked off 2014 with his show \u201cThe Savage Nation\u201d moving into the prime 3-6 p.m. afternoon drive timeslot on Cumulus radio stations.\nSavage says the root of the personal conflict is Hannity, who has told unflattering tall tales about him.\n\u201cMy competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat-Republican talking points,\u201d Savage told POLITICO."}
