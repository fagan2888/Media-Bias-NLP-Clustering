Compounding this troubling news, the state\u2019s insurance regulator approved steep premium increases last week, including a 25 percent premium hike for the state\u2019s largest insurance provider.\n\nThe 11 companies will receive a total of $169,191,983, or $2,477 for each enrollee on Oregon\u2019s exchange to help them meet the costs of providing healthcare to Obamacare enrollees in 2014. This high figure is in part due to Obamacare\u2019s abysmal performance in Oregon \u2013 the state enrolled only 68,308 individuals just 29 percent of their target.\n\nThe risk adjustment program was established in order to encourage healthcare insurers to enroll high-risk individuals even if that meant posting a loss. In theory, risk insurance is supposed to be budget neutral because it redistributes funds from plans that made money to plans that did not. But in practice it is likely that there will not be enough plans making money to fund the many Obamacare plans that are posting losses.\n\nThis announcement comes days after Oregon\u2019s insurance regulator ordered two insurance companies to raise premiums higher than they requested, and approved steep premium increase requests for other insurers of over 25 percent. According to Insurance Commissioner Laura Cali, premium increases were necessary to prevent \u201ccompanies going out of business in the middle of the plan year, or being unable to pay claims.\u201d Part of the reason for rate increases is because claims incurred in 2014 exceeded premium revenue by $127 million, according to state actuaries.\n\nThis news is the latest in a saga of bad headlines for Oregon\u2019s Obamacare exchange. When Oregon began constructing its Obamacare exchange, officials hoped it would become a model for the rest of the nation. The exchange, known as \u201cCover Oregon\u201d received $305,206,587 in federal grant money including almost $60 million in \u201cearly innovator\u201d grants that would allow individuals \u201cseamless access to information, financial assistance and easy health insurance enrollment.\u201d\n\nDespite receiving these millions in funding, Oregon\u2019s exchange failed to enroll a single individual weeks after the website was supposed to launch. After months of turmoil, Cover Oregon announced it would shift its exchange to the federal system, costing taxpayers $41 million more. Reports by Maximus, the state\u2019s quality assurance contractor identified numerous problems that plagued the construction of Cover Oregon in the months and years before launch. However, little corrective action was taken. Since then, investigations have been launched by watchdog groups and Congressional committees over accusations that decision-making was driven by the Governor Kitzhaber's reelection campaign.\n\nWith millions in federal subsidies and higher premiums required for Obamacare to remain sustainable in Oregon, this mammoth law is clearly not working.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "11 Insurance companies that provide healthcare to individuals on Oregon\u2019s Obamacare exchange will receive over $169 million in \u201crisk adjustment\u201d payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services according to a report from the Portland Business Journal.", "title": "Oregon\u2019s Obamacare Insurers Receive $2,477 in Government Subsidies per Enrollee", "url": "https://www.atr.org/oregon-s-obamacare-insurers-receive-2477-government-subsidies-enrollee", "image": "https://www.atr.org/sites/default/files/16687016354_ca450d18ec_z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 21200647, "pages": 8127889355}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb043\"", "article_summary": "This news is the latest in a saga of bad headlines for Oregon\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\nThe 11 companies will receive a total of $169,191,983, or $2,477 for each enrollee on Oregon\u2019s exchange to help them meet the costs of providing healthcare to Obamacare enrollees in 2014.\nBut in practice it is likely that there will not be enough plans making money to fund the many Obamacare plans that are posting losses.\nWhen Oregon began constructing its Obamacare exchange, officials hoped it would become a model for the rest of the nation.\nThis announcement comes days after Oregon\u2019s insurance regulator ordered two insurance companies to raise premiums higher than they requested, and approved steep premium increase requests for other insurers of over 25 percent."}
