Gallup: New low for Obamacare

Support for Obamacare continues to decline, with the law hitting a new low in approval, and a new high in disapproval, as the second enrollment period has opened for Americans, according to Gallup.

Just 37 percent approve of the Affordable Care Act, 1 percentage point less than the previous low recorded in January, Gallup found in a new survey released Monday.

The second enrollment season kicked off on Saturday, with minor snags; however, enthusiasm for the law remains underwhelming. A majority of Americans disapprove of Obamacare, at 56 percent — a new high, Gallup said.

“The law’s new low in approval — and new high in disapproval (56%) — could potentially have an impact on its future,” the pollster notes, but adds that repeal is still unlikely.

The Gallup poll was conducted Nov.6-9 and surveyed 828 adults. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
