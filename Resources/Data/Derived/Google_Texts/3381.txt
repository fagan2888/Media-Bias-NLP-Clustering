President Obama dropped in on a group of college journalists at the White House Thursday, and urged them to pursue a career of holding leaders accountable — leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who’s blocking his Supreme Court nominee.

“You may have heard there’s a Supreme Court vacancy,” Mr. Obama told the students, promoting nominee Merrick Garland. “So far at least, the Republican leader on the Senate side, Mitch McConnell, has refused … to schedule an actual vote.”

The president said he wants the budding journalists to understand that democracy only works when “there is still a willingness to follow the rules and treat people fairly. That’s something that’s been lost a little bit in this town of late.”

Asked what he was most proud of during his two terms, Mr. Obama said “I’m proud of a lot of stuff.” He mentioned Obamacare, the economic recovery, and reducing student debt. But he said he was most proud that, with first lady Michelle Obama, “I’ve raised two daughters who are amazing.”
