Conservatives who have gone gaga over GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump are guilty of the same actions of the liberals they like to lambaste for blindly following and voting for celebrity-types, writes Jonah Goldberg at National Review.

Goldberg admits there are plenty of "decent and honorable" people who celebrate Trump, but adds that just because Trump goes over the heads of the media to reach real people, that "is not an argument for Trump as a serious presidential candidate.""We routinely forgive the rich and famous for sins we would condemn our neighbors for," Goldberg says. "Trump’s popularity apparently trumps all standards we would apply not just to our neighbors, but to our leaders."One of Trump's presidential rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, refuses to condemn Trump based on Reagan's Eleventh Commandment not to speak ill of a fellow Republican, Goldberg notes. Yet Cruz has never before had a problem calling out other Republicans as part of his tea party appeal.Cruz happily criticizes Republicans when it will help him, but steers clear of Trump in hopes of getting his voters if he drops out of the race, Goldberg says."Similarly, I'm constantly hearing from Trump fans that it's 'disrespectful' for me to criticize the Republican front-runner — as if these fans would refrain from criticizing Jeb or Rubio or Kasich if they were in the lead," Goldberg says.
