Always a high-energy extrovert, she would begin her workdays as a clinical psychologist treating severely ill patients at 7:15 a.m., and get home in time to be with her three young children after school.\n\nThere was no time for slacking in a life so full, so when she was scheduled for a minor diagnostic procedure that involved inserting a tube down her throat to look into her stomach, she figured she\u2019d recover from the sedation and come right back to work that afternoon.\n\nBut afterward, she felt so sick she went to bed and slept for three days. \u201cI felt like I was poisoned,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt felt like the worst flu ever. I had a low grade fever, my body hurt, everything hurt. After a few days, I improved, but I never felt well. And then it became an episodic illness \u2014 a few days later I\u2019d get it again, and a few weeks later I\u2019d get it again.\u201d\n\nMoritz, now 48, has never been the same. For the last five years, she has seen dozens of doctors, trekked to leading medical centers around the country in search of a diagnosis and cure, to no avail. Her fevers come and go, and other symptoms; sometimes it\u2019s hard to swallow, even walk.\n\nIf this were the television show \u201cHouse,\u201d or the popular New York Times column \u201cThink Like A Doctor,\u201d her story would have a neat ending, a solution to her mystery. But as Moritz has learned in her exhaustive travels, in real life, a great many people \u2014 millions of them, she estimates \u2014 are clearly very sick but never get the answer that could help them get well. Call them \u201cthe undiagnosed.\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s working on a documentary on their plight (see the trailer above) and \u2014 in a lucky convergence \u2014 she\u2019s combining forces with the bright minds at the cutting edge of genomic research to seek answers.\n\nFive undiagnosed patients from the documentary are the focus of a new contest run by Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, titled \u201cCLARITY Undiagnosed.\u201d Aiming to advance the field of genomic medicine \u2014 using a patient\u2019s gene information in the clinic \u2014 it offers a $25,000 prize to the research team that best solves the patients\u2019 diagnostic mysteries.\n\nIn an unusual twist for such an exercise in competitive crowd-sourcing, the teams may also appear in the documentary that Moritz is creating. Titled simply \u201cUndiagnosed,\u201d It is still filming and thus far chronicles the patients\u2019 struggles but has no happy endings. (The medical detectives can also opt out if they\u2019re camera-shy.)\n\n\u201cThe probability that we\u2019re going to find something in any of these individuals is about 50 percent.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Isaac Kohane\n\nUp to 30 competing teams in the CLARITY contest will be given each patient\u2019s full medical record \u2014 no small file, given the medical odysseys they have endured. The contestants will also be given extensive data on the patients\u2019 genes.\n\nTeams have until June 25 to apply, says Dr. Isaac Kohane, chair of Harvard Medical School\u2019s Department of Biomedical Informatics, and they will then have two months to work. Results will be announced in November.\n\n\u201cI would say that, based on the performance from the Undiagnosed Disease Program at the National Institutes of Health, the probability that we\u2019re going to find something in any of these individuals is about 50 percent,\u201d Kohane says.\n\nThe contest aims to advance \u201cthe diagnostic art,\u201d he says, in the big-data era of the human genome.\n\n\u201cWe bandy about numbers these days \u2014 gigabytes come so easily to our lips,\u201d he says. \u201cBut evolutionarily speaking, the old brain in our cranium really has no idea what 3 billion looks like. So when we start having literally hundreds of mutations \u2014 each genome is larded with thousands of mutations that are personal to only you \u2014 you have to appeal to a lot of ancillary data and knowledge to come to a conclusion. Because otherwise, an overly trigger-happy interpretation of our genomes is going to bring us back to incidental findings \u2014 and we\u2019ll start removing body parts incautiously.\u201d\n\nThe contest is also looking for strong performance in communicating potentially tricky results to non-expert doctors and patients.\n\nThis is the second such contest that the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital team has run. The first, back in 2012, solicited diagnoses for three families with children who had serious illnesses, and yielded diagnoses for two out of the three. (See the Children\u2019s video below.)\n\nOne noteworthy element of that contest, Kohane says: Some of the winning teams came from hospitals where the children had previously been seen but not diagnosed.\n\n\u201cThat tells me that the usual clinical visit is just not the same thing as a team of people looking at this family as a competitive puzzle,\u201d he says.\n\nKohane and Moritz had been traveling along two very different paths. She had been criss-crossing the country seeking a diagnosis and interviews with experts on the problems of undiagnosed patients and how the current medical system fails them. He represented what that system is doing to try to improve: He is the coordinator of a $9 million NIH project called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, which aims to use genomics to diagnose rare and new diseases.\n\nWhen Moritz contacted Kohane last year, he offered to try to help the patients in the film, but he tried to manage her expectations, he says, warning her that the contest may not bring the results she wants.\n\nMoritz said she understood, he recalls \u2014 but that it was tremendously meaningful that he was even willing to try. Even for patients convinced they would surely die before medical science would ever find the answers they needed.\n\nReaders, please stay tuned. There will be no media access to the families involved during the contest, but we will cover the results in November.
