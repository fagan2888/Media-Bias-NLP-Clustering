Spirit Aerosystems was looking to fill around 500 jobs at their plant in Wichita during a job fair on Saturday.

Jarrod Bartlett of Spirit Aerosystems says that of the 500 jobs, 350 are for assembly mechanics - the people who build the airplane components - and another 150 jobs for support personnel.

"If you have aviation experience, that is awesome. If not, we are able to train you to work on the products that we deliver to our customers everyday," Bartlett said.

Thousands waited in long lines to get a chance for one of the available jobs.

Spirit staff suggest anyone that was not able to make it to the job fair or did not make it to the interview portion because of the long line to visit the Spirit website and search for jobs. Click hereto be redirected.

Spirit manufactures parts for Boeing and Airbus.

Bartlett says that the large airplane market is expected to remain steady for the next 20 years.
