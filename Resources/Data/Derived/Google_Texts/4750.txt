Democrat Kay Hagan, as a U.S. senator from North Carolina for one term, consistently advanced corporate welfare policies . She even campaigned on her support for the Export-Import Bank, bizarrely accusing her opponent Thom Tillis of catering to the "special interests" by opposing Ex-Im.

Today, Hagan officially cashes out. The millionaire one-term lawmaker will join K Street lobbying and law firm Akin Gump, Megan Wilson at The Hill reports . She is prohibited by law from lobbying the Senate for one more year, but if history is a guide, she will register as a lobbyist in 2016 if not earlier.

Akin Gump represents many corporate clients, including manufacturer Honeywell, for whom Akin Gump advocated reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank â€” Hagan of course sided with Honeywell on that one. Hagan used Siemens (another Akin Gump client) as a stump on which to campaign for reelection and tout export subsidies for her home state . Ex-Im giant Boeing is an Akin Gump client.

Hagan of course voted for Obamacare, and Obamacare beneficiary, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, is an Akin Gump client. Other Akin Gump clients include Dow, AT&T, KKR, Chevron and the Corrections Corporation of America.
