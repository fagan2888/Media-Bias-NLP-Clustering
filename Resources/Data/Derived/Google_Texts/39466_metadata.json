The caller reported seeing two black men shooting into the house, then fleeing in a white vehicle occupied by two other black men.\n\nAccording to police, one man fired into the home\u2019s east side with a .38 caliber revolver, while another man fired into the west side of the building with a .380 caliber handgun.\n\nOfficers at the scene learned the home\u2019s occupant, a 50-year-old man, had been sleeping in his bed with his girlfriend when he was struck in both feet by one of the shots. The victim was treated at the scene and taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThere were three adults and six children in the house at the time, according to police.\n\nA police officer saw a vehicle matching the description of the suspect car on North Florida Avenue. The officer followed the car until backup arrived, then he executed a traffic stop. The left rear passenger of the vehicle, Mario Fernando Garrett Jr., 18, fled on foot after the vehicle was stopped, but was caught after a short chase, police said. Officers found a .380 handgun close to the capture point, police said.\n\nThe witness who reported the shooting was brought to the vehicle, and although he could not identify the vehicle\u2019s occupants as the shooters, he did identify the vehicle, so it was impounded as evidence, police said.\n\nInside the vehicle, police said they found a .38 caliber handgun.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle was identified as Shawndell Artist, 34, and the front seat passenger and vehicle\u2019s owner was identified as Joseph Kelly, 34, police said. The right rear passenger was identified as Antonio Pouncey, 21.\n\nDuring interviews, police said they learned Garrett and Pouncey had asked to be taken by the victim\u2019s home. After stopping across the street from the residence, Garrett and Pouncey exited the vehicle, and Pouncey asked Artist to \u201chold on\u201d while they walked to the residence. Shortly thereafter, Artist said he heard shots being fired and saw Garrett and Pouncey running back to the vehicle holding handguns.\n\nBoth subjects got into the back seat of the vehicle and told Artist to drive out of the area. While driving, Artist said he told Garrett and Pouncey that they needed to get out of the vehicle but they refused. Shortly thereafter, the vehicle was stopped by police.\n\nDetectives said the shooting appeared to be the result of a disagreement between the victim and Pouncey and not gang-related.\n\nGarrett was charged with Shooting into an occupied dwelling, resisting arrest without violence, and violation of probation, F3.\n\nPouncey was charted with Shooting into an occupied dwelling, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, F2.\n\nThey were taken to the Polk County Jail.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 19 Jul 2014 21:12:10 -0400", "Description": "Two Lakeland men were arrested after shots were fired into a home this morning, Lakeland police said.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Two Lakeland men were arrested after shots were fired into a home this morning, Lakeland police said.", "title": "Two arrested after Lakeland house shooting", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/two-arrested-after-lakeland-house-shooting-20140719/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140719/ARTICLE/140719233/EP/1/1/EP-140719233.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2014-07-19T21:12:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Two Lakeland men were arrested after shots were fired into a home this morning, Lakeland police said.", "title": "Two arrested after Lakeland house shooting", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140719/ARTICLE/140719233/AR/0/AR-140719233.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-19T21:12:10Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T21:12:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaee3\"", "article_summary": "Police received a report about 7:34 a.m. about shots fired into a house in the 1300 block of Golconda Road.\nThe caller reported seeing two black men shooting into the house, then fleeing in a white vehicle occupied by two other black men.\nTwo Lakeland men were arrested after shots were fired into a home this morning, Lakeland police said.\nGarrett was charged with Shooting into an occupied dwelling, resisting arrest without violence, and violation of probation, F3.\nPouncey was charted with Shooting into an occupied dwelling, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, F2."}
