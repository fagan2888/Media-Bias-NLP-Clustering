Delivering a monologue on Republicans with all the hyperbole of an MSNBC anchor and none of the charm, Cuomo offered this:\n\nYou have a schism within the Republican Party. \u2026 They\u2019re searching to define their soul, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Is the Republican party in this state a moderate party or is it an extreme conservative party? That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to figure out. It\u2019s a mirror of what\u2019s going on in Washington. The gridlock in Washington is less about Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s more about extreme Republicans versus moderate Republicans. \u2026 You\u2019re seeing that play out in New York. \u2026 The Republican Party candidates are running against the SAFE Act \u2014 it was voted for by moderate Republicans who run the Senate! Their problem is not me and the Democrats; their problem is themselves. Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that\u2019s who they are and they\u2019re the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that\u2019s not who New Yorkers are. If they\u2019re moderate Republicans like in the Senate right now, who control the Senate \u2014 moderate Republicans have a place in their state. George Pataki was governor of this state as a moderate Republican; but not what you\u2019re hearing from them on the far right.\u201d\n\nHe at least uses the liberal pejoratives for those who are pro-2nd Amendment and oppose gay marriage. \u201cRight to life\u201d he uses as if it\u2019s offensive on its face. As Life News notes, he leans heavily on the President Barack tactic to simply declare everyone who disagrees with your positions in the slightest \u201cextreme,\u201d even if many of those people are your constituents. But how extreme is the pro-life position, even in a blue state like New York? Unlike, say, gay marriage, the polling on abortion restrictions, particularly second and third trimesters, regularly and overwhelmingly favors the more conservative position.\n\nCuomo spent much of 2013 trying to pass a Reproductive Health Act that moved the opposite direction of abortion legislation in states like Texas and North Carolina. He took from the Dr. Gosnell\u2019s House of Horrors story that, hey, who shouldn\u2019t be able to perform abortions, huh? The legislation, which was stuck into a broader Women\u2019s Equality Act, stalled in the Senate because of its abortion provisions and under strong fire from the state\u2019s bishops, who apparently are also no longer welcome in New York.\n\nOne 2013 poll, commissioned by the Chiaroscuro Foundation found, just as in the rest of the country, though many consider themselves pro-choice, they are very open to restrictions to abortion in the second and third trimesters and think abortions are already accessible enough in their state. A few of the questions lean on the prejudicial, but the bent of the electorate is clear:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Let\u2019s hear it for New York.", "title": "Cuomo: Pro-life people have \u201cno place in the state of New York\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/17/cuomo-pro-life-people-have-no-place-in-the-state-of-new-york/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T00:31:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-18T13:00:21+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda854\"", "article_summary": "If they\u2019re moderate Republicans like in the Senate right now, who control the Senate \u2014 moderate Republicans have a place in their state.\nIs the Republican party in this state a moderate party or is it an extreme conservative party?\nIt\u2019s more about extreme Republicans versus moderate Republicans.\n\u2026 The Republican Party candidates are running against the SAFE Act \u2014 it was voted for by moderate Republicans who run the Senate!\nDelivering a monologue on Republicans with all the hyperbole of an MSNBC anchor and none of the charm, Cuomo offered this:You have a schism within the Republican Party."}
