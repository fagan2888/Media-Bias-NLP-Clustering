This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort takes place Thursday.</p>\n\nBy Anne Kallas\n\nAlthough the 2015 World\u2019s Largest Swimming Lesson scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday is supposed to be fun, it also has a vital purpose: to save lives from accidental drowning.\n\nEach year a coalition of the nation\u2019s leading water safety and training organizations tries to top the previous year\u2019s attendance at a one-day lesson while teaching basic water safety skills.\n\nIn Ventura County, all of the YMCA facility pools will be holding the lesson, as will the Daland Swim School in Thousand Oaks.\n\n\u201cDrowning is the leading cause of accidental death in children ages 1 to 14,\u201d said Leslie Daland-James. \u201cIt happens quickly and silently. The best thing to do to minimize risk is to fence your pool and give children swimming lessons. Also, we are living by the ocean, and teaching kids to be stronger swimmers makes them safer by the beach as well.\u201d\n\nFor the past five years, the World\u2019s Largest Swimming Lesson has set a Guinness World Record for attendance at one lesson. In 2014, 36,564 swimmers from 22 countries participated in learning such basic skills as \u201cthrow, don\u2019t go,\u201d said Cassie Hughes, aquatics coordinator at the Camarillo YMCA.\n\n\u201cWe teach kids to attempt a rescue with noodles and rings instead of going in after the victim and creating a double drowning,\u201d Hughes said, noting that it\u2019s just one part of the very specific curricula required to participate in The World\u2019s Largest Swimming Lesson. \u201cWe also cover sun safety, use of sun screen, pool rules, being safe in and around an aquatic environment and how to get help in an aquatic emergency.\u201d\n\nHughes said she hopes to have 80 people sign up for the event, and she has eight instructors ready to give the lesson Thursday. The World\u2019s Largest Swimming Lesson is open to people of all ages, and YMCA membership is not required to participate.\n\nAt the Ventura YMCA, Cheri Hays, associate aquatics director, explained that all of the Channel Islands YMCAs, which include facilities in Santa Barbara County as well as Ventura County, are participating.\n\n\u201cWe have been really marketing all over. Last year we had 60 participants and we\u2019re hoping for more this year,\u201d Hays said. \u201cIt will be that one event where everyone can participate. It really gets awareness out for water safety.\u201d\n\nDaland-James said one of the first things instructors try to teach young children is how to survive an accidental fall into a pool.\n\n\u201cWe give the children the skill that if they fall in pool, they can take a breath and get out,\u201d she said, adding that there is usually some apprehension to overcome. \u201cIt takes time. We build rapport. We are teaching them to learn about their own buoyancy, while helping them become more comfortable in the water. We want them to think of water as a happy place.\u201d\n\nThe event starts at 9:30 a.m. so people can sign in and learn the rules of the lesson, which will be offered promptly at 10 a.m. in each time zone across the United States.\n\nOrganizers at all venues ask people to sign up ahead of time.\n\nTo participate in Thousand Oaks at the Daland Swim Center, call 495-5210 or visit the website http://www.dalandswim.com/\n\nTo participate in Camarillo at the YMCA, call 484-0423 or visit http://www.ciymca.org/camarillo/\n\nTo participate in Ventura at the YMCA, call 642-2131 or visit http://www.ciymca.org/ventura/", "article_metadata": {"title": "Ventura County swim instructors try to help set world record", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/ventura-county-swim-instructors-try-to-help-set-world-record-ep-1138579591-341748911.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/swimrecord_19892998_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 395}, "type": "article", "description": "Guinness World Record attempt results in Ventura County kids knowing water safety.", "title": "Ventura County swim instructors try to help set world record"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/swimrecord_19892998_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Guinness World Record attempt results in Ventura County kids knowing water safety.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ventura County swim instructors try to help set world record"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At the Ventura YMCA, Cheri Hays, associate aquatics director, explained that all of the Channel Islands YMCAs, which include facilities in Santa Barbara County as well as Ventura County, are participating.\nThe best thing to do to minimize risk is to fence your pool and give children swimming lessons.\nThe World\u2019s Largest Swimming Lesson is open to people of all ages, and YMCA membership is not required to participate.\n<p>STAR FILE PHOTO Participants in last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to set a Guinness World Record for simultaneous swimming lessons around the world celebrate after the lesson ends at the Ventura Family YMCA.\nIn Ventura County, all of the YMCA facility pools will be holding the lesson, as will the Daland Swim School in Thousand Oaks."}
