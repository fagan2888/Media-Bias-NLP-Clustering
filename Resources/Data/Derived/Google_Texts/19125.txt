Heck back in familiar territory fending off attacks that he’s ‘no advocate for women’

Here’s a new take on an old tale: Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nev., is anti-woman.

Erin Bilbray, a Democratic candidate running against Heck in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, recently alleged in an email that Heck is “no advocate for women’s equality, choice, or health.”

Characterizing Heck’s record as “very anti-choice, very anti-woman” during an interview with the Sun, she offered as evidence several votes Heck has taken during his three years in Congress and while he was serving in the state Senate.

She concluded her email pitch with a question: “Will you please help me beat Rep. Heck and protect women's rights by contributing $5 right now?”

Bilbray, who announced her candidacy this summer, consults for Emerge Nevada, a nonprofit group she founded that helps women get elected to political office. She said she planned to make women’s issues a “huge” part of her campaign.

Meanwhile, staffers with Heck’s re-election campaign who read Bilbray’s email got a sense of deja vu. They’d seen some of these claims before from Democratic candidate John Oceguera, who failed to defeat Heck during last year’s election, and from Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., who failed to unseat Heck in 2010 before winning election last year in Nevada’s 1st Congressional District.

“They were fact-checked,” said Mark Ciavola, Heck’s campaign manager. “They were debunked.”

What are the claims, and how truthful are they?
