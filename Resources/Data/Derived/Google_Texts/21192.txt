RTD will offer free New Year’s Eve rides on all regularly-scheduled bus and train service as well as Access-a-Ride and SkyRide services from 7 p.m. Thursday through 12 a.m. Jan. 2.

The Regional Transportation District will operate on a weekday schedule on New Year’s Eve and a Sunday/holiday schedule on New Year’s Day. Riders should check both the late night weekday schedule and the early morning Sunday/holiday schedule for trips after midnight on New Year’s Eve. Service hours will not be extended. Due to expected high passenger volumes, riders should plan accordingly.

RTD has offered this free fare service to discourage drinking and driving on New Year’s Eve for the past 25 years.

For the seventh year in a row, RTD is partnering with Coors Light, Coors Distributing Company, Colorado State Patrol and the Colorado Department of Transportation to promote a safe holiday season.

New RTD fares go into effect on Jan. 1. For fare and schedule information, visit www.rtd-denver.com/2016fares or call RTD Customer Care at 303-299-6000 or TDD 303-299-6089 from 6 a.m. – 6 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.
