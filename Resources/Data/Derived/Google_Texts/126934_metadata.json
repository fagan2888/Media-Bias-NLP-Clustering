Their draft work has been spotty. They\u2019re not much on re-signing their own.\n\nYet, the Broncos have won four consecutive AFC West titles in the four years of Elway\u2019s regime. Why? He spends. Much like when the late George Steinbrenner was emperor of the Yanks.\n\nRELATED: Potential Broncos targets in free agency\n\nNew York doesn\u2019t do farm systems. Let the small-market teams develop prospects. The Yanks win now. NOW! Or else.\n\nIn another life, Elway once worked for Steinbrenner. It was a brief dalliance that might have planted long-lasting philosophies into Elway on how to best build a franchise.\n\nSights in the NFL this week are on free agency, where no team has been more aggressive in recent years than the Broncos.\n\nPeyton Manning, Louis Vasquez, Wes Welker, DeMarcus Ware, Emmanuel Sanders, Aqib Talib, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, T.J. Ward, Manny Ramirez and Terrance \u201cPot Roast\u201d Knighton are among the 27 full- or part-time starters Elway has signed from the past four free-agent periods.\n\n\u201cThat all comes down to where our budget is, and I think that the bottom line is our philosophy to build in the draft and then add with free agency,\u201d Elway said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been fortunate in the fact that we\u2019ve been able to in the free-agency market get some very good, high-profile players. \u2026 But we\u2019re always, no matter what it is, we\u2019re always going to try to get better as a football team and stay within what the budget tells us to stay in, but try to find the right guys for the Denver Broncos.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 free-agent market opens March 10, but a soft opening begins Saturday when teams are allowed to discuss interest and contracts with agents of free-agent players. No contract can be finalized, though, until the market opens at 2 p.m. March 10.\n\nAfter the Broncos designate a $12.8 million franchise tag to their own free-agent receiver Demaryius Thomas on Monday, the team will have approximately $13 million of payroll cap room.\n\nThere is hope a restructured contract with Manning will provide a little more spending money. Still, it will be difficult this year for the Broncos to duplicate the buzz they created through free agency in the three previous seasons.\n\nWhen Elway first got the job as head of Denver\u2019s football operations, the league was coming out of a lockout and he had little choice but to begin modestly with an abbreviated free-agent period. Still, he signed running back Willis McGahee and three other starters, including Ramirez, who is still a Bronco.\n\nElway needed only one year of experience to successfully recruit arguably the greatest free-agent prize of all time: Manning. There were six other starters from that 2012 free-agent class signed. Wes Welker created the greatest splash from the league\u2019s 2013 market, although Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Louis Vasquez and Knighton weren\u2019t bad, either.\n\nManning might have single-handedly made 2012 the Broncos\u2019 best free-agent class, but the 2014 group was deeper with Ware, Talib, Ward and Sanders all earning Pro Bowl berths in their first season with the team.\n\nAmong the free agents the Broncos might pursue next week are Kansas City center Rodney Hudson, Miami tight end Charles Clay and Baltimore defensive end Pernell McPhee.\n\nFar more recognizable names, at least in Denver households, are expected to leave Dove Valley. Broncos tight end Julius Thomas, safety Rahim Moore, left guard Orlando Franklin and Knighton are all expected to command huge contracts and sign elsewhere as free agents.\n\nThe Broncos can\u2019t meet those players\u2019 asking prices while also seeking to redistribute the balance of their roster. A few players favored by coaches John Fox, Jack Del Rio and Adam Gase might not fit quite as well for Gary Kubiak, Wade Phillips and Rick Dennison.\n\nSpecifically, a new type of blocker is needed on offense. The Broncos have four needs up front: left guard, center, right tackle and tight end.\n\nThe draft might fill one need. Incumbents might fill another. Free agency will fill two, maybe three.\n\nWhile right tackle might be the Broncos\u2019 No. 1 need, their 2015 starter might come from their No. 28 draft pick. Or that No. 1 pick might be a tight end if the Broncos can\u2019t nab Clay, Owen Daniels or Jordan Cameron from free agency to replace Julius Thomas.\n\nWhere the Broncos are almost certain to sign a quality free agent is at center. Hudson is considered the best. Oakland\u2019s Stefan Wisniewski is young and experienced with the zone-blocking system.\n\nOn defense, the Broncos will seek at least two new linemen \u2014 one through free agency, the other through the draft.\n\nAt safety, the Broncos would love to bring back Moore. But in a safety market where demand is greater than supply, Moore should wind up with a big-money deal.\n\nAnd the Broncos already have one of the league\u2019s highest-paid secondaries after they secured Talib, Ward and Chris Harris for top dollars.\n\nIt appears the Broncos will have to be financially creative to keep their Boss\u2019 streak of free-agent star signings going.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos, John Elway remain aggressive in free agency", "title": "Denver Broncos, John Elway remain aggressive in free agency", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/denver-broncos-john-elway-remain-aggressive-in-free-agency/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150113__john-elwayp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150113__john-elwayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T19:28:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T22:24:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sights in the NFL this week are on free agency, where no team has been more aggressive in recent years than the Broncos.\nOn defense, the Broncos will seek at least two new linemen \u2014 one through free agency, the other through the draft.\n1 pick might be a tight end if the Broncos can\u2019t nab Clay, Owen Daniels or Jordan Cameron from free agency to replace Julius Thomas.\nStill, it will be difficult this year for the Broncos to duplicate the buzz they created through free agency in the three previous seasons.\nFree agency will fill two, maybe three."}
