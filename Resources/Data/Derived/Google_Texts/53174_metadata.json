The two now have the chance to break away from their rivals for good and begin focusing their attention on what is sure to be a bruising general election.\n\nOn the GOP side, Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) is perilously close to being mathematically eliminated, while Ohio Governor John Kasich has thus far only managed to win his home state \u2013 neither seems ready to change the dynamics of the race enough to prevent Trump from collecting the 1,237 delegates he needs to become the Republican standard-bearer.\n\nRelated: Hey, GOP: Maybe It\u2019s Time to Really Rig This Election\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (VT), coming off a stinging, double-digit loss in New York, will have to make some serious moves if he\u2019s going to add any more states to his win column any time soon.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the polls ahead of next week\u2019s contests:\n\nPennsylvania \u2013 210 Dem delegates, 71 GOP delegates\n\nDemocrats: Clinton: 51.3 percent \u2013 Sanders: 38.3 percent\n\nGOP: Trump: 44.8 percent \u2013 Cruz: 24.3 percent \u2013 Kasich: 23.5 percent\n\nMaryland \u2013 118 Dem delegates, 38 GOP delegates\n\nDemocrats: Clinton: 57 percent \u2013 Sanders: 36.3 percent\n\nGOP: Trump: 41 percent \u2013 Kasich 26.3 percent \u2013 Cruz: 24. 5 percent\n\nConnecticut -- 70 Dem delegates, 28 GOP delegates\n\nDemocrats: Clinton: 50 percent \u2013 Sanders: 42.5 percent\n\nGOP: Trump: 49 percent \u2013 Kasich: 27 percent \u2013 Cruz: 18 percent\n\nDelaware \u2013 31 Dem delegates, 16 GOP delegates\n\nPolling not available\n\nRhode Island \u2013 33 Dem delegates, 19, GOP delegates\n\nDemocrats: Clinton: 49 percent \u2013 Sanders 40 percent\n\nGOP: Trump: 43 percent \u2013 Kasich: 14 percent \u2013 Cruz: 10 percent\n\nConsidering that almost all of the remaining White House hopefuls announced their bids over a year ago, it would be nice to think that next Tuesday will be the last Super Tuesday of the 2016 campaign. But with Sanders promising to stay in the race until the Democratic National Convention this summer \u2013 and Cruz and Kasich hoping for a contested Republican convention \u2013 there will be at least one more when voters in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and North and South Dakota go to the polls on June 7.\n\nHow much drama lies in store for that date very much depends on how much campaigning Cruz, Kasich and Sanders do in the next week and if they\u2019re able to close the sizeable polling gaps facing them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Less than a week before the penultimate Super Tuesday of the 2016 presidential primary season, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are comfortably seated in the driver\u2019s seat.", "title": "Another Super Tuesday?
