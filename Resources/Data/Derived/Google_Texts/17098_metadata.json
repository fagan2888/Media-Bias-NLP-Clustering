Steiner, a warehouse manager for a publisher of Bible-themed literature, and his wife, Brenda, a part-time nurse, made just $30,000 a year. No way could they afford the drug on their own.\n\n\"We still had six kids at home \u2014 how were we going to come up with that kind of money?\" Steiner said. \"We couldn't re-mortgage the house because it had already been re-mortgaged. I wouldn't have been able to take the medication. We would have had to just trust in the Lord.\"\n\nIt was a scary brush with \"financial toxicity,\" as researchers call the mix of economic stress, anxiety and depression that cancer patients often endure. But then Steiner was assigned to Dan Sherman, an oncology social worker at Mercy Health Lacks Cancer Center who within days got a free supply of Gleevec from the manufacturer. He also made sure it was delivered promptly. The package arrived at Steiner's home on Christmas Eve, his 46th birthday.\n\nIn the eight years since, Steiner has faced a series of medical and financial reversals, and each time Sherman has done as much as any doctor to keep Steiner going \u2014 scrambling to get the treatment he needed without sending his family into bankruptcy. \"He keeps throwing me life rafts before I sink,\" Steiner said.\n\nWith cancer costs only continuing to rise, Sherman and other \"financial navigators\" across the country have moved to the front lines of efforts to help people survive financially as well as medically. They take a highly individualized approach, working closely with patients and oncologists from the time of diagnosis and continuing through the twists and turns of a protracted illness.\n\nTheir strategy is to pull every lever available to extract maximum assistance from pharmaceutical companies, the government, foundations and the hospitals themselves, and to make sure patients know the best insurance options for their particular illness. Such aggressiveness is needed, experts say, because millions of Americans are struggling with high out-of-pocket expenses. The complexity of the health care system only makes things worse, they add.\n\n\"We are experienced in dealing with the side effects of treatment,\" Sherman said, \"but we have not recognized that we are causing financial harm to patients.\"\n\nAlthough many in the health care industry say such collateral damage must be addressed - that hospitals need to become much more sophisticated, that doctors need to shed their reticence in discussing costs with patients \u2014 they acknowledge it's not happening quickly.\n\n\"This isn't something that health systems typically like to deal with,\" said Scott Ramsey, director of the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \"But someone needs to step in, assess patients' financial risks and do something to manage their finances.\"\n\nCost of cancer Laura McDermott / For The Washington Post A radiation therapist monitors a treatment session for Scott Steiner last month.

Insurers say excessive hospital charges, doctor fees and drug prices are the culprits and that drug assistance programs actually encourage greater medication use.\n\nAnd hospitals complain that the pharmaceutical companies are inflating prices and that insurers are failing to adequately cover needed treatments.\n\nSherman ignores the finger-pointing. Over the past several years, he has worked with about 25 hospitals across the country to set up financial-navigation services. \"I can't do anything about prices or most of what happens in the health-care system,\" he said. \"But I can help the cancer patient sitting in front of me.\"\n\n---\n\nCancer has always been an expensive disease. In 2013, S. Yousuf Zafar at the Duke University School of Medicine coined the term \"financial toxicity\" to describe the impact of better but costlier drugs, longer treatment regimens and the shifting of ever-greater costs to patients.\n\nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, millions more people are insured, including some who previously couldn't buy coverage at any price. Even so, researchers say, many Americans are underinsured, with out-of-pocket expenses outstripping their ability to pay. They include deductibles (paid by the patient before insurance kicks in), copays (set dollar amounts for a prescription or service) and co-insurance (a percentage of the cost of a drug or service).\n\nMost ACA and employer insurance plans have out-of-pocket maximums \u2014 $6,850 for individuals and $13,700 for family coverage for this year \u2014 yet the costs can still be oppressive. Patients may have to pay more for out-of-network services. And with some cancer drugs weighing in at $10,000 a month, copays for patients can reach hundreds and even thousands of dollars a month.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Tackling the financial toll of cancer, one patient at a time", "date": "2016-04-11", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Even before Scott Steiner started treatment for a rare gastrointestinal cancer that had spread throughout his abdomen, a dangerous side effect threatened his health.", "title": "Tackling the financial toll of cancer, one patient at a time", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-financial-toll-of-cancer-20160411-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-570b9ba0/turbine/ct-financial-toll-of-cancer-20160411", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86512523", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "oncology treatment, cancer care, financial burden of health care, hospital social workers", "news_keywords": "oncology treatment, cancer care, financial burden of health care, hospital social workers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "With cancer costs continuing to rise, \"financial navigators\" have moved to the front lines of efforts to help people survive financially - and medically."}, "article_summary": "It was a scary brush with \"financial toxicity,\" as researchers call the mix of economic stress, anxiety and depression that cancer patients often endure.\n\"But someone needs to step in, assess patients' financial risks and do something to manage their finances.\"\nHis doctor had prescribed the cancer drug Gleevec, but Steiner's insurance refused to cover its $3,500 monthly cost.\nIn Milwaukee, social workers at Aurora Health Care's cancer center have added financial counseling to the psychological support they've long provided to patients.\nWith cancer costs only continuing to rise, Sherman and other \"financial navigators\" across the country have moved to the front lines of efforts to help people survive financially as well as medically."}
