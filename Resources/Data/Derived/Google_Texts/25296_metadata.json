However, a European Union task force last week confirmed that the ruthless cabal he empowered by bombing Serbia in 1999 has committed atrocities that include murdering individuals to extract and sell their kidneys, livers and other body parts.\n\nClint Williamson, the chief prosecutor of a special European Union task force, declared that senior members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) had engaged in \u201cunlawful killings, abductions, enforced disappearances, illegal detentions in camps in Kosovo and Albania, sexual violence, forced displacements of individuals from their homes and communities, and desecration and destruction of churches and other religious sites.\u201d\n\nA special war-crimes tribunal is planned for next year. The New York Times reported that the trials may be stymied by cover-ups and stonewalling: \u201cPast investigations of reports of organ trafficking in Kosovo have been undermined by witnesses\u2019 fears of testifying in a small country where clan ties run deep and former members of the KLA are still feted as heroes. Former leaders of the KLA occupy high posts in the government.\u201d American politicians have almost entirely ignored the growing scandal. Vice President Joe Biden hailed former KLA leader and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci in 2010 as \u201cthe George Washington of Kosovo.\u201d A few months later, a Council of Europe investigative report tagged Mr. Thaci as an accomplice to the body-trafficking operation.\n\nThe latest allegations might cause some Americans to rethink their approval of the 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia killed up to 1,500 civilians. In early June 1999, The Washington Post reported that \u201csome presidential aides and friends are describing [bombing] Kosovo in Churchillian tones, as Clinton\u2019s \u2018finest hour.\u2019\u201d Clinton administration officials justified killing civilians because the Serbs were allegedly committing genocide in Kosovo. After the bombing ended, no evidence of genocide was found, but Mr. Clinton and Britain\u2019s Tony Blair continued boasting as if their war stopped a new Hitler in his tracks.\n\nThe KLA\u2019s savage nature was well-known before the Clinton administration formally christened them \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d in 1999. The prior year, the State Department condemned \u201cterrorist action by the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army.\u201d The KLA was heavily involved in drug trafficking and had close to ties to Osama bin Laden. Arming the KLA helped Mr. Clinton portray himself as a crusader against injustice and shift public attention after his impeachment trial. Mr. Clinton was aided by many congressmen anxious to portray U.S. bombing as an engine of righteousness. Sen. Joe Lieberman whooped that the United States and the KLA \u201cstand for the same values and principles. Fighting for the KLA is fighting for human rights and American values.\u201d\n\nAfter the bombing ended, Mr. Clinton assured the Serbian people that the United States and NATO agreed to be peacekeepers only \u201cwith the understanding that they would protect Serbs as well as ethnic Albanians and that they would leave when peace took hold.\u201d In the subsequent months and years, American and NATO forces stood by as the KLA resumed its ethnic cleansing, slaughtering Serb civilians, bombing Serbian churches and oppressing any non-Muslims. Almost a quarter-million Serbs, Gypsies, Jews, and other minorities fled Kosovo after Mr. Clinton promised to protect them. By 2003, almost 70 percent of the Serbs living in Kosovo in 1999 had fled, and Kosovo was 95 percent ethnic Albanian.\n\nIn 2009, Mr. Clinton visited Kosovo\u2019s capital, Pristina, for the unveiling of an 11-foot-tall statue of himself. The allegations of the KLA\u2019s involvement in organ trafficking were already swirling, but Mr. Clinton overlooked the grisly record of his hosts. Instead, he stood on Bill Clinton Boulevard and lapped up adulation from supporters of one of the most brutal regimes in Europe. A commentator in the United Kingdom\u2019s The Guardian newspaper noted that the statue showed Mr. Clinton \u201cwith a left hand raised, a typical gesture of a leader greeting the masses. In his right hand he is holding documents engraved with the date when NATO started the bombardment of Serbia, 24 March 1999.\u201d\n\nShortly after the end of the 1999 bombing campaign, Mr. Clinton enunciated what his aides labeled the Clinton doctrine: \u201cWhether within or beyond the borders of a country, if the world community has the power to stop it, we ought to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing.\u201d In reality, the Clinton doctrine was that presidents are entitled to commence bombing regardless of whether their accusations against foreigners are true. As long as the U.S. government promises great benefits from bombing abroad, presidents can usually attack whom they please.\n\nMr. Clinton\u2019s war on Serbia was a Pandora\u2019s box from which the world still suffers. Because politicians and most of the media portrayed the war against Serbia as a moral triumph, it was easier for the Bush administration to justify attacking Iraq and for the Obama administration to bomb Libya. Both interventions sowed chaos that continues to curse the purported beneficiaries.\n\nUnfortunately, Bill Clinton will never be held liable for killing innocent Serbs or for helping body-snatchers take over a nation the size of Connecticut. Mr. Clinton is reportedly being paid up to $500,000 for each speech he gives nowadays. Perhaps some of the well-heeled attendees could brandish artificial arms and legs in the air to showcase Mr. Clinton\u2019s actual legacy.\n\nJames Bovard is the author of \u201cAttention Deficit Democracy\u201d (Palgrave, 2006) and \u201cLost Rights\u201d (St. Martin\u2019s, 1994).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton continues to be feted around the world as a progressive champion of human rights.", "Author": "James Bovard", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton continues to be feted around the world as a progressive champion of human rights.", "title": "BOVARD: When the spoils of war are  human organs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/4/bovard-when-the-spoils-of-war-are-human-organs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/04/8_4_2014_b1-bovard8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/04/8_4_2014_b1-bovard8201.jpg", "title": "BOVARD: When the spoils of war are  human organs", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton continues to be feted around the world as a progressive champion of human rights.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99f1\"", "article_summary": "The allegations of the KLA\u2019s involvement in organ trafficking were already swirling, but Mr. Clinton overlooked the grisly record of his hosts.\nMr. Clinton is reportedly being paid up to $500,000 for each speech he gives nowadays.\nIn 2009, Mr. Clinton visited Kosovo\u2019s capital, Pristina, for the unveiling of an 11-foot-tall statue of himself.\nArming the KLA helped Mr. Clinton portray himself as a crusader against injustice and shift public attention after his impeachment trial.\nThe KLA\u2019s savage nature was well-known before the Clinton administration formally christened them \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d in 1999."}
