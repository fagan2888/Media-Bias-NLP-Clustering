Rick Perry is crisscrossing the country extolling a business-first philosophy he says made his state\u2019s economy white-hot \u2014 and can work for the rest of America too.\n\nBut back home, members of Perry\u2019s own party seem poised to dismantle key parts of his legacy. The longest-serving governor in state history isn\u2019t seeking re-election and may see two of his achievements \u2014 distributing hundreds of millions of dollars to attract top employers to Texas and stockpiling a rainy day fund robust enough to bankroll infrastructure projects \u2014 swept away not long after he moves out of the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nAlso likely doomed is a Perry-backed program extending in-state university tuition to the children of immigrants in the country illegally, a nod to Texas\u2019 Hispanic population that\u2019s long been championed by top business leaders clamoring for a softer approach to immigration.\n\nThe rebuff to Perry, who was once known as one of America\u2019s most conservative stalwarts, reflects the grassroots surge that has seen the tea party seize almost total control of the state\u2019s political and social agenda in the last two years and push it to his right.\n\n\u201cThe young conservatives have completely moved on, but I think even some of the old guard are pretty tired of him,\u201d said Don Zimmerman, an Austin-area tea party activist who was a delegate to the national GOP convention in 2012.\n\nThe shift raises the awkward possibility that Perry \u2014 looking to bounce back from his short-lived, gaffe-marred 2012 White House campaign \u2014 could wind up running nationally on his record even as it\u2019s being undone.\n\nAlready, the snubs are evident in what was supposed to be his victory-lap year. The governor\u2019s name barely came up during the recent Texas Republican primary campaign, which produced a near clean-sweep for top tea party-backed candidates. And the response at the state GOP convention Thursday may be muted when Perry addresses a gathering he once dominated.\n\nPerry\u2019s departure could spell the official demise of a longstanding brand of Texas conservatism that avoided fiery immigration rhetoric and deferred to big-business even at the expense of some free market ideals and pledges to shrink government. That approach long buoyed Perry and his Texas gubernatorial predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he or his policies have changed,\u201d said Cathie Adams, a former chairwoman of the state Republican Party. \u201cBut I do think the electorate is different.\u201d\n\nTexas created a third of all net new jobs nationwide between 2003 and last year \u2014 and Perry\u2019s pushing of low-tax, relaxed-regulation policies remains wildly popular among conservatives. But his support for using public seed money and incentives to boost the state economy aren\u2019t as beloved.\n\nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the favorite to succeed Perry because he\u2019s successfully wooed both tea party activists and establishment conservatives, has expressed unease about the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Emerging Technology Fund, the two pots of money Perry has used to lure job-creators to Texas. Abbott says the government should \u201cget out of the business of picking winners and losers.\u201d\n\nTea-party champion Ted Cruz, who defeated Perry\u2019s preferred candidate, David Dewhurst, for a U.S. Senate seat in 2012, suggested during a recent Austin visit that only the free market \u2014 not Republicans pulling economic strings \u2014 can create jobs.\n\nThe GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, and Abbott both say they\u2019d like to wipe out the in-state tuition law Perry signed in 2001. The governor passionately defended the policy during his 2012 presidential run.\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick, who will oversee legislation in the Texas Senate if he\u2019s elected \u2014 which is likely \u2014 has said he wants to refund the about $8 billion left in the state\u2019s rainy day fund to taxpayers rather than keep it on the government books.\n\nLast year, Perry, supported by leading business groups, campaigned hard to spend $2 billion from the reserves on infrastructure projects to boost state water resources \u2014 a move he and other proponents said was vital to keep Texas economically competitive for the future.\n\nMark Miner, a veteran of Perry\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign who\u2019s helping him again raise his national profile, shrugged off the idea that the changed political climate would affect Perry should he run for president.\n\n\u201cTexas continues to be the economic engine that\u2019s driving this country and that\u2019s the result of the work that Governor Perry has done,\u201d Miner said.\n\nAdams, the ex-state GOP chairwoman and president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum, said Perry remains popular among Texans, but maybe not like in years past.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of angst about those who have been there for a long time,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The longest-serving governor in state history isn't seeking re-election and may see two of his achievements \u2014 distributing hundreds of millions of dollars to attract top employers to Texas and stockpiling a rainy day fund robust enough to bankroll infrastructure projects \u2014 swept away not long after he moves out of the governor's mansion.", "pubdate": 20140604, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The longest-serving governor in state history isn't seeking re-election and may see two of his achievements \u2014 distributing hundreds of millions of dollars to attract top employers to Texas and stockpiling a rainy day fund robust enough to bankroll infrastructure projects \u2014 swept away not long after he moves out of the governor's mansion.", "title": "Texas lawmakers likely to dismantle key parts of Rick Perry's legacy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/photos-2013-07-09-167978574.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/texas-lawmakers-likely-dismantle-rick-perrys-legacy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The longest-serving governor in state history isn't seeking re-election and may see two of his achievements \u2014 distributing hundreds of millions of dollars to attract top employers to Texas and stockpiling a rainy day fund robust enough to bankroll infrastructure projects \u2014 swept away not long after he moves out of the governor's mansion.", "title": "Texas lawmakers likely to dismantle key parts of Rick Perry's legacy", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/photos-2013-07-09-167978574.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd79\"", "article_summary": "But back home, members of Perry\u2019s own party seem poised to dismantle key parts of his legacy.\nAnd the response at the state GOP convention Thursday may be muted when Perry addresses a gathering he once dominated.\n\u201cTexas continues to be the economic engine that\u2019s driving this country and that\u2019s the result of the work that Governor Perry has done,\u201d Miner said.\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 As he gears up for a possible second presidential run, Texas Gov.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he or his policies have changed,\u201d said Cathie Adams, a former chairwoman of the state Republican Party."}
