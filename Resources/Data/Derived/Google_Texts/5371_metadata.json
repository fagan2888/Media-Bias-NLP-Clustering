In some ways\u2014like with improved and increased street space\u2014this has been a very good thing. But in other ways\u2014like the homelessness epidemic and with the loss of affordable housing to taxpayer subsidized high rises\u2014it most certainly has not. And one of his worst legacies will be the incredible loss of beloved neighborhood businesses and restaurants over his 12 years in office.\n\nJeremiah Moss, the curator and chronicler of the changing face of NYC on Jeremiah's Vanishing New York, compiled an impressively depressing list of businesses that have disappeared since 2001\u2014places that have been forced out because of rent hikes, that lost their leases when their building was sold, that were demolished for billion-dollar luxury condo projects.\n\nIt's a list where the phrase \"a victim of soaring rents in a neighborhood populated as much by bankers as by bohemians\" is all too accurate. Moss lists all the years these establishments were in business (ie, 150 years for Domino Sugar Factory, 45 years for Kenny's Castaway's), and came up with an astronomical figure: NYC lost at least 6,926 years of its history in 12 years.\n\nIn 2013 alone, we lost 836 years of history:\n\nStile's Market: 26 years Pushed out by landlord, to be demolished for luxury development 5Pointz, formerly Phun Phactory: 20 years\n\nWhite-washed by owner, to be demolished for luxury condo towers Famous Roio\u2019s/Ray\u2019s Pizza: 40 years\n\nBuilding sold Ray Beauty Supply: 50 years\n\nProperty seized by landlord Vercesi Hardware: 101 years\n\nBuilding sold to be demolished for luxury condos D\u2019Auito\u2019s Bakery: 89 years\n\nUnknown Odessa Restaurant: 48 years\n\nBuilding sold, gastropub to move in, now for rent Splash gay bar: 22 years\n\nLack of business Paradise Caf\u00e9: 20 years\n\nRent hike Big Nick\u2019s Burger and Pizza Joint: 51 years\n\nRent increase from $42,000 to $60,000 a month Max Fish: 24 years\n\nRent increase Joe\u2019s Dairy: 60 years\n\nCost of doing business Bleecker Bob\u2019s Records: 46 years\n\nRent hike Blarney Cove: 50+ years\n\nEvicted for new development Sofia\u2019s Italian restaurant: 35 years\n\nLost their lease 9th Street Bakery: 87 years\n\n38% rent hike, replaced by juice-cleanse and smoothie shop Capucine\u2019s Italian restaurant: 33 years\n\nRent hike Rawhide gay bar: 34 years\n\nRent hike, to be turned into a pizza chain from California\n\nSome of these places of course would have disappeared anyway (as a commenter points out, \"'Seized by landlord' and 'evicted' means non-payment of rent\"), but most places seem to have been the victims of gentrification, rent increases, and the rising cost of surviving in NYC. We share Moss' hope that de Blasio will follow the lead of San Francisco in dealing with retail stores. In the meantime, let's appreciate the popovers while they're here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gothamist", "description": "One of Bloomberg's worst legacies will be the incredible loss of beloved neighborhood businesses and restaurants over his 12 years in office.", "title": "6,926 Years Of NYC History Disappeared During The Bloomberg Era (Approximately)", "url": "http://gothamist.com/2014/01/05/6926_years_of_nyc_history_disappear.php", "image": "http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/01/10514bleek-thumb-640xauto-825096.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of Bloomberg's worst legacies will be the incredible loss of beloved neighborhood businesses and restaurants over his 12 years in office.", "title": "6,926 Years Of NYC History Disappeared During The Bloomberg Era (Approximately)", "url": "http://gothamist.com/2014/01/05/6926_years_of_nyc_history_disappear.php", "image": "http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/01/10514bleek-thumb-640xauto-825096.jpg", "site": "@gothamist", "card": "summary"}, "vr": {"category": "arts", "author": "Ben Yakas"}, "fb": {"pages": 13927915491}, "taboola-recommend": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "lachance's flickrThere's no denying that Mayor Bloomberg dramatically changed the landscape of NYC through bike lanes, new buildings construction, and rezoning.\nWe share Moss' hope that de Blasio will follow the lead of San Francisco in dealing with retail stores.\nBut in other ways\u2014like the homelessness epidemic and with the loss of affordable housing to taxpayer subsidized high rises\u2014it most certainly has not.\nIn some ways\u2014like with improved and increased street space\u2014this has been a very good thing.\nAnd one of his worst legacies will be the incredible loss of beloved neighborhood businesses and restaurants over his 12 years in office."}
