The year after she will serve a term as chairman of the PAFP board.Davis said in the release she will be “confronting issues such as payment reform, graduate medical eduction funding and the Affordable Care Act,” and wants “to be an example to medical students, medical residents and Pennsylvania youth interested in a career in medicine.”Having been associated with the PAFP for so many years, Davis said “it was a goal” to become president of the organization.As president-elect she will work with the organization in its ongoing update to its three-year strategic plan and focus on learning the “legislative side … understanding that … it will be the biggest learning curve doing this job.”“I think the Pennsylvania Academy does a really good job representing family physicians across the state on a wide range of issue,” Davis said.Her goal in serving in the leadership positions will be to determine “if we’re meeting the goals from last year, and if not to tweak them.”
