Those records include checks and invoices.\n\nColorado\u2019s state constitution forbids public money from being used to fund abortion, McIntyre said. That document reads:\n\nPublic funding of abortion forbidden. No public funds shall be used by the state of Colorado, its agencies or political subdivisions to pay or otherwise reimburse, either directly or indirectly, any person, agency or facility for the performance of any induced abortion, PROVIDED HOWEVER, that the General Assembly, by specific bill, may authorize and appropriate funds to be used for those medical services necessary to prevent the death of either a pregnant woman or her unborn child under circumstances where every reasonable effort is made to preserve the life of each.\n\nHowever, McIntyre said, the state government disregarded this provision and continued to fund Planned Parenthood \u201cwithout legal justification.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat definition is wide and broad to protect Colorado taxpayers from funding something they may have a moral objection to,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cIt needs to be enforced. Not only can they not profit from this, they cannot be reimbursed.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released last month when the suit was filed, university spokesman Mike Hooker said the school denied wrongdoing. Hooker said the university \u201cobtained placental tissue from Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood for research into healthy pregnancies,\u201d as well as \u201cproperly obtained fetal tissue from other providers for important research into curing disease.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is one of the affiliates featured in undercover videos released by the pro-life Center for Medical Progress. The videos raised allegations that Planned Parenthood clinics sell the body parts of aborted babies.\n\nIn the group\u2019s fourth video, Dr. Savita Ginde, vice president and medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, is shown speaking to actors portraying buyers from a human biologics company.\n\n\u201cI think a per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it,\u201d Ginde tells them in the video.\n\nProfiting from the sale of human organs\u2014including those of the unborn\u2014is illegal in the United States. Spokesmen for Planned Parenthood Federation of America have denied that the organization and its affiliates profitin by illegal transactions.\n\nThe organization, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, recently announced that it no longer will accept \u201creimbursement\u201d for donations of body parts to researchers.\n\nMcIntyre said the videos provided \u201cmore information\u201d about Planned Parenthood\u2019s business practices.\n\n\u201cWe knew that Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is not up to high medical standards,\u201d McIntyre said, citing a case involving the organization\u2019s failure to report the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old girl.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Not only has Planned Parenthood lied, they have used state funds for abortions and fetal tissue transactions,\u201d pro-life activist Nick McIntyre says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Not only has Planned Parenthood lied, they have used state funds for abortions and fetal tissue transactions,\u201d pro-life activist Nick McIntyre says.", "title": "Suit: Planned Parenthood Took Taxpayer Money for Body Parts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_ColoradoPP_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-24T11:40:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SXtxnx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Not only has Planned Parenthood lied, they have used state funds for abortions and fetal tissue transactions,\u201d pro-life activist Nick McIntyre says.", "title": "Suit: Planned Parenthood Took Taxpayer Money for Body Parts", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_ColoradoPP_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-11-24T11:14:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T11:40:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, Center for Medical Progress, Planned Parenthood videos, prolife, pro-life, abortion, #PPSellsBabyParts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe132b\"", "article_summary": "A lawsuit filed in Colorado alleges that Planned Parenthood accepted taxpayer funds from Colorado State University in exchange for the body parts of aborted babies.\nThe videos raised allegations that Planned Parenthood clinics sell the body parts of aborted babies.\nSpokesmen for Planned Parenthood Federation of America have denied that the organization and its affiliates profitin by illegal transactions.\nColorado State University paid as much as $160 per specimen, he said.\nMcIntyre said his group obtained records from Colorado State University through the Colorado Open Records Act that document a financial relationship among the university, the Planned Parenthood affiliate and Advanced Bioscience Resources."}
