In the realm of popular fiction, few novelists can equal his explosive action scenes, neon-bright descriptions and unexpected plot twists. Still, stylish writing alone rarely creates best-sellers, and I think the real secret of the series\u2019 phenomenal success is Child\u2019s improbable, larger-than-life hero.\n\nReacher is 6-foot-5, 250 pounds, a former military police officer who\u2019s a one-man army. Most fictional crime fighters stick to their home turf, but Reacher travels America endlessly, mostly hitchhiking or by bus, and he finds admiring women and evil men wherever he goes. He\u2019s the stuff of myth, a great male fantasy. I confess that the big galoot sometimes strikes me as faintly ridiculous, but he ranks with Stieg Larsson\u2019s Lisbeth Salander as one of this century\u2019s most original, tantalizing pop-fiction heroes.\n\nStill, for all Child\u2019s skill, he faces the same problem as every writer who agrees to produce a new book every year: Inevitably, some of his plots will be stronger than others \u2014 and others much weaker. The first Reacher novel I read was \u201cWithout Fail\u201d in 2002, wherein he helped the Secret Service protect the vice president from an assassination plot. My conclusion: \u201cChild\u2019s plot is ingenious, his characters are first-rate, and his writing is fine indeed.\u201d\n\nI was less enamored of \u201cWorth Dying For\u201d (2010), in which Reacher faced off against a Nebraska gang that used former college football players for muscle. The gang kept sending young giants to dispose of Reacher, whereupon he would laugh and dispatch them with a punch or two. Eventually a bad guy with a gun \u2014 Reacher rarely carries one \u2014 locked him in a cellar to await execution. Not to worry, the silver-tongued Reacher tricked his clueless captors into freeing him. All in all, it was a silly story, however well told.\n\n\u201cPersonal,\u201d the 19th Reacher novel, is the best of the six I\u2019ve read. A Special Forces general urgently summons him after a failed assassination attempt on the president of France. The general believes the attack was a rehearsal for an assassination attempt on the U.S. president at an upcoming economic summit in London.\n\nThe Paris shooter had fired from a distance of 1,400 yards, and Reacher and the general know that only a handful of snipers in the world could make that shot. One is an American named John Kott, whom Reacher sent to prison 15 years earlier. Now he\u2019s free, and Reacher\u2019s job is to find him, knowing of course that Kott would like nothing more than to kill his pursuer.\n\nThe story that unfolds in Paris and London \u2014 both lovingly evoked \u2014 is complex and fascinating. You\u2019ll learn more than you ever expected to know about snipers and high-powered rifles. In London, Kott is protected by a criminal gang led by Little Joey, who is 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Reacher joins forces with an attractive, 28-year-old military aide with the fetching name Casey Nice. Throughout, Child does a masterly job of bringing his adventure to life with endless surprises and fierce suspense, and he\u2019s peerless on the logistics of killing.\n\nMy complaints concern the book\u2019s ending and mostly reflect the imperatives of the genre. We start with the fact that, unless Child and his publisher are willing to throw away many millions of dollars for the sake of a truly unexpected conclusion, Reacher is destined to survive.\n\nThere\u2019s an unspoken bargain here: Child gives us an exciting read, and we pretend not to know that his hero will survive, just as he did the previous 18 times. Thus, when all the villains have been laid to rest, a weary Reacher can climb onto the next bus and vanish into the night, leaving his multitude of fans awaiting the challenge that will greet him somewhere down the road.\n\nFICTION: THRILLER\n\nTHRILLER\n\nPersonal\n\nby Lee Child (Delacorte)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Review: Lee Child continues Jack Reacher series with \u201cPersonal\u201d", "title": "Review: Lee Child continues Jack Reacher series with \u201cPersonal\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/11/review-lee-child-continues-jack-reacher-series-with-personal/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140911__20140914_E8_BK14REVIEWPERSONALBOOp1.jpg", "height": 394}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140911__20140914_E8_BK14REVIEWPERSONALBOOp1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-11T17:07:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:24:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One reason Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher novels are so hugely popular is that the man writes so very well.\nThe Paris shooter had fired from a distance of 1,400 yards, and Reacher and the general know that only a handful of snipers in the world could make that shot.\nOne is an American named John Kott, whom Reacher sent to prison 15 years earlier.\nThe first Reacher novel I read was \u201cWithout Fail\u201d in 2002, wherein he helped the Secret Service protect the vice president from an assassination plot.\nEventually a bad guy with a gun \u2014 Reacher rarely carries one \u2014 locked him in a cellar to await execution."}
