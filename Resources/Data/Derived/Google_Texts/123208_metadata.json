You learn the process, and you learn to make sure you identify the issues,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. \u201cI think having served in the state Legislature gives me more of a rounded view and gives me a better grasp of the issues than a person who just served on a staff or never had to make a vote.\u201d\n\nMr. Zinke, a Republican running for Montana\u2019s sole U.S. House seat, is one of almost 150 veterans hoping to become a member of the 114th Congress.\n\nVeterans advocates predict the number of competitive veteran candidates will increase in future elections as recent veterans have time to learn how to campaign and legislate in local politics first \u2014 though some candidates found that their lack of political experience actually helped them defeat those seen as Washington insiders.\n\nThe number of veterans in Congress has been declining for decades. While veterans made up just 20 percent of the 113th Congress as its start, former service members accounted for more than 70 percent of lawmakers in the 1970s, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. The next Congress will also be the first without a veteran of World War II.\n\nBill Rausch, political director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said the veteran candidates running now are far more competitive and serious than those who ran six years ago. Previously, candidates would leave the military and run for Congress right away, lacking the experience and network necessary to win a high-profile seat.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we see a lot with candidates is they come back immediately from service and they run for Congress, and most of those candidates don\u2019t do well for various reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no experience outside the military. Oftentimes, as a result of military service, they\u2019ve moved around the country, and the [home] district doesn\u2019t know the individual.\u201d\n\nJon Soltz, chairman for the left-leaning VoteVets, said that being a veteran is \u201cthe worst platform you can have,\u201d noting that those who served have likely not built a following in the district and don\u2019t have wealthy friends to donate to a campaign, unlike candidates who may have come from business jobs, for example.\n\nGary Lambert, who lost in the GOP House primary in New Hampshire last week, said that his time in state senate was \u201ca good training ground\u201d in how to campaign and how to work with other lawmakers, but added a lament common to many politicians \u2014 that any decision made in office can be used against you in an election.\n\n\u201cAny time you have a voting record, people can use that record against you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fresh face and you have no record at all, you can run on whatever agenda you feel like running on.\u201d\n\nMr. Lambert, who spent 35 years in the Marine Corps, said he had a hard time fundraising among fellow veterans, whom he said are traditionally low givers, and lacked the connections of Marilinda Garcia, the 31-year-old who won the primary after serving in state government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent my life developing my military career,\u201d he said. \u201cMy opponent spent her whole adult life in the state house of representatives, so she developed a following, she developed a lot of relationships that I hadn\u2019t really had. Quite frankly, plenty of people thank you for serving, but I\u2019m not sure it means a lot running for elected office.\u201d\n\nSeth Moulton, a former Marine who knocked out the Democratic incumbent in Massachusetts earlier this month, took time off before running for Congress but didn\u2019t enter local politics, instead earning an MBA from Harvard Business School and starting his own business. He said his lack of experience in state-level politics actually helped him in the national election.\n\n\u201cPeople are tired of career politicians right now, so one of the things I found in my race is people were excited that my experience was in business and in public service, and not in politics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Rausch said he expects the number of vets in Congress \u2014 currently 102 \u2014 to go down after the midterms.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be pretty close to that number, but it\u2019s probably going to go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the direction we\u2019ve been going in as it\u2019s been related to the proportion of vets who have been serving in the country.\u201d\n\nMr. Soltz agreed that the number would likely drop in January but said it\u2019s not fair to compare the number of vets in Congress today to the number who were elected years ago, when a much larger percentage of the country\u2019s population served in the military.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a decline in members who are veterans because there\u2019s no draft,\u201d Mr. Soltz said. \u201cWhen you have 1 percent of the population serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, how do you expect 50 percent of Congress to be vets? They\u2019re just not there.\u201d\n\nRather than comparing to past generations, Mr. Soltz said the number of vets in Congress should be judged in relation to how many are currently serving. And more important than just the number running for election, he said, is how many high-quality veteran candidates can actually win seats \u2014 and keep them through several election cycles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see people who are going to be in the next generation who are going to stay there,\u201d Mr. Soltz said, noting the success of combat veteran Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii Democrat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have people who are going to be there who can stay in their seats.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan Zinke already knew how to lead from his 23-year career as a Navy SEAL, but said his time in the Montana state Senate taught him how to represent constituents with vastly different backgrounds.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ryan Zinke already knew how to lead from his 23-year career as a Navy SEAL, but said his time in the Montana state Senate taught him how to represent constituents with vastly different backgrounds.", "title": "Military veterans seeking political office find new kind of battle", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/21/military-veterans-seeking-political-office-find-ne/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/21/9_212014_ap7822651616628201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/21/9_212014_ap7822651616628201.jpg", "description": "Ryan Zinke already knew how to lead from his 23-year career as a Navy SEAL, but said his time in the Montana state Senate taught him how to represent constituents with vastly different backgrounds.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Military veterans seeking political office find new kind of battle"}, "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Bill Rausch, Jon Soltz, Ryan Zinke"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b77\"", "article_summary": "Bill Rausch, political director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said the veteran candidates running now are far more competitive and serious than those who ran six years ago.\nThe number of veterans in Congress has been declining for decades.\nAnd more important than just the number running for election, he said, is how many high-quality veteran candidates can actually win seats \u2014 and keep them through several election cycles.\nMr. Rausch said he expects the number of vets in Congress \u2014 currently 102 \u2014 to go down after the midterms.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a decline in members who are veterans because there\u2019s no draft,\u201d Mr. Soltz said."}
