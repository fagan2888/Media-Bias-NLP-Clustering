In asking the court to overturn the designation of jaguar critical habitat in New Mexico, PLF attorneys represent three broad-based organizations with members who are harmed by this reckless and unjustified expansion of federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) regulations in the region \u2014 the New Mexico Farm & Livestock Bureau, New Mexico Cattle Growers\u2019 Association, and New Mexico Federal Lands Council.\n\n\n\nPLF represents these organizations free of charge, as with all its clients.\n\nReckless regulating: Roping off \u201ccritical habitat\u201d for a species that isn\u2019t there\n\nThe jaguar\u2019s global population is estimated to be at least 30,000; 90 percent live in tropical, jungle, and swamp habitats in Central and South America. According to the FWS Recovery Outline for the species, there are no jaguar populations in New Mexico \u2014 or anywhere in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe jaguar has been listed as \u201cendangered\u201d under the ESA since 1972; but the FWS did not designate any terrain as \u201ccritical habitat\u201d for the species until more than 40 years later (in 2014), and then only in response to a lawsuit by environmental activists. This long practice of not designating jaguar habitat reflected a basic biological reality, at least in New Mexico: The state has not been occupied by jaguars in many decades, and it is not home to any environmental features that are essential to the future of jaguar recovery. Indeed, the closest jaguar population to New Mexico is a small one (100 animals or fewer) living fully 130 miles south of the border, according to the FWS\u2019s Recovery Outline.\n\nHurting landowners and wasting environmental resources\n\n\u201cHabitat designations mean significant \u2014 sometimes crippling \u2014 restrictions on property owners and managers, both private and public,\u201d said PLF Senior Staff Attorney Tony Francois. \u201cThey also compete for the limited money and resources available for environmental protection.\n\n\n\n\u201cClearly, the government doesn\u2019t have the luxury of careless overreach when it comes to roping off property as critical habitat,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what we see with the jaguar habitat designation in New Mexico. The bureaucrats have cordoned off tens of thousands of acres for a phantom species. This amounts to reckless regulating, and a heavy-handed power play against landowners.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt most, only two jaguars have been credibly sighted anywhere in the state over the past four decades,\u201d Francois noted. \u201cThere are no breeding pairs or evidence of resident jaguars in the state. This species\u2019 connection to New Mexico is a matter of distant memory, not recent reality. There is no justification for bringing down the regulatory fist on property owners, and wasting scarce environmental resources.\u201d\n\nJaguar regs\u2019 threat to fire prevention\n\nA significant portion of the New Mexico habitat designation lies within the Coronado National Forest \u2014 creating an impediment to fire-prevention and fire-fighting initiatives in that region.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the FWS\u2019s \u201cFinal Critical Habitat Designation\u201d for the jaguar admits that the designation of critical habitat creates new regulatory hurdles for forest-fire management strategies, such as \u201cfuels-management activities, and some prescribed fire.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOver and above the legal issues, it\u2019s simply poor public policy to designate a fire-prone National Forest as critical habitat for an animal that isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Francois. \u201cImportant projects to reduce fire risk will be impeded by new layers of bureaucracy and a time-consuming approval process. It will be harder to implement effective, flexible fire-prevention strategies. This means increased danger of catastrophic wildfire, with potentially devastating impacts not just for people, property and natural resources \u2014 but also for species. That\u2019s right: The environment is at greater risk because of unjustified regulations by the very bureaucrats who are paid to protect the environment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe jaguar habitat designation can also impede development of community infrastructure like road improvements and pipelines, and range improvements for cattle ranches that are important to the local community and economy,\u201d he noted.\n\nStatement from the New Mexico Farm & Livestock Bureau\n\n\u201cFood producers in New Mexico are under the gun as the federal government continues to endanger their livelihood,\u201d said Chad Smith, CEO of the New Mexico Farm & Livestock Bureau. \u201cThe designation of tens of thousands of acres of prime New Mexico ranch lands as critical habitat for endangered jaguars is one more example of how endangered species have taken precedence over people. We must restore balance, and members of the New Mexico Farm & Livestock Bureau ask the federal government to ensure a successful future for ranchers in Southern New Mexico by overturning the designation of jaguar habitat.\u201d\n\n\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, the lawsuit is New Mexico Farm & Livestock Bureau, et al. v. Jewell.
