Sioux Falls, SD

If you're already thinking about lunch Monday, eating at Panda Express could help hungry families.

Panda Express is teaming up with Feeding America to fight family hunger, with proceeds from local restaurants going right back to Feeding South Dakota.

The Chinese restaurant is holding its first ever "Family Day" Monday, June 8th at all 1,750 locations across the country. Ten percent of the day's sales will be donated to Feeding America, with money raised at South Dakota locations going back to its own communities in need.

"Family Day" will be all day at all Panda Express restaurants.
