Minneapolis, MN

A third person has died after an explosion in a Minneapolis apartment building.



Fire officials said Friday they believe they have accounted for all victims of Wednesday's explosion and fire, after recovering the bodies of two people from the building's charred ruins.



The first victim was identified Friday as Ahmed Farah Ali, a 57-year-old resident of one of the apartments. His body was recovered from the site Thursday. A second body was recovered Friday but has not yet been identified.



The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office said Saturday that 29-year-old Abdiqani Adan died at the Hennepin County Medical Center on Friday afternoon. He did not live in the building.



The fire, which also injured 13 others, was in the heart of Minneapolis' large Somali community.
