At last week\u2019s debate, Ted Cruz was asked by Fox News moderator Bret Baier to explain what he would do to cover people who would lose their insurance should Obamacare be repealed. Cruz dodged the question and instead explained how the free market will magically resolve everyone\u2019s healthcare problems. A couple of days later, Cruz was at a rally in Iowa where a voter confronted him with the story of his brother-in-law who, owing to severe medical problems, had not been able to get insurance until Obamacare was passed. He asked Cruz what he intended to replace Obamacare with, and Cruz said that pre-Obamacare \u201cregulations\u201d prevented the man\u2019s brother-in-law from getting coverage.\n\nIn a similar vein, Donald Trump was asked on ABC News this weekend what he intends to do to cover people once Obamacare is repealed, and he offered a still vaguer vision of the Republican healthcare future. \u201cI want people taken care of,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cIf someone has no money and they\u2019re lying in the middle of the street and they\u2019re dying, I\u2019m going to take care of them.\u201d Pressed on what, exactly, that would look like, Trump said \u201cwe\u2019re going to work with our hospitals, we\u2019re going to work with our doctors, we\u2019ve gotta do something.\u201d\n\nSo the post-Obamacare solution for ensuring coverage, as articulated by two of the top three GOP candidates, is to undo regulations and figure out \u201csomething.\u201d But what about the third candidate? What about Marco Rubio? The Florida senator spends the majority of his time talking up his own electability and warning about how dangerous the Islamic State is, so he doesn\u2019t get pressed on healthcare too often. But he should, because his healthcare plan is just as vague and inscrutable as what the other two Republican front-runners have to offer.\n\nThe most detailed rundown of what Rubio has in store for healthcare policy is a Politico Op-Ed he wrote all the way back in August. Once you slog through the pro-forma denunciations of the Affordable Care Act, you come to Rubio\u2019s three-part plan for providing affordable health coverage: tax credits to help purchase insurance; \u201creform insurance regulations\u201d and set up high-risk pools for people with preexisting conditions; and block-granting Medicaid while shifting Medicare to a \u201cpremium support system.\u201d\n\nThe first question that arises from all this is how Rubio intends to pay for it. \u201cPerhaps most importantly,\u201d Rubio wrote in Politico, his proposals \u201cwill not raise taxes on the American people.\u201d So tax hikes are out, which we could have guessed given Rubio\u2019s enthusiasm to sign Grover Norquist\u2019s no-tax pledge. But tax credits cost money, as do high-risk pools, which Rubio says should be \u201cfederally-supported.\u201d Those high-risk pools are only effective if there\u2019s a ton of federal cash backing them up (best of luck convincing House Republicans to sign off on that). And keep in mind that Rubio also wants to cut taxes by something like $12 trillion while also creating new tax credits for families while also increasing military spending by $1 trillion while also balancing the budget and decreasing the national debt. None of this math comes anywhere close to adding up, and Rubio hasn\u2019t explained how he\u2019ll pay for his healthcare proposal (or anything else, really).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have been pressed recently on their awful healthcare policies, and Rubio's is no better", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s lousy healthcare plan: None of the top 3 GOP candidates has a viable Obamacare \u201creplacement\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have been pressed recently on their awful healthcare policies, and Rubio's is no better", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s lousy healthcare plan: None of the top 3 GOP candidates has a viable Obamacare \u201creplacement\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/04/marco_rubios_lousy_healthcare_plan_none_of_the_top_3_gop_candidates_has_a_viable_obamacare_replacement/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/marco_rubio8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have been pressed recently on their awful healthcare policies, and Rubio's is no better", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s lousy healthcare plan: None of the top 3 GOP candidates has a viable Obamacare \u201creplacement\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/marco_rubio8.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Affordable Care Act, Donald Trump, healthcare, Healthcare Reform, Marco Rubio, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He asked Cruz what he intended to replace Obamacare with, and Cruz said that pre-Obamacare \u201cregulations\u201d prevented the man\u2019s brother-in-law from getting coverage.\nCruz dodged the question and instead explained how the free market will magically resolve everyone\u2019s healthcare problems.\nBut he should, because his healthcare plan is just as vague and inscrutable as what the other two Republican front-runners have to offer.\nNone of this math comes anywhere close to adding up, and Rubio hasn\u2019t explained how he\u2019ll pay for his healthcare proposal (or anything else, really).\nThe most detailed rundown of what Rubio has in store for healthcare policy is a Politico Op-Ed he wrote all the way back in August."}
