The Affordable Care Act is reducing the ranks of the uninsured across the county, but lagging behind is Virginia, which sports the largest percentage of people without health insurance of any state in the country.

That's a trend not likely to change anytime soon. The main reason for that is how the Medicaid system works in Virginia, creating the region's strictest limits on who can qualify for the program, which provides health insurance to people with low incomes or disabilities.

"We have women who are not covered in Virginia who would be covered in Maryland or in D.C.," says Anne Rorem at the University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. "In Virginia, we see that pregnant women are covered under Medicaid up to 143 percent of the poverty level, which means that they are living above poverty. But not all that much above poverty."

Maryland has about 12 percent of its population uninsured. In D.C., it's 8 percent. But across the Potomac in Virginia, 14 percent of the population has no health insurance. One explanation for that is that the General Assembly has blocked efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law.

"It would save the state ultimately to expand Medicaid because it has a very generous federal share that's paid for the program," says Alison Cuellar at George Mason University. "But it's just not a decision that the state has been willing to make, and as long as we don't expand Medicaid, we are going to have higher uninsured rates than our neighboring states do."

Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe campaigned on a platform of expanding Medicaid to 400,000 people without health insurance. So far he has been unable to deliver on that promise, blocked by Republicans in the General Assembly.
