The hospitalists argue that the rule disrupts their workflow, damages the physician-patient relationship and impacts their clinical decisions.\n\nThe study further emphasizes the problems that clinicians complained about this week during a Senate hearing on the effects of Medicare observation status on seniors. Marna Borgstrom, president and CEO of Yale-New Haven Health System in Connecticut, testified that the rule \"disregards physicians' clinical judgment and exacerbates the existing challenges that hospitals face when having to explain to beneficiaries a policy that causes beneficiary confusion.\"\n\nIn order to qualify for Medicare reimbursement under inpatient rates, the two-midnight rule requires that physicians deem the patient's condition as serious enough to require at least two overnight stays. Patients who aren't formally admitted may remain under outpatient or observation status--an action that may leave patients with high out-of-pocket expenses. The federal government currently prohibits RACs from conducting hospital patient status reviews on claims with dates of admission Oct. 1, 2013 through March 31, 2015, However, MACs may review a small set of claims from that time period and can deny them if they don't meet the two-midnight threshold.\n\nHospitalists urge a short-term solution involving more emphasis on provider and patient education. Patients especially need to understand the difference between admission as an inpatient and observation status and how it impacts their financial responsibilities. They also want the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to change skilled nursing facility care coverage rules as well as reform the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor program.\n\nOver the long-term, hospitalists want CMS to eliminate observation status and replace it with a program that includes a low-acuity modifier that accounts for patients whose inpatient visits are brief and require fewer or less-intensive hospital resources. They'd also like to see a Medicare payment system with a budget neutral formula that accounts for any changes in patient care.\n\nIn response to complaints from clinicians about the rule, lawmakers have introduced two pieces of legislation: the Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2013, which would count every patient day spent in observation status toward Medicare's required inpatient stay, and the Notice of Observation Treatment and Implications for Care Eligibility Act of 2014, which would require hospitals to clearly notify patients who are under observations status longer than 24 hours.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSenate committee hears stories on observation status, two-midnight rule\n\nEmergency room docs struggle with two-midnight rule, observation status\n\nIndustry leader disappointed IPPS proposed rule doesn't address two-midnight rule\n\nAHA, hospital groups sue over two-midnight rule\n\nHospitals mount challenge to two-midnight rule\n\nCMS clarifies two-midnight rule after enforcement delay announcement", "article_metadata": {"description": "Add hospitalists to the growing list of\u00a0medical professionals who are concerned about the federal government requirements for short inpatient stays.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Add hospitalists to the growing list of\u00a0medical professionals who are concerned about the federal government requirements for short inpatient stays.", "title": "Hospitalists: Two-midnight rule has negative impact on patient care, finances", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitalists-two-midnight-rule-has-negative-impact-patient-care-finances/2014-08-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Centers for Medicare % Medicaid Services (CMS),hospitalists,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,observation status,Society for Hospital Medicine,two-midnight rule", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80dd\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the report (.pdf)Related Articles:Senate committee hears stories on observation status, two-midnight ruleEmergency room docs struggle with two-midnight rule, observation statusIndustry leader disappointed IPPS proposed rule doesn't address two-midnight ruleAHA, hospital groups sue over two-midnight ruleHospitals mount challenge to two-midnight ruleCMS clarifies two-midnight rule after enforcement delay announcement\nIn a study released this week by the Society for Hospital Medicine, researchers say that a lack of understanding of the two-midnight rule has a negative impact on patient care and patient finances.\nThe study further emphasizes the problems that clinicians complained about this week during a Senate hearing on the effects of Medicare observation status on seniors.\nPatients especially need to understand the difference between admission as an inpatient and observation status and how it impacts their financial responsibilities.\nThe hospitalists argue that the rule disrupts their workflow, damages the physician-patient relationship and impacts their clinical decisions."}
