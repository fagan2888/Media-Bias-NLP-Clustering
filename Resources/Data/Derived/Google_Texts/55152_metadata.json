The short answer? The hospital was entitled to summary judgment, meaning Robinson lost. But as for the reasons why she lost, employers should take note of the many steps the hospital took in an effort to accommodate Robinson, steps that in combination amounted to a \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 sufficient to fend off her claim of discrimination.\n\nNeed the hospital have gone to the trouble of taking those steps for fear of a lawsuit? The well-reported cases of the past few years send mixed messages. Some suggest that many judges are deaf to pleas for religious liberty, while others have ears to hear. On one hand, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that hijab-wearing job applicants have a right to be hired by Abercrombie & Fitch despite the company\u2019s no-headwear policy and that Hobby Lobby has the right to refrain from paying for its employees\u2019 abortifacients despite the dictates of the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn the other hand, unless the Supreme Court rules otherwise, the federal Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 with the approval of six different federal courts of appeal \u2014 will continue insisting that the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor must pay for contraceptives. Similarly, after a Catholic prep school (Fontbonne Academy in Milton, Mass.) rescinded its job offer to a man when it learned that he was married to another man, the Superior Court for Norfolk County held that the school had discriminated against him unlawfully.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Fontbonne based its decision on a religious objection to same-sex marriage, it was not entitled to any sort of dispensation from the state. Incidentally, the school would have been on firmer ground had it limited its enrollment and employment to Catholics, but by welcoming people of all faiths and none, it ran afoul of the Commonwealth\u2019s anti-discrimination law (yes, you read that correctly).\n\nSo, given the experience of Little Sisters of the Poor and Fontbonne Academy, one could be forgiven for thinking that, when a children\u2019s hospital \u2014 by definition, a place for the treatment of children who are ill, some of them very seriously \u2014 instructs its employees to get vaccinated against influenza, it would be perfectly all right for the hospital to respond to a simple \u2018no\u2019 with an equally simple \u2018goodbye,\u2019 even if the employee cites religious grounds. That is not the current state of our Commonwealth\u2019s anti-discrimination law, however. Boston Children\u2019s Hospital demonstrated admirable wisdom and foresight in not immediately directing Robinson to the door marked \u2018exit.\u2019\n\nThe case began in 2011 when, in accordance with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Mass. Department of Public Health, the hospital adopted a policy requiring those employees working in patient-care positions to be vaccinated against the influenza virus. Robinson refused. She was often the first employee to come into contact with patients, and her job involved touching them and sitting close to them. She also happens to be a Muslim, more specifically an adherent of the Nation of Islam, and initially she said the basis for her refusal was the presence of pork byproducts in the influenza vaccine.\n\nAt this juncture, although it is not relevant to the legal analysis of Robinson\u2019s claim of religious discrimination, readers may wish to note that, within Islam as a whole, on this issue at least, the Nation of Islam is a bit of an outlier. In 1995 (coincidentally, the year Robinson started working at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital) the Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences ruled that the series of chemical reactions by which porcine products turn into gelatin is transformative, so much so that the resultant gelatin is not \u2018judicially impure\u2019 but \u2018lawful and permissible.\u2019 Therefore, according to the Islamic scholars who authored the 1995 statement, observant Muslims are allowed to receive vaccinations via gelatin that, prior to its transmogrification, contained pig tissue.\n\nBut the Nation of Islam takes a different view of vaccines, as do some Scientologists, a few minor Christian denominations such as End Time Ministries, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The year after the Islamic scholars issued their statement, the Nation of Islam\u2019s minister of health declared all vaccines suspect and recommended a \u201cmoratorium for all African-American members of the Muslim faith.\u201d Although it was issued in 1996, Robinson only learned of this recommendation in November 2011.\n\nFrom that point forward, she foreswore all vaccines, possibly regretting the tetanus shot she had received in September. Nevertheless, so far as the hospital was concerned, the loneliness of the Nation of Islam\u2019s anti-vaccine position among Muslims in general and the fact of Robinson\u2019s prior vaccines were not trees worth barking up: judges are loath to assess the sincerity and bona fides of a litigant\u2019s religious professions.\n\nTo recap, Robinson, an employee at a children\u2019s hospital, refused a mandatory influenza shot on religious grounds that it was pig-based, and even though mainstream Muslim opinion holds that the vaccine is permissible, the hospital did not simply fire her. Rather, in order to accommodate her religious objection (the initial one), the hospital offered Robinson a pig-free version of the influenza vaccine. But by that stage, Robinson had learned of the Nation of Islam\u2019s moratorium on all vaccinations, so she refused that too.\n\nAgain, instead of firing Robinson, the hospital attempted to accommodate her. Human resources arranged an interview for a clerical position, a job that did not involve direct patient care, but for which Robinson was not chosen. After that, she did not apply for any other positions in the hospital. After that, the hospital not only granted Robinson a two-month leave of absence to look for work, but also assigned an HR employee to help her.\n\nWhen the two months were up and Robinson had not found new employment, the hospital gave her two more weeks. Finally, when the additional two weeks expired, it categorized Robinson\u2019s separation from the hospital as voluntary so that she could apply for other positions. In February 2014, Robinson sued the hospital for religious discrimination.\n\nAt summary judgment, the court assumed that Robinson could show that her vaccine refusal was based on a sincerely held, bona fide religious belief, so the burden shifted to the hospital to show either that it had offered her a reasonable accommodation or that a reasonable accommodation would be an undue burden. The court found in the hospital\u2019s favor on both counts: the hospital had offered a reasonable accommodation (see the preceding paragraph), and the accommodation Robinson requested would have been an undue hardship (her working in a patient-care position without vaccination would increase the risk to the hospital\u2019s already-vulnerable patients).\n\nWhat should Massachusetts employers take away from this case? First, that Title VII and Chapter 151B prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion. Second, challenging the bona fides of an employee\u2019s professed belief is a fool\u2019s errand. As the court stated. \u201calthough inconsistencies between a person\u2019s conduct and her professed religious beliefs may suggest insincerity, they may also reflect an evolution in the person\u2019s religious views.\u201d Do not try to disprove evolution.\n\nThird, on the bright side, an accommodation is not reasonable if it would generate undue hardship, which in turn means that the employer does not have to create a new job for the religious objector.\n\nFourth, and perhaps most importantly, as a practical matter, an employer should bear in mind the burden-shifting formula and prepare to demonstrate two things in detail: (1) that it attempted to accommodate the employee\u2019s religious objection, and (2) precisely how the particular accommodation that the employee requested would cause undue hardship.\n\nPeter Vickery practices employment law in Amherst; (413) 549-9933.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "BusinessWest", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://businesswest.com/blog/hospitals-victory-in-discrimination-claim-provides-a-critical-lesson/", "article_author_name": "BusinessWest", "image": "http://businesswest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Vickery-e1407518670388-150x150.png", "site_id": "60194866eb87d5b4a33aa10a6760c251", "article_published_time": "2016-05-03T09:44:03+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-27T13:39:08+00:00", "keywords": "discrimination, employment", "wp_version": "7.6.1.8"}, "description": "Hospital\u2019s Victory in Discrimination Claim Provides a Critical Lesson", "generator": "WooFramework 6.0.4", "og": {"site_name": "BusinessWest", "description": "Hospital\u2019s Victory in Discrimination Claim Provides a Critical Lesson", "title": "Hospital\u2019s Victory in Discrimination Claim Provides a Critical Lesson", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://businesswest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Vickery-e1407518670388-150x150.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-29T13:38:23+00:00", "url": "http://businesswest.com/blog/hospitals-victory-in-discrimination-claim-provides-a-critical-lesson/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "BusinessWest", "description": "Hospital\u2019s Victory in Discrimination Claim Provides a Critical Lesson", "title": "Hospital\u2019s Victory in Discrimination Claim Provides a Critical Lesson", "image": "http://businesswest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Vickery-e1407518670388-150x150.png", "creator": "@businesswest", "site": "@businesswest", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BusinessWestJournal", "section": "Employment", "published_time": "2016-05-03T05:44:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T13:38:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Rather, in order to accommodate her religious objection (the initial one), the hospital offered Robinson a pig-free version of the influenza vaccine.\nIn February 2014, Robinson sued the hospital for religious discrimination.\nSome suggest that many judges are deaf to pleas for religious liberty, while others have ears to hear.\nWhen the two months were up and Robinson had not found new employment, the hospital gave her two more weeks.\nBut by that stage, Robinson had learned of the Nation of Islam\u2019s moratorium on all vaccinations, so she refused that too."}
