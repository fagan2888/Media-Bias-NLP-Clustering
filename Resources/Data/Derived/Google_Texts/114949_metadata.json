Hawk Carlisle said during an Air Force Association event. \u201cIncredible work when you think about.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe guys that were working down out of Hurlburt, they\u2019re combing through social media and they see some moron standing at this command. And in some social media, open forum, bragging about the command and control capabilities for Daesh, ISIL. And these guys go: \u2018We got an in.\u2019 So they do some work, long story short, about 22 hours later\u201d the building had been destroyed by a strike, he said.\n\nISIS has made aggressive use of social media to recruit sympathetic young people to its cause and communicate more broadly with the public. A March estimate from the Brookings Institute found that there were at least 46,000 Twitter accounts used by supporters of ISIS between September and December last year.\n\nTheir penetration on social media has allowed them to distribute and leverage the power of videos of executions of prisoners conducted by the group, including several Americans.\n\nSocial media platforms have moved to suspend users associated with the group, but the authors of the Brookings paper found those were not successful on a broad scale.\n\n\u201cAccount suspensions do have concrete effects in limiting the reach and scope of ISIS activities on social media,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey do not, at the current level of implementation, eliminate those activities, and cannot be expected to do this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cIncredible work when you think about,\" he said.", "description": "\u201cIncredible work when you think about,\" he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cIncredible work when you think about,\" he said.", "title": "General: Social media post led to strike against ISIS", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/244060-general-says-a-single-social-media-post-led-to-isis-strike", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/isis03112015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/244060-general-says-a-single-social-media-post-led-to-isis-strike", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-04T14:57-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,ISIS, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Islamic State", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T14:57:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/244060-general-says-a-single-social-media-post-led-to-isis-strike", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cIncredible work when you think about,\" he said.", "card": "summary", "title": "General: Social media post led to strike against ISIS"}, "dcterms.title": "General: Social media post led to strike against ISIS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd61\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAccount suspensions do have concrete effects in limiting the reach and scope of ISIS activities on social media,\u201d they wrote.\nAnd in some social media, open forum, bragging about the command and control capabilities for Daesh, ISIL.\nISIS has made aggressive use of social media to recruit sympathetic young people to its cause and communicate more broadly with the public.\n\u201cIt was a post on social media to bombs on target in less than 24 hours,\u201d Gen.
