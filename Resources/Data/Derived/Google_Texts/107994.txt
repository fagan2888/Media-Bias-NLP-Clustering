Related Research Credit Opinion: Aetna Inc.: Semiannual Update Credit Opinion: Aetna Inc. Credit Opinion: Coventry Health Care, Inc. Credit Opinion: Aetna Life Insurance Company Rating List: Moody's Investors Service – Update on Credit Ratings Remaining on Review Rating Action: Moody's upgrades Aetna's ratings (sr. debt to Baa1); outlook stable Global Credit Research - 14 May 2015 Approximately $8.1 billion of long term debt affected New York, May 14, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Aetna Inc.'s (Aetna; NYSE: AET) senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2 following the announcement of first quarter earnings. In conjunction with the rating action the insurance financial strength (IFS) rating of Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC) has been upgraded to A1 from A2. The outlook on the ratings is stable. RATINGS RATIONALE Moody's stated that the ratings upgrade for Aetna reflects strong financial results for 2014 followed by even stronger results for first quarter 2015. Moody's senior vice president, Steve Zaharuk, said that, "Aetna's financial results over this period were characterized by strong revenue and membership growth, solid earnings margins and reduced financial leverage." "In particular", Mr. Zaharuk continued, "Aetna's financial leverage (adjusted debt to capital, where debt includes unfunded pension liabilities and operating leases), which had been expected to be remain at or above 40% through the end of 2015 as a result of the Coventry acquisition in 2013, was lowered to 38.7% as of March 31, 2015." Moody's added that the integration with Coventry was very successful as reflected in the resulting combined entity with approximately 24 million medical members, increased product diversity, and the realization of expense synergies. The rating agency noted that the rating upgrade reflects the expectation that there will not be a large debt-financed acquisition over the next 24 months. The rating agency commented that after the Coventry acquisition, Aetna's EBITDA margins have remained consistent at 8.4% for 2014 and a very strong 11% for the first quarter of 2015. During this same period Aetna has organically grown medical membership by approximately 1.5 million members, including 950 thousand individual members who purchased policies both on and off the public exchanges. According to Moody's the results represent a very disciplined approach to pricing, medical management, and expense oversight. Commenting on Aetna's strong business profile, Moody's said that Aetna's ratings continue to be supported by its national presence, solid brand name, and its product diversity, which includes employer group health, life and disability benefits, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage. The rating agency added that Aetna continues to be well positioned to meet the challenges posed by the Affordable Care Act as a result of the company's geographic and product diversity as well as several strategic acquisitions that involved small non-risk businesses that employ technology to develop and promote cost effective health care solutions. The rating agency stated that the ratings could be upgraded if 1) the adjusted financial leverage ratio is sustained below 35%, 2) Aetna's consolidated risk based capital (RBC) ratio is increased to 300% company action level (CAL), and 3) the average annual membership growth is at least 2%. However, Moody's said, if 1) EBITDA margins fall below 5%, 2) there is a decrease in the consolidated risk-based capital ratio below 250%, 3) there is a large debt-financed acquisition increasing leverage significantly above 40% or 4) there are significant adverse developments in healthcare reform regulation that threaten the profitability of the company, the ratings may be downgraded. The following ratings were upgraded with a stable outlook: Aetna Inc. -- senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2; senior unsecured debt shelf rating to (P) Baa1 from (P)Baa2; subordinated debt shelf rating (P)Baa2 from (P)Baa3; preferred stock debt shelf rating to (P)Baa3 from (P)Ba1; Aetna Health Holdings, LLC -- senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2; Aetna Life Insurance Company -- insurance financial strength rating to A1 from A2; long-term issuer rating to A2 from A3; Coventry Health Care of Missouri, Inc. -- insurance financial strength rating to A1 from A2; HealthAmerica Pennsylvania, Inc. -- insurance financial strength rating to A1 from A2; HealthAssurance Pennsylvania, Inc. -- insurance financial strength rating to A1 from A2. The following rating was affirmed with a stable outlook: Aetna Inc. - short-term debt rating for commercial paper at Prime-2. Aetna Inc. is based in Hartford, CT, and through its subsidiaries provides health and life insurance products primarily to group customers. For the first three months of 2015, the company reported consolidated GAAP revenues of approximately $15.1 billion. As of March 31, 2015 shareholders' equity was approximately $15.1 billion, with medical enrollment of 23.7 million members (excluding standalone Medicare Part D members). Moody's insurance financial strength ratings are opinions of the ability of insurance companies to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations. The principal methodology used in these ratings was U.S. Health Insurance Companies published in October 2014. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
