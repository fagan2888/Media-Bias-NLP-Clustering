Launching on January 1, 2016, this ACO brings two of Delaware\u2019s leaders in health care together to improve the way care is provided for Medicare patients across the state. This collaboration between a trusted and respected health system well-known for personal, comprehensive care and the state\u2019s largest and most prominent physician organization, and MedNet, will improve the patient experience while providing access to high-value medical care through a coordinated, patient-centered approach. To date, 22 physicians have enrolled in the ACO.\n\n\u201cThe way health care is provided and paid for is changing across the nation. Through this partnership with a proven and experienced team in the Medical Society of Delaware, our health system will help to shape the future here in Delaware,\u201d says Brian E. Dietz, FACHE, president and CEO of Saint Francis Healthcare. Saint Francis Healthcare is a part of Trinity Health, which is a national leader with 27 ACOs in 20 markets across the nation.\n\nEstablished by the Affordable Care Act in 2012, ACOs are groups of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers who come together voluntarily to provide coordinated care to Medicare patients. More than 7 million Medicare beneficiaries currently receive care from doctors enrolled in ACOs across the country.\n\nDelaware Care Collaboration, a physician-driven ACO, will become the second physician-led statewide ACO in Delaware with the first being MedNet\u2019s existing Highmark Quality Blue ACO commercial program. The new ACO will be formed under Medicare\u2019s Shared Savings Program (MSSP), which rewards ACOs that reduce health care costs while meeting quality performance standards. Primary care physicians who are either employed or in private practice in Delaware can join Delaware Care Collaboration.\n\n\u201cThe goal is for patients, especially those who are chronically ill, to get the right care at the right time, while avoiding duplicated services and preventing medical errors,\u201d says Michael Bradley, DO, family medicine physician in Dover, Delaware and president, MedNet of Delaware. \u201cThis partnership will improve outcomes and the overall patient experience.\u201d\n\nUnlike many ACOs, Delaware Care Collaboration will not require any financial investment by participating physicians. Delaware Care Collaborative will provide practices with the infrastructure to support the ACO. This includes providing physicians with transition assistance, navigation and care coordination services, sophisticated and meaningful analytics, and hands-on educational support. It will not mandate changes to physicians\u2019 existing referral patterns. If quality benchmarks are met, participating physicians can also share in up to 50 percent of any cost savings earned with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nParticipation agreements will be accepted from physicians statewide until July 31, 2015. Delaware Care Collaboration will complete all required steps on the practices\u2019 behalf for approval of the ACO by CMS. For more information, physicians can contact Lori Ann Rhoads, Director of Physician Relations and Health System Innovation, MSD, at 302-224-5196 or LoriAnn.Rhoads@medsocdel.org.\n\nAbout Saint Francis Healthcare\n\nSaint Francis Healthcare, a part of Trinity Health, operates Delaware\u2019s only Catholic hospital serving Wilmington and Northern New Castle County since 1924.

Today, MedNet provides administrative services, such as contract management, and practice support to approximately 800 physicians that are part of one of the four physician organizations in Delaware. MedNet is also positioned to assist physicians in taking advantage of opportunities presented by the changing health care delivery landscape.
