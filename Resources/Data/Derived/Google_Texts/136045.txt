Queens-born cinematographer Gordon Willis died this weekend at the age of 82. When a celebrated filmmaker passes, all manner of cinephiles queue up to pay their respects. While there is typically a consensus about that individual’s most significant contributions to film – in this case, the Godfather trilogy will undoubtedly be the centerpiece of most retrospectives – a truly great back catalog implies that there is something for everyone.

Personally, I like to think of Willis as the quintessential New York shooter thanks to films like “Klute” and Hal Ashby’s criminally underappreciated “The Landlord.” But foremost in my mind are a sequence of scenes in “Annie Hall” that serve as the film’s getting-to-know-you moments – a crucial sequence in all romantic comedies. Woody Allen fans are familiar with the hilarious balcony scene in which the subtext of Annie and Alvy’s pseudo-intellectual conversation is revealed via subtitles. But prior to that brilliant but overt gag, the distance between the two potential lovers is revealed far more subtly through Willis’ camera work.
