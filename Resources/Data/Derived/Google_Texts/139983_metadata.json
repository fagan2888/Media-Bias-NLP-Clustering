The Physician Assistant Studies graduate program is ranked #70 in the nation, according to the 2016 U.S. News & World Report Best Graduate Schools report.\n\n\u201cThis is a natural next step in our partnership with North Shore-LIJ Health System,\u201d said Hofstra University President Stuart Rabinowitz. \u201cMeeting the need for accessible, high-quality health care requires well-trained medical professionals of all types. The Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Graduate Nursing and Health Professions, together with the medical school and our School of Health Sciences and Human Services, will help build a comprehensive network of health care options that will serve our region for decades to come.\u201d\n\nThe Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Graduate Nursing and Health Professions will continue the innovative, holistic, patient-centered approach pioneered by the medical school, an educational model that focuses on treating people, rather than illnesses, and emphasizes community-based care.\n\n\u201cThrough this new School of Graduate Nursing and Health Professions, we are taking another bold step toward redesigning both medical and nursing education to reflect the rapid changes occurring in the way healthcare is accessed, delivered and paid for in this country,\u201d said North Shore-LIJ President & CEO Michael J. Dowling. \u201cIn keeping with our hands-on approach to education, North Shore-LIJ\u2019s 19 hospitals, more than 400 outpatient facilities, our simulation center and all other resources across the health system will be available as learning laboratories for students in this innovative new program.\u201d\n\nThe number of nurse practitioners in the United States has doubled over the last decade, from 106,000 in 2004 to 205,000 in 2014, according to the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics, citing the impact of healthcare legislation, increased emphasis on preventative care and an aging population, projects the number of jobs in advanced nursing roles, including nurse practitioners, will increase by 31 percent by 2022.\n\nNurse practitioner and physician assistant are ranked among the top 10 best jobs in 2015, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\n\u201cWith the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine and this new school focused on the training of future nurse practitioners and physician assistants, we have a unique opportunity to pursue an interprofessional education curriculum different than any other in the New York area,\u201d said Dr. Gallo. \u201cAs our population continues to age and as more people become insured as part of the Affordable Care Act, nurse practitioners and physician assistants will both be key in meeting the growing demand for care.\"\n\nDr. Gallo brings to the new school a blend of scholarly, clinical and management experience.
