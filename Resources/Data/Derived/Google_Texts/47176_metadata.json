The event was hosted by the Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nRegulating growth\n\nHis presentation, \u201cStanding Up for American Enterprise: Elevating Job Creators, Entrepreneurs and Innovators,\u201d offered insights into regulations and uncertainty \u2014 two major obstacles that entrepreneurs are facing locally and abroad, he said.\n\n\u201cSince 1976, we\u2019ve added about 176,000 new regulations,\u201d Van Andel said. \u201cI think the federal agencies are churning out about 4,000 regulations every year. Even more surprising than that are major regulations \u2014 and they interpret major regulations as regulations that will have over $100 million in cost impact \u2014 that has gone up in the last decade by 80 percent.\u201d\n\nRegulations can slow growth, but uncertainty in the economy and the government can stop it, he said.\n\nMost recently, the disastrous rollout and ongoing confusion about impacts of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act have caused many entrepreneurs to question putting their businesses up for sale, Van Andel said.\n\nMany entrepreneurs are put in a kind of holding pattern until more information about costs is made transparent.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, however, Van Andel urged businesses and government officials to not remain stagnant, simply out of fear over Washington\u2019s troubles.\n\n\u201cLocal governments shouldn\u2019t stop, because they\u2019re worried about something nationally,\u201d Van Andel said. \u201cThey should just keep moving forward. You may not know what the future looks like, but it will ultimately work itself out, and everyone\u2019s going to be in the same ocean.\u201d\n\nStudying entrepreneurship\n\nVan Andel\u2019s insights come from a recent global study on entrepreneurship from Ada-based Amway.\n\nThe goal of the fifth-annual report, which surveyed 26,000 entrepreneurs from 24 different countries, was to discover what\u2019s the driving the fear that\u2019s holding many entrepreneurs back, said Cindy Droog, Amway public relations. Economic uncertainty is the answer, she said.\n\nThe report also reveals that the U.S. is the most entrepreneur-friendly country in the world, with the independence of self-employment being the reason many choose to pursue starting their own business.\n\nOnly one in three Americans, however, felt favorable about pursuing that option, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was actually surprising,\u201d Droog said. \u201cThose aged under 30 had the highest fear of letting other people down. As a community, we need to do a deeper dive into this.\u201d\n\nDroog added that because that generation \u201cgrew up so socialized, with more community than independence,\u201d we have to ask if independence is still as woven into our community.\n\nStatewide growth\n\nThe good news is that on a local level, West Michigan seems to be doing well, Van Andel said.\n\nHe praised the expansion of the Medical Mile in downtown Grand Rapids, as well as the work of Start Garden and Grand Valley State University.\n\n\u201cCloser to home, when we look at our environments here, I think Michigan\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Van Andel said. \u201cOver the last couple of years, we\u2019ve created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the state economy is at a 10-year high \u2014 in fact, the Grand Rapids metro area is the number two in the U.S. for per-capita job growth. The Michigan Business Tax that was hurting jobs is gone, we\u2019re now a right-to-work state, funding for education has increased . . . I think there\u2019s new optimism here as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If economic uncertainty is keeping you from expanding your business, Steve Van Andel has some advice for you: keep moving forward anyway.
