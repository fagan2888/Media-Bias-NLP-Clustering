The plan is centered on acquiring young, hard-throwing pitching prospects, building a bulletproof bullpen and relying on a rich pipeline from the minor leagues.\n\nThe Harvard-educated Bridich, 38, has been on the job since October 2014, when he took over for Dan O\u2019Dowd, his longtime mentor. Despite the Rockies\u2019 losing tradition, Bridich sees no need to blow things up and start from scratch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Bridich said last week. \u201cThe little that I do read about this whole rebuilding thing, the assumption by a lot of people is, the only way to do it, or the only right way to do it, is some sort of nuclear tear down. In my opinion, our farm system is incredibly strong.\n\n\u201cWhile we have a lot of growth and a lot of improvement to do in terms of our results at the major-league level and our process at the major-league level. But we have a lot of talented baseball athletes. We have high-impact (players) and we have depth of those players in our system. It\u2019s not like we have to build at the major-league level and build at the minor-league level all at the same time.\u201d\n\nPowerful young arms\n\nThere is promise growing down on the farm, with the Rockies\u2019 minor-leagues system ranked in the top 10 by most observers, including Baseball America.\n\nBridich has especially high hope for a stable full of powerful young arms, including right-handers Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro, Jesus Tinoco, German Marquez and Antonio Senzatela, and lefties Tyler Anderson and Kyle Freeland.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a renewed focus on pitching,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cProbably to the degree that I haven\u2019t seen it before here, and this is my 15th year with the organization in some capacity. That\u2019s definitely a part of it.\u201d\n\nWeiss also said the Rockies are intent on \u201cgetting the right type of guy,\u201d meaning clubhouse leaders such as catcher Nick Hundley or new free-agent outfielder Gerardo Parra, who \u201cplays baseball with an edge.\u201d\n\nSince taking over as GM, Bridich has largely steered clear of setting out any kind of timetable for turning the corner. At his first general managers meeting in November 2014, he said, \u201cOur goal is just to get us back to playing meaningful games in September.\u201d\n\nNow, nearly 18 months into the job, and after enduring 94 losses in 2015, Bridich declined to talk wins and losses this season, nor will he project if his plan will yield results in 2016, 2017, 2018 or further down the line.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Bridich said. \u201cWhy limit ourselves? So if I were to come out and say something that\u2019s pleasing to the ear of you, or a fan here or a fan there, and I say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to win for \u2018X.\u2019 So what?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about people. It\u2019s about process. And it\u2019s about how well can we do that together. If a lot of that or most of that comes together for us this year, wonderful. Why say something where it\u2019s got to happen X-number of months and years in the future, where really a lot of good things can happen this year?\u201d\n\nGoing out to win\n\nMost observers would be surprised if the Rockies played .500 baseball this season, and downright astounded if they were to contend in the tough National League West. USA Today recently predicted the first 100-loss season in Rockies history. In other words, rooting for the Rockies requires the patience of Job, because even if they do have quality arms coming up through the system, history tells us it\u2019s extremely rare that Colorado pitchers thrive in the majors.\n\nKansas City\u2019s Dayton Moore knows all about patience. He has been the Royals\u2019 GM since June 2006, and his team had losing records in his first six seasons, including five seasons of 90-plus losses. Then K.C. put together three consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1987-89, culminating in a World Series title last fall, its first in 30 years.\n\n\u201cIn 2009 or 2010, I think it was, I had a radio interview and I said that building a winner is an eight- to 10-year process,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat made a lot of people upset. It\u2019s the truth, but I could have probably phrased it a little bit differently, because our fans had been patient since 1985.\u201d\n\nWhen Moore\u2019s story was passed on to Bridich, he chuckled and then said, \u201cHe\u2019s right though.\u201d\n\nMoore, who was aware of the long, steep climb ahead of him, says he\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t try to hide how far the Royals had to go.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I knew it was going to take at least eight years, but we always felt we had to be very transparent with our fan base,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to fool them anyway. They are smart people, the people in the media are well-informed and pay attention, so we said what we said and just went ahead with our plan.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 problem, however, is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be light at the end of the tunnel, although they dispute that.\n\n\u201cI go out expecting to win every night,\u201d said Weiss, who\u2019s entering the final year of his three-year contract. \u201cThat\u2019s my mentality and I hope that\u2019s our players\u2019 mentality. What other people say about us really has no bearing on it for me.\u201d\n\nBridich says the same thing, but he wouldn\u2019t mind a little payback this season.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that we are surprising all of the doubters and all of the naysayers; most of the interested parties in this baseball industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to prognosticate now with everything on paper. But we are getting closer to it not being on paper, which is fun and exciting.\n\n\u201cBut our goal every single year is to compete our butts off and play good baseball. The winning and the losing, a lot of that is dependent on the details and how you play the game.\u201d\n\nBridich\u2019s moves\n\nDenver Post baseball writer Patrick Saunders takes a snapshot of the major moves made by Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich since he replaced Dan O\u2019Dowd on Oct. 8, 2014:\n\nTRADES\n\nOF Corey Dickerson and 3B prospect Kevin Padlo to Tampa Bay Rays for LHP Jake McGee and RHP prospect German Marquez (Jan. 28, 2016): Gave up a potential star slugger for a back-end reliever for two years and Marquez\u2019s great promise.\n\nLHP Rex Brothers to Chicago Cubs for LHP prospect Wander Cabrera (Nov. 25, 2015): If Brothers gets right, this will be a steal for Chicago.\n\nSS Troy Tulowitzki and RHP LaTroy Hawkins to Toronto Blue Jays for SS Jose Reyes, RHP prospects Miguel Castro, Jeff Hoffman and Jesus Tinoco (July 28, 2015): One of biggest trades in franchise history that could well define Bridich as a GM. Trading Tulo for future pitching makes some sense, but the $48 million the club owes a declining Reyes is hard to swallow.\n\nCatcher prospects Jose Briceno and Chris O\u2019Dowd to Atlanta Braves for RHP David Hale and RHP Gus Schlosser (Jan. 30, 2015): Hale looked like he might provide rotation depth, but now looks like a 4A pitcher.\n\n2B Josh Rutledge to Los Angeles Angels for RHP Jairo Diaz (Dec. 12, 2014): One of Bridich\u2019s first deals looks like a winner. Diaz has chance to be a power arm in back of bullpen.\n\nFREE-AGENT SIGNINGS\n\nOF Gerardo Parra, three years, $27.5 million (Jan. 20, 2016): Cleared way for Dickerson trade, and Parra strengthens the defense at Coors Field, but did the Rockies need to spend big bucks on a nonslugging outfielder?\n\n1B Mark Reynolds, one year, $2.6 million (Dec. 16, 2015): Rockies needed depth at first base and a right-handed bat. A low-cost solution for one year.\n\nRHP Chad Qualls, two years $6 million (Dec. 8, 2015): Bullpen needed immediate help and Qualls brings it. A likely seventh-inning arm.\n\nRHP Jason Motte, two years, $10 million (Dec. 8, 2015): If McGee can\u2019t close, Motte will. A solid acquisition if he can recapture some of his 2012 magic when he saved 42 games for the Cardinals.\n\nRHP Kyle Kendrick, one year, $5.5 million (Feb. 4, 2015): A disastrous marriage between a pitcher and a ballpark. Kendrick posted a 7.72 ERA and gave up 21 homers in 13 starts at Coors Field.\n\nC Nick Hundley, two years, $6.25 million (Jan. 5, 2015): Bridich struck gold with Hundley, who hit a career-high .301 last season and provided needed stability behind the plate and leadership in the clubhouse.\n\nRHP John Axford to a minor-league contract (Jan. 30, 2015): Made the team, became the closer and notched 25 saves despite roller-coaster 2015 season. The Rockies considered re-signing him, but a likely $6 million arbitration figure was too steep.\n\nINF Daniel Descalso, two years, $3.6 million (Dec. 14, 2014): Veteran utility infielder provides some depth, but he hit just .205 with a .283 on-base percentage last season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jeff Bridich, Colorado Rockies building up a (home) base", "title": "Jeff Bridich, Colorado Rockies building up a (home) base", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/jeff-bridich-colorado-rockies-building-up-a-home-base/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__BN20160228_C18_BNSP28BBNROCKIESp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__BN20160228_C18_BNSP28BBNROCKIESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T20:24:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:48:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "1B Mark Reynolds, one year, $2.6 million (Dec. 16, 2015): Rockies needed depth at first base and a right-handed bat.\nDespite the Rockies\u2019 losing tradition, Bridich sees no need to blow things up and start from scratch.\nRHP John Axford to a minor-league contract (Jan. 30, 2015): Made the team, became the closer and notched 25 saves despite roller-coaster 2015 season.\nC Nick Hundley, two years, $6.25 million (Jan. 5, 2015): Bridich struck gold with Hundley, who hit a career-high .301 last season and provided needed stability behind the plate and leadership in the clubhouse.\nRHP Kyle Kendrick, one year, $5.5 million (Feb. 4, 2015): A disastrous marriage between a pitcher and a ballpark."}
