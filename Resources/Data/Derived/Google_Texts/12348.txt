Your Turn NH: GOP needs to back immigration reform



I MOVED to the United States from India in 1968, with a mere $5 in my pocket. Such was my starting point. I was nervous but also excited that my dreams would come true in this country. With hard work and dedication, I built a company, GT Solar, from the ground up, hired many local American citizens and immigrants and have enjoyed professional success. I am now a U.S. Citizen for the last 30 years. I am CEO of ARC Energy, a major employer in my area. I am blessed and truly appreciative.



Immigration made America exceptional. It continues to make America exceptional. It is my story, and the story of many who live and work in New Hampshire today. We must remember our roots, especially when debating immigration reform.



The primary season is here, and the Republican candidates are still avoiding the tough questions when it comes to immigration reform. Six debates have come and gone without real solutions to our broken immigration system. Where are the detailed, realistic plans for dealing with the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in America? And where are the concrete, viable proposals for fixing our visa programs for seasonal laborers and skilled workers? It is time for the concerned citizens of this country to start pressing the candidates to answer these difficult questions.



Mass deportation is not an option. It would cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars and slam the economy. It would necessitate the expansion of federal policing powers to an extent that would threaten the civil liberties of American citizens. And it would dampen the light of the American spirit. The breaking down of thousands of doors in the middle of the night would forever alter the country’s character.



New Hampshire is pioneering the push for serious and nuanced discussion of immigration reform. Over the past few months, business leaders and members of the Granite Staters for Common Sense Immigration Reform (GSCSIR), a grassroots coalition, have been hosting roundtables across the state.



Recently, Jason Sullivan, an accomplished Portsmouth-based immigration attorney, presented personal accounts of clients and outlined complications hurting the current immigration system. Dawn Wivell, representative to the International Trade Advisory Committee, spoke about international trade and the positive impact that would result from meaningful reform.



Increasingly, the Republican candidates have to start seeing undocumented immigrants through a conservative lens. Treating them as a faceless horde violates the conservative philosophy’s core principle of regarding people as individuals.



Those living here are an untapped source of human potential. They can further advance the American story, continuing a narrative that’s vibrant and dynamic, not monochrome and static. It’s the responsibility of our elected officials then to delineate strategies that match founding principles with opportunities.



With the media circus involving mass deportation, the candidates have been able to circumvent a vital component of immigration reform: fixing the legal channels for entry.



Of particular concern to New Hampshire is the need for the simplification and expansion of the H-1B visa program. High-tech companies like mine rely on these visas to recruit skilled workers. They help preserve America’s status as the global leader in innovation. As such, they also sustain and invigorate the domestic economy.



American companies that have opted to stay here rather than move overseas should be rewarded, not punished. They should have unfettered access to the free market of ideas. Similarly, the international community’s best and brightest should be welcomed, not shunned. They are choosing to dedicate their unique talents to America. We want them investing their ability and ambition here, not in India, China, and Russia.



There’s no doubt that immigration reform would be a significant plus for New Hampshire, as well as for the rest of the country. The only question that remains: Which candidate possesses the courage and the vision to make it happen?



Other states would benefit from following GSCSIR’s lead in expanding the public conversation. And short of that, voters must simply step up to the microphone at town halls and demand that the candidates get specific. Let them know that there are no shortcuts to Pennsylvania Avenue.

The H1-B visa program is a corporatist scam designed to flood this country with white collar scabs, it is a scheme to force down the wages of US workers, and when those wages are kept low, they destroy the incentive for US kids to go to school and achieve the skills to get a high paying job. The super rich seek to globalize labor rates on the backs of the middle class, and even the GOP rank and file, who have been suckers on this issue for years, are finally waking up to the fact that the GOP's war on the cleaning lady is just a big smoke screen to hide the fact that their 1%er masters are commanding them to pass the kind of H1-B floodgate legislation advocated here. You got an I.T. job? Or are you an engineer? A technician? Hey, vote yourself out of a job, vote for the GOP establishment.....

SANDRA PICARD said Monday, January 18, 2016 at 11:24 am



Mr. Gupta, please separate the illegal aliens (that's what they are - not "undocumented immigrants) - they are felons because they entered this country illegally from the "immigrants". Then we can have a conversation.

" But as Mr. Hanson explains in his paper, reasonable calculations suggest that weâre talking about very small numbers, perhaps as little as 0.1 percent of GDP."My second negative point is that immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. Thatâs just supply and demand..."Finally, the fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear.

I know what you are saying MATT the GOP establishment killed my cat. They like to kick baby's. I think I saw them run over my neighbors dog. They are so bad. Only the GOP's are the super rich. The Dems are the poor. Sound correct to you MATT. By the way MATT the true 1% are the men and women who served.

Matt Lulling said Monday, January 18, 2016 at 3:15 pm



Your party advocates flooding this country with H-1b visa labor scabs, and it's top champion in the Senate is Ted Cruz, instead of posting childish gibberish, go ahead and use the Google thingee, if you can figure it out, and google up Ted Cruz H1-B visas and see how your sniveling little immigrant-bashing hero is really just setting American technical workers for a stab in the back.

greg lowell said Monday, January 18, 2016 at 10:13 pm



What's lost in any conversation about illegal aliens or visa programs for foreign workers is the loss of jobs for high school and college-age U.S. residents. Years ago, these temporary jobs as landscapers, fast food workers, retail workers, laborers, etc., were the first jobs for many of us and taught us both a work ethic and gave us insight into different professions, as well as allowing us to pay for college. How will any of our young people learn to work if we continue to allow foreign workers - both illegal and legal - to fill these jobs?

Jeannine Richardson said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 1:35 am



You can blame all of DC for the lobbyists like Tata consulting, the gang in the State Dept in cahoots with the UN and Church do-gooders for bringing in refugees to work meat packing plants around the country. Used to be people like my daughter and her husband (both brain injured) had part time jobs as dishwashers, busboys, sweepers, etc. Now the illegals and refugees get the jobs and these Americans sit home barely getting by. We have the people who want to work stop feeding them food stamps and welfare and telling us we need foreign workers.

PAUL LUNDWALL said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 7:42 am



When we all here about job creation and how many positions and jobs were filled 70% of those jobs are filled by non-citizens. Very misleading to make politicians look good.

George LeMont said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 8:10 am



When a nation already has millions of it's own people not working with few jobs being created it does not need an influx of illegal immigrants to either take jobs from our own citizens or have those citizens living off the tax payers. Then we can talk about the heroin and other drugs coming in, the criminal elements and the citizens who pay the price. And I'm tired of hearing our immigration is broken, when the truth of the matter is our leaders are simply not enforcing our laws. All of that costs us a fortune also and our laws are being broken. Which laws can I break and not be punished, because I see many citizens being prosecuted but not those who came here illegally. That is not a nation of laws that apply to all, but an arrogant dictatorship where some pick and choose the laws they enforce and who will and will not be prosecuted for breaking laws. If I'm ever charged with something I'm going to be one angry citizen.

Matt Lulling said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 11:11 am



Ted Cruz proposed an immediate increase in the base H-1B cap from 65,000 to 325,000 !!!! foreign white-collar labor scabs, one has to ask why an economy reeling from past GOP mismanagement needed to import foreigners to fill high paying jobs in some sort of supposed 'shortage of technical workers' like is being claimed in this article, which belongs at the bottom of a bird cage. Ted Cruz and this author both want the same thing. Instead of protecting the middle class, Cruz offered an increase of newly imported H1-B immigrant scabs as an amendment in 2013 to the Senate's comprehensive immigration bill, something the liar has already tried to claim he did not support. Luckily, Cruz's amendment was defeated by the Senate's Judiciary Committee by a bi-partisan vote of the few moderate GOPers left with the Democrats on the committee. Now Cruz is saying well, he was for that then, but he's against that now, while he avoids questions about his unreported fat loans from the global bankers. Don't fall for this guy's "lets build a fence" smoke screen or his claim that we need a "delay" in H1-B visas, the people who have financed his campaign, the global oil and chemical companies, the big banks, and the rest of his 1%er crowd want to flood this country with these people so they can cut their labor costs. The real jobs the Cruz and his globalist masters are after aren't the cleaning ladies and the guy who mows your lawn, they are after YOUR job if you are a technical, engineering, or I.T. worker in the US, or any other job they can claim a 'shortage' in, and they want to make sure your kid's new career path is down at the hamburger joint.

SANDRA PICARD said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 11:28 am



Lulling - Politifact has ruled the statements you keep making (verbatim every day about Cruz = immigration and H1B visas) as mostly false. Check it out. ANd knock it off.

Congratulations!!! Mr. Guipta, on your coming here to America and being so successful. YOU sir are the American dream. However, to predicate your argument on your ambition is spurious.~~~Some 80% of the new comers now to our shores end up on welfare. Mr.Guipta, YOU are welcome, they are not. ~~~To say that immigration needs reform is an understatement, but not reforms that allow in the hordes. reform that selects those who will help America, not hurt it.~~~For seven years now we have had a president breaking the Constitution by ignoring the current immigration laws. He cannot pick and choose, yet he does,,, daily. Obama's policy is simple. To fulfil his Father's Dream to bring America down to the level of Africa, Obama imports poverty and exports wealth. ~~~We cannot afford any more policies that do that.

@Sandra Picard, You liar. Here it is, on his own website:http://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=137

Matt Lulling said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 2:10 pm



Read Ted Cruz's amendment to expand H1-B visas by googling "Sen. Cruz Presents Measure to Strengthen, Improve Legal Immigration"On his own website, he chortles about his attempt to stab US workers in the back by flooding the country with foreign white collar scabs, but of course now he is conveniently against his own amendment, which gives cover to the people lying for him, like Sandra.

Jeannine Richardson said Tuesday, January 19, 2016 at 5:21 pm



Matt Lulling. Not everyone is voting for Cruz. How about the Dem plan to not only ban deportation but to bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees, give illegals access to Obamacare.? How is that helping unemployed Americans? Both sides are terrible with giving away our country. Trump 2016!

Matt Lulling said Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 10:18 am



I've heard of no such plans, you need to quit getting all your information from Limbaugh. It's 10,000 Syrians and no one has proposed any such thing about illegals on Obamacare. Trump will say anything, just keep slurping it up...
