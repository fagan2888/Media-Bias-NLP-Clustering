Politicians (and their staffers) are generally guarded, scripted, and boring, but when David Axelrod subtweets Hillary Clinton or Rand Paul tweets that Marco Rubio wants to build a moat, it\u2019s the political equivalent of a pretty good episode of The Real Housewives.\n\nLike reality television, political feuds are mostly insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and generate a lot more attention (clicks) than they may deserve. But they\u2019re fun to watch, especially when they play out on Twitter, where people tend to choose their words less carefully.\n\nIn that spirit, here are the seven best political feuds of 2014.\n\n1. Marco Rubio vs. Rand Paul\n\nPaul is on track to have a public feud with every Republican presidential hopeful by the time the first candidate formally declares his candidacy. The Kentucky senator traded barbs over foreign policy disagreements with Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Texas Governor Rick Perry (in a Politico op-ed, Paul wrote that \u201capparently [Perry\u2019s] new glasses haven\u2019t altered his perception of the world, or allowed him to see it any more clearly\u201d), and most recently his colleague from Florida.\n\nWhile Paul supports President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to normalize ties with Cuba, Rubio does not. \u201cLike many people that have been opining, [Paul] has no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Rubio said during a Fox News segment. Paul responded on Twitter.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SenRandPaul/status/545998696974798848\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, Rand, if he wants to become the chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy, he certainly has a right to do that,\u201d Rubio said when asked about the tweets on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n2. Donald Trump vs. BuzzFeed\n\nIn February, BuzzFeed reporter McKay Coppins published a piece on Donald Trump\u2019s political career, \u201ca long con that the blustery billionaire has perpetrated on the country for 25 years by repeatedly pretending to consider various runs for office, only to bail out after generating hundreds of headlines.\u201d\n\nTrump was furious, to say the least. He fired the staffer who helped organize the piece, and made several efforts to discredit Coppins with the help of Breitbart\u2019s Matthew Boyle.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mckaycoppins/status/435859918269063168\n\nHonorable mention: The overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed.\n\n3. Al Roker vs. Bill de Blasio\n\nThe short version of this feud is that Roker, a Today co-anchor and weatherman for The Weather Channel, was very, very, very upset that de Blasio (or \u201cDiBlasio,\u201d as Roker spelled it), the New York City mayor, decided not to close schools during a major storm, though surrounding areas did. BuzzFeed collected the full tweetstorm, but this captures the gist of his argument.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alroker/status/433991168771096577\n\nDuring a press conference at the time, de Blasio said that he respected Roker, but that \u201cit\u2019s a different thing to run the city than to give the weather on TV.\u201d To which Roker replied:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alroker/status/434013915345719296\n\nIt should be noted that Roker wasn\u2019t the only person who thought the city made the wrong call. Several students vented their frustration on Twitter, and attendance at schools was below 50 percent.\n\n4. Rob Ford vs. Kevin Spacey\n\nThis \u201cfeud\u201d started when Spacey (who plays a politician who has killed people) wound up in the same dressing room as Ford (a real former mayor of Toronto who has threatened to kill people) when they both appeared on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d in March. Spacey joked that Ford had thrown up all over the dressing room.\n\nOn the Ford brothers\u2019 YouTube channel, the two responded by calling him an \u201carrogant SOB\u201d and asking him to get off his high horse and take pictures with people. So Spacey did, kind of.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/444828306089574400\n\n5. Former Obama aides vs. Chuck Schumer\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, Schumer, a Democratic senator from New York, told the National Press Club that Democrats \u201cblew the opportunity the American people gave them\u201d by passing health reform in 2009 instead of policies to help the middle class. Several former Obama aides viewed the comments as cynical. Former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor tweeted:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TVietor08/status/537368813218451456\n\nFormer Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett wrote that cynicism has been Schumer\u2019s modus operandi forever.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jonlovett/status/537380538001412098\n\nJon Favreau, another former speechwriter, was also unimpressed.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/537372051195977728\n\nSchumer was also criticized by elected members of his party. \u201cWe come here to do a job, not keep a job,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement to CNN.\n\n6. David Axelrod vs. Hillary Clinton\n\nClinton, the former secretary of state, drew fire from Team Obama in August when, in an interview with the Atlantic, she criticized Obama\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d foreign policy. \u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\u201d she said.\n\nOf course, one of the complaints from the left against Clinton is that she\u2019s too hawkish, and she supported the Iraq War when she was a New York senator. Axelrod, a former Obama adviser, used that as the jumping point for one of the better subtweets of the year.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/499193669975834624\n\n7. Piers Morgan vs. everyone who hated his show\n\nPiers Morgan Tonight, the title-anchor\u2019s cancelled CNN show, had the unique ability of uniting people from all backgrounds ... in outrage. Morgan upset conservatives when he criticized America\u2019s support for guns in the wake of Sandy Hook, and offended the transgender community when he repeatedly referred to author Janet Mock as \u201cformerly a boy\u201d during an interview. The Mock backlash heated up when he tweeted that he was a victim of prejudice against people who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/431182316178665472\n\nBoth pro-gun conservatives and LGBT rights supporters were pleased when the network ended the show.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/437758203846074368https://twitter.com/allisonkilkenny/status/437748967410257920\n\nThe end of the show also stirred up the Larry King-Piers Morgan feud. In May, and again in August, King questioned the wisdom of replacing him with a \u201cBritisher,\u201d Talking Points Memo noted. Morgan responded by accusing King of ruining CNN\u2019s 9 p.m. ratings and the following:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/496312936475131904", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Arit John", "description": "The year in rants, feuds, unflattering BuzzFeed profiles and subtweets.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The year in rants, feuds, unflattering BuzzFeed profiles and subtweets.", "title": "The Best Political Twitter Fights of 2014", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-28/the-best-twitter-fights-of-2014", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iduSdWFm0U2g/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The year in rants, feuds, unflattering BuzzFeed profiles and subtweets.", "title": "The Best Political Twitter Fights of 2014", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-28/the-best-twitter-fights-of-2014", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iduSdWFm0U2g/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "The year in rants, feuds, unflattering BuzzFeed profiles and subtweets."}, "parsely-title": "The Best Political Twitter Fights of 2014", "parsely-tags": "Hillary Clinton,Superlatives,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NHAPK36JTSE801", "parsely-author": "Arit John", "date": "2014-12-28T14:00:03.308Z", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton,Superlatives", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton,Superlatives", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-28T14:00:03.308Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iduSdWFm0U2g/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-28/the-best-twitter-fights-of-2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1fe\"", "article_summary": "At the center of every good political feud is the sense that the participants are being more than a little petty and immature.\nhttps://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/437758203846074368https://twitter.com/allisonkilkenny/status/437748967410257920The end of the show also stirred up the Larry King-Piers Morgan feud.\nPiers Morgan vs. everyone who hated his showPiers Morgan Tonight, the title-anchor\u2019s cancelled CNN show, had the unique ability of uniting people from all backgrounds ... in outrage.\nIn that spirit, here are the seven best political feuds of 2014.\nBut they\u2019re fun to watch, especially when they play out on Twitter, where people tend to choose their words less carefully."}
