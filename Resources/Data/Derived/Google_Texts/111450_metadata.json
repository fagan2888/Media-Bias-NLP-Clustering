The research, led by Donna Kashian, assistant professor of biological sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Jeffrey Ram, professor of physiology in the School of Medicine, will work to identify these chemical cues released by algae and determine how they can be used to develop an ecological-scale control strategy to disrupt reproduction.\n\n\u201cOur preliminary research has demonstrated that algae produce chemicals that can stimulate or inhibit zebra and quagga mussels spawning,\u201d Kashian said. \u201cThe stimulatory chemicals may be the normal triggers of spawning that signal when conditions are amenable to larval development, whereas the inhibitory algal chemicals may be protective or toxic signals that prevent predation by mussel adults and larvae.\u201d\n\nBecause of this preliminary research, they are working to identify and deploy algal chemicals \u2014 which are potentially species-specific natural products \u2014 to regulate mussel reproduction to reduce their populations at ecosystem scales.\n\n\u201cInstead of focusing on toxic, non-specific chemicals to kill mussels, such as those used in water treatment facilities and power stations, we hope inhibit them by natural chemical cues released by algae that ultimately will disrupt reproduction,\u201d Kashian said.\n\nThe grant was funded through the USGS from the EPA\u2019s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative with a first year total of $135,000, and an anticipated overall total of nearly $320,000. The grant\u2019s cooperative agreement number is G14AC00017.\n\nhttp://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/23/the-top-five-obamacare-myths-debunked/198569", "article_metadata": {"description": "Foreign mussels hitchhiking to the Great Lakes in the ballast water tanks of international freighters are becoming one of the most vexing environmental problems facing the Great Lakes.
