This regional alignment is the first step in empowering Veterans to interact with one VA \u2013 MyVA,\u201d McDonald said in a statement.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this reform will improve the Veteran experience by enabling Veterans to more easily navigate VA and access their earned care and benefits,\u201d he added.\n\nThe VA today boasts nine organizational maps and at least a dozen websites, many of which require a separate login and password to access.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step in a journey,\u201d Bob Snyder, executive director of the MyVA Program Management Office, told reporters during a conference call.\n\nHe did not offer a price tag for the realignment, but he predicted the costs would be minimal since only the agency\u2019s Veterans Benefits Administration will have to hire additional staff.\n\nSnyder said the new structure will be in place by June 30.\n\nAn agency spokesman said others parts of the MyVA revamp, including a new chief customer service officer who will report directly to McDonald, are still being ironed out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still building the team,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The new framework divides the VA into five regions.", "description": "The new framework divides the VA into five regions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Matishak", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The new framework divides the VA into five regions.", "title": "VA rolls out regional framework amid reform", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/230742-va-rolls-out-new-regional-framework", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/230742-va-rolls-out-new-regional-framework", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-26T14:43-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,Veterans Affairs, VA", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-26T14:43:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/230742-va-rolls-out-new-regional-framework", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The new framework divides the VA into five regions.", "card": "summary", "title": "VA rolls out regional framework amid reform"}, "dcterms.title": "VA rolls out regional framework amid reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb22d\"", "article_summary": "This regional alignment is the first step in empowering Veterans to interact with one VA \u2013 MyVA,\u201d McDonald said in a statement.\n\u201cWe want every Veteran to have a seamless, integrated, and responsive VA customer service experience every time.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on Monday unveiled the first piece of an agencywide overhaul designed to provide better service to veterans.\nADVERTISEMENTThe agency, still working to get past last year\u2019s scandal over medical wait times, announced a new framework that divides the VA into five regions.\n\u201cUltimately, this reform will improve the Veteran experience by enabling Veterans to more easily navigate VA and access their earned care and benefits,\u201d he added."}
