He moved freely from one stage of his life to another, with sports the common thread.\n\nBut now there\u2019s a new challenge.\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s scary,\u201d Brown said last week. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have enough to do. I could get a high school coaching job, but I can\u2019t stand for any length of time.\u201d\n\nHe voiced his concern about adapting to a slower life two days before his final day on \u201cThe Irv and Joe Show\u201d with longtime co-host Joe Williams.\n\nA sizable group of fans came to a downtown restaurant to hear Brown sign off from the sports-talk show that has been a fixture for Denver audiences for 40 years. He leaves the programming at Mile High Sports radio.\n\nBrown signed off saying: \u201cThis is Irv Brown. You (the audience) make the show. Good night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Brown said of his decision to retire. He is 81 years old and having difficulty recovering fully from back surgery.\n\n\u201cOur show has been cut down to an hour, and I haven\u2019t been given the clearance to drive after the surgery. It was tough getting to where I had to go,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown\u2019s career made him one of the best known and accomplished sports figures in the Denver area. Sports Illustrated once ranked him among the top 50 sportsmen in Colorado.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be a coach,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe formed that desire during his playing days at Denver\u2019s North High School, where he earned seven letters, and at Colorado State College in Greeley, now the University of Northern Colorado, where he played on a College World Series team.\n\nHe coached baseball, football and basketball at Arvada High School. He continued at the University of Colorado as the head coach in baseball and an assistant coach in football. He also started and coached the baseball program at Metro State.\n\n\u201cCoaches weren\u2019t paid very well in those days, and I had to start something else,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe tried fundraising for CU but didn\u2019t last into the Chuck Fairbanks football coaching era.\n\nThen it was on to officiating college basketball and a transition to the media. One of his first jobs in the media was with the fledgling ESPN network.\n\n\u201cOfficiating college basketball was the most challenging thing I did,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut I also had a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBrown officiated six NCAA Tournament championship games.\n\nBrown also had time for the youngsters in the Denver area. In conjunction with a Nuggets program, he estimates he visited 100 schools each year and conducted a clinic on how to play basketball.\n\n\u201cIt was popular,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was free.\u201d\n\nBrown could fill his retirement hours with stories from his career. And he could start with this: UTEP basketball coach Don Haskins and Brown had ongoing barbs for each other. After the Miners lost a home game in El Paso that Brown officiated, creating an unfriendly crowd, he remembers Haskins saying, \u201cYou called a good game, but I want to see how you\u2019re going to get out of here.\u201d\n\nBrown had all the answers when convincing Metro State it should add a baseball program to its athletic department. Told the Division II school in Denver had nothing to offer for baseball, including a field, Brown said, \u201cI told them we\u2019d play all our games on the road and I\u2019d find a practice field. I told them I\u2019d even get some uniforms.\u201d\n\nBasketball coaches Bob Knight of Indiana and John Wooden of UCLA were different personalities. After officiating an NCAA championship game, Brown remembers Knight saying to him, \u201d \u2018Did you take too many baseballs in the head without wearing a helmet?\u2019 All Wooden wanted to talk about was baseball.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or @irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Irv Brown signs off of Denver sports-talk radio after 40 years", "title": "Irv Brown signs off of Denver sports-talk radio after 40 years", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/irv-brown-signs-off-of-denver-sports-talk-radio-after-40-years/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160409__BN20160410_Z00_BNSP10BROWN1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160409__BN20160410_Z00_BNSP10BROWN1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T15:18:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T13:11:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Anyone who knows Irv Brown just a little bit would understand why he is looking ahead to retirement years with apprehension.\nBrown signed off saying: \u201cThis is Irv Brown.\nAnd he could start with this: UTEP basketball coach Don Haskins and Brown had ongoing barbs for each other.\nThe Irv Brown they know had an amazing career over the last 60 years that was nonstop and varied from coaching to basketball officiating to being a radio personality.\n\u201cI always wanted to be a coach,\u201d Brown said."}
