(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nWhat must Mitch McConnell be thinking?\n\nWe\u2019re on the eve of Super Tuesday and Donald Trump \u2013 DONALD TRUMP \u2013 appears to be poised to be running away with the Republican nomination.\n\nTrump has 82 delegates to Ted Cruz\u2019s 17 delegates to Marco Rubio\u2019s 16 delegates. The others are even further behind.\n\nWith Super Tuesday coming up with 595 delegates at stake and Trump doing well in the polls, and then a few more contests including Kentucky\u2019s caucus, and then a chunk of winner-take-all primaries a couple of weeks later ...\n\nFolks, this may be over soon.\n\nNow, McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader with among the best poker faces east of the Pecos River, isn\u2019t saying anything about the presidential primary other than somebody, anybody, in his opinion, would be better than Barack Obama.\n\nThat\u2019s the signal he\u2019s sending, at least, when he refuses to even consider whoever Obama nominates to the U.S. Supreme Court to replace the late Antonin Scalia. His argument: A president shouldn\u2019t be able to have confirmed a Supreme Court nominee in the last year of a term.\n\nMcConnell has been mum on an endorsement.\n\nBut as Lady Bird Johnson once said, \u201cTwitter is the window to man\u2019s soul,\u201d (or it was something like that) we might be getting an idea what he thinks by the tweets of his former aids.\n\nOn Thursday, McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff and re-election guru Josh Holmes retweeted a Fox News poll that showed Rubio, Cruz and John Kasich all beating Hillary Clinton nationally while Trump trails the former secretary of state by five percentage points.\n\nHe also retweeted a story in the Washington Free Beacon with this headline on Friday: \u201cChris Christie Endorses Trump After Calling Him \u2018Guy Who\u2019s Playing Make-Believe on Television.\u2019\u201d\n\nScott Douglas, another former McConnell aide, tweeted this about New Jersey Chris Christie\u2019s surprise endorsement of Trump: \u201cTrump endorsement shows that @ChrisChristie political career has been one long con. No regard for our Country or Party. #ConArtist\"\n\nAnd he posted this: \u201cOne #ConMan supports another. @ChrisChristie is a disgrace to the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nScott Jennings, who runs the McConnell super PAC \u201cKentuckians for Strong Leadership,\u201d spent the Republican debate Thursday retweeting jabs at Trump for citing as proof of support for the Israeli government the fact that he was grand marshal of New York City\u2019s Israel Day parade a few years ago.\n\nAnd McConnell\u2019s biographer John David Dyche said in two tweets, \u201cChristie's endorsement of Trump reminds me of Plato's comment on the friends of despots at Gorgias 510 B where Socrates observes that: Despots cannot befriend betters, whom they fear, or inferiors, whom they despise, but only men of like character, who truckle to them.\u201d\n\n1/2: Christie's endorsement of Trump reminds me of Plato's comment on the friends of despots at Gorgias 510 B where Socrates observes that: \u2014 John David Dyche (@jddyche) February 27, 2016\n\n2/2: Despots cannot befriend betters, whom they fear, or inferiors, whom they despise, but only men of like character, who truckle to them. \u2014 John David Dyche (@jddyche) February 27, 2016\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily express McConnell\u2019s thoughts on the issue of Trump, but it, at the very least, reflects the thoughts of those who are of like minds with him \u2013 and McConnell isn\u2019t known for surrounding himself with people who stray far away.\n\nWe're to a point where you might suspect that even a Cruz nomination would be preferable to McConnell. I can't believe I just typed that.\n\nMcConnell can\u2019t say any of this himself, however. What\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s rise is the disgust people in his party have for what is going on in Washington. McConnell is the embodiment of Washington and interjecting himself into such a race would inflame passions even more.\n\nA Republican last week told me that this is all Barack Obama\u2019s fault; that he\u2019s the one who created this movement within the GOP that despises establishment politicians because of the way he has governed.\n\nObama hasn\u2019t helped matters with policy decisions and with his attitude that has become snarkier toward Republicans as he has run into roadblock after roadblock, but McConnell is hardly blameless.\n\nSeven years of enduring obstruction has made our country\u2019s government more than dysfunctional.\n\nSeven years of enduring attacks on a Democratic president \u2013 even when he puts forward a Republican idea like the individual health care mandate \u2013 stokes an anger that in the end becomes difficult, even impossible, to control.\n\nIf Trump winds up as the Republican nominee, the establishment GOP has no one to blame but itself.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at 502-582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
