In my first AARP Bulletin column in October, I wrote that I would be unapologetic in fighting for the wants and needs of people 50-plus, and that I need you to be fearless with me. So, what does that mean?

Since early 2012, we have engaged Americans in a conversation about the future of Social Security and Medicare. Millions of you responded by telling us that you rely on Social Security and Medicare for financial and health security — and that you want these programs to remain strong, not just for yourselves but for your kids and grandkids.

As one AARP member in Georgia wrote, "I am 84 years old, and both Medicare and Social Security have served me well. I want the same for my children. There has to be a way to make both work for them." Therein lies the challenge — making these programs work for them.
