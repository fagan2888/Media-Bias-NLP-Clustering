Twenty-nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Trump, compared to just eight percent for his closest challenger, Marco Rubio.\n\nHowever, according to national polls the Democratic nominee, likely Clinton, would be the frontrunner.\n\nAnother poll released Aug. 26 indicated the race for governor in the Democratic primary is almost tied between Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, D-Marshall, and Jim Justice, billionaire coal baron and owner of The Greenbrier Resort.\n\nThe poll was conducted by Prism Surveys August 21 of voters who were likely to vote given vote history and who also indicated when asked if they were very likely to vote in next year\u2019s Democratic primary. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.21 percent.\n\nThe IVR poll of 900 completed surveys shows the informed vote to be 28 percent for Justice and 26 percent for Kessler. Voters were told that some people were concerned about Kessler\u2019s proposal to raise cigarette taxes and his support of gay marriage and the legalization of medical marijuana. Justice was defined as a coal baron whose mines have dozens of safety violations that are often unpaid as well as vendors and workers not being paid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased, but not surprised by the poll results,\u201d Kessler said in a news release from his campaign office. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that when given the facts about each candidate, voters wouldn\u2019t be swayed by money and celebrities. As I continue campaigning and talking to people about real issues and real solutions facing real West Virginians my message and support will continue to grow. Our future needs a decisive plan of action, not just meaningless declarations of love for the state.\u201d\n\nSenate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer, is running for governor as the Republican candidate.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "As Mountain State residents are flooded with news of who is throwing their hat in the ring for the governor\u2019s office in 2016, there is another important election gaining attention.
