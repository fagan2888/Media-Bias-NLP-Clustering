Weight Watchers, nutritionists \u2014 she had tried them all in vain. A physician like Dr. Kaplan, she reasoned, might be the only one left who could help her. \u201cI\u2019m really tired of it,\u201d the woman said one recent afternoon, declining to give her name to a reporter. \u201cI feel like something is off with me.\u201d\n\nDr. Kaplan, a leader in the medical weight-loss industry, nodded sympathetically, interjecting questions that ranged from what she typically ate for breakfast (protein shake) to whether she felt depressed (sometimes). By the end of the 50-minute session, the woman had chosen Dr. Kaplan\u2019s most expensive weight-loss plan: $1,199 for six weeks\u2019 worth of meal-replacement products, counseling and vitamin supplements.\n\nThen he delivered some good news: Her insurance would probably reimburse her for at least a small portion of the bill, thanks to a provision in the federal health care law that requires insurers to pay for nutrition and obesity screening.\n\nThe news was pleasing to the patient. But it has also created a financial opportunity for a corner of the diet industry that has often operated on the fringe of the medical establishment: for-profit diet clinics overseen by doctors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a game changer,\u201d said John LaRosa, research director at Marketdata Enterprises, who has studied the weight-loss industry for more than 20 years.\n\nMr. LaRosa estimates that medical weight-loss programs, which include those run by hospitals as well as clinics, bring in $1 billion annually and that the market will grow about 5 percent a year through 2019.\n\nThe prospects are so lucrative that in March, Mr. LaRosa sponsored a seminar advising entrepreneurs how to open their own weight-loss clinics to take advantage of the new stream of insurance coverage.\n\nAnd Dr. Kaplan recently started a consulting business to teach primary-care doctors how to bill insurers for obesity treatments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a rapid expansion mode as a result of the insurance companies covering obesity treatment,\u201d Dr. Kaplan said. He estimated that a doctor could earn as much as $3,000 more a year for each obese patient, according to promotional materials for his new company, Obesity Management Systems.\n\nBut the prospect of rapid growth in the diet-clinic industry, fed by insurance payments, has exposed deep philosophical differences on the best ways to help patients lose weight.\n\nObesity specialists at major medical centers say the proprietors of diet clinics often employ unproven tactics \u2014 like vitamin injections, costly supplements and extreme diet plans \u2014 that lure customers but do not lead to lasting results. Diet-clinic owners contend that they are filling a needed role because the mainstream medical establishment pays little attention to patients\u2019 struggles with weight.\n\nPhoto\n\nMeanwhile, Americans keep piling on the pounds. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified obesity \u2014 defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 as a disease, and solving the obesity epidemic came to be viewed as one of the nation\u2019s most pressing public health challenges. Beyond the federal requirement that insurers cover obesity screening, many states go further, requiring coverage that ranges from basic counseling to weight-loss surgery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSustained weight loss is notoriously difficult to achieve. Lasting results require long-term care and follow-up, said Michael D. Jensen, the director of the obesity treatment research program at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who has studied the effectiveness of weight-loss programs.\n\n\u201cIt just takes most people so long to make permanent changes in eating or activity habits,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always this search for the quick fix, and usually you can find somebody who\u2019s willing to sell it to you.\u201d\n\nDr. Pieter A. Cohen, a primary-care doctor at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said several of his patients had used such clinics, only to return to him in frustration. \u201cMy clinical experience is that at least nine out of 10 patients who do these kinds of diets don\u2019t just regain the weight, but go up again,\u201d he said.\n\nFew clinics follow patients long enough to demonstrate their programs\u2019 effectiveness, although they point to individual success stories and say they do offer comprehensive behavioral counseling. Some are trying to improve treatment standards by employing doctors with backgrounds in obesity and certified nutritionists, while recommending only evidence-based treatments. And they say they offer real options to patients who have been shunned by mainstream medical providers.\n\n\u201cDoctors \u2014 even my own doctor \u2014 they would just say, \u2018Stay under X calories and get lots of sleep and get lots of water,\u2019 \u201d said Cris Cawley, chief executive of Thinique, a small medical weight-loss chain based in Texas. \u201cBut that\u2019s really difficult.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150704193252, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to pay for nutrition and obesity screening, and
