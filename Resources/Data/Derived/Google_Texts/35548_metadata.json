Another doctor, meanwhile, worked to extract a piece of her fibula that would be fitted like a puzzle piece into the space where her jaw\n\nonce was.\n\nThe goal was to remove the growth and create a new, fully functioning jaw, a feat that once took three operations over 18 months and left some patients with trouble chewing and disfigurement. But the doctors at NYU Langone had pioneered a new approach, one they dubbed \u201cjaw in a day.\u201d The tool that made it possible: not a scalpel, but a 3-D printer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift in the way of doing surgery,\u201d said Dr. Jamie Levine, chief of microsurgery at NYU Langone, and one of the surgeons who worked on Stern. \u201cThere was a need for it to be more precise.\u201d\n\nMore from Crain's: Bionic hands, synthetic bones. 3-D printing powers medical innovation.\n\n\n\nThe Institute for Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at NYU Langone is one of a growing number of New York hospital departments that have embraced the use of 3-D printing, in which materials such as plastic or titanium powder are \u00adexuded, layer by layer, to create objects: \u00adjewelry, kitchen utensils or, say, a new trachea.\n\nThe surgeons at NYU Langone use the printers to better plan and execute complex procedures like Stern\u2019s with more precision and predictability, ultimately saving hours in the operating room and $20,000 to $30,000 per reconstruction.\n\nThe promise of 3-D printing is a world of science fiction come to life: Headlines from 2015 included the first 3-D-printed nose in the U.S., created by a doctor at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.\n\nLast year also saw Food and Drug Administration approval for 3-D-printed pills and vertebrae. Designs for bionic hands are now available for free on the Internet, and researchers from around the world are experimenting with organs printed from living cells.\n\nThe genius of 3-D printing is that, unlike traditional manufacturing, complex objects are not more expensive to make; they do not require unique molds or multiple machines. The cost of any object is determined simply by the amount of printing material used and the time needed to design it on a computer.\n\nMedical-grade printers are expensive, some costing upward of $200,000. But one printer can make an infinite number of objects customized to each individual\u2019s anatomy. And the cost of printers is starting to come down. A Philadelphia company called BioBots made waves last year by releasing a $10,000 bioprinter, which it offered for $5,000 to scientists for testing.\n\nIn Stern\u2019s case, her doctors designed a metal plate and plastic surgical guides\u2014indicating where to cut or drill\u2014based on a digital 3-D model of her skull made from CAT-scan images. The pieces were manufactured by 3D Systems, a South Carolina company whose founder, Chuck Hull, patented the first 3-D printer in 1986. Though 3D Systems would not disclose its costs, the plastic in each of Stern\u2019s surgical guides retails for just a few dollars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole secret of 3-D printing,\u201d said Katherine Weimer, vice president of \u00admedical devices at 3D Systems. \u201cComplexity is free.\u201d\n\nDespite the potential for innovation, medical 3-D printing, as Stern learned, is only just beginning to be adopted in New York. Stern received her initial diagnosis from an oral surgeon who was unaware of 3-D printing\u2019s advances, telling her that her only option was a lengthy, three-surgery ordeal. During much of that time, he said, Stern would be left with a seriously diminished set of teeth.\n\nThe prospect gave the usually calm 38-year-old special-education teacher an uncharacteristic dose of anxiety.\n\n\u201cIf I could get through one surgery, I would still have to get through the next and the next,\u201d said Stern, thinking back on the prognosis 18 months later in her apartment on the Upper West Side. \u201cMy life would have been destroyed for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe cost of the machines is only one hurdle to wider adoption of 3-D printing. The learning curve of mastering the design software is steep, and doctors need to spend extra time planning the surgery and designing the tools they\u2019ll need to execute it.\n\nThe health industry is also mired in regulatory, cultural and institutional challenges that preclude rapid change. The pioneers in this field are finding that insurance companies, as well as patients and doctors, must be made to understand the value of 3-D-printed devices in order to factor them into reimbursement rates. A priority for 3D Systems is conducting studies with institutions to prove that 3-D printing can improve health outcomes and save money.\n\nAs doctors have found more uses for 3-D printing over the past decade, they have influenced the materials developed by companies such as 3D Systems and Stratasys, the parent company of Brooklyn-based MakerBot, which manufactures lower-cost desktop 3-D printers.\n\nA few years ago, there were only plastics, which could be printed into custom prosthetics and manipulated into patient-specific surgical tools. Then, titanium powder was loaded into 3-D printers to produce custom implants. Now mixed materials are opening up new possibilities.\n\nThe Feinstein Institute for Medical Research on Long Island is experimenting with something MakerBot calls \u00adlimestone. The material is actually a composite of organic plastic and calcium carbonate that together mimics bone. More-flexible materials that can act as other body parts are also in the works.\n\nTo gain FDA approval, any 3-D-printed material or device that comes into contact with patients must be capable of being sterilized. It can be a challenging process.\n\n\u201cSome materials go through something in the 3-D printing process that makes them nonsterile,\u201d said Weimer of 3D Systems. But she said FDA approval for 3-D-printed products is becoming more common.\n\nSome New York hospitals are hoping to speed up the pace of adoption\u2014and plant the seed for more homegrown innovation\u2014by creating in-house 3-D printing centers where experienced users can assist novices.\n\nWithin hospitals, 3-D printing capabilities can vary widely by department. Two medical units at NYU Langone have their own printers, while Levine and his team collaborate with 3D Systems, using the company\u2019s printers and software. Other departments don\u2019t use the technology at all.\n\nDr. Oren Tepper, director of craniofacial surgery at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, has been using the technology since 2007 and, like Levine, outsources his printing needs to 3D Systems. Now, however, he is in talks with Montefiore about creating a 3-D printing center on-site that would be widely accessible to physicians at the hospital.\n\n\u201cI think the main limitation of 3-D printing is not functionality or cost but awareness of what can be done,\u201d Tepper said. \u201cThe majority of health care workers don\u2019t even have the knowledge that this technology exists.\u201d\n\nStern herself was only vaguely aware of 3-D printing before her diagnosis in March 2014 of a benign but fast-growing tumor called an ameloblastoma. While researching second opinions, she found Levine and his team of surgeons at NYU Langone and was soon buoyed by the doctors\u2019 confidence and the \u201cafter\u201d pictures they showed her of previous patients.\n\nStern\u2019s jaw-in-a-day surgery began early one May morning in 2014. Her parents and sister bided their time in the waiting room as the surgical team removed her jaw and cut the bone from her leg.\n\nCareful digital planning and the 3-D-printed cutting guides FedExed to them by 3D Systems allowed her doctors to work simultaneously, knowing that everything would match up in the end. The implant carved from her leg fit her jaw perfectly. The same was true of the titanium plate the surgeons had designed to hold Stern\u2019s new jaw in place.\n\nBefore 3-D printing entered the equation, there was a lot more \u201ceyeballing,\u201d according to Levine. He couldn\u2019t go into the operating room with a metal plate the exact size and shape he needed. Instead, he had to manipulate the standard pieces of metal he had on hand while the patient was sedated.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, sitting in the O.R. with a set of pliers to make [the plate] fit the jaw is somewhat time-consuming,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Ceradini, associate director of microsurgery at NYU Langone, who also helped develop the jaw-in-a-day procedure. If the placement of the plate or jaw implant were just a few millimeters off, the patient could suffer.\n\nInto the jaw implant, the surgeons inserted the screws that would secure Stern\u2019s new dentures. For this, they used a drilling guide, which is really just a few centimeters of plastic that aids in the placement of a screw hole. Still, it\u2019s a piece of plastic that Levine and Ceradini insist makes all the difference by eliminating guesswork that could lead to costly complications.\n\nWhen Stern left the operating room after 12 hours, disoriented because it was dark outside, her sister turned pale. \u201cIs that Zeesy?\u201d she asked her father. Stern\u2019s face was severely swol-len. She had to spend a week in the hospital, being fed through a tube in her throat. Afterward, Stern spent two months at her parents\u2019 house, embarrassed to go outside because she had yet to receive her dentures.\n\nThree months post-op, though, she was back at work. Despite the chunk of bone missing from her leg, she was running after kids at the special-education preschool she works at near Central Park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be a little stiff,\u201d said Stern, touching her jawline. She has a faint scar on her throat where her feeding tube had been inserted, and a slight indentation to the left of her chin\u2014both of which she has to point out to people for them to notice.\n\nSince her surgery, Stern\u2019s doctors have \u00adcontinued to refine their methods. They are now able to fit a patient\u2019s dentures on the day of surgery. Soon, Ceradini said, the dentures will be 3-D-\u00adprinted as well.\n\nWithin a decade, Levine predicts, 3-D \u00adprinters will be as common as CAT scans, which, in 1995, were just as novel as 3-D printers are now. His colleague Ceradini agrees. \u201cLooking down the road 10 years, having a 3-D printer that\u2019s in the office or in the clinic will become the new mainstay,\u201d he said, \u201cas opposed to having one company that prints these things and FedExes them to you the next day.\u201d\n\nCorrection: Zeesy Stern works at a special-education preschool near Central Park.
