Our round-up of state blogs will follow on Saturday afternoon.\n\nPresident Obama, the Democratic Party, and the GOP\n\nThis week in response to an online position posted on the White House\u2019s website, President Obama\u2019s Senior Advisor, Valerie Jarrett, stated that the administration would support a federal ban on \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 treatments for homosexuals. Hit & Run comments on Friday that it would be very dangerous for the federal government to declare which therapies were legal. On Wednesday, Daily Kos reports on comments from former Vice-President, Dick Cheney, who has recently stated that Obama is the \u2018worst president that we ever had\u2019, and that the nuclear deal agreed with Iran late last week would be a \u2018terrible burden\u2019 for the next president. The Lonely Conservative writes that the federal judge in Texas, Andrew S. Hana, who had issued an order halting President Obama\u2019s amnesty executive order, has this week ruled against a motion by the administration that sought for the halt to be lifted.\n\nMoving on to the Democratic Party more generally, on Tuesday, Townhall says that the Democrats are the \u2018party of lies\u2019, and discusses how senior Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have lied or misled the public in recent months and years. They write that these Democrats should either be thrown in prison for their lies or should forfeit their government pensions. National Journal looks this week at what they say is the Democratic Party\u2019s \u2018identity politics\u2019 problem. They comment that one of the reasons why Hillary Clinton has a \u2018near-lock\u2019 on the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination is because the party is now dependent on a coalition of \u2018less-reliable voters\u2019 with \u2018non-traditional candidates\u2019. This week also saw Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel re-elected with nearly 56 percent of the vote compared to just over 44 percent for his challenger Jesus \u2018Chuy\u2019 Garcia. American Thinker says that Garcia\u2019s relative success (given that he was mostly unknown until now) shows that the Democratic Party will have to deal with the growing power of the Hispanic vote.\n\nLooking at the Republican Party, Daily Kos writes on Saturday that the GOP should take lessons from the Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence after he found himself at the \u2018crossroads of a culture war\u2019 over that state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). They say that Pence\u2019s slow reaction to the controversy has effectively killed any presidential ambitions that he might have had, and that being against rights for gay people is now \u2018suicide\u2019 for any potential GOP candidate. On Friday, Wonkblog looks at the Republican Party\u2019s economic strategy, commenting that it is from the \u201890s \u2013 the 1890s that is. They say that the GOP\u2019s tactic of trying to stop the Federal Reserve from keeping interest rates low or buying bonds with newly printed money is bad economics, and that their constant concern about inflation is a throwback to the Reagan era.\n\nElections and the road to 2016\n\nAs the 2016 presidential campaign continues to unfold some commentators have argued that the former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, has an advantage over his likely Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton in winning the Electoral College, because the GOP looks to have an advantage in key states like Florida and Ohio. Political Animal says the evidence behind this claim is weak since even with those states behind Bush, the Democrats still have a \u2018gigantic blue firewall\u2019 of states that will vote for their candidate in 2016. In other Jeb Bush news this week, Daily Kos reports on Monday that he identified himself as Hispanic on a Florida voter-registration application form in 2009.\n\nOn Sunday, the Monkey Cage looks at what some have said may be a potential problem for the Governor of Wisconsin, and potential presidential candidate, Scott Walker \u2013 his dog allergy. They say that while some are concerned that American voters may be against a candidate that isn\u2019t dog-friendly, recent research does not bear this out. Compared to the Democrats\u2019 presidential bench, the Republican field is massive, with the best part of a dozen candidates likely to throw their hats into the ring, with a couple having already done so. This week Talking Points Memo asserts that despite the size of the GOP field, the race is between Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, because of their political experience and current lack of scandal.\n\nOn Monday, Political Animal discusses Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), one of the GOP\u2019s wide presidential field who has actually declared his intention to run for the presidency. They say that Cruz is \u2018hell-bent\u2019 on pushing for the allegiance of conservative evangelicals with new television commercials timed for the Easter weekend and slated to air during Christian-themed programming. Red State meanwhile reports that Cruz has been able to raise $31 million in the space of a week via Political Action Committees, which means that he should be able to raise enough to compete in the presidential primary season.\n\nThe big 2016 news this week was of course Senator Rand Paul\u2019s (R-KY) announcement that he would be pursuing the GOPs nomination for the presidency. On Tuesday, after the announcement, Wonkblog has a brief guide to what Paul actually believes, including being against government surveillance and against federal government intrusion into locally elected school boards\u2019 authority over classrooms. Rand Paul is the son of Ron Paul, who ran for the presidency in 2008 and 2012. FiveThirtyEight writes this week that the younger Paul is losing his father\u2019s base in an effort to seem more mainstream than his father was. Still on Paul, Hit & Run gives five things we need to know about his campaign, including that his strategy is built around appealing to those who don\u2019t normally vote Republican such as young people and minorities, and that he is taking donations in Bitcoin.\n\nTurning to the Democratic side of the presidential race, Townhall gives five things that Republicans need to do in order to beat Hillary Clinton. These include tying Clinton to Barack Obama and his unpopular approach to governing, as well as not allowing Clinton to be portrayed by the media as a victim of the GOP\u2019s \u2018war on women\u2019. On Friday Red State writes that Clinton\u2019s lead against many GOP candidates, including Rand Paul is melting away. They also comment on the announcement by the Democratic Governor of Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee, that he will launch a presidential exploratory committee; saying that he would be a \u2018joy\u2019 to run against, given that he is a Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democrat. Hit & Run meanwhile wonders where all the Democratic candidates for president are. None of this may actually matter very much at the moment, given that according to new research, reported by Outside the Beltway, most people aren\u2019t actually taking any notice of the 2016 campaign yet.\n\nGovernment, the Beltway and Congress\u2019 agenda\n\nOn Monday, The Daily Signal reports that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has lost a \u2018procedural battle\u2019 in an Ohio court fight. They say that a federal judge has granted a motion to compel the IRS to produce the names of 298 conservative organizations that were targeted by IRS official Lois Lerner and her colleagues.\n\nMoving to the judiciary, Crooks & Liars writes on Tuesday that the Supreme Court has refused (for now) to rule on North Carolina\u2019s GOP-backed voting restrictions that may influence the 2016 election. The state had asked the Court to uphold the restrictions, which eliminate same day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting, after a federal appeals court ruled in October that they may have violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nThis week The Daily Signal gives 26 economic policy reforms that they say could get passed by Congress. These cover tax policy, energy reforms (such as ending the crude oil export ban), ending the current Washington-centric approach to transport funding, and adopting a path to a balanced budget with a resolution. Harry Reid\u2019s recent announcement that he would not be seeking reelection in 2016 has reopened the debate in the Senate over nuclear waste disposal (Reid had long been opposed to disposing of such waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada), writes Roll Call.\n\nOn Thursday, Wonkblog assesses a recent idea from Senator Rand Paul \u2013 that members of Congress should be term limited in much the same way that the President is. They sat that while it could give individual lawmakers more freedom, it could also expand the power of the presidency as there would be fewer established legislative coalitions.\n\nForeign policy, defense and trade\n\nDiscussion on last week\u2019s framework agreement with Iran over that county\u2019s nuclear program continued this week, with Informed Comment asking if any of the Republican Party\u2019s frontrunners for the presidential nomination have a policy on the Iran that excludes sanctions and bombs, as they have mostly all come out against the deal. One member of the GOP who is most definitely not in favor of the agreement is Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) who, according to Freak Our Nation, stated this week that military action against Iran would not have to be in the form of all-out war, rather it could be a four-day bombing campaign like 1999\u2019s Operation Desert Fox against Iraq. Daily Kos meanwhile writes that President Obama has three months to make a formal agreement with Iran, and then sell it to the public, many of whom are skeptical.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hit & Run casts their eye on what they say is the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy civil war. They say that Senator Rand Paul, who has generally been against increasing America\u2019s foreign involvements, has been shifting towards a more orthodox GOP approach.\n\nObamacare and health policy\n\nOn Monday, The Daily Signal has a chart explaining what they say is Obamacare\u2019s \u2018$800 billion tax hike\u2019. They say because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans will be paying this much more in 18 separate tax increases between now and 2022. Lonely Conservative meanwhile writes that Obamacare\u2019s costs are falling on ordinary consumers who have more expensive policies with higher deductibles than before.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wonkblog previews what they say is the coming revolution in how employers provide health insurance coverage. They comment that as workers are being asked to pay more for employer-sponsored health plans, more and more are moving over to privately run health insurance exchanges where employees can select their own plans.\n\nWith Tax Day only a few days away, The Hill\u2019s Congress blog examines the plight of immigrants who have been barred from purchasing health insurance from the Obamacare insurance marketplaces, but may still end up paying the Obamacare lack of coverage penalty because of confusion about the exemption rules.\n\nThe economy and society\n\nThis week, Daily Kos reports that initial applications for unemployment compensation remain at a 15-year low, with 281,000 for the week ending April 4th. They say that the low figure is deceptive since congressional Republicans in December 2013 refused to renew federal emergency unemployment compensation, which chopped more than 1.3 million from the compensation rolls.\n\nOn Sunday, The Daily Signal looks at why colleges in the U.S. are afraid of letting students speak freely, and blames the rise of political correctness which they say makes debate impossible.\n\nHit & Run says that according to a new poll a majority of voters in three swing states, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, support the legalisation of marijuana.\n\nThe weekend saw the shooting of a fleeing unarmed black man by a white policeman in South Carolina, which was captured on video by a bystander. The Daily Signal writes that the shooting has reignited the debate over police body cameras, and that bills to introduce them would be voted on in the South Carolina legislature in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, The Federalist has a stunning map of forty years of capital punishment in the U.S., in the wake of the conviction of Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who could face the death penalty. On Wednesday, Wonkblog reports that nearly 1 in 10 Americans have sever anger issues, and access to guns.\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\nOn Tuesday D.C was in the dark, after a massive power outage, says Crooks & Liars, which also led to a State Department briefing using phone lights to identify reporters asking questions.\n\nRand Paul\u2019s presidential announcement was slightly mired on Tuesday when the video of his speech was taken down by YouTube. The video began with the song, \u201cShuttin\u2019 Detroit Down\u201d which was automatically flagged as a copyright violation by YoutTube, reports Hit & Run.\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USApp\u2013 American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1D2Mijd", "article_metadata": {"description": "USApp Managing Editor,\u00a0Chris Gilson looks at the best in political blogging from around the Beltway.
