John McCain is going on the air this week with an ad attacking Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, his likely Democratic opponent in this year's Arizona election, over her support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn McCain's first television commercial of the campaign, an announcer ticks off recent problems with President Barack Obama's signature health-care law and says, \"Obamacare is failing Arizonans\" before knocking Kirkpatrick for bragging about voting for the 2010 legislation.\n\n\u201cThe Obamacare system is collapsing and tens of thousands of Arizonans are being forced to find new health-care coverage and brace themselves for higher premiums next year,\u201d McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said in a written statement to The Arizona Republic. \u201cDemocrat Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick\u2019s continued support of the failed health-care system shows she is nothing more than a rubber-stamp for President Obama and the liberal establishment.\"\n\nThe ad is set to run Tuesday through May 23 on Phoenix broadcast television stations.\n\nD.B. Mitchell, a Kirkpatrick campaign spokesman, responded by noting that the McCain campaign also was running a web ad against former state Sen. Kelli Ward of Lake Havasu City, one of three GOP challengers McCain expects to face in the Aug. 30 Senate primary.\n\n\u201cToday, Arizonans woke up to not one but two attack ads from John McCain, who is clearly running scared in both his primary and in the general election,\" Mitchell said in an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic. \"McCain's tired old attacks about Obamacare are nothing new \u2014 and once again he disregards the thousands of Arizonans who now have health coverage because of the ACA and its Medicaid expansion. McCain's cheap attack on Ann is completely out of touch with the needs of these families because he's spent the last 33 years in Washington.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Kirkpatrick campaign is preparing to launch a series of bilingual videos designed to remind Latino voters of McCain's much-discussed 2010 \"danged fence\" border-security TV ad.\n\nNowicki is The Republic's national political reporter.
