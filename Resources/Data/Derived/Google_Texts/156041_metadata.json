Bush-era interrogation tactics of suspected terrorists, calling the Democratic-fueled discussion little more than political theatrics.\n\nOr, in his words: The report\u2019s \u201cjust a crock,\u201d Mr. Cheney said, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cWhat I keep hearing out there is they portray this as a rogue operation, and the agency was way out of bounds and then they lied about it,\u201d Mr. Cheney said, during a phone interview with The New York Times. \u201cI think that\u2019s all a bunch of hooey. The program was authorized. The agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program.\u201d\n\nHis comments came just hours before the Senate intelligence committee is poised to release summary findings of a report that likens the Bush-era interrogation techniques as torture. The report is also believed to contain text that alleges the CIA misled lawmakers about the value of such techniques to actually get information from the suspects, The Hill reported.\n\nMr. Cheney said the techniques used by the Bush White House \u2014 like water boarding \u2014 were \u201cabsolutely, totally justified,\u201d and hardly akin to torture.\n\n\u201cThey deserve a lot of praise,\u201d he said, referring to the CIA, The Hill reported. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, they ought to be decorated, not criticized.\u201d\n\nHe also said that waterboarding and similar tactics were the \u201cright thing[s] to do, and if I had to do it over again, I would do it. When we had that program in place, we kept the country safe from any more mass casualty attacks, which was our objective,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\nAnd his thoughts on why Democrats want the report publicized now?\n\nThey\u2019re trying toy rewrite history, he said, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cIt occurs to me it was a sort of a cover for those on the Democratic side who were briefed on the program, but then were subsequently embarrassed to admit that and so are going back to construct a rationale to say, \u2018They didn\u2019t tell us the truth,\u2019 \u201d he said, The Hill reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney took preemptive action on the looming release of a report that takes a look at President George W.
