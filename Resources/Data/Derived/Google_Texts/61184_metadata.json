With about 20,000 of these residents in buildings it owns, NCS is the largest affordable senior housing provider in the nation. Now, National Church Residences is rolling out the Care Guide program to residents its four continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) and other health care properties, including assisted living centers.\n\nRicketts recently spoke with SHN about the nuts and bolts of the program and how the pre-acute focus already is making National Church Residences stand out to hospitals, health insurers and other crucial referral sources.\n\nGoing Proactive\n\nNational Church Residences has long touted the fact that it has a social worker embedded in each of its independent living apartment facilities, who would help coordinate services for the residents. However, changes that have swept the U.S. health care system since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act prompted National Church Residences to reevaluate how the social workers were functioning and what their full potential could be.\n\nSpecifically, the ACA incentivized population health management. That boils down to Medicare and Medicaid providers such as hospitals and health systems seeing their payments tied to how well they can manage the health of the seniors they see, being rewarded financially by helping patients avoiding costly events such as hospitalizations. Senior care organizations have emerged as important players in this effort.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to activate our seniors in self-care, asking how can we work with seniors to let them know what contributes to better health, so they don\u2019t have unnecessary trips to the emergency room and have expensive health care interventions,\u201d says Ricketts. \u201cIf I can help you get access to physical therapy, manage diabetes, etc., we\u2019ll have an overall lower cost of care.\u201d\n\nHelping seniors access these types of services has been a focus for National Church Residences for years, Ricketts adds. But now health insurers\u2014such as managed care organizations that are actively trying to lower costs while improving outcomes\u2014are much more interested in working with the company on this effort.\n\nWhen thinking about how to take its population health management to the next level, National Church Residences realized that enabling social workers to be more proactive would make a huge difference.\n\n\u201cWe asked social workers, \u2018Who are you helping?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Anyone who walks down to our office,\u2019\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cWe wanted to change that.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Ricketts and other National Church Residences leaders wanted to arm their social workers with data about residents, so that the social workers could reach out to those people at greatest risk of a hospitalization or other adverse health event.\n\nEnter: Care Guide\n\nThe objective that National Church Residences settled on was ambitious: assessing every one of the residents at its affordable housing buildings. To accomplish this, it implemented Care Guide, a tool that encompasses various types of evaluations, such as the Mini Mental Status Exam and Geriatric Depression Scale.\n\nThe online system launched in pilot phase at 15 locations in May 2013 and rolled out company-wide in the following months. Now, Care Guide is being used with 30,082 residents in National Church Residences-owned buildings and those it staffs.\n\nThe results stratify residents into three categories. Between 60% and 70% of respondents were categorized as healthy and living well, but 7% of seniors were identified as at high risk of having a hospitalization within 12 months.\n\nWith the goal of keeping these high-risk seniors out of the hospital, National Church Residences\u2019 social workers are intervening on many fronts, including checking in on their medication adherence, checking on whether family members have been in touch, assessing their apartments for fall risks, and determining whether they\u2019ve had a flu shot.\n\n\u201cThat 7% of the population is getting an incredible amount of social work,\u201d Ricketts says.\n\nBecause the success of the program hinges on the social worker, National Church Residences is holding these workers to a high standard, he adds. One of the social workers\u2019 duties is connecting seniors with the community resources they need, such as home health. National Church Residences owns and operates its own home health organizations in Ohio and Florida, and works with outside providers in other markets.\n\nPartly because of the Care Guide push, National Church Residences now is building up relationships with top home health and home care companies around the country, to make them preferred providers and help facilitate the process of connecting seniors with services. It should help ease the process for social workers, who are working hard to act on the Care Guide data.\n\n\u201cThe social worker is held responsible for getting the care that is needed for the senior at risk,\u201d Ricketts emphasizes. \u201cThey can\u2019t give up because their first call was a dud.\u201d\n\n\u2018More Metrics Than Brains\u2019\n\nNot surprisingly, the assessments have given National Church Residences a huge amount of data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more metrics than brains at this point,\u201d Ricketts jokes.\n\nBecause 2014 was the first full year of the program, results will be used as a benchmark for measuring future success.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to compare the data to yet,\u201d Ricketts says. But already, there have been some standout numbers.\n\nOne in particular has been the number of high-risk residents\u2014those with chronic conditions or classified as severely vulnerable\u2014who have seen a physician in the last year. This has risen from 72% of residents at the beginning of the year to 82% now, Erica Drewry, vice president of Home and Community Services, tells SHN.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the impressive raw number of documented interventions. There have been 159,032 instances in which service coordinators have assisted residents with their needs, Drewry says.\n\nStill, there is some important information that National Church Residences does not have its fingertips just yet. Namely, claims data that resides at the hospital or insurer level. It\u2019s this data that will show whether Care Guide is helping reduce utilization of costlier services in acute settings, and this is really the \u201csecret juice\u201d that will elevate National Church Residences above other senior care providers when hospital systems or managed care organizations are determining which providers to work with, Ricketts says.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have access to that data easily,\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for an insurer or hospital that can give us access, and hope that 12 months from now, we\u2019ll have claims data.\u201d\n\nAmong other next steps will be the complete rollout of Care Guide to CCRCs and assisted living centers, and perhaps even to seniors living in private residences. It may be harder to engage social workers to help that group, but it\u2019s not impossible, Ricketts says.\n\nEven though it\u2019s early days in terms of seeing Care Guide results, hospitals, insurers, accountable care organizations and other entities already are excited about the pre-acute capabilities of National Church Residences, Ricketts says.\n\n\u201cHospital systems, primary care practices and insurers are looking at us uniquely and saying, if we partner with you, you\u2019ll allow us to do somethign we can\u2019t do: Get in people\u2019s homes,\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cThe prevention side of what we\u2019re doing is really exciting.\u201d\n\nWritten by Tim Mullaney\n\nPictured at top: First Community Village in Upper Arlington, Ohio, a National Church Residences CCRC", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "Now, National Church Residences is rolling out the Care Guide program to residents its four continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) and other health care properties, including assisted living centers.\nEven though it\u2019s early days in terms of seeing Care Guide results, hospitals, insurers, accountable care organizations and other entities already are excited about the pre-acute capabilities of National Church Residences, Ricketts says.\nNational Church Residences began the program with the population in its affordable senior housing apartments, and this is no small contingent.\nStill, there is some important information that National Church Residences does not have its fingertips just yet.\nIt should help ease the process for social workers, who are working hard to act on the Care Guide data."}
