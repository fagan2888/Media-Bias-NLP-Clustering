That is, Senate Republicans in 2016 won\u2019t act as Democrats did when they blocked court confirmations in 1992.\n\nTwenty-four years ago looked a lot like the inverse of today. On the eve of a presidential election, there was a Republican in the White House and a Democrat majority in the Senate.\n\nNow those roles are reversed\u2014and so is the Democrat perspective on judicial nominees.\n\nRather than confirming President George H.W. Bush\u2019s picks for federal judgeships, The New York Times from Sept. 1, 1992, reports, Senate Democrats delayed nominees \u201cto preserve the vacancies for [Arkansas] Gov. Bill Clinton to fill if he is elected president.\u201d\n\nIn an era before widespread use of the Internet, \u201cnone of the senators urging a shutdown\u201d for Bush nominees would go on the record or register his opinion publicly with The New York Times.\n\nBut Neil Lewis reported that Senate Democrats wanted to leave approximately 50 judgeships open for \u201cpresumably more liberal nominees.\u201d\n\nAccording to Senate roll call votes from 1992, only one Bush judicial nominee received a vote after The New York Times published that story.\n\nEdward Carnes, nominated by Bush in January 1992 and later filibustered by Democrats, won confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on a vote of 62-36 on Sept. 9, 1992. He was the final nominee confirmed under Bush.\n\nAnother Bush nominee at the time was John G. Roberts, now chief justice of the Supreme Court. In 1992, the Senate opted not to vote on Roberts\u2019 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Without Senate action, his nomination was left to expire.\n\nThe New York Times reports that in the House, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., led a congressional congregation to complain to then-Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.\n\n\u201cWe told him it was very unsettling, even incredible, that the Senate should continue to consider these people as if it were business as usual,\u201d Conyers told the newspaper.\n\nIn the minority today, Senate Democrats have shifted their opinion at news that Republicans intend to leave vacant the seat of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative who died Saturday.\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have accused Republicans of dereliction of their constitutional duty to advise and consent on judicial nominees.\n\nIn an op-ed Monday in The Washington Post, Reid criticized Senate Republicans for engaging in \u201cpartisan sabotage\u201d after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced he wouldn\u2019t move an Obama nominee to the court.\n\nReid predicted that Republicans would be \u201cremembered as the most nakedly partisan, obstructionist, and irresponsible majority in history.\u201d\n\nEdward Whelan, president of the Washington-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, told The Daily Signal that Democrats have done \u201cthe same thing Republicans are doing now.\u201d\n\nA Supreme Court clerk for Scalia in the 1990s, Whelan said he sees this back-and-forth as par for the course.\n\n\u201cThe confirmation process is inherently political,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re talking about transformational seats, it\u2019s all the more intense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1992, Senate Democrats froze out Republican judicial nominees to leave seats open for Bill Clinton to fill after the presidential election.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In 1992, Senate Democrats froze out Republican judicial nominees to leave seats open for Bill Clinton to fill after the presidential election.", "title": "That Other Time Democrats Halted Judicial Nominees", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/bsphotos031227.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-18T10:14:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1oqSCib"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In 1992, Senate Democrats froze out Republican judicial nominees to leave seats open for Bill Clinton to fill after the presidential election.", "title": "That Other Time Democrats Halted Judicial Nominees", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/bsphotos031227.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "nominations,supreme court", "published_time": "2016-02-17T15:44:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T10:14:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bill Clinton, George Bush, Judicial Nominees, Supreme Court, Scalia"}, "article_summary": "Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have accused Republicans of dereliction of their constitutional duty to advise and consent on judicial nominees.\nBush\u2019s picks for federal judgeships, The New York Times from Sept. 1, 1992, reports, Senate Democrats delayed nominees \u201cto preserve the vacancies for [Arkansas] Gov.\nThat is, Senate Republicans in 2016 won\u2019t act as Democrats did when they blocked court confirmations in 1992.\nIf Senate Democrats get their way, Republicans won\u2019t follow their example.\nAnother Bush nominee at the time was John G.
