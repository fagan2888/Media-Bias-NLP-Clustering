Tit Bona\u010d\n\nDid a British research balloon pick up extraterrestrial life as it skimmed the stratosphere during the annual Perseid meteor shower?\n\nThe answer is yes, absolutely \u2013 at least if you trust astrobiologist Chandra Wickramasinghe and his fellow scientists, who claim that the microscopic algae detected on the balloon\u2019s sterile slides \u201ccan only have come from space.\u201d In a study presented at the Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology conference in San Diego, Calif. last month, the team theorized that the seeds are constantly transported between planets by asteroids, comets, and other cosmic wanderers.\n\n\u201cBiological entities of this nature have not previously been reported occurring in the stratosphere,\u201d Wickramasinghe said, speaking to The Daily Mail. \u201cThe entities varied from a presumptive colony of ultra-small bacteria to two unusual individual organisms - part of a diatom frustule and a 200 micron-sized particle mass interlaced with biofilm and biological filaments.\u201d\n\nThe presence of stratospheric life would back the panspermia hypothesis \u2013 the popular astrobiological view that life is promulgated by itinerant repositories of microorganisms that \u201cimpregnate\u201d planets. The theory, of which Wickramasinghe is a leading proponent, holds that life on Earth is neither the product of a divine prime mover nor spontaneous biopoesis, but a single, catalytic organism brought here from outer space. In panspermia, alien life is not only possible \u2013 it is necessary.\n\n\u201cBy our current understanding of the means by which such particles can be transferred from Earth to the stratosphere they could not - in the absence of a violent volcanic eruption occurring within a day of the sampling event - make such a journey,\u201d Wickramasinghe explained. \u201cIf there is no mechanism by which these biological entities could be elevated from Earth to the stratosphere then it must have arrived from above the stratosphere and have been incoming to Earth.\u201d\n\nA similar discovery made headlines yesterday when scientists announced that extensive analyses of a meteorite sample from 2012 revealed a number of organic molecules. The team said that the fascinating chemistry is similar to that of the hypothetical prebiotic soup \u2013 the chemical precursors of organic life. Like Wickramasinghe\u2019s algae, the molecules represent rudimentary evidence that we may not be alone in the universe.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alien life, seeds of life stratosphere, chandra wickramasinghe, astrobiology, panspermia, perseid meteor shower alien", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Algae collected by a weather balloon during the Perseid meteor shower suggest that we're not alone in the universe, astrobiologist says.", "title": "'Seeds Of Life' Collected During Perseid Meteor Shower", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seeds-life-collected-during-perseid-meteor-shower-scientists-say-algae-can-only-have-come-space", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/stars.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Algae collected by a weather balloon during the Perseid meteor shower suggest that we're not alone in the universe, astrobiologist says.", "title": "'Seeds Of Life' Collected During Perseid Meteor Shower", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seeds-life-collected-during-perseid-meteor-shower-scientists-say-algae-can-only-have-come-space", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/stars.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/stars.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-09-10T21:59:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T00:20:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Algae collected by a weather balloon during the Perseid meteor shower suggest that we're not alone in the universe, astrobiologist says."}, "article_summary": "Tit Bona\u010dDid a British research balloon pick up extraterrestrial life as it skimmed the stratosphere during the annual Perseid meteor shower?\n\u201cBiological entities of this nature have not previously been reported occurring in the stratosphere,\u201d the researchers said.\n\u201cBiological entities of this nature have not previously been reported occurring in the stratosphere,\u201d Wickramasinghe said, speaking to The Daily Mail.\nThe team said that the fascinating chemistry is similar to that of the hypothetical prebiotic soup \u2013 the chemical precursors of organic life.\nLike Wickramasinghe\u2019s algae, the molecules represent rudimentary evidence that we may not be alone in the universe."}
