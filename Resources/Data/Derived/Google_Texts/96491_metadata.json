During his road trip throughout the U.S., he intends to eat a hot dog in each of the 30 Major League Baseball parks, driving roughly 11,000 miles.\n\nLohr has been chronicling his experience on his blog, ranking ballpark hot dogs - without forgetting his bottle of Pepto-Bismol.\n\n\u201cLast year, I drove the entire Route 66 and ate hot dogs all the way, but they taste better at the ballpark,\u201d Lohr said in an interview, explaining why he undertook this experiment.\n\nAs of July 3, he\u2019s visited 26 out of the 30 MLB parks and 18 minor league stadiums. He anticipates he\u2019ll finish his journey in Atlanta on July 20.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in America\n\nHe looks at several factors when rating Dodger Dogs against Fenway Franks and other ballpark offerings: the quality of the hot dogs he tastes, including the bun, the meat and the toppings; the quality of the park itself, including the location, parking, cleanliness and the fans; and affordability.\n\nHere are his top three ballpark hot dogs so far:\n\nOriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Md. Coors Field in Denver, Colo. Chase Field in Phoenix, Ariz.\n\n\u201cWith a combination of great dog and ballpark, Oriole Park gets the first perfect score of 60,\u201d he wrote on his blog on June 25. \u201cThat means if you are planning a baseball road trip, Baltimore should be on your list no matter what. Great job, Baltimore.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For many Americans, there\u2019s no better way to celebrate July 4th than to eat a hot dog", "title": "One Fan\u2019s 11,000-Mile Quest for the Best Ballpark Hot Dog", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/04/One-Fan-s-11000-Mile-Quest-Best-Ballpark-Hot-Dog", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05222014_Fatty_Food_Hot_Dogs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/04/One-Fan-s-11000-Mile-Quest-Best-Ballpark-Hot-Dog", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05222014_Fatty_Food_Hot_Dogs.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "For many Americans, there\u2019s no better way to celebrate July 4th than to eat a hot dog", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1157\"", "article_summary": "Related: 11 Worst Fast Food Restaurants in AmericaIn early April, Lohr, who is originally from West Virginia but lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, began the quintessential American quest for the best ballpark hot dog.\nLohr has been chronicling his experience on his blog, ranking ballpark hot dogs - without forgetting his bottle of Pepto-Bismol.\nHere are his top three ballpark hot dogs so far:Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Md.\n\u201cThat means if you are planning a baseball road trip, Baltimore should be on your list no matter what.\nFor many Americans, there\u2019s no better way to celebrate July 4th than to eat a hot dog at a baseball game."}
