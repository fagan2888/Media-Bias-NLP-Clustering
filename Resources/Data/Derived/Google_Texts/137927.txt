What to think of Peter Egan?

Shame on you, Peter Egan, for using an analogy of wife abuse to complain about Jay Dardenne’s endorsement of John Bel Edwards for Louisiana governor. And shame on you for hobnobbing with the GOP as St. Tammany’s chair. Didn’t any of your priest training in Ireland remain? Since when is it okay to denigrate minorities, the poor, and women by denying healthcare and equitable pay? You and your buddies have yours, so the hell with the rest of us. Pro-life my derriere. Did the callous switch happen when you started your own business? Do you treat your customers without means differently than those with money? I defended you when you left the priesthood to marry a former student. I refused to listen to later rumors that you were guilty of spousal abuse. Lots of marriages have troubles that can be misperceived or exaggerated. But now, what are parishioners who once revered you to think? You have chosen to hook your wagon to the likes of David Vitter. Edwards is a man with exemplary honor; Vitter is a man with absolutely none.
