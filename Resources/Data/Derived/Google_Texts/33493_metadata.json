That can be more in\u00adsightful than recommendations from friends or family. You should also consider what kind of doctor you want. Someone who can care for your whole family? Someone who focuses on women or older people (see below)? Here are some other things to consider as you search for Dr. Right.\n\n1. Check your insurance\n\nUse your insurer\u2019s directory or search on its website for doctors in your network. Because doctors often add or drop plans, call the office to verify that the doctor still accepts your insurance. (If you are choosing a health plan, use our insurance rankings to compare plans.)\n\n\n\n2. Consider hospital affiliation\n\nYour choice of doctor can determine which hospital you go to, if needed, so find out where the doctor has admitting privileges. Then use our hospital Ratings to see how that facility compares with other hospitals in your area.\n\n3. Look for board certification\n\nBeing certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties means a doctor has earned a medical degree from a qualified medical school, completed three to seven years of accredited residency training, is licensed by a state medical board, and has passed one or more exams administered by a member of the ABMS. To maintain the certification, a doctor is expected to participate in continuing education. To see whether a doctor is certified, go to certificationmatters.org.\n\n4. Watch out for red flags\n\nThey include malpractice claims and disciplinary actions. Even good doctors can get sued once or twice, but \u201cyou certainly don\u2019t want someone who has had a lot of malpractice claims,\u201d Avitzur says. Common reasons for being disciplined include substance abuse and inappropriate sexual behavior, though it can be hard to know exactly why a doctor was sanctioned. Most states let doctors prac\u00adtice while they receive treatment. See our state-by-state list of links to state medical boards and other resources or checking up on doctors.\n\n5. Consider compatibility\n\nMore than half of Americans focus on personality and relationship when choosing a physician, according to a 2014 survey from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. (Just 29 percent said the delivery of care or the patient\u2019s health outcome was most crucial.) Use your first visit as a litmus test. Some factors to consider: Does the doctor listen to you without interrupting? Does she fully answer your questions? Does she explain your diagnosis and treatment, and specify a date for a follow-up visit?\n\n6. Ask about drug reps\n\nMany doctors let representatives from pharma\u00adceutical companies into their offices to pitch their drugs. That not only takes up a lot of the doctor\u2019s time but also may inappropriately influence his choice of drugs. \u201cThat can get patients started on a brand-name medication that may be more expensive or may not be the best one for them,\u201d Peter said. Moreover, a doctor\u2019s attitude toward drug reps can indicate how committed he is to practicing according to the best evidence, not pressures from industry.\n\n7. Find out about office policies\n\nAsk how long it takes to make an appointment for a routine visit (it should be less than a week), whether they offer same-day appointments, and how long patients are kept in the waiting room. Once you\u2019re a patient, if the reality doesn\u2019t meet your expectations, consider shopping around. That\u2019s important not only to save you time but also for your health. In practices that waste patients\u2019 time, research shows that \u201cpatients are less likely to follow up on recommendations to prevent or manage chronic conditions,\u201d said L. Gordon Moore, M.D., chief medical officer at Treo Solutions, a data analytics firm.\n\n8. Scrutinize the staff\n\nThey are the people who will schedule your appointments, check you in and out, give the doctor your messages, and address insurance concerns. Look for a staff that\u2019s friendly, efficient, and respectful. \u201cHealth care is a team sport,\u201d said Lois Margaret Nora, M.D., J.D., and president and CEO of the American Board of Medical Specialties. \u201cPeople should expect quality in their doctor and the system in which the physician practices.\u201d\n\n9. Factor in technology\n\nElectronic health records let your doctor track your medical history, share info with spe\u00adcialists, and monitor all of your drugs. Many doctors also have a patient portal, a secured website that gives you 24-hour access to your health information, al\u00adlowing you to book and track doctor appointments, get lab results, request prescription refills, and e-mail questions to your doctor. The government requires that health information be protected with passwords, encryption, and other technical safeguards. Still, ask how your information will be safeguarded.
