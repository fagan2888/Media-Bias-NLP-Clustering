Buried amid the current holiday shopping commotion is the idea that 2014 presents a clean slate for personal improvement. A recurring theme when it comes to New Year’s resolutions is the desire to better manage personal finances.

At the start of 2013, Betterment.com reported that 47 percent of Americans set resolutions related to self-improvement or education; 34 percent of people make a money-related resolution, emphasizing the prominent position financial matters have taken in Americans’ minds as the economy slowly recovers.

In a new GoBankingRates survey, more than 1,700 participants were asked what their biggest financial goal is for the upcoming year; the results revealed that objectives in 2014 are spread across many personal finance categories.

Survey Results: What Is Your Biggest Financial Goal for 2014?

Other resolutions for New Year’s 2014, such as losing weight and reading more, could still be on the laundry list of goals for Americans in the upcoming year, but our survey results suggest that the holiday hangover might contribute to how individuals plan to approach the year ahead.

Saving money weighed in at the top of the list, with 39.3 percent of respondents looking to pull back on spending, followed with paying down debt (29.3 percent).

Conversely, just 12 percent of participants said they intend on focusing their efforts on investing, and 10.6 percent said they’re targeting a raise.

This inclination to save money and pay off debts comes as no surprise, especially as retail sales over November and December 2013 are expected to reach as much as $602.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.

Based on the findings, Americans are starting off the new year cautiously, choosing to work with the money they have left over from the holiday season rather than hedge their bets on riskier financial goals early in the year.

Biggest Financial Goal for New Year’s 2014 by Gender

Of those who decided to pursue a more aggressive money management approach, a gender divide arose in the poll results. Female respondents’ financials goals were more likely to be conservative with “save money” (43.3 percent) and “pay down debt” (30.8 percent) as their top choices, while only 35.1 percent and 27.7 percent of males prioritized these goals, respectively.

Male participants were more likely to select “invest” (17 percent) and “get a raise” (12.2 percent) as their New Year’s 2014 financial goals than females.

Despite the general perception that women are more passive about their money and men are liable to take more risks when it comes to building wealth, there was no significant gender-related difference for the survey option “build an emergency fund.”

This suggests that, while men and women might differ in how they achieve immediate financial self-improvement, neither are necessarily focused on planning for unexpected expenses.

Poll Results by Income

An interesting finding from the New Year’s 2014 financial goal survey was the relationship between participants’ chosen goal and their current income bracket.

Incomes levels for $0-$24,999, $25,000-$49,999, $50,000-$74,999, $75,000-$99,999, $100,000-$149,999 and $150,000+ were identified in the poll. Surveyed individuals from two opposite income intervals — $0-$24,000 and $100,000-$149,000 — reported the most responses for “save money” and “pay down debt.”

“Save Money” Responses

Fifty percent of those with an income of $100,000-149,999 reported this goal.

Coming in second, 42 percent of respondents with an income of $0-$24,999 chose “save money” as their 2014 financial goal.

“Pay Down Debt” Responses

People with an income of $100,000-$149,000 reported the most responses (31.8 percent) for “pay down debt,” followed by participants earning $0-$24,000 (31.6 percent).

These results suggest that low-wage workers and those who are making significantly more money (though not at the highest income bracket surveyed) are looking to make controlled financial decisions (i.e. setting aside savings and reducing existing debt) to stabilize their wealth in 2014.

On the other hand, individuals identified within middle income brackets ($50,000-$74,999 and $75,000-$99,999) reported the most “invest” responses.

Unlike those making the lowest income levels, who don’t have much money to risk, and those earning $100,000-$149,000 who likely already have an investment portfolio, respondents whose earnings fell in the middle might feel comfortable enough to sustain their cost of living in the new year, while making a few investing decisions to see how far they can get by the end of the year.

What Does This Mean for New Year’s 2014?

2014 will certainly bring on more changes as the Affordable Care Act goes into full effect. With the uncertain future of these new regulations and how they affect Americans’ pockets and the sluggish job market, workers are riddled with uncertainties on how their finances will fare.

Respondents’ financial goals are being influenced by these factors as well as the aftermath of spending during the holiday months.
