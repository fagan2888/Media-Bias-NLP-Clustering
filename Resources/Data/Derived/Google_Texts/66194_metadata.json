But what many workers may not realize is that HDHPs are often accompanied by a Health Savings Account (HSA), a tax-advantaged account that holds money intended to cover medical costs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that high-deductible plans are becoming more common,\u201d says David Blaylock, CFP\u00ae with LearnVest Planning Services. \u201cAnd I have a lot of clients who have been provided an HSA option through their company. They\u2019re a little hesitant at first, but once they understand that it allows them to save in an account of their own\u2014that\u2019s not necessarily tied to the employer\u2014they usually prefer that route.\u201d\n\nIn fact, HSAs (and their linked high-deductible policies) have been growing rapidly both in the private markets and on the new public exchanges. Devenir, a Minneapolis-based HSA investment firm, says its assets in HSA accounts have reached almost $23 billion\u2014a 26% increase over last year.\n\nWith open enrollment season in full swing, you may be wondering, \u201cIs an HSA right for me?\u201d To help you land on the answer, we\u2019ve put together a 101 guide on how they work\u2014and what makes them different from other types of savings vehicles.\n\nRelated: How to Get the Most Out of Obamacare\n\nThe HSA Basics\n\nMuch like a 401(k) or IRA that you can use to save for retirement, an HSA is a savings account to which you contribute pre-tax dollars that earn interest or could be invested, depending on the options that are provided to you by the financial institution where you hold your account.\n\nAnd much like with a 401(k), you can have your contributions taken straight from your paycheck\u2014plus, some employers may opt to make HSA contributions on your behalf.\n\nAs is the case with retirement accounts, HSAs have contribution limits that are set by the IRS every year. For 2015, individuals who only cover themselves through an HDHP can contribute up to $3,350 per year; those on a family plan can contribute up to $6,650. If you\u2019re 55 or older, you can also add another $1,000 as a catch-up contribution.\n\nBut here\u2019s one big difference from a retirement account: While 401(k)s, IRAs and HSAs all let your earnings grow tax-deferred\u2014which means you pay no capital gains tax\u2014you do pay ordinary income taxes on the withdrawals you make from your IRAs and 401(k)s in retirement.\n\nRelated: 12 Ways Your Employer Can Increase Your Tax Refund\n\nWith an HSA, however, you don\u2019t pay taxes on withdrawals, at any age, as long as you\u2019re using them to cover qualified medical expenses\u2014which means you can get a tax break on what you put in and get out, provided the money is being used properly.\n\n\u201cI think the average account holder is getting around $25 to $40 in tax savings per month [by using an HSA],\u201d says Todd Berkley, president of Minnetonka, Minn.\u2013based HSA Consulting.\n\nAnother pro to an HSA? That money and investment growth is all yours\u2014there are no year-end, use-it-or-lose it or limited carryover provisions, as is the case with flexible spending accounts.\n\nOf course, one of the biggest limitations to an HSA is the fact that you can\u2019t open one unless you\u2019re enrolled in an HDHP, and for 2015 that means an insurance plan with a deductible of at least $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for families. Another caveat: An HDHP may not be the right insurance choice if you have a long-standing illness or already know that you tend to incur high medical bills you can\u2019t cover out-of-pocket.\n\n\u201cIf your medical costs are low, [HSAs] enable you to set aside money to cover future health care costs and, if you stay healthy, even retirement [medical costs],\u201d Blaylock says. \u201cBut if you have a chronic medical condition, you are probably better off in a traditional health insurance policy.\u201d\n\nBerkley, however, believes that the slant toward healthy, wealthy participants has been overstated. His company sees participants across the age and income spectrum, with the average account holder between ages 40 and 45.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great tax shelter for the rich, since you can only put away $6,650 a year,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a [better] tax shelter for the middle class.\u201d\n\nAnother important thing to note: Since HSAs are meant to be paired with an HDHP, you can\u2019t contribute more money to them unless you are enrolled in such a plan. You can, however, keep the account open and continue to let the money grow that\u2019s already been contributed.\n\nDecision Time: Key Things to Look for in an HSA\n\nAs with a 401(k), you might be limited to the HSA providers that your company offers. But for those who are free to choose their own, there are a plethora of financial institutions that participate\u2014many major banks include HSAs among their offerings.\n\nBefore you open an account, take a look at the fees you\u2019ll be charged, suggests Blaylock, because they can vary widely from bank to bank. A comparison table at the HSA Search website shows monthly maintenance fees ranging from $0 to $7, some of which are waived for people with higher account balances.\n\nIf you decide to invest your HSA funds, also consider taking a look at any additional fees that are charged by the funds that you may invest in. The higher the fees, the more you\u2019re eating into the value of your account and offsetting your tax benefits.\n\nBeyond fees, the HSA features you value will really depend on how you intend to utilize the account.\n\n\u201cIf you feel like you\u2019re going to use the account frequently, then convenience is probably going to be a big factor,\u201d Blaylock says. \u201cYou may want to choose a bank that offers a debit card, ATM access and other easy ways to pay.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, if you\u2019re viewing your HSA as more of a long-term savings vehicle, then choose a provider that offers a good mix of investment options, Blaylock adds. \u201cYou may want to go with a larger company\u2014they\u2019re going to have a wider range of investment choices than the local credit union.\u201d\n\nIn fact, because of their tax benefits, some people view HSAs as another way to save for retirement. If you\u2019re 65 and older, you can withdraw money from an HSA for any reason\u2014even non-medical ones\u2014but the non-medical withdrawals you make will be taxed like ordinary income, which is similar to IRA or 401(k) withdrawals.\n\n\u201cMost people come in to HSAs thinking of them as a replacement for a flexible savings account. They just want to put in the amount that they expect to spend on medical expenses,\u201d Berkley says. \u201cBut I think the [next] big frontier for HSAs is in investing. The options [you have in HSAs] are generally similar to a 401(k).\u201d\n\nFor instance, Berkley says that investors who have maxed out their 401(k) contributions can consider putting any additional retirement money into their HSA up to that contribution limit, which also helps bump up their tax benefits for the year. The other upside, of course, is that if the HSA money is used to cover medical costs in retirement, it won\u2019t be taxed at all.\n\n\u201cI always encourage people to first get your match on your 401(k). That\u2019s free money,\u201d Berkley says. \u201cThen max out your HSA.\u201d\n\nBlaylock takes a more cautious approach. \u201cAn HSA is not really a long-term planning tool, in my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about taking care of our health needs today.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Blaylock encourages people to put money into their HSAs until they have enough to cover their deductible. After that, he explains, \u201cwe want to make sure they\u2019re filling other important financial buckets: emergency savings, retirement savings and college savings.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how you use your HSA, Berkley notes that these accounts are helping to address a problem that almost no one is prepared for today\u2014the mounting costs of health care in retirement.\n\nA study from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai found that, on average, people with Medicare coverage paid more than $38,000 for medical care out-of-pocket in the last five years of life.\n\n\u201cI think we all wish everyone was saving a little more for post-retirement medical costs,\u201d Berkley says, \u201cand HSAs can help with that.\u201d\n\nThis piece originally appeared at LearnVest.
