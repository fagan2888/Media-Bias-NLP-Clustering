Then dressed in Santa\u2019s Hats and Reindeer antlers members of Community Outreach Church began handing out bags of fruits and candy canes to the residents of Golden Living and Pastor Merriweather says it is a blessing to give back to the community.\n\n\u201cWhen we pass it out to the elders, when they look at you in your face and say god bless your son or god bless your daughter that is the most important thing in our life because they mean it, they really mean when they say god bless you and that is a thrill and that is a happiness that you never forget in your life,\u201d stated Pastor Merriweather.\n\nOnce they finished giving out the Christmas gift bags, members of the church wished and prayed with the residents before they moved on to the next nursing home to brighten someone else\u2019s day.\n\n\u201cWe just want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everybody,\u201d stated the Church Members.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Community Outreach Church spent their Christmas morning visiting various nursing homes spreading holiday cheer.", "language": "english", "author": "Nick Gunter", "og": {"description": "Community Outreach Church spent their Christmas morning visiting various nursing homes spreading holiday cheer.", "title": "Local Church visits Nursing Homes", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Local-Church-visits-Nursing-Homes-286831901.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/9F7/302/9F7302E4ABC44177961A277DBF30C6D2", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/65B/1BB/65B1BB2B4FBB404A9885EA96A89FD9B3.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Community Outreach Church spent their Christmas morning visiting various nursing homes spreading holiday cheer.", "title": "Local Church visits Nursing Homes", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Local-Church-visits-Nursing-Homes-286831901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Christmas57.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Local Church visits Nursing Homes", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local Church visits Nursing Homes"}, "article_summary": "With many people enjoying their time at home during Christmas one local church took the time out of their morning to visit various nursing homes spreading Christmas cheer to its residents.\n\u201cWe just want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everybody,\u201d stated the Church Members.\nThe first stop for the church members was the Golden Living Center where they sang Christmas Carols.\nOnce they finished giving out the Christmas gift bags, members of the church wished and prayed with the residents before they moved on to the next nursing home to brighten someone else\u2019s day.\nThen dressed in Santa\u2019s Hats and Reindeer antlers members of Community Outreach Church began handing out bags of fruits and candy canes to the residents of Golden Living and Pastor Merriweather says it is a blessing to give back to the community."}
