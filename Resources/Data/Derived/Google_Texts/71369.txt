Medical providers who see reductions in revenue from health insurers due to Obamacare’s cost-containment measures may try to increase the volume and mix of services that can be billed to property and casualty carriers to compensate, a new report contends.

Whle Obamacare provisions do not directly target or affect P&C insurance, the Insurance Research Council, in a report titled, “The Affordable Care Act and Property-Casualty Insurance,” says, “To the extent the cost-containment provisions of the ACA negatively affect medical-provider revenue, then efforts by providers to increase revenue from other sources, including property and casualty insurance, should be expected.”
