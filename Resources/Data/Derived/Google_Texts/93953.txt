SALT LAKE CITY -- One of Utah's oldest commercial buildings housed wagons more than 100 years ago, and now it's undergoing a modern makeover.

The 58,000 square-foot building once housed the arts and craft store Zims, and before that, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints used it to store wagons and manufacture farming equipment.

Impact Hub Salt Lake will move in when the overhaul is finished. It's a company of entrepreneurs who will use the building as a hub for technology and networking.

Architects want to keep the unique characteristics intact, and on Friday FOX 13 Newsâ€™ Tamara Vaifanua toured the building. See the video above for more details.
