Speaking on his “InfoWars” radio show on Monday, conspiracy theorist extraordinaire Alex Jones claimed that the recent public shooting in Las Vegas — during which a man and his wife murdered two police officers, another person, and then themselves — was a secret plot by the government to discredit gun fetishists such as himself.

Noting that the Facebook page of Jerad Miller, the man believed to have been the driving force behind the couple’s killing spree, is littered with indications that he was a fan of Jones’ work, the radio host argued that this, too, was part of the conspiracy. Apparently Mark Zuckerberg is also out to take Jones’ guns.

“Oh, and guess what’s on [Miller’s] Facebook page? It’s so easy to set this up,” Jones said. “Facebook works with you-know-who so closely.” (You-know-who is supposed to be the U.S. government.)
