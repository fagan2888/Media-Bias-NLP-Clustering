We keep the basics handy for days like today.\n\n\n\nTiger Beat On The Potomac seems befuddled as to why Hillary Rodham Clinton hasn't yet buried it in detailed policy briefs. After all, her campaign is more than 48 hours old!\n\nBut mainly, Clinton hasn't offered many clues about how her presidency would do more than serve as essentially Obama's third term: How would she try to fix flaws in Obama's signature health care law? Would she crack down on Wall Street or the National Security Agency? Would she break with Obama in pushing for fast-track trade deals?\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nBecause I am always here to help, I will now present a list of what we already know about a potential Rodham Clinton's presidency.\n\nIf she is elected, she unequivocally will accept the science of anthropogenic climate change and treat it as a crisis. This cannot be said of any of the Republican candidates, real or potential.\n\nIf she is elected, she unequivocally will support marriage equality, and oppose discrimination against our fellow citizens based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This cannot be said of any of the Republican candidates, real or potential.\n\nMost Popular\n\nIf she is elected, she will not destroy the Affordable Care Act, an article of faith among all the Republican candidates, real or potential.\n\nIf she is elected, and despite her closeness to certain Wall Street interests, she will not destroy the Dodd-Frank reforms, another article of faith among all the Republican candidates, real or potential.\n\nIf she is elected, the DREAMers will get to stay in the country.\n\nIf she is elected, she will not sign a bill to eliminate the estate tax. (More on this one later)\n\nIf she is elected, Janice Rogers Brown will stay right where she is in the judicial food chain.\n\nTo get elected, she does not have to wink at state's rights, up to and including incidents of armed resistance.\n\nTo get elected, she does not have to equivocate on the science behind the theory of evolution as does any Republican candidate who seeks the votes of Republicans in Iowa.\n\nTo get elected, she does not have to peddle the snake oil of supply-side economics, nor does she have to peddle scare stories about the oncoming caliphate, nor does she have to create bogeymen about jackboots coming to steal your guns.\n\nMore, I suspect, to follow.\n\nJesus, this is going to be a long 19 months.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/10/160x160/square_1425395509-464331632.jpg", "description": "In which we explain that Hillary Rodham Clinton actually has positions.", "title": "Things In Politico That Make Me Want To Guzzle Antifreeze", "og": {"site_name": "Esquire", "description": "In which we explain that Hillary Rodham Clinton actually has positions.", "title": "There Are Issues On Which Ms. Rodham Clinton Has A Position", "url": "http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a34359/clinton-politico/", "image": {"url": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/10/1600x800/landscape_1425395509-464331632.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/10/1600x800/landscape_1425395509-464331632.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Esquire", "image": {"src": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/10/1425395509-464331632.jpg"}, "description": "In which we explain that Hillary Rodham Clinton actually has positions.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "There Are Issues On Which Ms. Rodham Clinton Has A Position"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-15T12:08:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "There Are Issues On Which Ms. Rodham Clinton Has A Position", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1020421151, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteESQ&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 171874009543995, "pages": 84169421673}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "google-site-verification": "jc-n3hu5vRQZpMR_8zTdWlZclmVbvCl2qFQ2fxka3rc", "sailthru.tags": "News & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Esquire", "section": "Politics With Charles P.
