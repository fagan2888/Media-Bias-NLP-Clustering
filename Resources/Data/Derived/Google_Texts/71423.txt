More than a dozen San Mateo County election workers spent the evening processing hundreds of mail-in ballots cast for Tuesdayâ€™s election at the county elections office.

The consolidated municipal, school and special district election was the first in California history to exclusively use all mail-in ballots. Mail-in ballots were electronically scanned after the voter signatures had been verified, according to San Mateo County election officials.
