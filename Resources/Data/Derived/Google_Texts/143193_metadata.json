Standing next to him was Donald Trump.\n\nAt a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa, Joe Arpaio, the controversial sheriff of Maricopa Country, Arizona, announced his support of the Republican frontrunner, saying, \u201cIt was a no-brainer for me to endorse him. Very easy decision. Believe me.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Donald Trump Afraid of a Megyn Kelly Rematch?\n\nFor his part, Trump gladly accepted the blessing of a man widely reviled in the Hispanic community for his extreme policies toward illegal immigrants. Most Republicans acknowledge that without the Hispanic vote the party has little chance of winning the presidency. Yet, while the majority of GOP candidates wouldn\u2019t want to be seen in the same football stadium as Arpaio, Trump embraced him Tuesday night, calling him a \u201cgreat guy.\u201d\n\nThe only thing in question here is why this took so long. In many ways, Arpaio is a sort of proto-Trump. He\u2019s a petty, vindictive narcissist who traffics in conspiracy theories and whose abuse of authority with regard to suspected illegal immigrants was so egregious that that the Department of Justice successfully sued to have his enforcement authority stripped away.\n\nIn other words, before the feds stepped in and spoiled the fun, Arpaio did to Maricopa County what Trump proposes to do to the whole country. Trump calls for banning immigrants based on their religion, walling off Mexico from the U.S. and forcibly deporting 12 million people. He\u2019s basically Joe Arpaio in a bespoke suit.\n\nArpaio\u2019s reputation as \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff\u201d is based, in part, on his practice of devising the most inhumane ways to treat prisoners in county detention centers while (arguably) remaining within the letter of the law. He developed an armed volunteer \u201cposse\u201d to assist his deputies in the enforcement of immigration laws, which attracted a handful of B-list celebrities (like actor Steven Seagal, last seen palling around with another Trump favorite, Russian President Vladimir Putin.)\n\nRelated: Clinton Leads Trump in the Endorsement Sweepstakes 459 to 0\n\nIn the more than 20 years Arpaio has been sheriff, the people of Maricopa County have paid out more than $140 million in court judgments, awards and legal fees defending him and his office.\n\nArpaio was only the second highly controversial figure to endorse Trump on Tuesday. Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr., the son of the televangelist who founded the Moral Majority in 1979, and the current president of Liberty University, also founded by his father, officially got behind Trump earlier in the day.\n\nFalwell\u2019s endorsement was hardly a surprise. Trump spoke at Liberty earlier this month, and Falwell delivered an introduction that, while not an explicit endorsement, sounded a lot like one. Tuesday morning he removed what little doubt might have remained.\n\nIn his remarks, Falwell called Trump \u201ca successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.\u201d\n\nFalwell has recently come under fire for recommending that students at Liberty carry weapons on campus. In the wake of the San Bernardino shootings last month, committed by a Muslim man and wife aligned with the terror group ISIS, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought if more good people had concealed carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reaction, via Twitter: \u201cGreat honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A man famous for demonizing illegal immigrants, ranting about President Obama\u2019s birth", "title": "Joe Arpaio, Trump\u2019s \u2018Mini-Me,\u2019 Delivers His Endorsement", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/27/Joe-Arpaio-Trump-s-Mini-Me-Delivers-His-Endorsement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/RTR3DK7T.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/27/Joe-Arpaio-Trump-s-Mini-Me-Delivers-His-Endorsement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/RTR3DK7T.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A man famous for demonizing illegal immigrants, ranting about President Obama\u2019s birth", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "For his part, Trump gladly accepted the blessing of a man widely reviled in the Hispanic community for his extreme policies toward illegal immigrants.\nAt a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa, Joe Arpaio, the controversial sheriff of Maricopa Country, Arizona, announced his support of the Republican frontrunner, saying, \u201cIt was a no-brainer for me to endorse him.\nTrump spoke at Liberty earlier this month, and Falwell delivered an introduction that, while not an explicit endorsement, sounded a lot like one.\nJerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!\nYet, while the majority of GOP candidates wouldn\u2019t want to be seen in the same football stadium as Arpaio, Trump embraced him Tuesday night, calling him a \u201cgreat guy.\u201dThe only thing in question here is why this took so long."}
