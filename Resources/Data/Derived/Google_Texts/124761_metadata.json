For most brands, that's very smart,\" Calkins said. \"Some brands, though, can push this. We're going to see more brands take advantage of this and use this as a way to define themselves.\"\n\n\"Spirit Airlines has a certain character and, as a result, I think this works for Spirit,\" Calkins added. \"But we're not going to see United (Airlines) embrace the same idea anytime soon.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their TV pitches is growing: Spirit Airlines is beckoning flyers to \"get mile high.\"", "author": "Bill Briggs, CNBC contributor", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their TV pitches is growing: Spirit Airlines is beckoning flyers to \"get mile high.\"", "title": "Wooing the weed crowd with artful, edgy ads", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/16/companies-woo-the-weed-crowd-with-artful-edgy-ads.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/01/14/101335989-latenightfire_1280x960-1r.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their TV pitches is growing: Spirit Airlines is beckoning flyers to \"get mile high.\"", "title": "Companies woo the weed crowd with artful, edgy ads", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/16/companies-woo-the-weed-crowd-with-artful-edgy-ads.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/01/14/101335989-latenightfire_1280x960-1r.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Advertising, Advertising, Marijuana, Marketing, Business of Marijuana: The Consumer, Business of Marijuana: The Business, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-01-18T11:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Advertising", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T12:53:53-0500", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 101336393, "news_keywords": "marijuana, weed, advertising, marketing, edgy, spirit, brands, risky"}, "article_summary": "\"Spirit Airlines has a certain character and, as a result, I think this works for Spirit,\" Calkins added.\nThey have run ads intimating weed use, with code words like \"munchies\" or \"bake,\" or with squinty-eyed characters engaged in apparent stoner babble.\nThe tactic has been delicately plied by other brands, including Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, Denny's and Carl's Jr.\n(Read more: New marijuana laws get brewers buzzing)\"Many brands in this country aren't going anywhere near the legalization issue.\nBut Spirit transports passengers through the sky from city to city, not gorditas from a drive-through window to a car."}
