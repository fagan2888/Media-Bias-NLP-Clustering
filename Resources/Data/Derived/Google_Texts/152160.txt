As the presidential election takes shape, the Affordable Care Act dominates health policy discourse in both parties. The latest edition of the Health Wonk Review, hosted by Louise Norris at Colorado Health Insurance Insider, focuses on the lawâ€™s future, from small tweaks to major changes. Included is a Health Affairs Blog post by Nicole Garro, Brittany Hernandez, and Cynthia Pellegrini arguing that the Department of Health and Human Services should establish a Special Enrollment Period for women who become pregnant.

David Williams hosts the next edition at Health Business Blog on March 10.
