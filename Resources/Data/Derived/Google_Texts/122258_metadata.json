Just four years ago in Indiana, a shock 20-point primary loss by six-term GOP Sen. Richard Lugar demonstrated just how much establishment control of the GOP had slipped. But this year, Rep. Todd Young has opened a lead in the state's Republican Senate primary behind a tsunami of establishment money and support \u2014 and the tea-party energy that took down Lugar has failed to materialize, despite the anti-establishment vigor of the presidential race.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cGOP Rep. Marlin Stutzman, Young's opponent, has won support from some of the same groups that backed Lugar challenger Richard Mourdock in Indiana in 2012. But neither the money nor the outrage that drove past tea-party campaigns has been there for Stutzman. Young and his supporters have outspent Stutzman 9-to-1 on TV.\u201d http://politi.co/1Oa9PlI\n\nADDING ADS \u2014 DCCC makes first fall TV reservations,\" by Campaign Pro's Theodoric Meyer: \"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making its first TV ad buys for the fall, outlining the beginnings of a 2016 House battleground map that is still developing. The DCCC's independent-expenditure arm has reserved $32 million worth of airtime in markets covering 14 districts \u2014 12 held by Republicans and two held by Democrats. The buys start as early as Sept. 6, and some run through Election Day in November. ... The reservations also appear to be tilted toward major markets in battleground states \u2014 like Denver, Miami, and Las Vegas \u2014 where ad rates are likely to soar.\"\n\n\u2014 The DCCC's first set of Republican targets: GOP Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Rod Blum and David Young of Iowa, Bruce Poliquin of Maine, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Cresent Hardy of Nevada, Frank Guinta of New Hampshire, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, and the open seats being vacated by GOP Reps. John Kline of Minnesota, Joe Heck of Nevada and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. The DCCC has also made reservations intended to defend Democratic Reps. Rick Nolan of Minnesota and Brad Ashford of Nebraska. (See the reservations and dates organized by district here.) http://politico.pro/1pWo6MI\n\nHOOSIER PRIMARY, CONTINUED \u2014 \u201cFour super PACs clash in upcoming House primary,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Theodoric Meyer: \u201cThere are five Republicans running for the open seat in Indiana's 9th Congressional District. But the primary there has started to feel more like a race between four super PACs instead. ... [S]uch single-candidate super PACs have grown increasingly common in House races in 2016, as donors and outside groups have focused on the presidential race. \u2026 At least 18 single-candidate super PACs have appeared in House races across the country this cycle, from Arizona to New Hampshire, although not all of them have started spending yet.\u201d http://politico.pro/1SHXNlv\n\nDays until the Indiana primary: 1.

Brad Ashford's district. But the DCCC's top brass says there's more to the ad campaign than meddling in GOP affairs. The committee is spending more than $430,000 on ads that paint Republican Chip Maxwell in a conservative, outsider light compared to Don Bacon, a better-funded GOP candidate backed by a number of Republican House members. \u2026 Yet the DCCC says it's also using the ads to debut a general-election line expected to pop up again in this district and many more this year: tying candidates to the \u2018Washington establishment.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 \"'Pick your poison,' the narrator says. 'Establishment Don Bacon: tens of thousands of dollars from Washington insiders.' The segment about Maxwell, though, is longer. It runs through a list of positions that would likely carry appeal in a GOP primary. ... 'Chip Maxwell wants to completely repeal Obamacare. And Chip Maxwell won't raise the debt limit under any circumstance.' ... 'We're jump-starting a general election message against [Bacon]. And if Chip Maxwell wins, that's great too,' [DCCC executive director Kelly] Ward said. But the DCCC's move hasn't met with universal approval in its own party. Strategists in both parties are divided over the practice of advertising during the other side's primaries, even as it has become more common. http://politico.pro/1Y1R5KQ\n\nTHE MONEY CHASE \u2014 \u201cJolly had fundraiser scheduled days after \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Jake Sherman: \u201cOn \u201860 Minutes\u2019 Sunday, Rep. David Jolly spent an entire segment decrying members of Congress' obsession with campaign fundraising and touting his bill to ban them from personally soliciting campaign cash. But on Friday, just five days after the piece aired, Jolly\u201d \u2014 who\u2019s locked in a five-way primary for the Florida Senate seat Marco Rubio is vacating \u2014 \u201chad a fundraiser scheduled in Washington, according to multiple sources familiar with the event. He was scheduled to be there, in person. And donors were asked to spend upwards of $1,000 to attend. One source said late Friday that the event had been canceled. Aides to Jolly said the congressman was on an airplane and they did not respond to multiple requests for comment before publication.\u201d http://politi.co/1SUWKEj\n\nAIR AID \u2014 McCain goes after Kirkpatrick with radio ads in her own district: GOP Sen. John McCain's campaign will go up on the air with its first radio ads today \u2014 and his campaign is going after his Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, in her home district. The ad is styled to sound like a news segment about UnitedHealthcare's decision to leave the insurance exchange in Arizona. \"Even after this breaking news that Arizona families will have fewer health care options, Ann Kirkpatrick still calls Obamacare her proudest vote,\" a narrator says. \"John McCain lad led the fight to repeal Obamacare and replace it with common-sense reforms to let Arizonans make their own health care choices.\" The ad is running in the Lakeside, Show Low, Safford and Flagstaff markets in the 1st District, which Kirkpatrick is vacating to run for Senate.\n\nMAPMAKING METHODS \u2014 Rauner backs Illinois redistricting reform ballot measure: \"Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner on Friday endorsed a petition-driven effort to allow voters to change the state constitution to reduce political influence in the redrawing of legislative boundaries, dismissing attempts by lawmakers to put their own redistricting proposals on the fall ballot,\" The Chicago Tribune's Rick Pearson and Kim Geiger report. \"Redistricting reform is part of Rauner's 'turnaround agenda,' which he has made a precondition for negotiating a state budget with the legislature.\" But the proposed changes would affect only state legislative districts, not congressional redistricting. http://trib.in/1Tpa1PL\n\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cWhy Rubio hasn\u2019t endorsed Cruz,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo: \u201cMarco Rubio won\u2019t be endorsing Ted Cruz during the Republican presidential primary, but he\u2019s likely to back the Texas senator at a contested convention \u2014 if it gets that far. The de facto plan, Rubio\u2019s backers say, is designed to help Cruz\u201d \u2014 but also protect Rubio's political future. \u201cImmediately after Rubio dropped out of the presidential contest following his home state March 15 loss, the Florida senator told supporters he would endorse Cruz under two conditions: if the Texas senator wanted the endorsement and if it would make a difference. But Rubio came to believe that neither Cruz nor he would really gain from an endorsement so far.\u201d http://politi.co/24tW9LP\n\n\u2014 \u201cClinton fundraising leaves little for state parties,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf: \u201cIn the days before Hillary Clinton launched an unprecedented big-money fundraising vehicle with state parties last summer, she vowed \u2018 to rebuild our party from the ground up,\u2019 proclaiming \u2018when our state parties are strong, we win. That\u2019s what will happen.\u2019 But less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by that effort has stayed in the state parties\u2019 coffers, according to a POLITICO analysis of the latest Federal Election Commission filings.\u201d Most of the $3.8 million that the vehicle has transferred to the state parties has been transferred subsequently to the Democratic National Committee by a Clinton staffer. http://politi.co/1Z2hfNM\n\n\u2014 \u201cTrump flops in Arizona delegate fight,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney: \u201cDonald Trump's campaign got burned again Saturday in the hunt for loyal delegates to the Republican national convention - this time on turf where he'd recently trounced his rivals in primary elections. Though the mogul's campaign showed more muscle than ever in this shadow primary, he walked away in defeat in Arizona - losing about 40 of the 55 delegate slots that were up for grabs on the day.\u201d http://politico.pro/1rLz1uu\n\n\u2014 \u201cGo-it-alone fund-raising might limit Donald Trump in fall,\u201d by The Boston Globe\u2019s Matt Viser: With Donald \u201cTrump closing in on the Republican nomination, there are growing questions over how he would come up with the $1 billion or more that is generally needed nowadays to run a presidential campaign, particularly one against a well-oiled Democratic fund-raising machine.\u201d If Trump intends to self-fund, \u201che could be challenged by the fact that much of his fortune is tied up in real estate and might be difficult to quickly transform into cash.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NgA7YW\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"I'd rather die.\" \u2014 John Podhoretz, the Commentary editor and conservative talking head, responding to a Breitbart News reporter's request for an interview on Sunday. http://bit.ly/1pWnQNY\n\n** A message from Sinclair Broadcast Group: News, opinions, and entertainment surround us 24/7, yet a fundamental truth remains, whether for competitive races or impactful ballot measures, the TV commercial reigns as the medium for reaching potential voters.
