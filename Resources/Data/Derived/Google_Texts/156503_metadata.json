The religious order spread throughout the world. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.\n\nThe late Pope John Paul II bent Vatican rules to allow the procedure to establish her case for sainthood to be launched two years after her death instead of the usual five. She was beatified in 2003, a mere six years after her death.\n\nIn the time since her death, some have accused Mother Teresa and the order of having ulterior motives in helping the\n\ndestitute, saying their aim was to convert them to Christianity.\n\nThe order rejects that, saying, for example, that most of those helped in the Kalighat Home for Dying Destitutes in\n\nKolkata were non-Christians with just a few days left to live and noting that conversion is a lengthy process.\n\nThe Church defines saints as those believed to have been holy enough during their lives to now be in Heaven and can intercede with God to perform miracles. She has been credited in the church with two miracles, both involving the healing of sick people.\n\n(Reporting By Philip Pullella; editing by Ralph Boulton; Editing by Ralph Boulton)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a nun who dedicated her life to he", "title": "Mother Teresa of Calcutta to be made Roman Catholic saint Sept. 4: pope", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/15/Mother-Teresa-Calcutta-be-made-Roman-Catholic-saint-Sept-4-pope", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/india_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/15/Mother-Teresa-Calcutta-be-made-Roman-Catholic-saint-Sept-4-pope", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/india_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a nun who dedicated her life to he", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a nun who dedicated her life to helping the poor, will be made a saint of the Roman Catholic Church at a ceremony on Sept. 4, Pope Francis announced on Tuesday.\nFrancis, who has made concern for the poor a major plank of his papacy, was keen to make Mother Teresa a saint during the Church's current Holy Year.\nIn the time since her death, some have accused Mother Teresa and the order of having ulterior motives in helping thedestitute, saying their aim was to convert them to Christianity.\nShe has been credited in the church with two miracles, both involving the healing of sick people.\nThe Vatican said the ceremony would take place at the Vatican, dashing hopes of Indians that the pope would go to Kolkata, as Calcutta is now called, to perform the ritual."}
