He brings a solution to the table.\u201d\n\nThe fundraising numbers are indeed competitive -- considering Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul -- a top-tier 2016 hopeful -- has purportedly raised roughly $4.7 million.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nBut while Carson might be able to match fundraising numbers, at least for now, the equally important question is whether he can assemble a campaign operation, considering he\u2019s not expected until next year to make a decision about running.\n\nSousa told FoxNews.com that his group, formally known as the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, has offers out now to three regional political directors while assembling volunteers, upgrading technology and performing other key tasks associated with building a campaign infrastructure.\n\nThe group is already running ads on cable TV and plans to start direct mailings and advertise in local markets to increase Carson\u2019s name recognition.\n\nSousa thinks Carson, an African-American and former director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University, can appeal to Republicans, so-called Reagan Democrats and take 17 percent of the minority vote.\n\n\u201cWe have a strategy that goes beyond saying, \u2018You need another black president,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to take away those voters from Democrats.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Carson continues to make speeches, write op-ed pieces and serve as a publisher for The Washington Times\u2019 new digital magazine for conservative blacks, American CurrentSee.\n\nThe Carson for president movement essentially started after his February 2013 Prayer Breakfast keynote speech in which he gave a unflattering assessment of American today, taking issue with everything from the size of the federal debt to the country\u2019s education system to lawyers in politics -- with President Obama sitting just a few feet away.\n\nSousa and others have tried since that time to draft Carson and have been energized recently by his strong showing in straw polls.\n\nLast month, Carson finished third in the Conservative Political Action Conference\u2019s poll and tied for third in the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference\u2019s poll.\n\nLast weekend, Carson restated his position that ObamaCare is part of the big government he wants to trim and that it moves Americans away from personal responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe issue is, the most important thing we have is our health care,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cDo we want that under government control?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Republicans,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 02:11:46 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Conservatives frustrated with the direction of the country think Dr. Ben Carson can change the course by winning the 2016 presidential race.
