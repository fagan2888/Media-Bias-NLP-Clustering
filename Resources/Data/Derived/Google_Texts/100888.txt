Rescue personnel from multiple agencies today are retrieving the body of an adult female which had been discovered Friday evening near the 2500 block of Flagstaff Road but could not be removed at night due to unsafe conditions.

Boulder County Sheriff's detectives along with detectives from the Boulder Police Department and investigators from the Boulder County Coroner's Office, members of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, and city of Boulder Parks and Open Space Officers returned to the area today to remove the victim.

Boulder County Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Oehlkers said the woman was possibly in her teens or early 20s, and that she is believed to be from Boulder.

"There is no foul play, nothing suspicious about it, at all," Oehlkers said.

The body was located in steep, rocky terrain at the base of a cliff estimated to be approximately 100 feet tall, according to a news release. When the body was discovered the conditions were deemed to be too unsafe for rescue personnel to remove her due to the heavy rain and thick fog at the time.

Teams returned to the site today to complete the removal, which was expected to take about three hours.

"I do not believe that it is an climbing incident," Oehlkers said. "It's either an accident or a suicide, but I can't say for sure. There is trauma."

He estimated the body had been in the location it was found for at least a couple of days.

The incident is currently being investigated by the sheriff's office and the Boulder County Coroner's Office.
