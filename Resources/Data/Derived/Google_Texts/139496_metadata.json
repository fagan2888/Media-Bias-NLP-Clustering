Tutt was shot and killed by one of the wounded deputies during the shooting.\n\nOperation Hoodoo Voodoo, a joint effort between the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, U.S. Marshals and the Drug Enforcement Administration has now netted a total of at least 16 arrests.\n\nOn Tuesday, task force investigators intercepted 44 pounds of methamphetamine with a street value of $2 million at Love\u2019s Truck Stop, 1800 Florida 559, in Polk City and arrested 13 suspects at various addresses around Lakeland, deputies said. During those arrests detectives seized tens of thousands of dollars, seven vehicles, approximately 100 weapons, bullet proof vests and thousands of rounds of ammunition, deputies said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 22 Mar 2014 14:19:34 -0400", "Description": "Two men connected to a methamphetamine ring with ties to a California supplier who sought help from a Voodoo priest were arrested Friday night in Plant City, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office s", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Two men connected to a methamphetamine ring with ties to a California supplier who sought help from a Voodoo priest were arrested Friday night in Plant City, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office s", "title": "\u2018Operation Hoodoo Voodoo\u2019 nets meth arrests in Plant City", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/plant-city/operation-hoodoo-voodoo-nets-meth-arrests-in-plant-city-20140322/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140322/ARTICLE/140329733/AR/0/AR-140329733.jpg", "height": 345}, "updated_time": "2014-03-22T14:30:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Two men connected to a methamphetamine ring with ties to a California supplier who sought help from a Voodoo priest were arrested Friday night in Plant City, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office", "title": "\u2018Operation Hoodoo Voodoo\u2019 nets meth arrests in Plant City", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140322/ARTICLE/140329733/AR/0/AR-140329733.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-22T14:19:34Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-22T14:30:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Operation Hoodoo Voodoo, a joint effort between the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, U.S.\nDeputies also said Scott and Widdows were associated with Matthew Tutt, a suspect who shot two Polk County deputies in June 2010.\nTwo men connected to a methamphetamine ring with ties to a California supplier who sought help from a Voodoo priest were arrested Friday night in Plant City, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nTyler Scott, 25, and Josh Widdows, 30, both from Lakeland, were arrested at a residence on Shelby Brook Drive after detectives and U.S.\nThe arrests were part of an ongoing effort labeled Operation Hoodoo Voodoo, which is targeting a crime group accused of distributing large amounts of methamphetamine in Lake, Orange, Osceola, Polk and Seminole counties."}
