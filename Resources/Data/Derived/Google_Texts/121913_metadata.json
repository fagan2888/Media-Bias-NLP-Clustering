Tim Neville, a Republican from Littleton, hit several conservative GOP talking points while speaking to about 30 activists at Citrola\u2019s Italian Grill, calling for a change in philosophy in government, lashing out at Planned Parenthood and calling for a smaller government.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Neville said, needs to be \u201cgutted and retooled,\u201d and the cost of regulation, which he said amounted to $15,000 per family per year, slashed.\n\nEPA involvement in the Animas River spill last summer demonstrated that the agency is getting little done to improve the environment, Neville said.\n\n\u201cGovernment has gotten so big that it\u2019s telling you what you can wear, what kind of car you can drive, what kind of fuel you can put in it,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThe answer is smaller government, and Michael Bennet and Barack Obama are not going to do that.\u201d\n\nDuring his time in the state Senate, he\u2019s been \u201ca thorn in the side of liberal Democrats, and liberal Republicans, too,\u201d Neville said.\n\nNeville said that he would sponsor right-to-work legislation in the Senate, as well as a life-at-conception act.\n\nPlanned Parenthood \u201ckills the unborn and sells their body parts,\u201d he said, calling for \u201can end to this madness.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cObamacare debacle\u201d needs to be corrected, he said, likening the Affordable Care Act to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which he said is failing to meet the needs of veterans.\n\nBorder enforcement needs to be strengthened while welfare benefits should be denied to those who enter the country illegally, Neville said.\n\nNeville was accompanied by one of his sons, state Rep. Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, who said his father took him to the funerals of his Columbine High School classmates who died in the April 20, 1999, shootings so he could \u201cfind meaning in that horrific tragedy.\u201d\n\nTim Neville is one of nearly a dozen Republican candidates seeking to face Bennet. Others include Ryan Frazier, a former Aurora city councilman and previous candidate for Congress, businessman Robert Blaha, state Rep. Jon Keyser of Morrison, Jefferson County Commissioner Don Rosier and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/senate-hopeful-swipes-at-bennet/", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - The first of a flock of Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate to visit Grand Junction asked supporters on Saturday to join in a", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - The first of a flock of Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate to visit Grand Junction asked supporters on Saturday to join in a", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-01T23:53:25-0600", "DC.creator": "Gary Harmon", "keywords": "colorado rep. patrick neville,colorado senate,colorado state sen. tim neville,u.s. sen. michael bennet,u.s. senate", "DC.date.created": "2016-01-17T05:20:07-0700", "DC.subject": "colorado rep. patrick neville,colorado senate,colorado state sen. tim neville,u.s. sen. michael bennet,u.s. senate", "DC.title": "Senate hopeful swipes at Bennet  |  GJSentinel.com", "DC.date.modified": "2016-01-18T17:42:08-0700", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d08\"", "article_summary": "Senate hopeful swipes at BennetThe first of a flock of Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate to visit Grand Junction asked supporters on Saturday to join in a \u201crevolution\u201d to oust the incumbent, Democrat Michael Bennet, in November.\nNeville said that he would sponsor right-to-work legislation in the Senate, as well as a life-at-conception act.\nOthers include Ryan Frazier, a former Aurora city councilman and previous candidate for Congress, businessman Robert Blaha, state Rep.
