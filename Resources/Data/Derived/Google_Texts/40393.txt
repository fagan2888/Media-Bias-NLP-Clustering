Black holes attract the attention of astronomers as they are known for drawing material towards their core with a very high gravitational force. Therefore, when astronomers spotted black hole RX J1131-1231, they observed it in detail to get more information regarding formation and its characteristics.

The black hole is said to be around six billion light years away. It has been found that the black hole RX J1131-1231 spins over at half the speed of light. The black hole's gravitational lens helped researchers know the rotational speed of the black hole.

The observation is said to be a historic one as it has happened for the first time that direct measurements have been taken of the distant black hole's rotational speed.

"Because of this gravitational lens, we were able to get very detailed information on the X-ray spectrum - that is, the amount of X-rays seen at different energies - from RX J1131", said Mark Reynolds, one of the researchers in the study.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton telescope were used to study and observe the black hole. As per researchers, the spin rate of the black hole is said to be around 90% of the maximum value permitted by General Relativity, which is about half the speed of light.

NASA said such a fast spin rate gives an idea that the black hole has grown through mergers and not through pulling materials in from different directions.

Dr. Reynolds said as the black holes grow in size, it forms a disk of gas and dust around them. The inner regions of the disk become quite hot and a corona of hot gas and electrons form above the disk.

Corona performs the duty of ionizing X-ray radiations and bounces off the inner disk. These X-rays were measured by the scientists to know the exact spin rate of the black hole. The study titled, 'Reflection from the strong gravity regime in a lensed quasar at redshift z = 0.658' has been published in the journal Nature.
