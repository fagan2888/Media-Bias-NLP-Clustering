Is there anyone who understands the angst of conservatives better than Roy? He\u2019s our man on the ground at CPAC \u2014 Ed.\n\nThe crowd loves Dr. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who once sassed Obama and is now mentioned, at least by this website, as a Presidential contender. No wonder: He gesticulates like other politicians, but no matter how much his arms wave his voice remains sweet, gentle-sounding, almost hushed.\n\nCarson wanted to set straight some \u201clies\u201d progressives were telling about him. \u201cI still believe that marriage is between a man and a woman,\u201d said Carson, and when the applause died down continued, \u201cand because I happen to mention that nobody gets to change the definition of marriage\u2026 progressives say I equate homosexuality and bestiality.\u201d (They also say he apologized for saying whatever it was he said, but that can\u2019t be true, since he said nothing offensive.)\n\nNor, Carson said, did he ever say \u201cObamacare and slavery are the same thing.\u201d What he said, according to the Washington Post, was, \u201cObamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u201c; but what he really meant, Carson patiently explained, was that the government \u201chas shifted the power that was given to us, it\u2019s the most massive shift in power in America that has ever occurred,\u201d which is not slavery. Also, Carson said, \u201cIn Germany people did not believe it what Hitler was doing and they didn\u2019t speak up,\u201d which was not the same thing as \u201cprogressives are Nazis\u201d even though he was explicitly talking about Obama and America. Yet progressives \u201crepeat these lies because they cannot argue the actual facts.\u201d\n\nThe punch line: Carson then accused progressives of \u201cdemonizing\u201d conservatives.\n\nCarson also said that some people were boycotting his supporters because they believed Carson was spreading \u201cpoison,\u201d and he asked, we believe rhetorically, \u201cI wonder what poison that would be? Would that be the poison of self-reliance and self-respect? Would that be\u2026\u201d Then he named a lot of other nice things which progressives maybe think are poison.\n\nOther tidbits from Carson\u2019s speech: \u201cI know there are a lot of people in that 47 percent who are decent, hardworking people.\u201d On the condition of America today: \u201cThe ship is about the sail off Niagara Falls and we\u2019re all going to be killed.\u201d Carson also asked supporters to go out and get old people to vote, even if they say, \u201cI\u2019ve given up on America, I\u2019m just waiting to die.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nCraig Bergman was walking around in the lobby at CPAC with this poster, trying to get people to see a documentary called UnFair, which promises to \u201creveal the truth about the abuses of power, the cover ups, and expose the IRS as a blatantly unfair and corrupt entity which is unable to be reformed and therefore must be abolished.\u201d He\u2019s also the film\u2019s producer and the interlocutor, appearing throughout as himself, a muckraking documentarian. He\u2019s never done a movie before, but \u201chey, if Michael Moore can do it\u2026\u201d he says.\n\nI saw part of the film, in which Bergman\u2019s interviews of conservative politicians like Trey Gowdy and Mike Huckabee are interspersed with interviews of common folk who have had bad trouble with the IRS \u2014 not just the famous tea-party non-profits, but also apparently non-political outrages like the $50,000 fine a Round Rock VFW post got for soliciting donations for a charity event. Though Obama seems to have had nothing to do with the VFW fine, images of him and his wife are stuck onto that section so people know whom to hiss. There are also some found-footage inserts that are humorous, or at least were found so by the crowd. It\u2019s either a reverse or a Bizarro Michael Moore thing, depending on your POV.\n\nHow does a picture like this get sold? \u201cWell,\u201d said Bergman, \u201cyou go to events like CPAC and you show it to people.\u201d If they think they can make money on it, added Bergman, they invest. You mean they don\u2019t just expect to get the message out \u2014 they expect to make money, too? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Bergman. He says he\u2019s working with John Sullivan, a producer on Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s anti-Obama documentary 2016: Obama\u2019s America,, which is one of the most successful documentaries of all time. \u201cThe industry standard is 15 percent, 20 percent return on investment,\u201d said Bergman. \u201cIt\u2019s not a donation.\u201d He picked up his poster and headed to the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nThere are some little tech breakout sections at CPAC, offered by vendors on the theory that some of these folks want to do actual politics and will see the sense of rectifying the notorious digital gap between Democrats and Republicans with products. Sometimes the salesmen try to speak the native lingo, as with the \u201cBeyond Politically Correct: How to Configure WordPress for Success\u201d session competing for CPAC gawker attention with a workshop on organizing tool NationBuilder conducted by \u201cCertified NationBuilder Expert & Architect\u201d Ian Patrick Hines (pictured).\n\nHines is a little bundle of technerd who knows how to work it for the suits. \u201cNationalBuilder does not do consulting \u2014 this is super-super important,\u201d he stressed. What it does is help you sign up supporters, campaign workers, and donors. A slide comes up that describes NationBuilder as a \u201ccommunity organizing system,\u201d and no one walked out, though it\u2019s \u201cnot a term you hear very often in the right-of-center universe,\u201d said Hines, because community organizing is not just an Obama joke \u2014 it\u2019s also what they want to do.\n\nI only caught one little sop to the nature of the event in his pitch: Hines claiming that some of his fellow techies were appalled that he was coming to CPAC, because (he related in a goofy voice) \u201conly liberals should have access to this technology, you\u2019re betraying the cause.\u201d Hines countered that this is \u201ca non-partisan political tool.\u201d None of the handful of potential buyers responded at all to this: Silly-liberal jokes mean one thing in the big hall, and nothing at all wherever making money is being discussed.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Ben_Carson2-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "CPAC: Dr. Ben Carson takes on the liberal \u2018lies\u2019 about him"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd910\"", "article_summary": "The crowd loves Dr. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who once sassed Obama and is now mentioned, at least by this website, as a Presidential contender.\nYet progressives \u201crepeat these lies because they cannot argue the actual facts.\u201dThe punch line: Carson then accused progressives of \u201cdemonizing\u201d conservatives.\nCarson wanted to set straight some \u201clies\u201d progressives were telling about him.\nCarson also said that some people were boycotting his supporters because they believed Carson was spreading \u201cpoison,\u201d and he asked, we believe rhetorically, \u201cI wonder what poison that would be?\nNo wonder: He gesticulates like other politicians, but no matter how much his arms wave his voice remains sweet, gentle-sounding, almost hushed."}
