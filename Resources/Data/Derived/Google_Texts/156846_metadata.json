Blunt says govt. shutdown a mistake; defunding Obamacare an error\n\nST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) \u2013 Highlighting the growing split in the GOP ranks over the government shutdown, Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt refused to assign them the total blame for the shutdown. \u201cThere\u2019s enough blame here to go around.\u201d Blunt says the shutdown was a mistake, and that tying the shutdown to de-funding Obamacare was a major error.\n\n\u201cMy view of this from the very first was that it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Blunt said in a conference call with Missouri reporters. \u201cWhen you have the government shut down and the president\u2019s health care initiative launches that same day is one indication of why I thought it wouldn\u2019t work. It should never have happened.\u201d\n\nBlunt said he has spoken to military personnel at Scot Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood, and had been told that the shutdown is hurting military morale. \u201cThe civilian employees who work there play a vital role. They have bills to pay, and they\u2019ve been sent home without paychecks. This is also damaging national security. Around half of the employees at the CIA have been furloughed, and our enemies around the world know that.\u201d\n\nBlunt also raised the prospect that the shutdown could extend for another two weeks, until Congress has to pass an increase in the national debt ceiling by October 17. If the ceiling is not extended, the U.S. government could begin defaulting on some of it\u2019s debts. \u201cIf this thing isn\u2019t ended in the next 24 to 48 hours, it won\u201dt end until the debt ceiling problem is resolved,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means this will go on longer than anyone wants it too.\u201d\n\nDespite his disagreements with Republicans Tea Party members in the House, the Republican Senator refused to assign the blame to them. \u201cThere\u2019s anough blame in this to go around,\u201d said Blunt. \u201cThe President refuses to lead. The House and Senate can\u2019t do their jobs.\u201d\n\n@RoyBlunt says he kept his office open, employees paid as public service to constituents. Says shutdown has put half of CIA put on leave. \u2014 Charles Jaco (@charlesjaco1) October 2, 2013\n\n@RoyBlunt says Obamacare defund attempt won't work, wouldn't work.
