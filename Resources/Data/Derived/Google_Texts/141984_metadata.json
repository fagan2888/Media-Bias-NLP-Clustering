More than 90 percent of larger Michigan employers offer health insurance, she said.\n\n\n\n\"(2013) showed a surprising blip, an anomaly, where we saw an increase in small firms offering health insurance (to 40 percent of companies), said Udow-Phillips, who couldn't account for the blip.\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has projected that over the next decade the Affordable Care Act will lead to a 4 percent reduction in employer-sponsored coverage as firms drop coverage and some workers switch to other coverage options. Since 2009, the share of employers offering coverage has dropped to 57 percent last year from 59 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Kluge, CEO of Michigan Business and Professional Association in Warren, said one unnamed company with more than 100 workers decided to pay the IRS penalty this year because it did not offer every eligible employee insurance. The penalty ranges from $2,000 to $3,000 per employee.\n\n\n\n\"The ACA is hindering their growth plans as they are not sure if they can make additional hires,\" said Kluge. \"If they go up in staff (they have an acquisition opportunity), they have to recalculate if they prefer to offer coverage or to pay a penalty.\"\n\n\n\nKluge said several other member companies have experienced rate increases of 30 percent to 40 percent. To lower costs, some have purchased high-deductible policies and passed along increased costs to employees.\n\n\n\nBut some small companies have experienced improvements in health benefit costs by shopping around and making other adjustments.\n\n\n\nMichael Wilson, owner of Cardus Inc., a Farmington Hills-based health care information technology company, said health care costs are lower now than three years ago. He employs 32 full-time and 10 part-time workers.\n\n\n\n\"We were paying $300 per employee in 2013 to Blue Cross and they canceled our policy and gave us a new rate of $490 per employee\" for 2014, Wilson said. Wilson said he purchased a lower-cost policy in 2014 through United Healthcare for $350 per employee. Last year, United cut its rates to $330 an employee after Wilson decided to cover only his younger information technology staff.\n\n\n\n\"I have a medical transcription business (with older workers) and went to a health reimbursement account where I contribute 50 percent (half of premium) or up to $175 per employee,\" he said.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The decline comes despite a relatively low 2.8 percent average annual increase in health insurance premiums from 2009 to 2014 for small businesses with less than 50 employees.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "The decline comes despite a relatively low 2.8 percent average annual increase in health insurance premiums from 2009 to 2014 for small businesses with less than 50 employees.", "title": "Survey notes drop in small businesses offering health insurance", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160214/NEWS/302149990/survey-notes-drop-in-small-businesses-offering-health-insurance", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20160214/NEWS/302149990/AR/0/Marianne_Udow-Phillips.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health care reform", "published_time": "2016-02-14T08:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-14T23:14:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "article_summary": "Survey notes drop in small businesses offering health insuranceThe number of small companies offering health insurance in 2014 dropped to 33 percent from 40 percent in 2013, according to a new study by the Ann Arbor-based Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation.\nMichael Wilson, owner of Cardus Inc., a Farmington Hills-based health care information technology company, said health care costs are lower now than three years ago.\nMore than 90 percent of larger Michigan employers offer health insurance, she said.\nThe decline comes despite a relatively low 2.8 percent average annual increase in health insurance premiums from 2009 to 2014 for small businesses with less than 50 employees.\nSince 2009, the share of employers offering coverage has dropped to 57 percent last year from 59 percent."}
