Health Connector Website Costs Rise To $281 Million\n\nThe cost of setting up the Massachusetts health insurance website under the rules of Obamacare is rising again, this time by $47.2 million.\n\nAdditional fixes bring the total price tag for the Connector site that failed two years ago and the new flawed replacement to $281 million. And this isn\u2019t the final bill.\n\nConnector leaders are considering two significant changes \u2014 a new payment tool and an easy physician search option \u2014 which could push the costs over $300 million.\n\n\u2018It Shouldn\u2019t Be That Difficult\u2019\n\nA lot of the current Connector website headaches begin when members try to make a payment.\n\nPaul Conway, a 61-year-old self-employed carpenter from Arlington, signed up for insurance through the Connector at the beginning of the year. He sent in his first $700 payment and began receiving monthly bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m holding one in my hand,\u201d Conway says during a phone interview. \u201cWhen I look at, it says \u2018previous balance zero, past due balance zero,\u2019 so I just assumed it was going to the right place.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t. The payments he\u2019d sent in, which now total $3,500, went to Conway\u2019s old account through the Connector. It wasn\u2019t until he called his health plan with a question that he realized he\u2019d been sending payments to the wrong Connector account and was uninsured.\n\n\u201cThank God I haven\u2019t had any issues because I have been going four months without health insurance,\u201d Conways says.\n\nConway has spent those four months trying to clear up the problem through the Connector call center, dialing the 1-800 number and hitting prompts that lead to a dead end. He\u2019d call back and sit on hold. Each time he reached a person, he had to tell his story from the beginning. He couldn\u2019t be transferred to anyone in billing \u2014 they would have to call him back. In four months, he got one call back, on a Friday evening at 6:30 p.m., which he missed.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it should take four months to clear up this problem; it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult,\u201d Conway says.\n\nHe is worried he\u2019ll have to pay a penalty for the months he was listed as uninsured. A Connector spokesman says Conway should have the option of a waiver, or could appeal.\n\n\u2018It Should Operate Like A Bank\u2019\n\nLouis Gutierrez, the Connector executive director, agrees: Once a member chooses a plan and makes a payment, he or she should be all set.\n\n\u201cThe whole process from that point forward, to you being insured through the carrier, should operate like clockwork, it should operate like a bank,\u201d Gutierrez says.\n\nBut bringing the Connector site to that level of precision will cost about $47 million.\n\n\u201cRight now, there are just many bumps in the road,\u201d Gutierrez says. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better at smoothing the bumps, but I could go almost any point in the process.\u201d\n\nHe mentions a problem that cropped up just this week, in which Connector members who caught up on insurance payments were moved from delinquent to paid, but their coverage was not renewed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big problem and it\u2019s that kind of thing we need to work through,\u201d Gutierrez says.\n\nStill, the Connector is making progress. Wait times at the call center are down, most refunds have been paid, and the backlog of account changes is clearing. The Connector will find out if confidence is rebounding when it launches a survey option through the call center later this year.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "And the total price tag for the updated website, which is still riddled with problems, could top $300 million.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "And the total price tag for the updated website, which is still riddled with problems, could top $300 million.", "title": "Mass.
