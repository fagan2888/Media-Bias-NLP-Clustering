Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) presented an enticing challenge. In an interview with the New York Times, Roberts said he sleeps on a friend's recliner on the rare occasions he returns to Kansas. Later, in a radio interview, he admitted that he tries to return to Kansas \"every time I get an opponent.\" Roberts might have been in trouble against a serious challenger. Instead he faced political newcomer Milton Wolf, whom he dispatched by seven points on Tuesday.\n\nWolf's qualifications as a Kansas tea party activist began with his family tree. He is a second cousin of President Barack Obama\u2014whom he compared to Hitler\u2014and a doctor, qualifications that earned him invitations to appear on cable news and talk radio to critique the Affordable Care Act as an unconstitutional attack on Americans' liberties. But Wolf's hopes of becoming the next great conservative insurgent candidate died in February at a Topeka diner, where a reporter from the Topeka Capital-Journal confronted him about images on his Facebook page (deleted before the campaign) of x-rays he'd taken of gunshot victims. Although billed as a tea party vs. establishment showdown, the Roberts-Wolf race was more of a referendum on social media protocol. And in Kansas, the verdict is clear: You shouldn't post x-rays of gunshot victims on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Note to future candidates: don't post x-rays of gunshot victims on Facebook.", "title": "The Obama cousin who compared Obama to Hitler just lost his Kansas GOP primary", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/08/milton-wolf-pat-roberts-facebook-photos", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/mwolf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"creator": "timothypmurphy", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/08/milton-wolf-pat-roberts-facebook-photos", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/mwolf.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/mwolf.jpg"}, "title": "The Obama cousin who compared Obama to Hitler just lost his Kansas GOP primary", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Elections", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d94\"", "article_summary": "Later, in a radio interview, he admitted that he tries to return to Kansas \"every time I get an opponent.\"\nAlthough billed as a tea party vs. establishment showdown, the Roberts-Wolf race was more of a referendum on social media protocol.\nWolf's qualifications as a Kansas tea party activist began with his family tree.\nAnd in Kansas, the verdict is clear: You shouldn't post x-rays of gunshot victims on Facebook.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Roberts said he sleeps on a friend's recliner on the rare occasions he returns to Kansas."}
