When pollsters break Obamacare apart, nearly all of the individual pieces are well regarded. But when they ask about Obamacare as a single, hulking policy, it\u2019s derided. Americans trust the parts, but not the whole.\n\nIn a March 2014 poll, the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed 1,504 adults about nine components of the law and found that only the individual mandate lacked majority support. In fact, even among Republicans, all but two of the surveyed elements enjoyed majority support, including the expansion of Medicaid that is at issue in states across the country.\n\nMore Politics\n\nBut the law itself consistently has more opponents than supporters. In April 2014, 46 percent of Americans polled had an unfavorable view of Obamacare, while 38 percent had a favorable view. And in a telling indicator, GOP candidates have been using Obamacare in their ads this primary season. Once a law becomes the subject of attack ads, it\u2019s a good bet it\u2019s not overwhelmingly popular.\n\nToday, we take that unpopularity for granted. But the law\u2019s architects cobbled together a complex bill so that everyone could find something to like. Seniors were sure to appreciate that the law closed the \u201cdonut hole\u201d in prescription drug coverage. Young adults could stay on their parents\u2019 insurance longer. Those with pre-existing medical conditions could buy health insurance at the same prices as others. The uninsured became more likely to qualify for Medicaid and were now able to buy plans on new insurance exchanges. Seen in that light, the law\u2019s unpopularity is not a fact to be assumed but a puzzle to be explained.\n\nBut that puzzle can\u2019t be explained by \u201cdeath panels\u201d or either party\u2019s messaging on the issue. It also seems unlikely that a substantial share of the opposition to Obamacare comes from those who wanted to see more sweeping health care reforms.\n\nInstead, the public\u2019s disapproval of Obamacare considered as a whole points to Americans\u2019 broader relationship with the government, and our unwillingness to trust that it can accomplish what it sets out to do.\n\nOne political scientist, Vanderbilt University\u2019s Marc Hetherington, has been doing work on political trust since before the Obama presidency. His 2006 book \u201cWhy Trust Matters\u201d managed to anticipate the country\u2019s response to the 2010 health care law surprisingly well. In it, Hetherington investigated why American public policy has moved rightward since the 1960s even though public opinion hasn\u2019t become markedly more conservative. His answer: There\u2019s been a decline in our trust in government.\n\nDuring a period of high trust like the early 1960s, Americans were confident that the government could accomplish what it set out to accomplish \u2014 and were willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. A War on Poverty? Sign us up, even if we were also trying to put the first person on the moon. And fighting a major war in southeast Asia. In 1966, Chief Justice Earl Warren said that President Lyndon Johnson had been \u201cworking hard on Vietnam and has been for a long time. \u2026 He will find some way out.\u201d At the time trust was high, and much of the country agreed.\n\nDuring a period of low trust, however, we might endorse a policy in theory but oppose it in practice because we doubt the government\u2019s ability to make it happen.\n\nSince LBJ\u2019s time, Americans\u2019 trust in the federal government has fallen, though it has rebounded somewhat during periods of economic growth.\n\nIn Hetherington\u2019s view, a lack of trust particularly plagues policies that target disadvantaged populations, as Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion does. Those are the policies that benefit relatively few Americans directly, forcing most people to trust the government to spend the money wisely without seeing any of the effects themselves. Social Security, on the other hand, benefits most older people: Even if you\u2019re not receiving Social Security today, you probably know somebody who is, so it\u2019s easy enough to see if the program is working. You don\u2019t need to trust when you can verify.\n\nIn the same vein, we might expect trust to shape public opinion more when assessing policies that are complex amalgams, as Obamacare is. After all, some of the law\u2019s more popular elements aren\u2019t especially complicated (say, young adults staying on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26, or banning discrimination against those with pre-existing conditions). But as a whole, the legislation is a highly complex balancing act of federal and state policymaking, to say nothing of the insurers, hospitals and other private actors involved.\n\nTo test how trust influences public opinion, I fielded a survey using GfK\u2019s nationally sampled online panel in late 2011 with colleagues at Georgetown University. GfK maintains a national online panel recruited via off-line techniques, so it includes people from a wide range of places and backgrounds. People without Internet access are in the mix as well.\n\nI randomly assigned people to two groups. The first was a control group: It provided a baseline for how people\u2019s trust in government relates to their attitudes toward Obamacare. The second group I primed with an anti-government argument to test if distrusting rhetoric might affect the relationship between trust in government and attitudes about Obamacare.\n\nI asked respondents in the first group whether their views of the \u201chealth reform bill signed into law in 2010\u201d were generally favorable or unfavorable. For these respondents, their trust in government \u2014 asked weeks beforehand \u2014 was a reasonably strong and statistically significant predictor of their attitudes toward health care reform, even accounting for their partisanship, ideology and approval of President Obama (among other things). Imagine two liberal Democrats who approve of Obama. One trusts the federal government \u201cjust about always\u201d while the other trusts it \u201calmost never,\u201d but that\u2019s the only way in which they differ. The gap between how those two Democrats feel about Obamacare is about a quarter the size of the gap between Democrats and Republicans. Distrusting liberal Democrats were much less favorable toward the health care law than were more trusting liberal Dems.\n\nOther randomly selected respondents received a different version of the questionnaire, one that first asked them to read an anti-Obamacare argument grounded in trust. Specifically, it explained that a senator had recently argued:\n\nHealth care is one of the most complicated issues we face. It involves 1 of every 6 dollars spent here in the United States. The health care system includes millions of doctors and nurses and thousands of hospitals and clinics. Together, they regularly make decisions that can mean life or death. The government in Washington can\u2019t even balance its own budget. We certainly can\u2019t trust it to run something as complicated as the health care system.\n\nSure, this was a hypothetical argument I wrote in the fall of 2011. But similar claims spread across the country in the fall of 2013 after the botched roll-out of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to insurance coverage under Obamacare. And they have been a staple of arguments against government programs for decades.\n\nFor the respondents who read the senator\u2019s argument about trust, the relationship between their trust in the federal government and health care attitudes nearly doubled as compared to those who hadn\u2019t read the argument. Imagine two more respondents, both of whom are again strong Democrats and ideologically liberal. Before the survey, one said she trusted the government \u201cjust about always,\u201d and the second said he trusted the government \u201chardly ever.\u201d After hearing from the distrustful senator, the trusting respondent is predicted to assess health care reform at a 3.31, where 3 is \u201csomewhat favorable\u201d and 4 is \u201cvery favorable.\u201d But her low-trusting counterpart comes in at 2.78, between \u201csomewhat favorable\u201d and \u201csomewhat unfavorable.\u201d In the earlier case with no argument about trust, the trust gap was 0.30, and now it\u2019s grown to 0.53. That\u2019s a big difference on a four-point scale given that we\u2019ve held partisanship, ideology and even approval of Obama constant. In fact, it\u2019s now almost half the average difference between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nTrust matters. It matters above and beyond partisanship, above and beyond ideology. And it\u2019s especially important in an environment where politicians are explicitly talking about trust. In other words, Americans\u2019 distrust of government can become a political weapon. The experiment suggests that appealing to distrust provides an avenue for the GOP to bring untrusting Democrats closer to their vantage point.\n\nIn today\u2019s politics, low trust in government seems to work primarily against the Democratic Party, which is both in control of the presidency and has a more activist domestic agenda. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine how low trust could undercut GOP policy goals, too. If the government isn\u2019t trusted to implement insurance exchanges, it might also be hard to trust it on capital punishment, or to rebuild a foreign country. Ironically, low trust might prove a barrier to a policy like privatizing Social Security. Low trust could even make it difficult to balance congressional leadership with a conservative constituency (see Cantor, Eric).\n\nLow trust in government can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In a low-trust environment, politicians who want to expand the government\u2019s role face a conundrum. Even when the public is supportive of their policy goals, Americans might well doubt the government\u2019s capacity to deliver on those goals. And that in turn might encourage the architects of public policy to hide the government\u2019s role, leading to public policies that are at once highly complex and obscured from view. That\u2019s not a great recipe for rebuilding trust in government. But it\u2019s an apt description of Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Americans are still of two minds about the health care reform law.
