Some of them can stop infections or put an end to bleeding in as little as 15 seconds, while others can detect bed sores before they even become visible. Now researchers from MIT have created one out of a malleable polymer equipped with sensors that\u2019s capable of stretching over your skin and healing wounds fast.\n\nXuanhe Zhao, an associate professor in MIT\u2019s Department of Mechanical Engineering, has been developing a hydrogel bandage, made of highly absorbent polymer chains, that\u2019s capable of being stretched to nearly double its length (as seen in the video below) to cover wounds in areas where placing a traditional bandage would be difficult. It\u2019s also been embedded with sensors for monitoring temperature, and indicating when medicine stores are running low, so they can be pumped through drug-delivery channels into reservoirs, where they\u2019re held and administered as needed.\n\nAll of these sensors can be monitored via a smartphone, giving doctors and other medical professionals insight into how the wound is healing and if the medicine is working. It would also allow them to monitor patients\u2019 temperatures in order to look for fever. This so-called \u201csmart wound dressing\u201d is very similar to the recently announced Ibuprofen patch.\n\nThough they\u2019re made up of 90 percent water, hydrogels are normally inflexible, easily broken, and unable to effectively stick to electronic materials. In wound care, hydrogels are used to absorb fluids like blood, while keeping the wound area moist to promote a better healing environment. Though he didn\u2019t specify how, Zhao said his team made the adhesive strong enough to not only attach to electronics, but also metal, glass, aluminum, bronze, and more \u2014 making it applicable outside of medicine.\n\n\"Human tissues are soft and wet, but electronic devices are mostly hard and dry,\" Zhao told the Daily Dot. \"We propose to use hydrogels with similar mechanical and physiological properties as human tissues to form long-term high-efficacy interfaces between human body and electronics.\"\n\nThough the bandage might initially be used to treat burns or surface injuries like cuts or scrapes, Zhao believes it can be used for a variety of other applications \u2014 he imagines it being used underneath the skin or on the brain to deliver neural probes.\n\n\u201cThe brain is a bowl of Jell-O,\u201d Zhao said in a press release. \u201cCurrently, researchers are trying different soft materials to achieve long-term biocompatibility of neural devices. With collaborators, we are proposing to use robust hydrogel as an ideal material for neural devices, because the hydrogel can be designed to possess similar mechanical and physiological properties as the brain.\u201d\n\nHydrogels are increasingly being used in a variety of other, non-wound-healing ways. For example, a team of researchers are currently looking at how it can be used in the next generation of condoms, which contain anti-HIV properties. Other researchers are using it to replace surgical implants for drug delivery, or as an aid to build 3D-printed blood vessels. Needless to say, there seems to be a bright future for hydrogels in health care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "electric bandage, hydrogel, band-aid, heal wounds", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers have created an electric bandage using a stretchy hydrogel that will heal wounds faster, monitor a patient's temperature, and administer drugs when needed.", "title": "Band-Aid Of The Future May Heal Wounds Faster Than Ever", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/band-aid-future-mit-develops-electronic-bandage-heals-wounds-faster-364814", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/10/electric-bandage.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers have created an electric bandage using a stretchy hydrogel that will heal wounds faster, monitor a patient's temperature, and administer drugs when needed.", "title": "Band-Aid Of The Future May Heal Wounds Faster Than Ever", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/band-aid-future-mit-develops-electronic-bandage-heals-wounds-faster-364814", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/10/electric-bandage.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/10/electric-bandage.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-12-10T17:40:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-10T17:40:31-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers have created an electric bandage using a stretchy hydrogel that will heal wounds faster, monitor a patient's temperature, and administer drugs when needed."}, "article_summary": "\"We propose to use hydrogels with similar mechanical and physiological properties as human tissues to form long-term high-efficacy interfaces between human body and electronics.\"\nNow researchers from MIT have created one out of a malleable polymer equipped with sensors that\u2019s capable of stretching over your skin and healing wounds fast.\nIn wound care, hydrogels are used to absorb fluids like blood, while keeping the wound area moist to promote a better healing environment.\n\"Human tissues are soft and wet, but electronic devices are mostly hard and dry,\" Zhao told the Daily Dot.\nThough they\u2019re made up of 90 percent water, hydrogels are normally inflexible, easily broken, and unable to effectively stick to electronic materials."}
