Ben Carson said the scandal that’s emerging within the walls of the Department of Veterans Affairs is actually a blessing because it reveals some important insights to Americans: that government is truly not to be trusted.

“I think what’s happening with the veterans is a gift from God, to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider,” the neurosurgeon told Fox News.

Americans should take note of the bungling and failures that are being revealed, and learn a valuable lesson: What are the chances of Obamacare proving any more successful in providing care?

“And if we can’t get it right, with the relatively small number of veterans, how in the world are you going to do it with the entire population? You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out,” he said, The Blaze reported.
