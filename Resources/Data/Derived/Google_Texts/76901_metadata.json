How their faces must have dropped when Woodward suggested that investigators should \u201cfollow the trail\u201d of their front-runner\u2019s emails. Is Hillarygate unprecedented or really just Nixon 2.0?\n\nIronies abound, not the least of which is that the search for mishandled emails will inevitably grow larger as more eyewitnesses are located and deposed, their once-private files seized and scrutinized. Having conducted such investigations as an Army counter-intelligence officer, it always surprised me when a close friend or trusted business associate would suddenly reveal derogatory information about the person we were investigating. They became even more talkative the closer you came to the delicate issue of their own complicity, even if it was only partial. \u201cSir, the best way to secure your own position is to tell us everything you know about this case. Right now, you\u2019re a witness, not a subject.\u201d Exactly that same process is proceeding apace right now. As it expands, that investigation may lead to other Clinton concealments, from personal corruption in her foundation to her highly ambiguous role in Benghazi.\n\nThe current ironies were also predictable for the few who really knew Hillary Clinton. Until quite recently, it was hard for the rest of us to imagine someone so fiercely protective of her own reputation that she would use a private email server. Only Mrs. Clinton would have placed her own interests ahead of every government procedure for safeguarding information that rightfully belongs to the American citizens who paid her salary. So who knew her that well?\n\nWriting for Insight, former Justice Department attorney Sidney Powell argues that other knowing participants \u201cin Clintonmail.com\u201d likely included the top of the White House food-chain: President Obama and \u201cAll His Muses \u2014Counter-terrorism advisor Lisa Monaco, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, and then White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler (not to mention Valerie Jarrett.\u201d Mrs. Powell then asks, \u201cwhy hasn\u2019t the DOJ subpoenaed the emails from any of the recipients\u2014or the internet service providers?\u201d\n\nGood question, especially since it involves National Security Advisor Susan Rice. Right after Benghazi, Ms. Rice famously insisted on all the Sunday talk-shows that the American consulate had been attacked by flash-mobs protesting an anti-Islamic video. By then of course, she knew full well that the attack had been a well-coordinated terrorist assault. But K.T. McFarland of Fox News was the first major analyst to wonder: Why was Susan Rice acting as administration spoke-person for an attack on an American diplomatic facility? Wasn\u2019t that properly the job of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?\n\nOf course it was. But a woman so self-serving that she maintained her own email server was also smart enough to avoid being caught in an obvious lie. So hapless Susan Rice was sacrificed in front of the TV cameras while Mrs. Clinton lived on to fight another day, confident that her reputation was intact. And for awhile it was.\n\nBut in these pages on Thursday, Monica Crowley raised the fascinating possibility that the prosecution of General David Petraeus was an elaborate set-up. If it was, then \u201cMr. Obama used the Petraeus prosecution to set the precedent to prosecute Mrs. Clinton: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this, but my hands are tied.\u201d Revenge, you see, is a dish best eaten cold.\n\nHis real motivation may be payback for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s refusal to be front-person for an unsustainable cover-story or narcissistic protection of his alleged legacy. But as Miss Crowley correctly notes, the leaks against Mrs. Clinton and her associates are not accidental. \u201cMr. Obama is a clever dark knight: he\u2019s not just going after the queen. He\u2019s going after her court, too.\u201d All left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.\n\nThese menacing machinations are enabled by a compliant media establishment, rehearsing the myth of Barack Obama while faithfully supporting his leftist agenda. The most recent proof: Sharryl Attkisson\u2019s book, Stonewalled. Mrs. Attkisson bravely documented the close familial ties between CBS News and the Obama White House, facilitating news manipulation and control. But she also described a scarily covert attack that planted classified documents on her PC\u2019s hard drive when her investigative reporting got too close to the truth about Benghazi.\n\nIn Stephen King\u2019s canonical horror-thriller, It, the reader gradually notices that there is something scary about Pennywise, an eerie clown who seems to show up whenever something ghastly happens. Silent manipulation for sinister purposes: sounds like the Obama White House.\n\nKen Allard, a retired Army colonel, is a military analyst and author on national-security issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch what he does, not what he says about Hillary Clinton.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Watch what he does, not what he says about Hillary Clinton.", "title": "KEN ALLARD: Obama\u2019s silent manipulation", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/23/ken-allard-obamas-silent-manipulation/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/21/fe80bde95b27af257f0f6a706700e8b7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/21/fe80bde95b27af257f0f6a706700e8b7.jpg", "description": "Watch what he does, not what he says about Hillary Clinton.", "card": "summary", "title": "KEN ALLARD: Obama\u2019s silent manipulation"}, "Author": "Ken Allard", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Benghazi, Hillary Clinton"}, "article_summary": "Silent manipulation for sinister purposes: sounds like the Obama White House.\nMrs. Attkisson bravely documented the close familial ties between CBS News and the Obama White House, facilitating news manipulation and control.\nBut as Miss Crowley correctly notes, the leaks against Mrs. Clinton and her associates are not accidental.\nMcFarland of Fox News was the first major analyst to wonder: Why was Susan Rice acting as administration spoke-person for an attack on an American diplomatic facility?\nOnly Mrs. Clinton would have placed her own interests ahead of every government procedure for safeguarding information that rightfully belongs to the American citizens who paid her salary."}
