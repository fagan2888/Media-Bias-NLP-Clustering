The officer attempted to stop the white Chevy Monte Carlo near Anderson and Meadowbrook Drive, but the car sped away.\n\nPolice said speeds reached 90 miles-per-hour. Deputies from the Harvey County Sheriff\u2019s Office and an officer from Halstead joined the pursuit.\n\nThe car stopped after becoming disabled in the 6300 block of West Road. The four people inside the car got out and ran.\n\nThe driver was quickly taken into custody, and a K-9 tracked a second suspect who was found hiding in a nearby grassy area. Officers also found the third suspect and took him into custody.\n\nThe fourth and final suspect was arrested at a rural Harvey County home later in the morning.\n\nPolice said the car was stolen several days prior. The 20-year-old driver is from Wichita. He was booked for felony theft, eluding police, DUI, and being a minor in possession of alcohol. His name was not released.\n\nThe three remaining suspects were booked for obstruction. On top of that, a 19-year-old Hutchinson man also faces a charge of being a minor in possession of alcohol; a 20-year-old Harvey County man was booked for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. The third suspect is also a 20-year-old from Harvey County.\n\nPolice provided no further details.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Four men have been arrested following a pursuit early Saturday morning in Harvey County.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "Four men have been arrested following a pursuit early Saturday morning in Harvey County.", "title": "4 arrested after early-morning police chase in Harvey County", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/4-arrested-after-early-morning-car-chase-in-Newton-292012331.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/88D/FCD/88DFCD41D4384384BC90300790857ADA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/064/B6D/064B6DA0093E4F62A9456EC7BFF3DF7D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Four men have been arrested following a pursuit early Saturday morning in Harvey County.", "title": "4 arrested after early-morning police chase in Harvey County", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/4-arrested-after-early-morning-car-chase-in-Newton-292012331.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/newton+chase1.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "4 arrested after early-morning police chase in Harvey County", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "4 arrested after earlymorning police"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad29\"", "article_summary": "Credit: Facebook/Newton Police DepartmentFour men have been arrested following a pursuit early Saturday morning in Harvey County.\nThe fourth and final suspect was arrested at a rural Harvey County home later in the morning.\nDeputies from the Harvey County Sheriff\u2019s Office and an officer from Halstead joined the pursuit.\nThe third suspect is also a 20-year-old from Harvey County.\nOn top of that, a 19-year-old Hutchinson man also faces a charge of being a minor in possession of alcohol; a 20-year-old Harvey County man was booked for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia."}
