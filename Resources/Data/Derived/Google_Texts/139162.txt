What it asks: "Without raising additional taxes, shall that portion of the city's utility occupation tax on public utility companies that deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in the city that replaced the franchise fee paid by Public Service Company and supports general revenue needs of the city be extended from its current expiration date of December 31, 2017 and expire on December 31, 2022 with the revenues of the existing tax as extended being used to continue to support local government services, and shall the revenue from such tax extension and all earnings thereon (regardless of amount) constitute a voter approved revenue change, and an exception to the revenue and spending limits of Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution?"

What it means: Should the portion of the utility occupation tax on Xcel Energy bills that replaces the city's franchise fee and goes into the general fund be extended through the end of 2022? This ballot issue does not deal with the portion of the utility occupation tax that pays for research and legal costs associated with municipalization. This tax generates about $4.3 million a year for the general fund, which pays for basic services such as police, fire, parks and libraries.

What supporters say: This tax replaces the franchise fee that Xcel Energy used to pay and pays for basic services the entire community needs. If it is not extended, the city might have to cut important functions. This tax is completely separate from municipalization, and voters should extend it regardless of their feelings on a city-run energy utility.

What opponents say: There is no organized opposition to this measure. Some people have suggested the city might be forced to renegotiate a franchise with Xcel if the tax is defeated.
