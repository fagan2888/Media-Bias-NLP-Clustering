He became a member of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1665. His work as a missionary began in 1678, and he was assigned to Spain's colony in Mexico.\n\nKino arrived in Mexico City in the spring of 1681. After an abortive mission to Baja California in 1683, he began his longtime mission to the Pima Indians in Pimeria Alta, a district comprising present-day southern Arizona and the northern portion of Sonora State in Mexico.\n\nIn 1687, Father Kino established his first mission among the rural Indians of Sonora at Nuestra Senora de los Dolores. It became the headquarters for his explorations, as well as for the founding of other missions, including San Xavier del Bac (1700) near Tucson, Guevavi and Tumacacori (now a U.S. National Monument).\n\nIn 1691, Father Kino made the first of about 40 expeditions into Arizona. In 1694, he was the first European to visit the Hohokam ruins of Casa Grande (now a national monument). He is also said to have explored the sources of the Rio Grande, the Colorado and Gila rivers.\n\nHis explorations of the area around the mouth of the Colorado River in 1701 convinced him that Baja California was a peninsula, not an island. His 1705 map was the standard reference for the southwestern desert region for more than a century.\n\nFather Kino helped the Pima Indians diversify their agriculture and aided them in their constant wars with the Apaches, while opposing Indian enslavement in the silver mines of northern Mexico.\n\nHis \"Favores Celestiales\" (1708) was translated into English as the two-volume Kino's Historical Memoir of Pimer\u00eda Alta in 1919 (reissued 1948).\n\nFather Eusebio Kino died at Mission Magdalena in Sonora on March 15, 1711.\n\nFather Kino Timeline\n\nFrom National Park Service\n\nAug. 10, 1645: Born in Segno, Val di Non di Trento, christened with the name of Eusebius, at the Chapel of Torra, in northern Italy.\n\nNov. 20, 1665: Joins the company of Jesus and for the next 13 years, he makes his studies at the University of Landsberg, Freiburg, Ingolstadt and Grammer in Hall.\n\nMay 2, 1678: Leaves Genoa for Spain with 18 other missionaries and sojourns during three years between Seville and C\u00e1diz.\n\nJan. 27, 1681: Starts his voyage to New Spain that lasts three months.\n\nMay 3, 1681: Arrives at the Port of Vera Cruz in New Spain.\n\nOct. 28, 1682: He is appointed Missionary and Royal cosmographer to the California Expedition under the command of Admiral Don Isidro Atondo y Antill\u00f3n.
