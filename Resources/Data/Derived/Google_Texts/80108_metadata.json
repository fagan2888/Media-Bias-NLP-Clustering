He climbed aboard the Frankenstein-ian creation, one of many scattered about the Burbank, California, headquarters of his company, Lagree Fitness, which occupies a warehouse that brings to mind a mad scientist\u2019s lab.\n\n\u201cOn these machines here, I\u2019m experimenting having a mix of static and variable tension,\u201d he said, pedaling slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s like, out there, to drive cars, you have gas, diesel and electricity. Think about another way of powering a car that\u2019s clean energy, that\u2019s abundant, it\u2019s the perfect kind of energy you want. That\u2019s what I\u2019m working on.\u201d\n\nThis is how Lagree spends many of his days: toying with tension and figuring out how to better use it in a piece of exercise equipment he invented, the Megaformer, the basis of a core-burning workout that blends Pilates, cardio and strength training.\n\nA wobbly carriage that can be pushed and pulled, lunged on and squatted down to, the machine challenges those atop it in ways that traditional Pilates may not.\n\n\u201cIt brings to Pilates what Pilates was lacking,\u201d said Amanda Freeman, founder of the New York-based Megaformer studio SLT, which stands for Strengthen Lengthen Tone. \u201cI always wanted to do Pilates, but I felt like I needed to do another workout after. I didn\u2019t sweat.\u201d\n\nOver the last 13 years, Lagree has built something of an empire. He has sold thousands of machines, which cost upward of $7,000 each, to the more than 250 fitness studios that license his method. With the promise of sculpturing lean, long muscles, his workout has attracted celebrity devotees, including Sof\u00eda Vergara and Kim Kardashian. Even Michelle Obama is a fan.\n\nBut Lagree exhibits none of the rah-rah enthusiasm of a typical fitness guru. He is a former aspiring actor who took up personal training to pay the bills (\u201cI thought being a personal trainer was worse than being a car salesman\u201d) and calls his success something of a fluke. He also hasn\u2019t worked out in a year.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that I\u2019m a lazy guy,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing here happened because I masterminded it.\u201d\n\nWhen acting jobs didn\u2019t materialize, he applied to be a personal trainer at Angel City Gym in West Hollywood, California, and was thrust into teaching Pilates, a form of exercise he had never heard of.\n\n\u201cI thought this was the biggest scam ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI come from a background that physical fitness needs to be exertive, you need to sweat, you need to be sore.\u201d\n\nSo Lagree riffed on traditional Pilates moves and developed a workout that made him, in his words, \u201ca sensation overnight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/hffit07.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5aa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt brings to Pilates what Pilates was lacking,\u201d said Amanda Freeman, founder of the New York-based Megaformer studio SLT, which stands for Strengthen Lengthen Tone.\nA wobbly carriage that can be pushed and pulled, lunged on and squatted down to, the machine challenges those atop it in ways that traditional Pilates may not.\n\u201cI always wanted to do Pilates, but I felt like I needed to do another workout after.\nHe climbed aboard the Frankenstein-ian creation, one of many scattered about the Burbank, California, headquarters of his company, Lagree Fitness, which occupies a warehouse that brings to mind a mad scientist\u2019s lab.\nWith the promise of sculpturing lean, long muscles, his workout has attracted celebrity devotees, including Sof\u00eda Vergara and Kim Kardashian."}
