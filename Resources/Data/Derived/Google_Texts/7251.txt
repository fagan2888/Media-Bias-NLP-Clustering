Rapid City, SD

It might say May on the calendar, but a heavy snow in Rapid City made it seem like December. More than 13 inches of snow fell in the city, breaking the May record.

Donivan Marchen always uses this ATV to clean the snow off his neighbors sidewalks, he just normally isn't doing that at this time of the year.



"My neighbor, he always lets me, it's his four wheeler I use. He always lets me use it. Ever since I've just kind of plowed his sidewalks, plowed everybody's sidewalk, plowed everybody's around here. Just helping out the neighborhood," Marchen



He had plenty to plow today. It was a heavy, wet snow. It's suppose to be spring, but instead the snow knocked down a basketball hoop, and covered motorcycles. Marchen says it's something to expect in South Dakota.



"I grew up here in Rapid City and yeah we've got weird weather here, and I've never actually seen it in May," Marchen said.



With the snowfall setting records for the month of May, it's something no one in the city has ever seen.

The previous May record was 2008, when 12 inches of snow fell on Rapid City.
