Johns Hopkins Hospital found that in 2009, during high-admission periods, the rate of intensive care unit readmission was as high as 500 percent, Litvak writes.\n\nHowever, Litvak says, there is a solution. Volume peaks are driven not by emergency admissions, but by scheduled admissions. \"Without the peaks in demand that hospitals themselves bring about with their scheduling practices, the hospitals could afford a much better nurse-staffing ratios without controversial legislative measures,\" he writes.\n\nThe major obstacle to implementing this solution is that hospitals will have to reduce the level of autonomy given to surgeons for it to work effectively. This coordination strategy has proven effective in the past, Litvak writes, citing the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, which, in 2009, worked with the Institute for Healthcare Optimization to reform patient flow and saved $100 million.\n\n\"The only thing standing in the way of [admission streamlining's] implementation at all of the nation's 5,800 or so hospitals is a health-care culture too accustomed to excessive waste and a lack of inspired leadership,\" Litvak concludes.\n\nA May study found a direct correlation between nursing staff ratios and the number of pediatric readmissions, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read Litvak's column (login required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNursing staff ratios directly impact pediatric hospital readmissions\n\nHospitals, nurses clash over minimum staffing requirements\n\nSurvey: Nurse understaffing, fatigue threaten patient safety\n\nStudy credits nurse work environment for better outcomes", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six states and the District of Columbia are considering legislation that would establish mandatory minimum hospital-nurse staffing levels to deal with patient volume \"peaks,\" but there may be an easier way of addressing the problem, according to a column in the Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Six states and the District of Columbia are considering legislation that would establish mandatory minimum hospital-nurse staffing levels to deal with patient volume \"peaks,\" but there may be an easier way of addressing the problem, according to a column in the Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Is there another way to solve the nursing shortage?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/there-another-way-solve-nursing-shortage/2013-12-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Eugene Litvak,HR & Workforce Management,Nurse Staffing,nurse staffing ratios,Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cea\"", "article_summary": "A May study found a direct correlation between nursing staff ratios and the number of pediatric readmissions, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nAlthough patient peaks and volumes have long been the status quo for hospitals, they can no longer afford to maintain it--or its fallout.\nSix states and the District of Columbia are considering legislation that would establish mandatory minimum hospital-nurse staffing ratios to deal with patient volume \"peaks,\" but there may be an easier way of addressing the problem, according to a column in the Wall Street Journal.\n\"Without the peaks in demand that hospitals themselves bring about with their scheduling practices, the hospitals could afford a much better nurse-staffing ratios without controversial legislative measures,\" he writes.\nJohns Hopkins Hospital found that in 2009, during high-admission periods, the rate of intensive care unit readmission was as high as 500 percent, Litvak writes."}
