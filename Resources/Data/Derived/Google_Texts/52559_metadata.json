For example, let\u2019s say you spent the last 2 \u00bd weeks trying to enroll in the Affordable Care Act, and all you encountered were crashed websites and answering machines that put you endlessly on \u201chold.\u201d By employing sophisticated software analysis to your voice mail message to detect subtle modulations in tenor and timbre that denote stress, and other moods, the software will be able to conclude that your shouting \u201cHEY MORONS! ANSWER THE *&%^& PHONE!\u201d indicates that you are dissatisfied with the service you\u2019ve received thus far! Knowing this, knowledgeable supervisors will turn your file over to a specially trained agent who is taught to deal with high-strung, irascible, impossible customers like you, and promptly call you back in two months, when the kinks are worked out of the enrollment system.\n\nSoftware developed by Beyond Verbal a company in Israel, claims it can detect 400 variations of different moods, including 25 completely heretofore undiscovered shades of gray! Unfortunately, the software still can\u2019t recognize when someone expresses satisfaction, gratitude, happiness or a compliment, because the program is tailored for Customer Service Centers, and no one has ever called in to express a positive emotion.\n\nBut 400 shades of moods allows for a great deal of nuance, kind of like the way a wine snob describes a new pinot. \u201cYour anger comes with a hint of melancholy, a full-bodied taste of nuttiness, a wisp of regret and a lingering schadenfreude.\u201d\n\nDan Emodi, the marketing VP at Beyond Verbal, proclaimed that this tool will \u201callow machines for the first time to understand the emotional side of our communications.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question from a female audience member, Emodi promised to work on a version that would enable men to do that, as well.\n\nExperts say that one of the greatest benefits these mood analyzers will bring to Call Centers is being able to distinguish between frustrated customers who want to work out the problem and are therefore worth investing more time, and angry customers who just want to vent, and aren\u2019t. Leaving the latter to fume even more that they were hung up on by a stupid service clerk, thereby compelling them to go home and pick up the family AK-47, head to the nearest mall, and have their complaint listened to very respectfully to by a hostage negotiator.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see where this is going. Once this technology gets a little more developed and accepted, it\u2019ll be seized on by lawyers who will use it in all sorts of cases, including sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cYour Honor, it\u2019s true that my client heard the plaintiff say \u2018No,\u2019 but using the Acme Voice Tonal Transmogrifier 2020X here, it was obvious to him that she really meant \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nOr: \u201cYour Honor. Really. If the plaintiff was really concerned about getting his money back when my client promised \u2018Of course I\u2019ll pay you back!\u2019 then why didn\u2019t he use a portable \u201cspeech analyti-cizer\u201d which clearly would have shown the defendant was lying through his teeth?\u201d\n\nThe irony of this whole speech analytics thing is that customers have been way-yyyy ahead of these call centers for years. Who among us has not been on hold, listening to a recorded message imploring \u201cYour call is very important to us,\u201d and not screamed into the phone, \u201cYou\u2019re LYING, you &$%^! If it was IMPORTANT, you\u2019d hire more people to field it, you &^%$ lying sack of ^%*$#.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just sayin\u2019 that it looks like pretty soon there won\u2019t be any such thing as \u201cjust sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\nRelated articles", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Article 3", "description": "That old adage \u201cIt\u2019s not what you say, but how you say it,\u201d is coming to a Customer Service Center near you.
