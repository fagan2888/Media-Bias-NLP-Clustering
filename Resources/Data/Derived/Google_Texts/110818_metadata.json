(AP) \u2014 Even Merle Haggard gets nervous about stepping onto a stage when the audience is filled with songwriters, record label executives and fellow artists.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s glorious but it\u2019s also tough because all the pressure is on you,\u201d Haggard said after recently playing two sold-out nights at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all those people out there that call you a legend and an icon and all that stuff. You kinda gotta prove it.\u201d\n\nBut judging from the cheering and ovations, Haggard \u2014 who helped create the twangy electrified Bakersfield Sound in country music \u2014 still knows how to impress a crowd.\n\nAt 77, he tours the country about two weeks each month and recently bought a new tour bus, a sign that he\u2019s not interested in retirement from the road. His band, the Strangers, now includes his wife, Theresa, and 21-year-old son Ben, as well as band leader Norman Hamlet, who has been with Haggard since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real tempting to let it all go, but it\u2019s taken many years to get to where I am at,\u201d Haggard said. \u201cTo divorce myself of it earlier than I have to is really not something I want to do.\u201d\n\nHaggard had lung surgery after a cancer diagnosis in 2008, and he said an early, but incorrect, diagnosis had him thinking he had only a short time to live.\n\n\u201cAnd then they told me, \u2018No, we\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s only just a little benign condition that we can get rid of,'\u201d Haggard said. \u201cIt was sort of a disappointment.
