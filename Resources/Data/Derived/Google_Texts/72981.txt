And Jeb Bush gave the most to himself. ($388,720)

The first full set of campaign finance reports of the 2016 presidential election is in, providing the most useful data to date in measuring the early health of the contenders. To be clear, these reports don't include donations to super PACS, which in most cases are raising millions more than the candidates themselves.

U.S. News combed the July candidate reports – which cover money raised and spent between April and June – as well as the Twitter feeds of top campaign finance reporters to locate the most intriguing findings.

Here they are:

1. Phish Gave to Bernie

Jon Fishman, the drummer of the trippy rock band Phish, donated $2,500 to Bernie Sanders, according to Bloomberg's Greg Giroux. It probably doesn't hurt that the band originated in Vermont.

2. Jeb Gave Himself More Than He Raised From Small Donors

Jeb Bush wrote himself a check for almost $389,000, yet raised just $368,000 from donors who gave $200 or less, notes Politico's Ken Vogel. That amount is more than seven times the annual median household income in America.

3. Donald Trump Is the Richest Person Ever to Run for President

You thought Mitt Romney was rich at $250 million? That's a pittance compared to The Donald, whose financial disclosure reported his net worth is in excess of $10 billion. The wild card: How much of that does he put into the race?

4. Hillary Is Spending a Lot

Her "burn rate" – the percentage of money she's already used – is at 40 percent, or almost $19 million, according to CNN's Dan Merica, a signal that she's taking no chances in a primary where she remains the overwhelming front-runner.
