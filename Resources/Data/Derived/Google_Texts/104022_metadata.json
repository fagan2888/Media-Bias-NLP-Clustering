However, these were measured on a micro-basis, as opposed to today\u2019s all-encompassing basis.\u201d\n\nOther elements of the previous paradigm also have perished. \u201cSenior citizens on Medicare would receive their cards and enjoy the fact that they had no restrictions on the use of it,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt was not uncommon for a senior to stay in the hospital until he or she felt better or right.\n\n[See also: The new CFO.]\n\nAnd it was even more common for seniors to see half a dozen specialists, depending on their particular health condition, with no overall manager of their care.\u201d\n\nBefore long in the former model, healthcare costs catapulted by double digits year after year after year. \u201cObviously, something had to give,\u201d says Santangelo.\n\nNew paradigm for finance\n\nAnd give it did. And with it changed the CFO\u2019s role. Pre-reform (and still today), the CFO\u2019s task was to forecast patient volume for budget allocation purposes. If budgets were off, it was because patient volumes were off, and vice versa. \u201cIt was a more static and defined role for finance in the past, without the variability we now have,\u201d Santangelo explains.\n\nWith the movement toward financially managing hospitals based on patient outcomes and the overall need for greater efficiency and higher quality, today\u2019s CFO is more involved in a hospital\u2019s clinical services.\n\n\u201cMy prior role as CFO was to maximize revenue and control expenses, which is something I still do,\u201d says Warren Forgey, former CFO and chief administrative and operations officer at Schneck Medical Center, a one-hospital healthcare provider in Seymour, Ind., \u201cBut, now the role is more focused on the move from volume to value, creating more of a strategic partnership with payers and employers, while always keeping the patient first and foremost in my mind.\u201d\n\nWe have to ensure we have the right partnerships in place to provide the accountable care model to our community.\n\nLike Santangelo, Forgey says there is more collaboration between the CFO and clinical leaders and physicians at Schneck. As he put it, \u201cWe have become the bridge between healthcare quality and finance.\u201d\n\nThis bridge is still in the process of being built. Forgey\u2019s successor as CFO, Debbie Ridlen, says Schneck is working hard to make the transition from a fee-for-service model to the modern paradigm. \u201cWith revenues impinged by reduced hospital stays, we need to reexamine our overall cost structure to be positioned for this new era,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also have to look closely and ensure we have the right partnerships in place with other entities to provide the accountable care model to our community.\u201d\n\nAccountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which tie provider reimbursements to quality metrics and reductions in the total cost of patient care, are fueling a surge in mergers and consolidations.\n\nAs an example of this activity at Schneck, the new CFO points to a clinically integrated network, inSPIRE Health Partners, that the hospital formed earlier this year with Columbus Regional Health, a hospital about 25 miles away. \u201cBy combining our resources and having a more coordinated approach to healthcare, we believe we can improve overall healthcare in our local communities,\u201d Ridlen says. \u201cThere will be more of these kinds of alliances as we move forward.\u201d\n\n[See also: Relieving the Pressure.]\n\nMark Bogen, senior vice president and CFO at South Nassau Communities Hospital (SNCH) in Oceanside, N.Y., shares this view.\n\n\u201cPursuing strategic partnerships, mergers and acquisitions with all the due diligence this entails is a new role for many CFOs,\u201d says Bogen, who has negotiated deals to acquire an ambulatory surgery center through a joint venture and, in October, closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of the 162-bed Long Beach Medical Center, which closed in October 2012 after sustaining heavy flooding damage from Hurricane Sandy.\n\nSantangelo is also further engaged in M&A due diligence than in the past. \u201cThe board is in the thick of trying to determine how best to provide the services needed by the community, not just define them but to do this with the right organizations in the right context,\u201d he explains. \u201cChange is difficult and costly, and the typical community hospital has it tougher to change or do it fast enough. Large organizations actually change systems, policies and procedures faster because they have the resources to implement it.\u201d\n\nPlans afoot\n\nThe three CFOs also say they are more involved in their hospital\u2019s strategic planning. \u201cI\u2019m in the midst of developing a long-range strategic plan right now,\u201d Bogen says.\n\nSo is Santangelo. \u201cFrom a strategic standpoint, I am more a part of the team than ever before,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now much of our focus is medium-term planning, trying to get through this extraordinary period of change in the healthcare environment. Long-term, the board and senior management are evaluating how best to continue to provide services\u2014insofar as do we do what we do with our own experts or link up with a larger organization to provide greater resources. That\u2019s the key strategic question.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also one that Santangelo won\u2019t have to answer for much longer. After an entire career spent in hospital finance, the veteran CFO steps down at the end of the year.
