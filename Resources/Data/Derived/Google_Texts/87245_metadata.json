Arizona, Kansas and Georgia all asked that those forms request proof of citizenship, but the federal Election Assistance Commission rejected that in a 46-page ruling released late Friday, just ahead of a court-imposed deadline.\n\nThe EAC said states can check driver\u2019s license databases or ask federal immigration authorities for information, but they cannot tell the federal government what to include on federal forms.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama: \u2018I\u2019ll act on my own\u2019 to make \u2018breakthrough year\u2019 happen\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration Reform\n\n\u201cThe EAC finds that granting the states\u2019 requests would likely hinder eligible citizens from registering to vote in federal elections, undermining a core purpose of the NVRA,\u201d the commission said in its ruling, referring to the National Voter Registration Act, or motor-voter law.\n\nBut Kris Kobach, Kansas\u2019 secretary of state, said the states will go back to the courts and said there\u2019s already a motion in front of U.S. District Judge Eric F. Melgren in Kansas to hear the case. He\u2019s the same judge who set the deadline for the EAC\u2019s ruling on Friday.\n\nIndeed, the legal back-and-forth was in part spurred by a Supreme Court ruling last year, when the justices said Arizona couldn\u2019t refuse to accept the federal registration forms.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama vows that John Boehner will indeed push through immigration reform\n\nBut Justice Antonin Scalia also specifically said states could ask the EAC to include the request on forms distributed in that state, and said if the EAC refused, the states could come back to the courts.\n\nFriday\u2019s decision is the latest skirmish in the push for voter identification and proof of citizenship as some states seek to crack down on what they fear is fraudulent registration and, in some cases, fraudulent voting.\n\nArizona, Georgia and Kansas all have similar state requirements that those trying to register prove at some point in the process that they are in the country legally, and are citizens.\n\nThe commission also said that because Congress specifically considered then rejected requiring proof of citizenship when it debated the motor-voter law, the states can\u2019t now go and impose that requirement.\n\nBut Mr. Kobach said the commission doesn\u2019t have the power to second-guess the states, and it doesn\u2019t matter what Congress thought of proof-of-citizenship requests during its debate.\n\n\u201cCongress does not have the authority to prevent a state from requiring proof of citizenship, according to Article I of the Constitution. And Congress cannot create an agency to exercise a power that Congress itself is constitutionally prevented from exercising,\u201d Mr. Kobach told The Washington Times.\n\nHe also said Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion telling the states to take their request to the EAC suggested that the commission would be obligated to accept the states\u2019 request.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no way to square the EAC\u2019s decision with the text of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 holding,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics argue that requirement is too burdensome, particularly on naturalized citizens, and would keep some eligible voters from casting ballots. The EAC agreed with that claim.\n\nBut Mr. Kobach said the danger lies in potential fraud.\n\n\u201cEvery time an alien votes in an election, that vote effectively disenfranchises a United States citizen. But this administration evidently doesn\u2019t see that as a problem worth addressing,\u201d he said.\n\nMotor-voter was enacted in 1993 in order to try to boost voters\u2019 interest in elections. The EAC was set up in the wake of the 2000 elections, when then-candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore battled over Florida\u2019s electoral votes.\n\nBut the four-member EAC board is empty at the moment, with no commissioners confirmed. Last week\u2019s ruling was instead issued by the acting executive director, who was responding to a judge\u2019s order.", "article_metadata": {"description": "States are vowing to go to the courts for permission to ask newly registered voters to show proof of citizenship after a federal commission ruled late Friday that it's up to the national government, not states, to decide what to include on registration forms.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "States are vowing to go to the courts for permission to ask newly registered voters to show proof of citizenship after a federal commission ruled late Friday that it\u2019s up to the national government, not states, to decide what to include on registration forms.", "title": "New federal ruling forbids states from checking voters\u2019 citizenship", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/18/new-federal-ruling-forbids-states-checking-voters-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/14/digits-jpeg-0cc6f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/14/digits-jpeg-0cc6f.jpg", "title": "New federal ruling forbids states from checking voters\u2019 citizens", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "description": "States are vowing to go to the courts for permission to ask newly registered voters to show proof of citizenship after a federal commission ruled late Friday that it's up to the national government, n"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Law Crime, Election Assistance Commission, Kris Kobach, Antonin Scalia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04cd\"", "article_summary": "The EAC said states can check driver\u2019s license databases or ask federal immigration authorities for information, but they cannot tell the federal government what to include on federal forms.\nIndeed, the legal back-and-forth was in part spurred by a Supreme Court ruling last year, when the justices said Arizona couldn\u2019t refuse to accept the federal registration forms.\n\u201cCongress does not have the authority to prevent a state from requiring proof of citizenship, according to Article I of the Constitution.\nStates are vowing to go to the courts for permission to ask newly registered voters to show proof of citizenship after a federal commission ruled late Friday that it\u2019s up to the national government, not states, to decide what to include on registration forms.\nUnder the motor-voter law, federal officials distribute voter-registration forms in all of the states."}
