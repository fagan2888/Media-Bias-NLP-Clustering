As part of her employment, Verizon provided Lazette with a Blackberry, and Lazette was told she could use the phone for personal emails in addition to performing work.\n\nWhen Lazette turned the phone back into her manager Chris Kulmatycki, she believed she\u2019d deleted her personal Gmail account off of it. She was wrong.\n\nIn fact, Kulmatycki began accessing her Gmail account \u2014 and did so for the next 18 months. All in all, Kulmatycki eventually read 48,000 of Lazette\u2019s emails, including info about her family, career, financials, health and other personal matters.\n\nEven worse: Kulmatycki shared the info he read about in Lazette\u2019s personal emails with other employees.\n\nOnce Lazette eventually found out about Kulmatycki\u2019s actions, she changed her password to prevent further access. Before she did so, he had accessed 48,000 e-mails in plaintiff\u2019s Gmail account.\n\n\u2018But it was on a company-owned device\u2019\n\nThen, not surprisingly, Lazette sued, claiming violation of the Stored Communications Act (SCA) and invasion of privacy.\n\nVerizon argued that, as manager, Kulmatycki had authority to access Lazette\u2019s emails, and that it was her fault that she left the account on her company device.\n\nThe court wasn\u2019t having it. By failing to delete her account, Lazette didn\u2019t implicitly consent to her manager reading 48,000 of her personal emails, the court said \u2014 even if it was on a company-owned device.\n\nAnd, understandably so, the court also allowed Lazette\u2019s complaint of invasion of privacyto stand \u2014 a jury could very well find that Kulmatycki\u2019s conduct was offensive due to the personal and private nature of the emails.\n\nNorah Olson Bluvshtein, writing on the netWORKed blog, had this to say about the case:\n\n\u2026 the court\u2019s opinion was interesting in part because of the court\u2019s very strong position that just because the supervisor used a company device, that did not mean there was authorization to read the emails. Additionally, while the opinion didn\u2019t get into much detail regarding the company\u2019s policy on monitoring of company-issued devices, it is interesting to speculate about whether clear policy language putting the employee on notice that personal emails could be monitored would have changed the court\u2019s mind. It may be that even the clearest and strongest policy language would not have made a difference, due to the conduct of the overly curious supervisor who read tens of thousands of personal emails for no other reason than his own apparent amusement.\n\nThe case is Lazette v. Kulmatycki.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This manager took employee snooping to a whole new level.", "og": {"description": "This manager took employee snooping to a whole new level.", "title": "Manager snooped on staffer\u2019s personal email for 18 months, read 48,000 messages", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/manager-snooped-on-staffers-email-for-18-months-read-48000-messages/", "image": {"width": 508, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/174351206.jpg", "height": 337}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/174351206.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "personal email", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-01T19:36:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-05T13:10:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In fact, Kulmatycki began accessing her Gmail account \u2014 and did so for the next 18 months.\nWhen Lazette turned the phone back into her manager Chris Kulmatycki, she believed she\u2019d deleted her personal Gmail account off of it.\nAll in all, Kulmatycki eventually read 48,000 of Lazette\u2019s emails, including info about her family, career, financials, health and other personal matters.\nEven worse: Kulmatycki shared the info he read about in Lazette\u2019s personal emails with other employees.\nBefore she did so, he had accessed 48,000 e-mails in plaintiff\u2019s Gmail account."}
