As Denver tied a 114-year-old record high for the date, Broncos fans can look forward to a warm evening for Thursday night’s opening game.

But that kickoff was delayed by 25 minutes because of some thunderstorm cells — and lightning — in the area.

The high temperature at Denver International Airport hit 97 degrees Thursday afternoon, equaling a mark set in 1899, according to the National Weather Service.

It was the 51st day of 2013 with temperatures of 90 degrees or above. In an average year, the city gets that warm 40 times.

Temperature at kickoff for the game against the Baltimore Ravens at Sports Authority Field at Mile High was in the very high 80s.

Brendansweather.com calculated that the temperature at kickoff was 76 degrees warmer than when the teams met in last year’s playoffs.

Temperatures will fall during the evening but it should still be in the mid 70s when the game ends.

The National Weather Service reports that the lowest temperature recorded on Tuesday was 68 degrees. That broke the previous record for the highest minimum temperature for Sept. 3. Another “record high low” was possible on Thursday.
