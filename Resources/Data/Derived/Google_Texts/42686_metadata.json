They've been unwilling to come down on their asking,\" said picket Tommy Blitsch, principal officer of Teamsters 631.\n\nBlitsch, who said he was at the failed negotiation meeting, was one of several pickets who have heard they could face a 6 percent to 7 percent overall rate hike on services.\n\nNeither Culinary union spokeswoman Bethany Khan nor Rob Dyer, senior vice president of strategy and development for HCA's Far West Division, could confirm that figure. Dyer said the number sounded incorrect.\n\nHe added that HCA already agreed to one contract extension and does not want to continue negotiations indefinitely.\n\n\"Their last negotiations with a local health care provider went on for two years,\" he said.\n\nHe was apparently referring to a dispute between the coalition and Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican Hospitals. Khan said St. Rose was \"kicked out\" of the coalition's in-network providers group, but it rejoined this year.\n\n\"We're really good negotiators. They don't have to be in negotiations for two years,\" she said of HCA.\n\nContact Pashtana Usufzy at pusufzy@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4563.
