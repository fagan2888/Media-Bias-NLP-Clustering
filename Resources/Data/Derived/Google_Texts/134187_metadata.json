Full explanation here:\n\nEveryone agrees that really generous unemployment benefits, by reducing the incentive to seek jobs, can raise the NAIRU; that is, set limits to how far down you can push unemployment without running into inflation problems. But in case you haven\u2019t noticed, that\u2019s not the problem constraining job growth in America right now. Wage growth is declining, not rising, and so is overall inflation. A wage-price spiral looks like a distant dream. What\u2019s limiting employment now is lack of demand for the things workers produce. Their incentives to seek work are, for now, irrelevant \u2026 And the truth is that unemployment benefits are a good, quick, administratively easy way to increase demand, which is what we really need. So right now they have the effect of reducing unemployment.\n\nWhere I think even Dillow goes wrong, however, is in suggesting that this kind of regime-dependence makes economics different from the natural sciences. Actually, phase shifts are common across many phenomena. Suppose I want to cross a river. The effects of a simple policy of walking in the direction I want to go will be very different if the river is flowing than if it\u2019s frozen solid.\n\nAnd an economy where monetary policy has hit the zero lower bound is a very different place from one in which monetary policy can play its normal role. Right back at the beginning of this mess I said as much:\n\nWe are already, however, well into the realm of what I call depression economics. By that I mean a state of affairs like that of the 1930s in which the usual tools of economic policy \u2014 above all, the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to pump up the economy by cutting interest rates \u2014 have lost all traction. When depression economics prevails, the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply: virtue becomes vice, caution is risky and prudence is folly.\n\nNow, you may disagree with this diagnosis; you\u2019re wrong, but that\u2019s OK. What you can\u2019t do is claim that I\u2019m being inconsistent, let alone hypocritical: I\u2019ve been telling the same story all along.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140119094801, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 19, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/UI, the NAIRU, and the ZLB ( 20140119 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Depression economics: still different.", "title": "UI, the NAIRU, and the ZLB", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/ui-the-nairu-and-the-zlb/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Depression economics: still different.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 19, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1390142881, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-01-19T14:48:01-05:00"}, "utime": 20140119144801, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140119, "pdate": 20140119, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Depression economics: still different.", "title": "UI, the NAIRU, and the ZLB", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/ui-the-nairu-and-the-zlb/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/ui-the-nairu-and-the-zlb/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "UI, the NAIRU, and the ZLB", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7b4\"", "article_summary": "Where I think even Dillow goes wrong, however, is in suggesting that this kind of regime-dependence makes economics different from the natural sciences.\nFull explanation here:Everyone agrees that really generous unemployment benefits, by reducing the incentive to seek jobs, can raise the NAIRU; that is, set limits to how far down you can push unemployment without running into inflation problems.\n\u201cBut your textbook says that UI raises unemployment!\u201dFolks, we\u2019ve been here before.\nWhen depression economics prevails, the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply: virtue becomes vice, caution is risky and prudence is folly.\nBut in case you haven\u2019t noticed, that\u2019s not the problem constraining job growth in America right now."}
