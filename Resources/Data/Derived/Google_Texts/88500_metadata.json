Vape shops are the primary locations to buy exactly what they're named after, E-cigarettes and vapors.\n\n\"Over 95% of sales are brick and mortar,\" Mistic CEO, John Wiesehan.\n\nBut now Mistic and C-E-O John Wiesehan are adding another retailer for their Haus vaporizer.\n\n\"this is the vapor product,\" said Wiesehan\n\nThe nation's largest retailer, Walmart is currently selling the Haus vaporizer, but for now only in Oklahoma.\n\n\"From their perspective it seems like Oklahoma has hire demand for the vapor product,\" said Wiesehan.\n\nA higher demand for the vapor product, a statement that doesn't surprise the Oklahoma Vapor Advocacy League (OVAL).\n\n\"We're taking the biggest step forward toward tobacco harm reduction we've seen in 50 years,\" said Sean Gore, president of OVAL.\n\nThe numbers could be in support of OVAL President Sean Gore.
