John Kasich.\n\nKasich immediately shot down as \u201cunacceptable\u201d a legislative study committee\u2019s Wednesday recommendation the state extend its current two-year mandate freeze indefinitely.\n\nWhen Kasich signed Senate Bill 310 last year, he agreed to pause the phase-in of energy efficiency and alternative electricity generation mandates adopted in 2008 \u2014 and to create the Energy Mandates Study Committee, whose guidance he seems set on ignoring.\n\nThe governor\u2019s public opposition to an extended freeze isn\u2019t the only sign he\u2019ll fight for increased mandates. Kasich reportedly threatened to veto a version of SB 310 that would have locked the mandates at 2014 levels.\n\nAnd the same day the Energy Mandates Study Committee published its recommendations, a new coalition of Kasich backers calling itself Ohio Conservative Energy Forum popped up to promote steeper mandates.\n\nMike Hartley, who was named Ohio director of Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign less than a month before the launch of Ohio CEF, is the group\u2019s executive director.\n\nOhio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis \u2014 a Kasich appointee to the state medical board \u2014 is a member of Ohio CEF\u2019s leadership council. So is retired Air Force Col. Tom Moe, formerly Kasich\u2019s appointed director of the Ohio Department of Veterans Services.\n\nOther leaders of the group demanding tougher mandates as a matter of \u201cconservative support for a common-sense, all-of-the-above state energy policy\u201d include Kasich campaign enthusiasts from Ohio Young Republicans and Ohio Federation of College Republicans.\n\nKasich and Ohio CEF are supported in their push for increased green energy mandates by industry lobbying groups like Ohio Advanced Energy Economy, and Ohio\u2019s major newspapers, too.\n\nNews stories from Gannett and The Columbus Dispatch have already quoted Hartley and Ohio CEF as \u201cconservative\u201d advocates of higher mandates without acknowledging Hartley\u2019s ties to the governor\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nDispatch reporter Dan Gearino described Hartley as \u201cpresident of a political consulting firm,\u201d and Gannett reporter Jessie Balmert described Hartley simply as a \u201cconservative who thinks an indefinite freeze is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nOhio Watchdog contacted Ohio CEF to ask whether Hartley is still being paid by Kasich\u2019s campaign, but an inquiry sent to the address listed on Ohio CEF\u2019s website was returned as undeliverable and Ohio CEF did not respond to questions submitted through a web contact form.\n\nBoth of Ohio\u2019s free-market think tanks remain critical of the green energy mandates Kasich wants to expand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bewildered by Gov. John Kasich\u2019s leftish stance on energy issues,\u201d Opportunity Ohio president Matt Mayer told Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cFrom his tax hike attack on the oil and gas industry to pro-renewable mandate support, Kasich frankly isn\u2019t much different than a Democratic governor would be,\u201d Mayer sad. \u201cUnfortunately, his anti-free market energy positions will increase costs on businesses and consumers in Ohio and lead to job losses.\u201d\n\nThe mandates Kasich wants to expand were approved in 2008 by a Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly and signed into law by former governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t return to the policy mistakes of the Strickland administration by embracing another costly government mandate,\u201d Buckeye Institute president Robert Alt said in a press release.\n\nThe Ohio chapter of conservative activist group Americans For Prosperity praised the Energy Mandates Study Committee for recommending an indefinite freeze.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Ohio is continuing to lead the way in rethinking these harmful energy mandates,\u201d AFP-Ohio state director Baylor Myers said in a statement.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions from Ohio Watchdog.\n\nBefore Kasich signaled he wouldn\u2019t stand for a freeze of Ohio\u2019s green energy mandates, there were signs of progress in the General Assembly towards rolling back the energy efficiency and electricity generation requirements.\n\nIn 2013, Republican State Sen. Kris Jordan introduced legislation to repeal the mandates, but the repeal bill was smothered in an Ohio Senate committee without ever receiving a vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio lawmakers looking to extend a freeze on state \"green energy\" mandates will have to find a way past Gov.
