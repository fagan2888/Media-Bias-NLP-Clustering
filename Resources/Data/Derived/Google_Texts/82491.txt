TEMPE, Ariz. — Up until Saturday night, the Colorado men’s basketball team had shown sparks of being a really good team, even without their star player.

On Saturday, though, the Buffaloes had their worst performance of the season in a 72-51 loss at Arizona State at Wells Fargo Arena.

The defeat dropped the Buffaloes (15-6, 4-4 Pac-12) to 1-4 since star point guard Spencer Dinwiddie suffered a season-ending knee injury on Jan. 12.
