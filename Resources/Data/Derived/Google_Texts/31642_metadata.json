That Canadian just can\u2019t understand why American\u2019s don\u2019t like Obama as much as Canadians.\n\nA letter to the editor at the Detroit Free Press (titled \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t know how good they have it with Obama\u201d) from Richard Brunt, of Victoria, British Columbia, had a strong message for Americans who disapprove of their president.\n\n\u201cWhen you are done with Obama, could you send him our way?\u201d\n\nBrunt began the letter, saying, \u201cMany of us Canadians are confused by the U.S. midterm elections.\u201d\n\nHe credited Obama with lower the unemployment rate and lower gas prices.\n\n\u201cAmerica is leading the world once again and respected internationally \u2014 in sharp contrast to the Bush years,\u201d the letter said. \u201cObama brought soldiers home from Iraq and killed Osama bin Laden.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Americans vote for the party that got you into the mess that Obama just dug you out of? This defies reason,\u201d Brunt wrote.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor characterized the letter as becoming highly popular in both the United States and Canada, and pointed to Obama\u2019s past popularity in Canada.\n\nCanada\u2019s National Post previously called Obama, \u201cCanada\u2019s American President.\u201d\n\nThe Globe and Mail newspaper did a poll in 2012 that found Obama would have beaten Republican Mitt Romney with 65 percent of the vote.\n\nBrunt\u2019s letter has spread among progressive circles, as much of the left had expressed disappointment in the president before the election, the Christian Science Monitor reported.\n\n\u201c[H]e\u2019s right,\u201d John Prager of Americans Against the Tea Party wrote of Brunt\u2019s letter. \u201cApathetic and delusional voters alike allowed Republicans like hog-castrating psychopath Joni Ernst to rise to a position of authority, Mitch McConnell to keep his job, and a majority that seems to believe the best and only solution to our nation\u2019s problems is to rid itself of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A Canadian\u2019s passionate defense of Barack Obama offered a rare boost to the Democratic president after the Republican wave in last week\u2019s election.
