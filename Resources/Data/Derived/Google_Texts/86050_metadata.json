Judd Gregg\u2019s blast of Sen. Ted Cruz a day earlier. Gregg called Cruz \u201ca demagogue\u2019s demagogue,\u201d \u201ca person of little character\u201d and someone the lifelong Republican would not support in a general election.\n\nGregg said that he could bring himself to vote for Donald Trump in the general election, but not Cruz. If the Texas senator is the nominee, Gregg said, \u201cI\u2019d write in (U.S. House Speaker) Paul Ryan before I\u2019d vote for Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing Gregg\u2019s comments, as first reported by WMUR.com, Horn gave a measured response that deflected to criticism of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile Gregg blasted Cruz, Horn has in the past been deeply critical of GOP frontrunner Trump.\n\nIn December, she labeled as \u201cun-American\u201d Trump\u2019s call for a temporary \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the United States.\n\nLast November, she said Trump\u2019s \u201cbombast and divisive rhetoric\u201d would probably fail in New Hampshire. Trump won the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn August, when Trump made controversial comments about Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly, Horn called him \u201cdisrespectful to women.\u201d\n\nAnd in July, when Trump said Sen. John McCain was \u201cnot a war hero,\u201d Horn called his comment \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nBut as an unbound delegate to the Republican National Convention in July, Horn said she will remain neutral until she gets to Cleveland, and perhaps even until the first ballots for a presidential nominee are cast.\n\nGregg has decided not to go to the convention, telling WMUR.com on Friday he is \u201cnot excited about the direction the convention is going.\u201d\n\nA Cruz New Hampshire campaign co-chairman, former New Hampshire House Speaker William O\u2019Brien, brushed aside both Gregg\u2019s comments and those of former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who on Wednesday described Cruz as \u201cLucifer in the flesh.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately in this cycle, we\u2019ve come to a point where name-calling is substituted for political analysis and substituted for policy analysis,\u201d O\u2019Brien told WMUR political director Josh McElveen during a taping of this week\u2019s \u201cCloseUP\u201d program, which airs on Sunday at 10 a.m.\n\nO\u2019Brien and Ovide Lamontagne, state chairman for Carly Fiorina\u2019s former presidential campaign, praised the new alliance between Cruz and Fiorina, in which Fiorina agreed to become Cruz\u2019s running mate should he win the nomination.\n\nLamontagne and O\u2019Brien said the two comprise a ticket rooted in principled conservatism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a very robust conversation within the family of the Republican Party,\u201d Lamontagne said. But he said that if Trump wins the nomination, \u201cI\u2019m going to get behind him.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien would not go that far, calling Trump \u201cerratic, impulsive, ill-informed.\"\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, ramping up a tough re-election campaign, wanted no part of name-calling.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a vigorous primary, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to have these kinds of fights,\u201d she told McElveen on Friday.\n\nAyotte noted that she has had disagreements with Cruz, particularly on the 2013 government shutdown, which was fueled by Cruz\u2019s insistence that President Obama agree to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve directly addressed Senator Cruz\u201d on the shutdown, Ayotte said. And, she said, she will not hesitate to be \u201cvery clear where I agree or disagree\u201d with the eventual nominee and president.\n\nAyotte also stood by her earlier comments on support for the nominee.\n\n\u201cI said from the beginning that I plan to support the Republican nominee,\u201d she said, while also stressing that she\u2019s focusing on her re-election bid.\n\nHorn said that despite the party infighting at the national level, her party\u2019s Senate nominee will defeat Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan in November. She said Hassan has been a failed governor \u201cand has not earned a promotion.\u201d\n\nWMUR.com spoke with another veteran traditional New Hampshire Republican about the current state of affairs in his party.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there has ever been a nominating process like this, in which two such unusual individuals have turned out to be the frontrunners.\u201d\n\nBass said that while the \u201cestablishment\u201d is being criticized by both Trump and Cruz, \u201cI define the establishment as the people who go to the meetings and volunteer for campaigns. The establishment is not the elites. It is the people in every town and city in New Hampshire who are making the party work. And these candidates seem to have no respect for the work of these people.\u201d\n\nBass said Trump and Cruz \u201care the consequences of our own weakness. The Republican Party has not been what the people have expected from us. It started with the Tea Party movement, and now we have what I call the \u2018I Can\u2019t Take it Anymore\u2019 movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Ted Cruz defines raw ambition,\u201d Bass said. \u201cHe never cared about establishing relationships in the Senate. His agenda has been about him.\u201d\n\nBass said he is supporting Kasich, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m a Republican and I\u2019m going to support the Republican ticket, be it Cruz or Trump or Kasich.\u201d\n\nBass\u2019s advice to Ayotte and other New Hampshire Republicans who run on the ticket with Trump or Cruz is to be \u201cyour own candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t pick the Republican nominee. You support the nominee because he is part of the team, but you don\u2019t have to agree with the nominee up and down the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to weather the weather,\u201d Bass said of Ayotte. \u201cShe has her own record to talk about and the voters will decide. It\u2019s a game of draw poker and you don\u2019t get to pick the cards you draw.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 30 Apr 2016 11:33:18 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "With her party in disarray at the national level, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn is holding fast to her belief that whoever wins the GOP nomination will win the presidency in November.", "title": "Horn, Ayotte try to promote GOP unity in storm of disarray", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/horn-ayotte-try-to-promote-party-unity-in-storm-of-disarray/39289688", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/31174878/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/gsralnz/-/Commitment-2016-generic-graphic-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/horn-ayotte-try-to-promote-party-unity-in-storm-of-disarray/39289688", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/39289688", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/39289688", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/39289688"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/39289688", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/39289688", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/horn-ayotte-try-to-promote-party-unity-in-storm-of-disarray/39289688"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Jennifer Horn, Kelly Ayotte, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz , Bill O'Brien, Charlie Bass, Ovide Lamontagne, Commitment 2016", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDiStasoWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Jennifer Horn, Kelly Ayotte, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz , Bill O'Brien, Charlie Bass, Ovide Lamontagne, Commitment 2016", "description": "With her party in disarray at the national level, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn is holding fast to her belief that whoever wins the GOP nomination will win the presidency in November."}, "article_summary": "While Gregg blasted Cruz, Horn has in the past been deeply critical of GOP frontrunner Trump.\nWith her party in disarray at the national level, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn is holding fast to her belief that whoever wins the GOP nomination will win the presidency in November.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a very robust conversation within the family of the Republican Party,\u201d Lamontagne said.\nThe Republican Party has not been what the people have expected from us.\n\u201cI said from the beginning that I plan to support the Republican nominee,\u201d she said, while also stressing that she\u2019s focusing on her re-election bid."}
