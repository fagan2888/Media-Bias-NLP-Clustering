Good Earth State Park

South Dakota's newest state park can trace its history back long before settlers crossed the Big Sioux. Now a new chapter is beginning, sponsored by the Sierra Club of South Dakota.

The dirt field at Good Earth State Park might not look like much now, but just wait; Thanks to volunteers willing to get down and dirty, it will soon be home to over 6,000 baby trees.

Even the gloomy skies and blustery winds couldn't darken the mood Saturday. For the Daisy Girl Scouts in attendance, planting trees was just one more in a line of good deeds.

"They're doing their entire course this year in helping the community, so last night we picked up trash; today we're planting trees," Girl Scout Troop 44222 Leader Ammy Counterman said.

With Saturday's turnout, South Dakota park officials say Good Earth is seven acres closer to its overall goal of 33 filled with newly-planted trees.

"The reason we're planting is just one, to prevent soil erosion, two, to provide more wildlife habitat. This was grazed at one point, and then after that it had crops in it, so we're really restoring it back to probably what it was when years and years ago the settlers came through here," Sierra Club Volunteer Chairman Dana Loseke said.

The Sierra Club planted trees at Big Sioux Rec Area last year. Unfortunately, most of those plantings were washed away by floodwaters last june.

But Loseke says he's not discouraged, and the Sierra Club plans to replant the rec area soon.
