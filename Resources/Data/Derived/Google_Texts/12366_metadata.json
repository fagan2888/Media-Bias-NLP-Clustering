It\u2019s a transition many in England oppose (as do many Scots \u2013 check the polls), although any changes will take place in the voting booth rather than on the battlefield, where England preferred to settle such matters during the 18th century \u2013 as students of U.S. history are well aware.\n\nThen, Scots \u2013 particularly Highlanders \u2013 wanted to end oppressive British rule and restore the House of Stuart to the throne of the two kingdoms. In 1744, the youngest of those Stuarts, Bonnie Prince Charlie, convinced some Highland clan chiefs that he could raise an army with the help of old ally France and take the crown.\n\nThose plans were scuttled, in devastating fashion, at the Battle of Culloden.\n\nThe history leading up to this battle easily fills a book and can\u2019t quickly be summarized here. But Bonnie Prince Charlie raised a small army of 1,200 men and publicly announced his intentions on Aug. 19, 1745. His promise of French assistance was an empty one; no such pledge had been made. But victory near Edinburgh boosted morale and raised hopes. French money and weapons began to trickle in, and Charlie\u2019s army grew to more than 5,000.\n\nSix days\u2019 march from London, however, some of his own war chiefs decided an attack with such a force on England\u2019s capital would be madness, and forced a retreat northward, where they might consolidate their now-tired forces.\n\nOn Apr. 16, 1746, the two forces met on a treeless, boggy moor just east of Inverness. Charlie\u2019s 5,500 Jacobites and their allies, equipped with muskets and swords and a few cannons, charged toward 7,500 highly disciplined government troops who had trained to counter the fearsome Highland charge with skillful bayonet employment \u2013 and whose more highly skilled cannoneers unleashed grape shot as Charles\u2019 forces closed.\n\nThe result was carnage.\n\nIn less than an hour, around 1,200 of Charlie\u2019s troops lay dead, as many were wounded, and 376 were taken prisoner. A mere 50 government forces died, and less than 300 were wounded.\n\nAll lie buried in mass graves on the battlefield. The Highlanders are grouped by clan.\n\nThe battle marked the end of the clan system. Many Highlanders, including women and children, were murdered in the battle\u2019s aftermath, as England moved to crush any inclination to rise once again. Homes were looted, cattle stolen. As powerful symbols of the clans, the kilt, tartan and bagpipe were outlawed for decades.\n\nA visit to the site is both intellectually engaging and utterly sublime. The site has been wonderfully preserved. The Visitor Centre is an interactive marvel that provides a clear understanding of events that led up to the battle and a four-minute, Saving Private Ryan-quality film that recreates the clash on four walls, enveloping viewers with a startling sense of being there. The GPS-activated battlefield guide tells \u2013 and shows \u2013 visitors what happened where as they walk the site\u2019s paths.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Scotland, it is well worth the visit.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b0f\"", "article_summary": "Visit to a seminal battle site - in ScotlandDelaware Defense returns following a two-week break that took your correspondent to the Highlands of Scotland, which next year will hold a referendum on becoming independent from the United Kingdom.\nIn less than an hour, around 1,200 of Charlie\u2019s troops lay dead, as many were wounded, and 376 were taken prisoner.\nFrench money and weapons began to trickle in, and Charlie\u2019s army grew to more than 5,000.\nA visit to the site is both intellectually engaging and utterly sublime.\nIf you ever find yourself in Scotland, it is well worth the visit."}
