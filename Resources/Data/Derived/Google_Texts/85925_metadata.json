Despite marijuana being legalised in Colorado and Washington by referendum, the drug remains a schedule 1 controlled substance \u2013 along with heroin and ecstasy \u2013 under federal law.\n\nWhile the justice department said last year that it would not challenge the legalisation by both Colorado and Washington, the White House has stressed that Mr Obama does not favour amending the federal rules.\n\nThe president made his comments in a wide-ranging 17,000-word profile that surveyed the challenges facing his final three years in office after what is widely agreed to have been his worst 12 months.\n\nHe admitted the disclosure that US spies listened in on the telephone of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, felt \"like a breach of trust and I can't argue with her being aggravated about that\".\n\nHe conceded that the likelihood of the US reaching final treaties in its three major initiatives in the Middle East \u2013 on Iran's nuclear programme, the dispute between Israel and Palestinians, and Syria was \"less than fifty-fifty\".\n\n\"On the other hand,\" he said, \"in all three circumstances we may be able to push the boulder partway up the hill and maybe stabilise it so it doesn't roll back on us.\"\n\nAsked, after stepping back from intervening in Syria, if he were haunted by the horrors of the country's bloody civil war, Mr Obama said: \"I am haunted by what's happened. I am not haunted by my decision not to engage in another Middle Eastern war.\"\n\nSpeaking amid sharp Republican criticism of his handling of post-war Iraq, Mr Obama suggested that the power wielded there by al-Qaeda \u2013 whose flags fly over the city of Fallujah \u2013 was overstated.\n\nJust because a second-string school basketball team \"puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn't make them Kobe Bryant,\" said Mr Obama, referring to the star player for the Los Angeles Lakers NBA team, in what his interviewer described as an \"uncharacteristically flip analogy\".\n\nThe article disclosed that Mr Obama's wife, Michelle, has already begun working on an autobiography for publication after the couple leave the White House. The president plans to write his own memoirs of his time in office, which are expected to fetch a record $20 million (\u00a312 million) from a publisher.\n\nIt also explained that Malia, the couple's older daughter, is \"an aspiring filmmaker\" and is a fan of the sexually-explicit HBO series Girls, of which her parents are said to have been \"wary\".\n\nAfter some of his loftier ambitions for transforming America were crushed by the partisan realities of Washington, Mr Obama repeatedly played down the ability of the US president to effect change.\n\n\"We're part of a long-running story,\" he said. \"We just try to get our paragraph right.\n\n\"The President of the United States cannot remake our society, and that's probably a good thing,\" he went on, before pausing and adding: \"Not 'probably' - it's definitely a good thing.\"", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02795/obama_2795829k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jonswaine"}, "keywords": "barack obama, marijuana, drugs, colorado, legalise, Barack Obama,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;North_America;USA;Barack_Obama;Jon_Swaine", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/barackobama", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "barack obama, marijuana, drugs, colorado, legalise", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Barack Obama says smoking marijuana less dangerous than drinking alcohol", "section-id": 4411, "GSAGenre": "barackobama", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-barackobama", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/barackobama", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "US president risks undermining national drugs laws by stating that smoking marijuana is less dangerous than drinking alcohol", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 10582947, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-19", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-barack_obama", "last-modified": "2014-01-19", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 693, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Jon Swaine", "tag": "Jon Swaine", "subsection": "Barack Obama", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 3, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10582947, "tmgads.articleid": 10582947, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Barack Obama says smoking marijuana less dangerous than drinking alcohol  \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10582947/Barack-Obama-says-smoking-marijuana-less-dangerous-than-drinking-alcohol.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02795/obama_2795829k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10582947\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-19T19:23:35Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Jon Swaine\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Barack Obama\",\"Jon Swaine\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "US president risks undermining national drugs laws by stating that smoking marijuana is less dangerous than drinking alcohol", "title": "Barack Obama says smoking marijuana less dangerous than drinking alcohol", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10582947/Barack-Obama-says-smoking-marijuana-less-dangerous-than-drinking-alcohol.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02795/obama_2795829k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "barackobama", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.barackobama", "DCSext.author": "Jon Swaine", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-01-19 19:23"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0330\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama has said that smoking marijuana is less dangerous than drinking alcohol in an interview that risked undermining national drugs laws.\nMr Obama said that using the drug, which remains illegal under US federal law, was safer than drinking \"in terms of its impact on the individual consumer\".\nSpeaking amid sharp Republican criticism of his handling of post-war Iraq, Mr Obama suggested that the power wielded there by al-Qaeda \u2013 whose flags fly over the city of Fallujah \u2013 was overstated.\nAfter some of his loftier ambitions for transforming America were crushed by the partisan realities of Washington, Mr Obama repeatedly played down the ability of the US president to effect change.\nAsked, after stepping back from intervening in Syria, if he were haunted by the horrors of the country's bloody civil war, Mr Obama said: \"I am haunted by what's happened."}
