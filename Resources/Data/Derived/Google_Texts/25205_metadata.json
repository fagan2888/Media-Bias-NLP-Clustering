Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Paul ties release of 9/11 docs to defense bill Will Ted Cruz let it go? MORE (R-Ky.) is a wild card this week as the Senate makes a last-second bid to approve sweeping cybersecurity legislation before leaving for the August recess.\n\nWeeks after the news that nearly 22 million federal workers had their personal information hacked, the Senate is set to consider a bill to boost the exchange of information on cyber threats between the public and private sector. Supporters argue it would greatly improve protections against hackers.\n\nBut privacy advocates warn the bill is simply a mechanism that allows the government to get its hands on private citizens' data. They see it as another intrusive attempt to empower government surveillance programs, and wonder if Paul, a GOP presidential candidate who has made his name fighting over such issues, will take a new stand.\n\n\u201cThis is a ready-made moment where people are passionate about the issue and people are getting engaged,\u201d said Nathan White, \u200ethe senior legislative manager at Access, a digital rights group helping run a viral protest campaign against the bill. \u201cI hope he is taking note of that.\u201d\n\nBut Paul has been mum, declining to weigh in on the measure known as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA). It\u2019s led some to wonder why he\u2019s not grabbing the chance to make a splash as his presidential polling numbers stagnate. Since briefly hovering above the 10 percent mark during the NSA fight, Paul has slowly receded to 5.5 percent, according to a RealClearPolitics national average.\n\n\u201cIf he were to publicly position himself on this, it would be perfectly timed to the first presidential debate,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a Republican consultant, referring to next Thursday\u2019s inaugural primary clash. \u201cHe could really use it to try and punch through the Donald Trump Donald TrumpTrump aide: 'Hillary is the one who\u2019s got a gender gap' Trump aide: Picking a woman or minority as VP would be 'pandering' Trump adviser: He will 'soften' on Muslim ban MORE media blackhole.\u201d\n\nPaul has reaped the benefits of a high-profile stand against government surveillance before.\n\nHis White House bid got off to a bang in May when he served as the foil to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellRyan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era Trump and Ryan to speak by phone Bill would require nominees to release tax returns MORE (R-Ky.) in the heated debate over whether to reform the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nPaul deployed every procedural tactic available to stymie, stall and prohibit the upper chamber from advancing even the shortest reauthorization of a dragnet NSA spying program that collected phone metadata on American citizens.\n\nHe forced the Senate to work late into a Friday night and then return early from a week-long recess for a rare Sunday session, grabbing headlines along the way. Throughout, Paul spent hours on the floor, inveighing against what he described as oppressive and unconstitutional government snooping during a 10.5 hour speech.\n\nEventually, the Senate approved a bill, the USA Freedom Act, that killed the phone metadata program and added several NSA oversight and transparency provisions. Still, Paul voted against the final measure, arguing it didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nOnly a month after declaring his candidacy for the White House, the Kentucky Republican was suddenly a media darling. He was quick to use the attention to help fill his campaign coffers and strengthen ties with the deep-pocketed Silicon Valley community.\n\nBut things have slowed since for the Paul campaign, with business mogul Donald Trump hogging the headlines \u2014 and leading the polls.\n\nPrivacy advocates and strategists say the cyber debate may be a chance for Paul to reconnect with many of the same grassroots supporters that boosted his campaign during the last surveillance debate.\n\nPaul voted in June against attaching CISA\u2019s language to a defense authorization bill because the maneuver would restrict senators from amending the text. The vote bucked the party line and hinted Paul may have larger concerns about the bill.\n\n\u201cThis seems like something he should be getting involved in,\u201d said Access\u2019s White.\n\nAccess is part of the broad coalition of civil liberties advocates and digital privacy groups that set up a website this week \u2014 stopcyberspying.com \u2014 which lets anyone write up and send a fax to senators. As of Friday, over 6 million faxes had flooded the upper chamber\u2019s offices.\n\nA Wednesday \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d on reddit with the campaign's organizers spent much of the afternoon on the site\u2019s homepage, boosted by thousands of up-votes.\n\nThese are Paul\u2019s potential backers, White said. Of the roughly $7 million Paul has raised his April launch, 85 percent came via contributions of $50 or under, indicating considerable grassroots support.\n\n\u201cI would be very supportive of him using procedural tactics to delay,\u201d White said. \u201cI think he would get a lot of support.\u201d\n\nBut in many ways, the cybersecurity fight is not like the May\u2019s NSA scuffle.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s simply not as high-profile. A bill that would strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding has dominated floor time this past week as anti-abortion activists continue to release videos showing organization officials discussing its fetal tissue donation program.\n\nPaul has chosen to prioritize the battle to defund Planned Parenthood, said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really grabbed that and run with it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s a groundswell of grassroots activity opposing CISA, the major Silicon Valley players have largely stayed out of the debate. Companies like Google and Facebook were vocal adversaries to the NSA in May, but have declined to take a major stance on CISA.\n\nTherefore, a high-profile filibuster attempt might not gain Paul much favor with the tech set, Mackowiak said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think what he does or doesn\u2019t do on the cyber bill is going to change\u201d his relationship with Silicon Valley, he explained.\n\nThe ongoing fallout from the catastrophic hacks at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has also generated a sense of public urgency for Congress to act on a cyber bill.\n\nGumming up the gears in the face of such public pressure is not a clear win for a Republican presidential candidate, Bonjean said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to alienate those who are concerned about more attacks from overseas or from lone wolfs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could be a little more complicated than other debates he\u2019s been in.\"\n\nThe campaign trail schedule may even play against Paul\u2019s ability to contest the bill.\n\nPaul has already committed to a Voters First Forum on Monday night in New Hampshire with nearly every GOP candidate. And the senator will likely be spending time this week on debate prep ahead of Thursday\u2019s tilt.\n\n\"This may be a little bit of cynical way to look at it, Mackowiak said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s prepared to spend Monday through Thursday there [in the Senate].\"\n\nSen.
