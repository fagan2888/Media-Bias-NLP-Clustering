Newsbusters, for example, makes a living out of pointing out daily examples of a liberal agenda at MSNBC and (to a lesser extent) CNN. Media Matters serves up the same meal to its readers in regards to Fox and a conservative agenda, and even goes so far to move into activist territory (with no success) with petitions like this one.\n\nThe existence of partisan media outlets and playing to the crowd to help validate the steadfast beliefs of its readers on a daily basis isn\u2019t exactly breaking news. But here\u2019s a growing trend worth noting: The accusations of bias in the world of entertainment where it doesn\u2019t exist. We saw that recently with Selma and American Sniper leading up to the Oscar\u2019s, with the former being somehow \u201csnubbed\u201d despite being nominated for Best Picture (because the Academy is old and white and racist and stuff\u202612 Years a Slave winning the previous year notwithstanding) and the latter being snubbed by not winning the award outright because of Hollywood not embracing the military as much as it should (despite films like Hurt Locker winning in the not-so-distant past and nominations to Saving Private Ryan (correction) and Zero Dark Thirty).\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen and continue to see, almost all TV shows about Washington feature noble Democrats caring more and being deeper thinkers than their eeeeeviiil Republican counterparts. The West Wing was the best example (exceptionally articulate liberal geniuses winning policy battles over myopic, crusty conservatives). In the present, Scandal makes no apologies for being anti-GOP, nor did The Newsroom (Sorkin again). Madam Secretary might as well change Tea Leoni\u2018s character\u2019s name to Hillary. It\u2019s Hollywood, it\u2019s liberal. It is what it is. Deal with it. But\u2026those programs did/do lose more than a few viewers when blatantly taking a side. The same can\u2019t be said about House of Cards, which can\u2019t be bothered with making political statements with so many more compelling things going on.\n\nSo you can understand why it is so patently hilarious to read about accusations of bias when it comes to the best show to come onto our radar since The Sopranos in the form of the Netflix smash hit. And in a twist of irony, the bias accusations aren\u2019t coming from conservatives because the lead character\u2013the great Kevin Spacey\u2018s Frank Underwood\u2013is a Democrat everyone roots for, but from progressive outlets who feel the show is decidedly right-wing (more on that in a moment).\n\nBefore we continue, know this: Cards is the phenomenon it is not because of any Republican or Democratic messaging, or some kind of subtle undercurrent pushing a particular political agenda. What makes the series addictive for so many (more than five million people have viewed the official Season 3 trailer alone) are four things: The acting (Spacey elevates the entire cast to its A+ game, particularly Robin Wright\u2018s Claire Underwood), the unpredictability (I didn\u2019t see that train scene coming in Season 2, either) and the ruthlessness (those with something called emotion are doomed). But most of all, the writing\u2013custom-made for Spacey the way the late Harold Ramis teed up Bill Murray in Stripes, Caddyshack, Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day\u2013is absolutely tremendous. That said here\u2019s your top 10 quotes from the Spacey\u2019s Underwood:\n\n\u201cFriends make the worst enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney is the Mc-mansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power is the old stone building thast stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn\u2019t see the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are two kinds of pain. The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain. The sort of pain that\u2019s only suffering. I have no patience for useless things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe road to power is paved with hypocrisy, and casualties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nature of promises, Linda, is that they remain immune to changing circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loathed the necessity of sleep. Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.\u201d\n\n\u201cA great man once said, everything is about sex. Except sex. Sex is about power.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best thing about human beings is that they stack so neatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cPower is a lot like real estate. It\u2019s all about location, location, location. The closer you are to the source, the higher your property value.\u201d\n\nLike Tony Soprano, we all love Frank Underwood because\u2013while he\u2019s constantly scheming and lying\u2013he\u2019s still honest in his convictions and realistic about the soulless world around him. And this is why millions binged on House of Cards this weekend: Not for the political or ideological aspects of the show\u2013which merely serve background noise and therefore are completely inconsequential to the meat of the show\u2013but for its real premise: The pursuit of power above all else\u2026including things like love and loyalty.\n\nBut because everything always goes back to hidden agendas these days, this still isn\u2019t stopping these kind of headlines since the series began:\n\nHuffington Post: House of Cards is a Republican Fantasy World\n\nSalon: Why was Francis Underwood a Democrat? (the title should be \u201cis\u201d instead of \u201cwas\u201d considering Underwood is still very much alive on the series)\n\nHollywood Progessive: House of Cards Promotes Right-Wing Agenda\n\nFor those who don\u2019t watch the show, Spacey\u2019s Frank Underwood is indeed a Democrat, albeit one from South Carolina in the spirit of the old Blue Dog model. And yes, he does push to privatize social security to fund a job creation program, and in previous chapters has advocated raising the retirement age to 68. In Season 1, the teachers union is an Underwood target for major concessions (not because union-busting is something Frank actually cares about, but because it will get him closer to the president and eventually the vice presidency). Again, these policy plotlines are completely inconsequential, as the premise is always about Frank\u2013in the spirit of Littlefinger\u2019s speech on gaining power to Varys in Game of Thrones\u2014creating chaos not as a pit, but as a ladder to bigger things. It\u2019s not like Frank has any real principles or actual ambition to make the country a better place. Instead, Cards is all about obtaining power and holding onto it.\n\nSo is House of Cards a turnoff to members of either political party? Doesn\u2019t appear that way: Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared to TMZ before the weekend he plans on binge-watching the show. Hillary loves the show, as does the president (who once marveled at Underwood\u2019s ruthless efficiency in getting things done). House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was the first amateur actor to appear on the show (Season 2) after befriending Spacey a year earlier. He apparently has made quoting Underwood a hobby when on the Hill.\n\nBipartisan support in DC?\n\nYes, it exists\u2026only on Netflix. The agenda: Entertaining the masses through exceptional acting, writing and production.\n\nNothing more.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>>Follow Joe Concha on Twitter @JoeConchaTV", "article_metadata": {"description": "A word heard often in the world of media and especially cable news is agenda.
