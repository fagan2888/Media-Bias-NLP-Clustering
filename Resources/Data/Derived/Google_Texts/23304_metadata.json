Two candidates for the Republican presidential nomination advocated a \u201cChristians only\u201d policy for the resettlement of displaced Syrians and governors lined up to declare that Syrians were not welcome in their states, prompting an angry reaction from President Obama.\n\nThe reaction against Syrian refugees is due in part to the suggestion that one of the Paris attackers, who are believed to have been affiliated with the terror group ISIS, was able to get into the European Union by posing as a refugee fleeing the violence of the Syrian civil war. The Obama administration has pledged to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year and has promised to carefully screen them for ties to terror groups first.\n\nRelated: Why Paris Was the Target of the ISIS Massacre\n\nLawmakers have said that they don\u2019t believe the administration has the ability to do that effectively.\n\n\u201cYou can have a thousand people come in and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence,\u201d said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a leading candidate for the GOP presidential nomination. \u201cBut one of them is an ISIS fighter \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, you have a problem.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to vet that out. There\u2019s no background check system in the world that allows us to find that out because who do you call in Syria to background check them?\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Rep. Peter King (R-NY), who chairs the committee\u2019s panel on counterterrorism and intelligence, said that law enforcement and intelligence sources have told them such background checks are ineffective.\n\nRelated: Bush \u2014 U.S. Should Only Accept \u2018Christian\u2019 Refugees from Syria\n\nSpeaking at the G-20 meeting he attended over the weekend in Turkey, President Obama pushed back hard against the idea that the U.S. should prevent Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs president, my first priority is the safety of the American people. And that's why even as we accept more refugees, including Syrians, we do so only after subjecting them to rigorous screening and security checks. We also have to remember that many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves. That's what they're fleeing. Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values. Our nations can welcome refugees who are desperately seeking safety and ensure our own security. We can and must do both.\u201d\n\nObama also sharply rebuked politicians who \u201cfeed the dark impulse\u201d to demonize entire cultures or religions because of the actions of a few.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that's shameful. That's not American, it's not who we are.\u201d\n\nRelated: Will France Call on NATO to Join the Fight Against ISIS?\n\nObama\u2019s remarks appeared to directly target Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has called for the U.S. to limit itself to accepting Christian refugees only, saying on Sunday, \u201cThere is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror. If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation.\u201d\n\nThough Cruz is not the only GOP candidate to call for limiting immigration from Syria to Christians \u2014 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said the same thing on Sunday \u2014 a big part of Cruz\u2019s political biography is that his father escaped the repressive Castro regime in Cuba and found sanctuary in the U.S.\n\nObama continued, \u201cIt is good to remember that the United States does not have a religious test and we are a nation of many peoples of different faiths, which means that we show compassion to everybody. Those are the universal values we stand for.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks, however, did little to stem the tide of governors issuing statements and signing orders designed to block any effort to resettle Syrian refugees in their states.\n\nRelated: Obama Readies Biggest Reach of Presidential Power Yet\n\nBy early afternoon on Monday, the governors of Alabama, Michigan, Indiana, Louisiana, Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi and Texas \u2014 all of whom are Republicans \u2014 had said that their states would not accept Syrian refugees. Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, also a Republican, said that he would not support the resettlement of Syrian refugees in his state until he is satisfied with the process being used to screen them for ties to ISIS or other terror groups.\n\nIt is far from clear that the governors of U.S. states have the authority to block individual Syrians whom the federal government allows into the country from settling anywhere they please. However, they do have the ability to block state-level agencies from providing assistance to federal programs facilitating the resettlement of refugees.\n\nA statement released by Texas Gov. Greg Abbot captured the general tone of the most of announcements: \u201cGiven the tragic attacks in Paris and the threats we have already seen, Texas cannot participate in any program that will result in Syrian refugees \u2014 any one of whom could be connected to terrorism \u2014 being resettled in Texas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The public debate over how the U.S. should respond to terror attacks in Paris and the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis quickly turned toxic in the past 24 hours, as two candidates for the Republican presidential nomination advocated a \u201cChristians only\u201d policy for the resettlement of displaced Syrians, and governors lined up to declare that Syrians were not welcome in their states, prompting an angry reaction from President Obama.", "title": "Christians Only?
