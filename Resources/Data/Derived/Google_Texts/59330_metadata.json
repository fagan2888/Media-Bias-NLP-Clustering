To others, they can look like squished flowers. When scientists used NASA data to peer into clouds, what they saw resembled a hazard sign warning of a fast-deteriorating climate ahead.\n\nAnalysis of the first seven years of data from a NASA cloud-monitoring mission suggests clouds are doing less to slow the warming of the planet than previously thought, and that temperatures may rise faster than expected as greenhouse gas pollution worsens\u2014perhaps 25 percent faster.\n\nClouds can play an important role in slowing global warming by reflecting energy back into space. As temperatures rise, clouds contain more liquid water and fewer ice crystals, making them brighter, meaning they reflect more sunlight.\n\nThe new research, however, suggests climate models have overestimated how much ice is in clouds, meaning less is available to be converted to liquid as temperatures rise.\n\n\u201cWhen carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures rise, then mixed-phase clouds will increase their liquid water content,\u201d said Ivy Tan, a PhD candidate at Yale University who led the research, which investigated common clouds that contain both ice and water. \u201cMany models are overestimating how much ice is in the mixed-phase clouds.\u201d\n\nThe repercussions of the findings, which were published Thursday in Science, could make it harder to hold warming to limits set during recent United Nations climate negotiations\u2014but they\u2019re being received cautiously by other climate scientists, with questions raised over the results of the analysis.\n\nThe coldest clouds are full of ice; the warmest are full of water. Modeling experiments by Tan and two other scientists focused on inbetweeners\u2014mixed-phase clouds, such as undulating stratiform and fluffy stratocumulus clouds, which are abundant over the vast Southern Ocean and around the Northern Hemisphere north of New York.\n\nFor their study, the researchers used the NASA data to guide the modification of a popular earth model. They added more liquid and less ice to the clouds in their model simulations, striving to create more realistic conditions.\n\nBecause there was less ice, cloud brightness increased more slowly than it did in the unmodified model, since fewer ice crystals were replaced with reflective liquid as temperatures warmed.\n\nOne of climate science\u2019s great quests is to project how much earth warms when carbon dioxide concentrations double\u2014something known as climate sensitivity. When carbon dioxide levels were doubled in the modified model, temperatures rose by at least a quarter more than they did when the unmodified model was used\u2014to at least 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F).\n\nWhat the findings might actually mean for earth will depend heavily on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases yet gets billowed into the atmosphere, and how quickly. But the discovery suggests impacts from climate change will be worse, and that they will get worse more quickly than earth models had previously indicated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That same survey indicates temperatures could rise as much as 25 percent faster than previously expected", "title": "Clouds won\u2019t slow climate change: NASA survey finds their cooling effects have been overstated", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "That same survey indicates temperatures could rise as much as 25 percent faster than previously expected", "title": "Clouds won\u2019t slow climate change: NASA survey finds their cooling effects have been overstated", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/10/clouds_wont_save_us_from_global_warming_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/shutterstock_193491221.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "That same survey indicates temperatures could rise as much as 25 percent faster than previously expected", "title": "Clouds won\u2019t slow climate change: NASA survey finds their cooling effects have been overstated", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/shutterstock_193491221.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Upton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Central, Climate Change, Global Warming", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Climate Central, Climate Change, Global Warming, Sustainability News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on Climate CentralTo some, clouds resemble bunnies.\nFor their study, the researchers used the NASA data to guide the modification of a popular earth model.\nAs temperatures rise, clouds contain more liquid water and fewer ice crystals, making them brighter, meaning they reflect more sunlight.\nWhen scientists used NASA data to peer into clouds, what they saw resembled a hazard sign warning of a fast-deteriorating climate ahead.\nThey added more liquid and less ice to the clouds in their model simulations, striving to create more realistic conditions."}
