The only trouble is this sounded a lot like what Hitler did. Even his own opponents thought he\u2019d gone too far.\n\nAt the time, Bill Maher, who is certainly known as a critic of the extreme aspects of the Muslim faith, disagreed with what Trump said posting on Facebook:\n\nAs someone with the credentials of always keeping it real about Islam, let me say #Trump\u2019s idea about registering Muslims is outrageous. Posted by Bill Maher on Thursday, November 19, 2015\n\nFriday night on the last \u201cReal Time\u201d of the year, Maher blasted Trump for ginning up fear post-Paris which has resulted in a bump in his polls. Leave it to Islamophobia to bring the GOP voters together around someone.\n\n\u201cHe floated the idea of closing down mosques, but he\u2019s going to do it his way: he\u2019s going to buy them, turn them into casinos, and then slide them into bankruptcy,\u201d Maher said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of walking this back, but he was talking about this yesterday\u2014setting up different places across the country for every Muslim to register so they can be tracked. This is going to take a lot of manpower! It sounds like we\u2019re going to have to hire Mexicans!\u201d\n\nMaher went on to say that the GOP candidates are \u201ctripping over each other\u201d attempting to look tough and presidential over the Syrian refugee issue.
