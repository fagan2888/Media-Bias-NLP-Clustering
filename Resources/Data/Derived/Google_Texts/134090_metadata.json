But German legal officials have suggested that such operations are only justifiable in actual war zones.\n\nRamstein Air Base (AB), Germany, flies over the Ramstein AB tower, before retiring to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) or \u201cbone yard\u201d at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.\n\nA TOP-SECRET U.S. intelligence document obtained by The Intercept confirms that the sprawling U.S. military base in Ramstein, Germany serves as the high-tech heart of America\u2019s drone program. Ramstein is the site of a satellite relay station that enables drone operators in the American Southwest to communicate with their remote aircraft in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and other targeted countries. The top-secret slide deck, dated July 2012, provides the most detailed blueprint seen to date of the technical architecture used to conduct strikes with Predator and Reaper drones.\n\nAmid fierce European criticism of America\u2019s targeted killing program, U.S. and German government officials have long downplayed Ramstein\u2019s role in lethal U.S. drone operations and have issued carefully phrased evasions when confronted with direct questions about the base. But the slides show that the facilities at Ramstein perform an essential function in lethal drone strikes conducted by the CIA and the U.S. military in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa.\n\nThe slides were provided by a source with knowledge of the U.S. government\u2019s drone program who declined to be identified because of fears of retribution. According to the source, Ramstein\u2019s importance to the U.S. drone war is difficult to overstate. \u201cRamstein carries the signal to tell the drone what to do and it returns the display of what the drone sees. Without Ramstein, drones could not function, at least not as they do now,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe new evidence places German Chancellor Angela Merkel in an awkward position given Germany\u2019s close diplomatic alliance with the United States. The German government has granted the U.S. the right to use the property, but only under the condition that the Americans do nothing there that violates German law.\n\nThe U.S. government maintains that its drone strikes against al Qaeda and its \u201cassociated forces\u201d are legal, even outside of declared war zones. But German legal officials have suggested that such operations are only justifiable in actual war zones. Moreover, Germany has the right to prosecute \u201ccriminal offenses against international law \u2026 even when the offense was committed abroad and bears no relation to Germany,\u201d according to Germany\u2019s Code of Crimes against International Law, which passed in 2002.\n\nThis means that American personnel stationed at Ramstein could, in theory, be vulnerable to German prosecution if they provide drone pilots with data used in attacks.\n\nRead the full article at The Intercept.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. government maintains that its drone strikes against al Qaeda and its \u201cassociated forces\u201d are legal, even outside of declared war zones.
