It will be open Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to handle the tens of thousands of registered runners and walkers.\n\nBarring a crush of registrants Friday, the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run will not reach its registration cap of 38,500 for the first time since it was lowered to that mark in 2012.\n\nRun schedule Friday 8 a.m.-8 p.m. \u2014 Bridge Run Expo and Packet Pick-up, Charleston Area Convention Center, 5001 Coliseum Drive, North Charleston. Noon- 6 p.m. \u2014 Bridge Run Kids Run & Wonderfest, Hampton Park (races start at 5 p.m.). 5-8 p.m. \u2014 Taste of Charleston at three locations: Charleston Maritime Center, 10 Wharfside St., Charleston; Cinebarre, 963 Houston Northcutt Blvd., Mount Pleasant; Charleston Area Convention Center, North Charleston. Saturday 5-7 a.m. \u2014 Shuttle buses start loading and departing from five different locations, including Calhoun Street at Anson Street (last bus leaves at 6:45 p.m.), Charleston Area Convention Center in North Charleston, Mamie Whitesides Elementary, Mount Pleasant Towne Center and Laing Middle School in Mount Pleasant. 8 a.m. \u2014 Start of the first of 14 waves of the Cooper River Bridge Run, Coleman Boulevard near Simmons Street. 8:30 a.m.- noon \u2014 Finish Festival, Marion Square. Sunday Full coverage of the Bridge Run will start on postandcourier.com Saturday afternoon with a special print edition on the race, complete with nearly 10,000 finisher names, on Sunday. Flowertown Festival 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at S. Main Street and Azalea Park in downtown Summerville.\n\nAs of mid-afternoon Thursday, registrations were at 32,500, according to Assistant Race Director Tami Varn.\n\n\u201cI think the reason why registrations are low is because it (the Bridge Run) is a week earlier than normal and because the weather has been so bad,\u201d said Varn, noting that the date is bumped up one week early when Easter falls on the first weekend of April.\n\nSpeculation abounds on the lower registration numbers, but one fact that Bridge Run staff has been playing down has been the increased price of the race. Late registration is now $55, up $10 from last year.\n\nRainy Friday, chilly Saturday\n\nFor the Flowertown Festival in Summerville, rain may be an issue on Friday where chances of precipitation are about 70 percent in the late morning and early afternoon. The big arts and crafts festival starts at 9 a.m. Friday and runs through Sunday.\n\nThe weather forecast for Saturday certainly won\u2019t rally more bridge run registrants \u2014 particularly walkers, who tend to favor fair weather \u2014 as temperatures at the 8 a.m. start are expected to be about 40 degrees, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Wendy Sellers.\n\nSellers said the wind is the result of cool high pressure building in behind a front expected to bring the rain Friday, which also does not bode well for the Bridge Run\u2019s Kids Run & Wonderfest activities at Hampton Park.\n\nWonderfest activities start at noon, but actual races for children don\u2019t start until 5 p.m.\n\nFor the bridge run Saturday, rain won\u2019t be an issue, temperatures are going to be considerably lower and for the wind-adverse, the forecast also is breezier than normal for the morning with an anticipated northwest wind at about 10 to 15 mph, which means an indirect headwind for runners on the bridge.\n\nFlowertown festival crowds\n\nIn Summerville, it\u2019s all hands on deck as the town braces for an influx of an estimated 250,000 visitors for the Flowertown Festival.\n\nOfficers will man nearly every corner in the downtown festival area.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re ready,\u201d said Capt. John Rogers of the Summerville Police Department.\n\nSome roads, including a portion of Main Street, are closed to vehicles and others are limited to one-way traffic.\n\nPete Frazier, who lives on Main Street, plans not to drive anywhere during the three-day event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy trying to get down the street,\u201d he said. \u201cTraffic is incredible, and people park everywhere along the roads. I\u2019ll go out and walk the festival, but I won\u2019t drive anywhere all weekend.\u201d\n\nSafety measures\n\nFor the second year, security at the bridge run will be tight \u2014 the result of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 \u2014 for the Bridge Run events.\n\nLaw enforcement and Bridge Run officials have been trying to discourage people from bringing backpacks to hold changes of clothes, but with the relatively cold spring morning, people will need warm clothes.\n\nThose bringing backpacks are encouraged to use clear ones, such as the ones provided by the Bridge Run this year and last.\n\n\u201cSweat shuttles,\u201d trucks that will carry backpacks from the starting area to the finish area, will be parked away from the starting line staging area for security reasons. Those shuttles will be near a vacant building at the former sites of the Pane e Vino, Sette and Pizza Hut restaurants near Coleman Boulevard and Mill Street, and at Sea Island Shopping Center at the back of the staging area.\n\nSimilar to last year, members of the S.C. State Guard will be stationed at every entry point of the corrals at the starting area to verify race numbers and inspect any suspicious gear or bulky clothing. Participants can wear costumes, but will likely be searched.\n\nWeeks ago, Mount Pleasant Deputy Police Chief Stan Gragg and Charleston City Deputy Police Chief Anthony Elder met with the media to discuss this year\u2019s security measures.\n\nGragg and Elder asked that participants and spectators continue to be cooperative, vigilant about arriving to the starting line on time and to report any suspicious activity by calling 911. Law enforcement, including federal, state and local agencies, will be manning a command center in the area.\n\nGragg reiterated Thursday, \u201cIf you see something (suspicious), say something.\u201d\n\nRoad closures for Flowertown\n\nIn Summerville, some roads, including a portion of Main Street, are closed to vehicles and others are limited to one-way travel.\n\nNorthbound Main Street traffic will be rerouted two blocks over to Gum Street at Joyce Lane, returning to Main Street via East Richardson. Southbound traffic will be rerouted one block to South Magnolia. Main Street crossroads between Joyce and East Richardson are also closed.\n\nVisitors can park in parking spaces, the town\u2019s garage or along the streets. Handicap parking is available at First Citizens Bank at 218 S. Main St.\n\nFestival organizers will also provide transportation to those in need. Golf carts can be requested at the Information Booth at 2nd Street and 5th Street.\n\nRoad closures\n\nThe earliest road closures for the bridge run will be the starting line staging area on Coleman Boulevard, between Page\u2019s Okra Grill and Sea Island Shopping Center, as well as Calhoun Street between King and East Bay Street starting at 4:30 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe closure of the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge starts with the bike and pedestrian lane at 6:30 a.m. Saturday, followed by the entire bridge and race route at 7 a.m. Roadways will be opened as participants clear them. Typically the bridge reopens by 11 a.m.\n\nDespite the closures, people who aren\u2019t involved in the race can still get around by vehicle.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Johnnie Dodds Boulevard and Interstate 526 are still open. In downtown Charleston, people can drive around the race route segments of Meeting and King streets by using parallel routes of East Bay Street, St. Philip Street, Rutledge and Coming streets and crosstown routes such as Broad Street.\n\nEast Bay near Market Street, however, is expected to be more congested than normal as the Carnival Fantasy cruise ship, packed with about 2,000 passengers, will arrive at 7 a.m. Saturday, and unload passengers. The cruise ship will load passengers in the afternoon and embark at 4 p.m.\n\nWhen the Fantasy arrived at 6 a.m. during the Bridge Run morning in 2011, local merchants complained about the traffic and how it was hurting their businesses. Some simply didn\u2019t bother to open that morning.\n\nBrenda Rindge contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bridge Run registrations down; rain, cold may affect biggest weekend, News, \r\nNewsCooper River Bridge Run, \r\nRavenel Bridge Anniversary, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Bridge Run,Charleston,Flowertown Festival,Summerville", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Barring a crush of registrants Friday, the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run will not reach its registration cap of 38,500 for the first time since it was lowered to that mark in 2012.", "title": "Bridge Run registrations down; rain, cold may affect biggest weekend", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150326/150329445/bridge-run-registrations-down-rain-cold-may-affect-biggest-weekend", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150326/PC16/150329445/AR/0/AR-150329445.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150326/PC16/150329445/AR/0/AR-150329445.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barring a crush of registrants Friday, the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run will not reach its registration cap of 38,500 for the first time since it was lowered to that mark in 2012.", "title": "Bridge Run registrations down; rain, cold may affect biggest weekend", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150326/PC16/150329445/AR/0/AR-150329445.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150329445}}, "keywords": "Bridge Run registrations down; rain, cold may affect biggest weekend , News, \r\nNewsCooper River Bridge Run, \r\nRavenel Bridge Anniversary, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Bridge Run,Charleston,Flowertown Festival,Summerville", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-26T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T19:38:00Z", "author": "David Quick"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Barring a crush of registrants Friday, the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run will not reach its registration cap of 38,500 for the first time since it was lowered to that mark in 2012."}, "article_summary": "Northbound Main Street traffic will be rerouted two blocks over to Gum Street at Joyce Lane, returning to Main Street via East Richardson.\nRun schedule Friday 8 a.m.-8 p.m. \u2014 Bridge Run Expo and Packet Pick-up, Charleston Area Convention Center, 5001 Coliseum Drive, North Charleston.\nNoon- 6 p.m. \u2014 Bridge Run Kids Run & Wonderfest, Hampton Park (races start at 5 p.m.).\nThose bringing backpacks are encouraged to use clear ones, such as the ones provided by the Bridge Run this year and last.\n8 a.m. \u2014 Start of the first of 14 waves of the Cooper River Bridge Run, Coleman Boulevard near Simmons Street."}
