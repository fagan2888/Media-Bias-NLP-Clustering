I\u2019m a Millennial, and the socialist policies of Barack Obama don\u2019t work and are responsible for the crisis we are in.\u201d\n\nKieffer, with a degree from the University of St. Thomas and a background in commercial real estate, is passionate about helping others emerge from Obama\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cI have a strong desire to be a successful entrepreneur myself and to foster an environment that helps all persons of all ages to have a shot at being an entrepreneur. Building your own company or helping jumpstart another\u2019s company \u2013 that\u2019s a real passion of mine,\u201d Kieffer told WND. \u201cSome of my friends have degrees and are working part-time jobs. I thought, why don\u2019t I use my passion for entrepreneurship and provide some solutions for dealing with the economic problems we are experiencing?\u201d\n\nDiscover Katie Kieffer\u2019s fresh insights for the next generation in \u201cLet Me Be Clear: Barack Obama\u2019s War on Millennials, and One Woman\u2019s Case for Hope.\u201d\n\nKieffer is also eager to help conservative leaders see that reaching the next generation requires some savvy. In particular, capturing future election wins depends in large part on distinguishing between liberal and conservative fiscal policies and how those policies impact individuals.\n\nFor example, she says, millennials need to understand that subsidized health care isn\u2019t really free.\n\n\u201cI personally opted out of Obamacare and am in a Christian non-profit,\u201d Kieffer told WND. \u201cThe more young people who opt out will make it that much harder for Obamacare to go into effect.\u201d\n\nKieffer has the data to prove that Obama\u2019s economic strangleholds on the American system pummel entire business models vital to the country\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cWhen I worked in commercial real estate, young people were concerned because if you\u2019re a broker you\u2019re paid a nice commission, but you can\u2019t make a great deal of money if you\u2019re in a socialist system,\u201d she explained. \u201cI have talked to talented salespeople and brokers who say they\u2019re going to have to leave this industry because they can\u2019t make it under Obama; there are too many regulations.\u201d\n\nKieffer claims insights into what Millennials actually want. She says 70 percent want to be entrepreneurs, but because of the stagnant economy, many can\u2019t live on their own.\n\n\u201cIn a healthy economy we would have 2.3 million more households than we have now,\u201d she said, alluding to those of her generation still languishing in their parents\u2019 homes. \u201cThey aren\u2019t moving out and creating their own career paths, and that\u2019s creating \u2018missing households.'\u201d\n\nKieffer\u2019s ideas are already resonating with her generation, as she says the feedback from her book is positive, and the opportunities to influence Millennial voters has never been stronger.\n\n\u201cMillennials have lost a historical level of trust in the presidency,\u201d she told WND. \u201cThey aren\u2019t planning on voting in the midterms, but they are set to vote for Hillary [Clinton] in 2016. This is because they don\u2019t exactly know why there are problems. My book is timely, because these Millennials need to know right now. They are open to truth. Facts speak for themselves, although the message is not coherent coming out of the GOP.\u201d\n\nFor those in political leadership thinking that the next generation is a lost cause, Kieffer and others like her are a breath of fresh air.\n\nFellow commentator Nick Adams, author of \u201cThe American Boomerang: How the World\u2019s Greatest \u2018Turnaround\u2019 Nation Will Do It Again,\u201d agrees with Kieffer\u2019s conclusions and offers his advice to Millennials who are emerging to take the reigns of government in the next few years: \u201cRemain economically massive and nimble. Capital and imagination must continue to combine more quickly in America than anywhere else in the world. Taxes must always be low, and government should be out of the way. Don\u2019t spend money you don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nGet \u201cThe American Boomerang: How the World\u2019s Greatest \u2018Turnaround\u2019 Nation Will Do It Again\u201d \u2013 autographed \u2013 from the WND Superstore!\n\nRead Jim Fletcher\u2019s review of Kieffer\u2019s \u201cLet Me Be Clear\u201d by clicking here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Katie Kieffer isn\u2019t willing to concede victory to Barack Obama\u2019s now-famous pledge to fundamentally transform America.
