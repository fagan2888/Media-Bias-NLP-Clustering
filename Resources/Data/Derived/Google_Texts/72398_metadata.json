More than 75 had signed up to testify.\n\n\u201cWe have issues in this state when it comes to health and welfare \u2013 we\u2019re trying to solve those issues,\u201d Senate Health and Welfare Chairman Lee Heider, R-Twin Falls, said after the two-hour hearing. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve them all at once; we\u2019ve got to set some priorities. Obviously Medicaid expansion is a priority.\u201d\n\nHe said lawmakers are watching to see what happens with Gov. Butch Otter\u2019s proposed Primary Care Access Program, which would provide limited primary and preventive care services to the 78,000 Idahoans who make too little to qualify for subsidized health insurance through the state insurance exchange, but also don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. Under the federal Affordable Care Act, states have the option of expanding Medicaid, largely at federal expense, to cover that population. Idaho hasn\u2019t done so, but 31 states including Washington have, as has the District of Columbia.\n\n\u201cPlease, please hear us,\u201d said Chelle Gluch, who spoke of watching her husband \u201cwrithe in pain\u201d and not being able to help him. \u201cThere are many of us, many of us, 78,000 who are screaming for your help.\u201d\n\nLauren Necochea of Idaho Voices for Children pointed out that under Idaho\u2019s current system, a low-income childless person might earn enough to qualify for subsidized health insurance through Idaho\u2019s state insurance exchange, but with the same income and a larger family, would fall below minimum levels for eligibility. \u201cWe have a situation in Idaho today where the childless low-wage worker gets assistance with medical insurance, and the parent with children doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nLori Lodge, a counselor who works with children with mental illness, said, \u201cOur kids go home every day in crisis. It\u2019s heartbreaking. We need to make some changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not deaf. We hear loud and clear what the people of Idaho are saying,\u201d Heider said, \u201cand we want to move forward with something this session.\u201d\n\nScott, Boyle were \u2018shields\u2019\n\nAt the close of the tense standoff between armed occupiers at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, and authorities late last week, two Idaho state lawmakers, Reps. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, and Judy Boyle, R-Midvale, were at the scene; the two were making their second visit to the area.\n\nBoyle told the Idaho Statesman, \u201cWe were there as shields.\u201d She said, \u201cWe figured the FBI wouldn\u2019t kill legislators as much as regular citizens like they did two weeks go,\u201d referring to the death of occupier LaVoy Finicum after a traffic stop.\n\nScott said, \u201cI\u2019m just glad there was no more bloodshed.\u201d She told KIVI-TV that states need to exercise more sovereignty against the federal government \u201cor we\u2019re going to see more incidents like this.\u201d\n\nBible bill introduced\n\nAt the request of Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll, R-Cottonwood, the Senate Education Committee has introduced legislation to \u201cexpressly permit\u201d the use of the Bible in public schools as a reference. That\u2019s already allowed, Nuxoll acknowledged, but she wanted to press the point. Her bill says:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is expressly permitted to be used in Idaho public schools for reference purposes to further the study of literature, comparative religion, English and foreign languages, United States and world history, comparative government, law, philosophy, ethics, astronomy, biology, world geography, archaeology, music, sociology, and other topics of study where an understanding of the Bible may be useful or relevant. No student will be required to use any religious texts for reference purposes if the student or parents of the student object.\u201d\n\nSen. Janie Ward-Engelking, D-Boise, questioned the need for the law, since teachers can already use the Bible as a reference. \u201cOnce we start spelling out religious texts, then we open up the door to needing to spell out many, many more,\u201d she said. Nuxoll responded, \u201cThat, I guess, could be a possibility. But the reason this one is singled out is because it is embedded in our culture, our law and our civilization.\u201d\n\nBetsy Z.
