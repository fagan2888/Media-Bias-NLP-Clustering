He noted that the 60 percent male and 57 percent under-30 demographic breakdown was good for the film.\n\nSony and its subsidiaries have released all three of Blomkamp\u2019s films.\n\n\u201cI certainly believe, like Neill\u2019s other movies, that it\u2019s going to have a really strong multiple and we\u2019re going to come out fine on the movie,\u201d Bruer said.\n\nThe R-rated Vince Vaughn comedy \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d fared even worse, opening at No. 10 to a dismal $4.8 million. The $35 million film about a chaotic European business trip also stars Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson.\n\nIn its second weekend in theaters, Will Smith\u2019s \u201cFocus\u201d fell an estimated 46 percent to take second place with $10 million, bringing its domestic total to $34.6 million.\n\n\u201cThese are not exactly world class numbers,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Rentrak\u2019s senior media analyst.\n\n\u201cThis is two weekends in a row where we\u2019ve seen original R-rated movies just not resonate with audiences with \u201cFocus\u201d last weekend and \u201cChappie\u201d this weekend,\u201d he said.\n\nOne bright spot was Fox Searchlight\u2019s retiree comedy \u201cThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\u201d which opened in third place with a strong $8.6 million from 1,573 locations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very rare instances of an indie sequel. You normally don\u2019t see that,\u201d said Dergarabedian. The PG-rated film, which reunites Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy, will be expanding to about 1,800 screens next weekend.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Chappie\u2019 tops slow weekend, \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019 tanks", "title": "\u2018Chappie\u2019 tops slow weekend, \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019 tanks", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Chappie\u2019 tops slow weekend, \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019 tanks", "title": "\u2018Chappie\u2019 tops slow weekend, \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019 tanks", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/chappie_tops_slow_weekend_unfinished_business_tanks/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/box-office.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Chappie\u2019 tops slow weekend, \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019 tanks", "title": "\u2018Chappie\u2019 tops slow weekend, \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019 tanks", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/box-office.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsey Bahr", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd230e\"", "article_summary": "The R-rated Vince Vaughn comedy \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d fared even worse, opening at No.\nThe $35 million film about a chaotic European business trip also stars Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson.\nIn its second weekend in theaters, Will Smith\u2019s \u201cFocus\u201d fell an estimated 46 percent to take second place with $10 million, bringing its domestic total to $34.6 million.\nDistributor Sony remains optimistic about its $49 million film about a police robot (voiced by Sharlto Copley) who learns how to think and feel.\n\u201cThis is two weekends in a row where we\u2019ve seen original R-rated movies just not resonate with audiences with \u201cFocus\u201d last weekend and \u201cChappie\u201d this weekend,\u201d he said."}
