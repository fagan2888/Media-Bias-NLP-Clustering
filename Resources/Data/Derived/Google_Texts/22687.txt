After being shut out of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois' broadest Obamacare plan, NorthShore University HealthSystem quickly forged a deal with national insurer Aetna.

Evanston-based NorthShore, one of the most affluent hospital networks in the Chicago area, estimated that it would lose 18,000 patients who were insured through Chicago-based Blue Cross' broad Blue PPO. Blue Cross dropped the popular plan, which included in its network essentially every hospital in the state. Instead, it's offering another plan, Blue Choice, which has far fewer facilities and none of NorthShore's four hospitals.

Now NorthShore is part of Aetna's Whole Health Chicago HMO plan. Patients, who are required to choose a primary care doctor, will be encouraged to choose one from NorthShore or Advocate Health Care, the largest hospital network in the state with 12 hospitals. NorthShore and Advocate have a pending merger agreement that awaits approval from federal and state regulators.

“There was an opportunity for Aetna to work closely with NorthShore,” Aetna spokesman Rohan Hutchings said in an interview. “This is just another example of how Aetna is working collaboratively with providers to deliver greater choice and more options.”

In a statement, NorthShore Senior Vice President Brian Washa said the plan with Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna provides a “high-quality and affordable network for patients while maintaining their continuity of care within the NorthShore system. NorthShore stands ready to help existing and new patients transition to a new health plan arrangement.”

A Blue Cross spokesman declined to comment.

Aetna and NorthShore's deal is the latest amid a frenzy as the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, debuts this week for its third year. Shoppers have been able to get a glimpse of the plans before they are for sale.

Narrow network health plans, which limit patient choice, are picking up steam with cost-conscious consumers. Experts say people are willing to have access to fewer doctors and hospitals in exchange for paying less.

The insurer eliminated its broadest health plan on the exchange in favor of another because it said the costs were unsustainable. Broad health plans, typically known as PPOs, include a variety of doctors and hospitals, such as academic medical centers and large health systems with expensive specialists.

Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood and University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System on the Near West Side are the only academic medical centers in the Blue Choice plan.

NorthShore is in another Blue Cross plan, the Blue Precision HMO, which is a narrow network plan with other hospitals around the state.

Aetna's Whole Health Chicago plan is available on and off HealthCare.gov for individuals in Cook, Lake, DuPage, Kane and McHenry counties.

For small businesses, the plan is available off the exchange in those counties, as well as in Will, Kankakee and Kendall counties. For business, the network also includes doctors and facilities in Rush Health, a four-hospital network anchored by Rush University Medical Center on the Near West Side.

On the exchange this year, Blue Cross and Aetna are among 10 companies, some of which are affiliated, selling plans in Illinois.
