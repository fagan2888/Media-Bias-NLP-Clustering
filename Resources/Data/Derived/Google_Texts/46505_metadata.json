And, we\u2019re not stopping there.\n\n4 More Wins for Consumers:\n\nAs recently highlighted in the New York Times, AARP South Carolina volunteers raised their voices in opposition to Duke Energy\u2019s request for a rate increase that would have increased yearly bills by an average of $213. They attended public hearings \u2013 often shaking mason jars full of coins to represent their hard-earned savings \u2013 sent emails and rallied support. Under a recently announced settlement, Duke\u2019s rate request was not fully granted, and customers will see their rates rise 10 percent as opposed to 16 percent. Good news in New York \u2013 Verizon has decided to rebuild landlines damaged from Superstorm Sandy with fiber optics instead of offering only the wireless option, Voice Link. AARP New York advocated for the continuation of traditional, landline phone service because it is a lifeline for many, especially seniors who count on it for Life Alert, medical monitoring devices, home security systems and emergency services. After hearing from thousands of AARP members, the Arizona Corporation Commission decided not to move forward with the deregulation of electric services in the state. AARP Arizona fought hard against deregulation efforts because they would have likely led to increased costs for consumers \u2013 as evidenced in other states. In California, Assembly Bill (AB) 327 passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the governor\u2019s desk for his signature. The bill will give the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) the ability to implement fair and reasonable reforms of the state\u2019s electric rate structure. According to Katie Hirning, AARP California state director, \u201cAB 327, while allowing the CPUC to update California\u2019s electric rate structure, implements strong consumer protections.\u201d AARP now urges the governor to sign AB 327 into law.\n\nAnd, we\u2019re still fighting:\n\nWhile a win in New York, Voice Link is still in Verizon\u2019s plans for New Jersey. AARP has filed a formal request with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to investigate Verizon\u2019s plan to offer its new wireless Voice Link service instead of traditional landline service.\n\nAARP New Jersey is also speaking up against a request from PSE&G that would raise rates by $3.9 billion for New Jersey customers. With hearings throughout September and November, state residents are telling the Board of Public Utilites how this rate increase will hurt their families.\n\nIn Alabama, AARP has submitted an application asking the Public Service Commission(PSC) to reconsider their August decision on Alabama Power\u2019s profit structure. The decision will not lower rates for Alabamians who already pay some of the highest bills in the South. With the voices of thousands Alabamians ignored by the PSC, AARP is calling upon them to put people before profits.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @RoamTheDomes for more news on utilities across the country.
