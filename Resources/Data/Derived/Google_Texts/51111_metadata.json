They said she went to the restroom to further conceal the sunglasses, and then left the store without purchasing them.\n\nThe other woman dressed in a multi-colored shirt distracted and blocked the viewpoint of the store clerk, deputies said.\n\nStore owner Michael Sharpe said the two women planned to steal the eyeglasses.\n\n\"She was professional,\" Sharpe said. \"She knew what she was doing. It wasn't the first time she had done it, clearly.\"\n\nSharpe said he was surprised because both women seemed pleasant and introduced themselves.\n\n\"We're a small business, and like other small businesses we have bills to pay and employees to pay,\" Sharpe said.\n\nNews4Jax crime analyst Gil Smith said crimes like this typically increase this time of year, and business owners should post signs saying they have surveillance cameras.\n\nSharpe is hoping the women will be caught.\n\n\"I will track her down. I will find her,\" he said. \"I don't care if I have to spend 10 times as much as those glasses cost me.\"\n\nIf you may know the identities of the women, call Nassau County Sheriff's Office Detective Rhoden at 904-548-4025 or Crime Stoppers at 866-845-TIPS (8477). Callers can remain anonymous and could be eligible for a cash reward.\n\n\n\nSharpe said he's also offering $200 worth of merchandise at his store to anyone who has information leading to an arrest.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.
