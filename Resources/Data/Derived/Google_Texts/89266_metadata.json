Fred D. Robinson, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - On day five after the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown at the hands of police, I was on the phone with a white Christian and fellow preacher concerning the racial cauldron that has become Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nDuring our conversation, he spent more time decrying rioting and calling for calm and prayer than lamenting the modern-day lynching by law enforcement of innocent black bodies that are piling up across the nation.\n\nBut most frustrating was his solution to the racial powder keg that has produced the Fergusons across the nation: a call for more racially diverse churches.\n\nI get tired of that one. His unrelenting insistence reminded me \u2014 in the most stark terms \u2014 of James Baldwin\u2019s prophetic quip: \u201cRacial progress in America is measured by how fast I become white.\u201d\n\nSimply having diverse congregations without addressing the weightier matters of social justice and structural racism is not better church practice. It is possibly subterfuge.\n\nDuring Princeton Theological Seminary\u2019s 2014 Black Theology and Leadership Institute, of which I was a fellow, Dr. John Kinney, a professor of theology at Virginia Union, offered this stinging indictment:\n\n\u201cWhen white supremacy adopts diversity, it seeks to either cleanse you, contain you, co-opt you or convert you.\u201d\n\nIf one is not careful, that is exactly what will be achieved in today\u2019s climate of multiracial churches.\n\nIn their book, \u201cBlacks and White in Christian America,\u201d Jason E. Shelton and Michael O. Emerson point out that there have been two waves of reconciliation movements in America aimed at integrating the church.\n\nThe first wave, which occurred during the 1960s, was rejected by the white church because \u201cit was too structural in orientation.\u201d In other words, it challenged structures in America that kept racism in place.\n\nThe second wave, of more recent vintage, has been rejected mostly by black theologians and preachers (certainly not by all) because it is perceived as \u201ctoo individualist and cultural in orientation.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it occurs in a context that places no attention on structural racism.\n\nIt is a can\u2019t-we-all-just-get-along-model that sweeps the issues of structural injustice under the rug.\n\nSuch a model allows us to feel good about our diverse congregations while nothing meaningful is being done to make significant changes in society.\n\nIt ignores the fact that we have to do more than call sinners to repentance, we have to call societies, systems and structures to repentance as well.\n\nIndeed, simply baptizing an institution in diversity\u2014whether they are churches, the police force or corporate America \u2014 without transforming the injustice on which the institution is built, doesn\u2019t make it holy.\n\nNo \u2014 it just makes it integrated injustice. John Wesley was right about one thing when he penned this line: \u201cThe Bible knows no holiness except social holiness.\u201d\n\nTo end situations that are happening in Ferguson will require more than a re-coloring of the pews.\n\nCould it be that through persistent poverty and societal brokenness God is screaming at the church? Challenging us? Waiting on us?\n\nOvercoming unjust systems through personal success and hard work (which has become the cornerstone of much of white, evangelical theology) is not God\u2019s main desire: transforming structural evil is.\n\nTo my friend\u2019s call for prayer, I say \u201cyes, pray we must!\u201d But I also reminded him of the words of William Sloan Coffin: \u201cIt is not enough to resist with confession; we must confess with resistance.\u201d\n\nAnd a good place for that resistance to start is with a deconstruction of our theology, a theology that has been shaped more by the economic interests of America than by Christ.\n\nOtherwise\u2014should greater church integration ever come\u2014it will sadly be into a burning house.\n\nThe Rev.
