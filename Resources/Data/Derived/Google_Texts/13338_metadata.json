But financial woes definitely exacerbate stress significantly as well, and \u2014 particularly for women \u2014 they can increase a person\u2019s risk of a heart attack.\n\nAccording to a new study presented at the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research 2015 Scientific Sessions, a history of financial problems was linked to two times higher risk for heart attacks. Middle-aged and older women making less than $50,000 per year were more likely to have heart attacks.\n\nThe researchers based their results on 26,763 women with an average age of 56 who had participated in the national Women\u2019s Health Study. The participants were asked questions about traumatic or negative life events \u2014 like losing a job, legal problems, long stretches of unemployment, marital issues, financial woes, death of a loved one, and serious injuries or illnesses. These women were tracked for nine years.\n\n\u201cMuch of the prior research related to negative life events was done in persons who have a history of heart attacks and in men,\u201d Dr. Michelle Albert, senior study author and director of the Center for the Study of Adversity and Cardiovascular Disease (NURTURE Center) at the University of California Medical Center, San Francisco, said in the press release. \u201cIt is important to assess these relationships in middle-aged and older women as this age group is more susceptible to heart disease as they age and are likely to live longer with disability.\u201d\n\nIndeed, lower income has been associated with poor health in the past. In a CDC report released in 2012, researchers found that educated people, who were more likely to have a higher income, were in general healthier than low-income people.\n\n\u201cHighly educated persons are more likely to be employed and well-paid than the less educated,\u201d the CDC authors wrote. \u201cThey have a higher sense of control over their health and lives and more social support. In addition, the well-educated are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors and avoid unhealthy ones.\u201d\n\nBut education doesn\u2019t tell the whole story; even highly educated women can lose a job or find themselves in financial trouble.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether women are more physiologically vulnerable as some prior research suggests that decreases in blood flow to the heart caused by acute mentally induced stress is more common in women and individuals with less social support,\u201d Albert continued in the press release. \u201cAt the biological level, we know that adverse experiences including psychological ones can lead to increased inflammation and cortisol levels. However, the interplay between gender, heart disease, and psychological factors is poorly understood.\u201d\n\nHarvard Health Publications suggests that while stress and emotional issues (depression, anxiety, hostility, social isolation) can have a negative impact on your heart, there are ways to cope. Getting enough sleep, exercising, relaxing, managing your time, and nurturing yourself can all help mitigate your level of stress and thus protect your heart.\n\nSource: Albert M, et al.
