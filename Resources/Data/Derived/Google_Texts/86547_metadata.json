Millions more were newly covered through Medicaid.\n\nHeading into the new season, there are a number of questions and concerns people are asking about costs, coverage and penalties.\n\nWe\u2019re going to spend the next couple nights looking at those.\n\nMary Agnes Carey of Kaiser Health News is back with us again.\n\nMary Agnes, welcome again to the program.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health News: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, let\u2019s start out by talking about what the administration\u2019s challenge is here. How many people out there are eligible, but have not yet signed up for Obamacare?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: The administration says there are about 10.5 million people that are eligible to enroll in the exchanges, and they\u2019re hoping to enroll about one in four of those.\n\nThis is going to be a tough group to go after. Maybe they\u2019re confused about the health care law. They may not understand how it works or that they need to have coverage, and so they need to have a very aggressive outreach for this enrollment period.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let\u2019s look at one of those people who present, I guess you could say, a challenge. And that is, this is a woman \u2014 her name is Angela Denig. She lives near Miami in Margate, Florida. She decided not to sign up for coverage last year.\n\nShe said she was willing to pay the penalty. She\u2019d rather do that. She ended up having a health scare, and she\u2019s trying to decide what to do now. Let\u2019s listen.\n\nANGELA DENIG, Florida Resident: When the open enrollment was in 2013, I went online to explore my options, and when I plugged in my specific factors and my situation, I didn\u2019t qualify for the \u2014 for any subsidy.\n\nSo what it offered me was coverage through independent agencies, and the premiums were significantly expensive, something that wasn\u2019t in my budget. So, at that point, I had to decide that I couldn\u2019t afford medical insurance. Full-time employment, I pay my taxes, I pay my bills, I live by the letter of the law, and the letter of the law said that year that, even though I couldn\u2019t afford medical coverage, I was required to pay this penalty, and I did. And it hurt.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mary Agnes, what does the administration do to appeal, to win over people like this, who \u2014 it\u2019s not just a matter of persuading them. It sounds like she genuinely has an issue with the cost.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Right.\n\nWhat they\u2019re asking people to do is to come back to the marketplace this year, to look again to, to shop again. The hope is that, in some markets, perhaps in her market, that there are more choices that will be affordable to her. And they also are emphasizing the penalty. We have got to remember, for example, the first year, it was $95 or 1 percent of your income, whichever is greater.\n\nThat whichever is greater part really surprised people. For 2016, that goes to $695 or 2.5 percent of income. So, while the administration is emphasizing they want people to shop on the exchange, they also want to make it clear that you must have coverage, unless you meet a hardship exemption and other exception, and there is a penalty if you don\u2019t sign up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And people \u2014 and this \u2014 and people have to really focus on this. They have got to go online to get that information.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Exactly.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, let\u2019s look at another situation. This is a man named Glenn Alder who lives in Redwood City, California. Now, he ended up buying private insurance. He decided for him that was the smarter thing to do, rather than the federal coverage. But he has found the cost of premium, co-pays, deductibles are also rising.\n\nLet\u2019s listen to him.\n\nGLENN ALDER, California Resident: Before Obamacare, my insurance had a fairly low deductible, had reasonable co-pay amounts, and the premiums were at about the same level that they are now. At that point in time, we had a family deductible of exactly $3,500. And once we fulfilled that deductible, there were no additional payments required from the policy.\n\nNowadays, the deductibles are in the order of $10,000 for a family. Every year, I see the rates increasing in terms of premiums, the deductibles going up, and the co-payments are going up. And out of pocket, it is costing more and more for a family, much, much \u2014 at a much more rapid rate than the rate of inflation.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mary Agnes, what does the administration say to someone in his situation?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: They understand the frustration about affordability. And they also are trying to make it clear, as he makes it so clear, that it\u2019s not just about your premium. It\u2019s your deductible, it\u2019s your co-payment, it\u2019s this combined package of expenses that everyone faces.\n\nChances are his health plan \u2014 he lives in California \u2014 they all had to sort of rise to the level of the plans that \u2014 the Affordable Care Act had certain coverages they wanted covered, so that\u2019s probably why his plan is more expensive. But consumers have to look at the total package.\n\nAnd this is where the frustration comes in, because that out-of-pocket expense, your deductibles, your co-insurance, your co-pays, are all in addition to those premiums.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And this is, of course, the case with people who bought into Obamacare, people in the silver plan, for example. They\u2019re having to look at rising costs as well.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Exactly.\n\nThe silver plan is \u2014 the second lowest-cost silver plan is what they call the benchmark plan. That\u2019s what all the subsidies are tied to. You are seeing some increases, Oklahoma, for example, an average increase of 36 percent.\n\nIn Indiana, there is a decrease of 13 percent. But the thing that\u2019s important to understand is that, even within a state, even within a region, prices can vary. So, that\u2019s why it\u2019s important, even if you like your current plan, you should get on healthcare.gov or go to a local in-person assister or a broker, an insurance agent, and look at what your options are to see if you can make a change that\u2019s more affordable for you if you need to do that.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So how much tweaking is the administration able to do and stay within the law as it was passed?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: In the sense of \u2014 what do you mean tweaking?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Tweaking in terms of making adjustments for people like this. As they go along, they\u2019re finding there are some challenges that they didn\u2019t recognize originally.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Sure.\n\nI mean, they can do a variety of things. They\u2019re trying to increase the number of competitors in the marketplace. That can certainly help with consumers. They\u2019re trying to make the Web site faster and easier, so when people go on the site, some of the frustrations, some of the screen crashes and so on, won\u2019t be there now.\n\nThey\u2019re trying to make it as clear as possible for people to type in their information and see their benefits and see their potential coverages right there. What does this premium cost? What\u2019s my out-of-pocket cost? What\u2019s the total package? You can rank them from cheapest to most expensive, to simply make it easier for you to find out what\u2019s out there.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: How confident is the administration that they\u2019re going to be able to get many more people the sign up? When you talk to them, what is their expectation? What do they say?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: They\u2019re expecting, of that 10.5 million, that they can get one in four. They know, for some people, simply may not be aware of it, they don\u2019t want to enroll in it, they won\u2019t do that. Some people may make the same calculation as Angela did, that it\u2019s too expensive for her.\n\nBut they\u2019re trying to go to those people, who so far have said no, they do an aggressive outreach to try to at least make them aware of what\u2019s out there and what their options are.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Mary Agnes Carey, we are going to continue this investigation tomorrow night with some more questions as we move into and approach the third enrollment period for Obamacare.\n\nThank you.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The season of open enrollment is upon us: On Sunday Americans can shop for health care plans on the insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act.
