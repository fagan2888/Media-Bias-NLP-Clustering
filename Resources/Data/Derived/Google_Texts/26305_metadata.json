Mike Michaud as governor and dozens of other candidates to the Maine Legislature, the group announced Thursday. That investment dwarfs the $48,000 that the group spent in the last five elections combined.\n\nThe announcement underscores the importance of securing a strong turnout by women in the November election \u2013 especially for Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler. Both have been highlighting their stances on abortion and other issues important to women in the three-way battle with incumbent Republican Paul LePage.\n\nIn 2010, women represented 53.4 percent of registered voters in Maine but accounted for 60 percent of the electorate, according to the Maine Women\u2019s Policy Center.\n\nPAC Chairwoman Nicole Clegg said in a written statement that stakes for women are high this year, especially in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows closely held corporations to opt out of paying for birth control under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe court also ruled that some forms of free-speech buffer zones around abortion clinics are unconstitutional.\n\nClegg criticized LePage, who opposes abortion but has been a strong advocate against domestic violence, for vetoing the bipartisan Women\u2019s Health Initiative, which would have given 13,000 low-income women access to preventive health care and birth control. He also vetoed legislation to expand Medicaid five times and reduced funding for family planning services, she said.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s health and rights are under attack around the nation. The stakes are high, and now is the time to make a stand,\u201d Clegg said.\n\n\u201cMike has worked with us over the years and is one of our most trusted allies,\u201d she said of Michaud. \u201cHe is a strong, thoughtful and experienced leader, and the partner that we need in the Blaine House.\u201d\n\nThe group also announced endorsements in nearly two dozen legislative races, nearly all of which went to Democrats. Senate minority leader Roger Katz was the only Republican to receive the group\u2019s endorsement. Katz is being challenged by Democrat Rebecca Cornell du Houx.\n\nMaine women care about jobs, welfare abuse, education and domestic violence, said Maine Republican Party Spokesman David Sorensen. \u201cOn all four, Governor LePage and Republicans have taken the lead and delivered real results, while liberal politicians fight to preserve the decades-old status quo in Maine government.\u201d\n\nSorensen also sought to raise doubts about Michaud\u2019s commitment to preserving a women\u2019s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.\n\nMichaud began his political career in the anti-abortion camp, but has since changed his position to support a women\u2019s right to choose. He has been endorsed by NARAL Prochoice America.\n\nSorensen pointed to a 2008 interview with Maine Public Broadcasting Network in which Michaud appears to evade a question about his stance on abortion. He also highlighted Michaud\u2019s vote to support an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have banned federally funded abortions.\n\n\u201cCongressman Michaud is a politician who simply cannot be trusted,\u201d he added. \u201cYou may disagree with Gov. LePage, but at least you know where he stands on the issues.\u201d\n\nRECORD INVESTMENT FOR GROUP\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s campaign will include field operations, as well as television and online ads.\n\n\u201cThe majority is going to be invested in the governor\u2019s race,\u201d Clegg said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s national PAC will make its own endorsements and investment in federal races, Clegg said, noting Planned Parenthood could spend as much as $24 million nationally this year.\n\nShe said Planned Parenthood has been ramping up campaign activities since the tea party\u2019s rise in 2010, when LePage won the Blaine House and Republicans took control of the Legislature.\n\nNationally, conservative Republicans have sought to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nClegg said more than 200 restrictions have been passed on abortion nationally since 2011.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden you started to see across the country governors defunding Planned Parenthood and (other) very targeted attacks to our organization,\u201d she said.\n\nFederal law prohibits nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding from contributing to political campaigns. However, the law allows nonprofit groups to form political action committees that are funded by donors.\n\nThe PAC is the political arm of the Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, a nonprofit group that in fiscal 2014 received $359,000 in federal funds and $38,000 in state funds for non-abortion reproductive health services, such as birth control and cancer screenings, Clegg said.\n\nThe PAC\u2019s investment in Maine will far out-pace previous election cycles.\n\nIn the past five elections, Planned Parenthood has spent nearly $48,000 to try and sway voters.\n\nIn 2010, the PAC raised and spent less than $6,000. In 2012, the PAC raised nearly $11,000 and spent nearly $8,600.\n\nSo far this year, the PAC had raised a little more than $235,161 as of July 25. The PAC had spent $63,000, most of which went to produce online ads in support of Michaud, leaving the group with nearly $174,000 on hand.\n\nThe PAC\u2019s major donor this year is S. Donald Sussman, a financier and philanthropist who has already contributed $150,000.\n\nSussman is the majority owner of the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel.\n\nSussman issued a written statement through a spokesperson about his donation.\n\n\u201cLike so many of us in Maine, I am very disheartened by the recent Supreme Court rulings, as well as the onslaught of legislative efforts across the country that will undermine a woman\u2019s freedom to make her own personal medical decisions \u2013 a freedom that each and every one of us should enjoy,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cWe need to elect lawmakers who won\u2019t tolerate this sort of interference in women\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe New York City-based Planned Parenthood Votes has contributed nearly $73,000 to the Maine PAC.\n\nAnother major contributor is Cumberland resident Margot Milliken. She donated $5,000 to the Planned Parenthood\u2019s Maine-based PAC and $50,000 to the Planned Parenthood Votes PAC.\n\nWHERE WOMEN STAND\n\nA poll conducted in June for the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram provides some insight into how women will vote.\n\nForty-eight percent of women surveyed said they planned to vote for Michaud, while 29 percent said they\u2019d support LePage. Cutler was preferred by 17 percent.\n\nOf the women surveyed, 31 percent said they voted for LePage in 2010 and 31 percent voted for Cutler. Only 14 percent voted for Democrat Elizabeth \u201cLibby\u201d Mitchell.\n\nAs did men, women surveyed said jobs and the economy were the most important problems facing Maine.\n\nIn May, about 50 prominent women, including former U.S. Attorney Paula Silsby, a Republican, and Terry Hayes, a former Democratic House leader, announced they were supporting Cutler for governor.\n\nIn July, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who the chairs of the Democratic National Committee, headlined a \u201cWomen Take Action 2014\u201d rally by Maine Democrats.\n\nOn Aug. 27, Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, will headline a \u201cWomen for Mike\u201d rally.\n\nState Rep. Heather Sirocki, R-Scarborough, co-chairs a Women for LePage coalition. In July, she hailed LePage\u2019s efforts to combat domestic violence and his clear stance on issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund says it will work to elect Democrat Mike Michaud as governor and dozens of other candidates to the Legislature.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund says it will work to elect Democrat Mike Michaud as governor and dozens of other candidates to the Legislature.", "title": "Planned Parenthood PAC pledges over $500K in Maine campaign spending - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 405, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/451987_271415-michaud_2-e1408070094470.jpg", "height": 272}, "updated_time": "2014-08-15T10:25:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/08/14/planned-parenthood-pac-pledges-over-500k-in-maine-campaign-spending/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund says it will work to elect Democrat Mike Michaud as governor and dozens of other candidates to the Legislature.", "title": "Planned Parenthood PAC pledges over $500K in Maine campaign spending - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/451987_271415-michaud_2-e1408070094470.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-08-14T13:36:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T10:25:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb253\"", "article_summary": "She donated $5,000 to the Planned Parenthood\u2019s Maine-based PAC and $50,000 to the Planned Parenthood Votes PAC.\nMaine women care about jobs, welfare abuse, education and domestic violence, said Maine Republican Party Spokesman David Sorensen.\nIn the past five elections, Planned Parenthood has spent nearly $48,000 to try and sway voters.\nOn Aug. 27, Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, will headline a \u201cWomen for Mike\u201d rally.\nThe Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund will spend at least $500,000 to elect Democratic U.S. Rep.
