[Screenshot]\n\nConservative darling Dr. Ben Carson on Sunday defended comparing President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law to slavery by insisting that \u201canything is slavery that robs your of your ability to control your own life.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Values Voter Summit in Washington last year, Carson had lashed out at the Affordable Care Act for being \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about control.\u201d\n\nDuring a panel discussion on Sunday, NBC host David Gregory pointed out that people who were able to get health insurance because of the new law would most likely disagree with Carson.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, recognize what I said,\u201d Carson replied. \u201cWorst thing since slavery. I didn\u2019t say that it was slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you said \u2018it is\u2019 slavery \u2018in a way,'\u201d Gregory interrupted.\n\n\u201cRight, and I said, \u2018in a way,'\u201d Carson agreed. \u201cIn a way, anything is slavery that robs you of your ability to control your own life.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you take the most important thing that you have, which is your health care, and you put that in the hands of government bureaucrats, I think, you have done the wrong thing,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd as I was about to say, you go back and you look at the neo-Marxist literature, and look at what they say \u2014 don\u2019t have to listen to what I say \u2014 about taking control of health care of the populous, and making people dependant.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I believe in health care for everybody? Absolutely. But I think there are much better ways to get there, which leave the care in the hands of patients, and of doctors.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, broadcast May 18, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nbc_mtp_carson_slavery_140518g-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Ben Carson: \u2018Anything is slavery that robs you\u2019 like \u2018neo-Marxist\u2019 Obamacare"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0f1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWorst thing since slavery.\n\u201cRight, and I said, \u2018in a way,'\u201d Carson agreed.\nI didn\u2019t say that it was slavery.\u201d\u201cWell, you said \u2018it is\u2019 slavery \u2018in a way,'\u201d Gregory interrupted.\nBen Carson speaks to NBC on May 18, 2014.\n\u201cFirst of all, recognize what I said,\u201d Carson replied."}
