In early 2016, President Obama laid out the details of the Cancer Moonshot Task Force, to be led by Biden. The task force aims to \u201celiminate cancer as we know it\u201d and that is certainly a laudable goal.\n\nWhat most Americans didn\u2019t realize is that the Affordable Care Act had already laid the groundwork for an aggressive effort to significantly reduce cancer\u2019s devastating impact on Americans.\n\nExpanded coverage = more access to treatment\n\nRegardless of what treatments are developed, access to them typically depends on whether a patient has health insurance. Uninsured patients are much more likely to put off cancer screening, and their cancers tend to be detected at later \u2013 less curable \u2013 stages.\n\nThe ACA has sharply reduced the uninsured rate in the United States, and millions of Americans who were previously uninsured now have private health insurance or Medicaid \u2013 both of which cover cancer treatment. And the ACA has also greatly expanded access to preventive care. A wide range of preventive care \u2013 including cancer screening \u2013 is available at no charge on all non-grandfathered health plans as a result of the ACA.\n\nCovering prevention \u2013 as important as a cure?\n\nThis may end up being just as important \u2013 if not more important \u2013 than efforts to find a cure for cancer. Numerous public health experts from the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH) recently wrote to Vice President Biden, commending his efforts to fight cancer, but cautioning that while cures are important, prevention \u2013 through strategies that include tobacco cessation, cervical cancer screenings and vaccines \u2013 has thus far had the greatest impact in terms of reducing cancer mortality.\n\nClearly, a multi-pronged approach is necessary. Prevention and public health play a significant role, as does health care treatment that\u2019s accessible and affordable for all patients, regardless of income or medical history. On all of these fronts, the ACA has played a significant role, and will add to whatever success the Moonshot Task Force has.\n\nCoverage prospects were grim before ACA\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, patients with cancer \u2013 or even a history of cancer \u2013 were ineligible for individual market health insurance in all but five states. If they were already insured when the cancer was diagnosed, they were stuck with their health plan for at least the next several years, without the possibility of being able to shop around for better coverage or a better price.\n\nIf they were uninsured, their options were generally limited to the high-risk pool in their state \u2013 or nothing at all, if the state didn\u2019t have an active high-risk pool. If they worked for a small company, their entire group\u2019s rates could be increased as a result of the cost of cancer treatment. Some states had regulations to limit this, but there was no federal policy.\n\nThe ACA fixed all of that. Individual health insurance is guaranteed issue in every state, and small-group plans can no longer use a group\u2019s medical history to set premiums. Consumers who buy their own health insurance can shop from among all the plans on the market each year during open enrollment, regardless of medical history or ongoing medical treatment.\n\nPremiums are no longer based on an enrollee\u2019s health status, and pre-existing conditions cannot be excluded from coverage. In 31 states and DC, Medicaid is now available to anyone with a household income up to 138 percent of the poverty level (about $33,500 for a family of four).\n\nIn short, a cancer diagnosis no longer means that a patient is locked out of the health insurance market.\n\nIncreased access to preventive care\n\nThe ACA has also greatly increased access to preventive care, including cancer screening. Breast cancer and colon cancer are two of the most common cancers in the United States. Thanks to the ACA, preventive mammograms and colonoscopies \u2013 along with pap tests that screen for cervical cancer \u2013 are now covered on all non-grandfathered plans, at no cost to the patient. (Prior to the ACA, coverage mandates for preventive care varied from state to state).\n\nThis is a tremendous improvement in terms of access to screening, as studies have shown that when patients are responsible for a portion of the cost of the screening tests, they\u2019re less likely to have them done.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that health plans are only required to provide free preventive care when the procedure is actually performed on a preventive basis. So if the screening is diagnostic (if there\u2019s a reason for performing the test, other than just the fact that it\u2019s time for the patient\u2019s wellness exam), the patient can still be responsible for all or part of the cost, depending on the plan design.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the American Journal of Managed Care, this is part of the reason that the ACA has had limited initial impact on colonoscopy and mammography prevalence.\n\nCancer treatment \u2013 access and affordability\n\nBut when patients are diagnosed with cancer, there is no doubt that they\u2019re better protected now than they were before the ACA. All new individual and small-group plans include coverage for essential health benefits \u2013 including prescriptions, inpatient care, outpatient care, and lab work. And there are no longer lifetime or annual maximums on how much the insurance company will pay for in-network essential health benefits. That means you won\u2019t find out after your diagnosis that your health plan only covers generic drugs, or has a $300,000 lifetime benefit maximum.\n\nOne huge benefit of the ACA is that it caps a patient\u2019s annual out-of-pocket expenses for in-network essential health benefits (at no more than $6,850 in 2016) \u2013 and many plans have lower out-of-pocket limits. Prior to 2014, there were no restrictions on how high a plan\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum could be \u2013 some plans had no cap at all.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant problem when we consider the skyrocketing cost of cancer treatment. Prior to 2000, the average cost for a year of cancer medication was less than $10,000. But by 2012, 12 of the 13 new cancer drugs on the market were at least $100,000 for a year of treatment, and some specialized cancer medications cost $150,000 for a year of treatment.\n\nAlmost invariably, health insurance plans place these high-priced drugs in specialty tiers, which generally means the patient pays a percentage of the cost, rather than a set copay. If a drug is $10,000 a month, a 30 percent copay means the patient pays $3,000 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nThe ACA capped patients\u2019 annual out-of-pocket spending, but the steep price of drugs and the coinsurance model \u2013 as opposed to copays \u2013 means that some cancer patients will find themselves meeting their total annual out-of-pocket maximum within the first couple months of the year. Several states have implemented regulations that limit a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket cost for a medication to $250/month or less, and other states have considered following suit.\n\nAs with any health condition, carriers have flexibility in determining which cancer drugs are included in their formulary (covered drug list). So when a cancer patient needs to select a new health plan, the formulary is an essential tool. But R.J. Ours, Colorado Government Relations Director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), noted there\u2019s still a transparency issue in terms of patients being able to determine what their actual out-of-pocket cost for a medication will be, since most cancer drugs are covered with coinsurance rather than a copay, and the plan\u2019s price for the drug (and thus the patient\u2019s portion) generally isn\u2019t readily apparent until the patient goes to the pharmacy to fill the prescription.\n\nThere are also concerns that some of the requirements imposed by health plans for prescription coverage \u2013 including step therapy, prior authorization, and quantity limits may be overly onerous to patients. ACS CAN has recommended a variety of improvements that could be made in terms of cost transparency, formulary accuracy, prescription affordability, and access to all medically-necessary drugs for cancer patients.\n\nOurs explained that \u201cthe devil\u2019s in the details, and now we\u2019re down to the details. But the ACA has cut a broad swath in terms of providing access to care, checkups, and cancer screenings. And many cancer patients have been able to get health insurance for the first time ever\u201d as a result of the ACA\u2019s ban on medical underwriting.\n\nNetwork adequacy challenges\n\nAs of 2014, only four out of 19 top cancer centers were included on all the networks for plans sold in their state exchanges. And networks have become narrower \u2013 with fewer PPO options and limited out-of-network coverage \u2013 in the ensuing two years. Network management is one of the few remaining avenues that carriers have for curtailing costs, and health insurers have found that consumers tend to prefer lower premiums over broad networks. But when a patient is diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer, a limited network can suddenly seem much more daunting.\n\nWhile narrower networks are much more common now than they were prior to the ACA, there are various regulatory and legislative efforts underway to ensure that patients still have access to the care they need.\n\nPlans sold through the federally facilitated marketplace are required to have a network that includes enough providers \u2013 including specialists \u2013 \u201cto assure that all services will be accessible to enrollees without unreasonable delay.\u201d In a February 2015 letter to insurers offering plans in the federally-facilitated marketplace, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also noted that all plans would have to maintain an accurate provider directory, updated at least monthly and easily accessible online.\n\nIn December 2015, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) approved their Network Access and Adequacy Model Act, which was created in part with input from ACS CAN, and will be considered by CMS when setting network adequacy standards for future years.\n\nThe model act includes a wide range of recommendations to protect patients, including specific criteria that could be used to determine whether a plan has an adequate network, and provisions to allow patients to see out-of-network providers (with network-level benefits) if seeing an in-network provider would result in \u201cunreasonable travel or delay.\u201d\n\nIt also encourages state regulators to carefully review filings for tiered network plans (eg, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s new plans in New Jersey) to ensure that they aren\u2019t discriminatory towards people with chronic or complex illnesses. The model act also sets standards for ensuring continuity of care for patients with ongoing treatment whose provider leaves (or is removed from) the plan\u2019s network.\n\nThe NAIC model act also includes consumer protections relating to in-network facilities contracting with providers who aren\u2019t in the same networks, calling for full disclosure to patients in advance of treatment. Legislation was also introduced in the US House of Representatives in October 2015 in an effort to protect patients in this situation.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has detailed how the ACA has been a huge step forward for cancer patients. There is still room for improvement in terms of making cancer treatment affordable and accessible for all patients, and steps are being taken to make those improvements on both a state and federal level.\n\nBut the reforms that have already been implemented under the ACA have made coverage and care much more available than they used to be.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long before the Obama administration's pledge to eliminate cancer, Obamacare began targeting obstacles to cancer coverage and treatment.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Long before the Obama administration's pledge to eliminate cancer, Obamacare began targeting obstacles to cancer coverage and treatment.", "title": "Moonshot only the latest of Obama cancer missions", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2016/03/23/moonshot-only-the-latest-of-obama-cancer-missions/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2016/03/obamacare-cancer-coverage-1560x816.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "cancer, preventive", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-23T10:30:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The American Cancer Society has detailed how the ACA has been a huge step forward for cancer patients.\nIn early 2016, President Obama laid out the details of the Cancer Moonshot Task Force, to be led by Biden.\nCancer treatment \u2013 access and affordabilityBut when patients are diagnosed with cancer, there is no doubt that they\u2019re better protected now than they were before the ACA.\nIf they worked for a small company, their entire group\u2019s rates could be increased as a result of the cost of cancer treatment.\nIn short, a cancer diagnosis no longer means that a patient is locked out of the health insurance market."}
