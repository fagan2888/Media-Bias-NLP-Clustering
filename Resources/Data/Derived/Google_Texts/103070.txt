Hendersonville High senior Chris Kacprowski been selected to play in the Toyota East vs. West Tennessee All-Star Classic, which will be held at Cookeville’s Tennessee Tech University on Friday, Dec. 12.

“It’s a big honor,” Kacprowski said. “I’m really glad I can be a part of something like that.

“I was really surprised. Joe Townsend (who is currently a senior center at Vanderbilt University) was the last one who came from Hendersonville (to play in the all-star game). I didn’t think I was going to get that game. I found out Nov. 10. I was really surprised.”

Kacprowski – a 6-foot-2, 270-pound offensive tackle and defensive tackle for the Commandos – was selected as an offensive guard.

He helped Hendersonville’s run-oriented offense average better than 44 points per game this fall.

Kacprowski was selected as the District 9-AAA most valuable defensive lineman. Through the regular season, he had 23 tackles (20 solo tackles and 10 of which resulted in a loss of yardage), three quarterback sacks, eight hurries and one fumble recovery.

“There’s times I prefer offense, and there’s times I prefer defense,” Kacprowski – a two-year starter on both sides of the ball – said. “Most of the time, I prefer offense a little more. The offensive-line bond is a good thing to be a part of. I like that.”

Hendersonville finished 10-2 this season, winning the District 9-AAA regular-season championship before suffering a 24-7 loss to Centennial in the second round of the 6A playoffs.

The Commandos reached the 6A state championship game last season.

“I played to my capabilities,” Kacprowski said. “I just wish we could have extended the season a little longer.”

Kacprowski was selected to the West squad, which will be coached by Whitehaven head coach Rodney Saulsberry.

The East squad will be coached by Siegel head coach Greg Wyant.

The all-stars were nominated by their high-school coaches and then selected by the coaching staffs for the game.

Kacprowski is hoping to receive additional recruiting interest as a result of playing in the game. To this point, the majority of his attention has come from East Tennessee State University.

“I would like to play college football,” Kacprowski said. “I’ve thought about that (participation in the game helping his recruiting interest). I’m glad I can have the opportunity.

“Because of my size, I’m not looked at that much. This game will be a boost in recruiting.”

Players will report to Carson-Newman on Tuesday, Dec. 9 and will practice through Thursday.

Kickoff for the game is slated for 7 p.m.

The West squad won last year’s contest by a 55-39 score, with the two teams setting an all-star-game record of 94 points.

The West team leads the all-time series 4-3.
