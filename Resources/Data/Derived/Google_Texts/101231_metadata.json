That painting hangs about 400 yards from where he works as the director of the National Museum of the American Indian.\n\n\u201cThink about how powerful that notion is, that Columbus discovered America. There was nothing here, there was nobody here until Columbus arrived,\u201d he tells the crowd.\n\nGover goes on to discuss the First Thanksgiving myth and how Squanto learned English. The real Thanksgiving story continues about 50 years after that First Thanksgiving. \u201cAbout 50 years later, there were new generations of Pilgrims, new generations of Wampanoags, and the Wampanoags had sold so much of their land to the Pilgrims that they had fallen into poverty themselves. And they lashed out, and there was a great conflagration known as King Philip\u2019s War,\u201d he says. \u201cKing Philip\u2019s War was perhaps the most devastating war in the entire history of North America in terms of the percentage of people who were killed in this conflict. The tribes of New England were virtually wiped out. Those that weren\u2019t wiped out were confined and no longer the powers they had once been.\u201d\n\nWhen the Pilgrims captured Philip they put his head on a pike and left it there for 20 years. \u201cAnd most of us don\u2019t know that story,\u201d he points out.\n\n\u201cOur origin myths in America mostly include Indians,\u201d he says mentioning Squanto, Pocahontas, and Sacajawea. \u201cAll of these were very important figures in American history, and yet in each case they\u2019ve been rendered imaginaries\u2026 they are imaginary Indians.\u201d\n\nGover also discusses General Custer, Andrew Jackson, and the Trail of Tears.\n\nSee his full talk below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kevin Gover, director of the National Museum of the American Indian, recently gave a TEDx Talk about history myths including Columbus and Thanksgiving", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/19/kevin-gover-talks-history-myths-tedx-columbus-thanksgiving-and-imaginary-indians-162674", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tedx-talk-kevin-gover-thanksgiving.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Kevin Gover Talks History Myths at TEDx: Columbus, Thanksgiving, and Imaginary Indians"}, "abstract": "Kevin Gover, director of the National Museum of the American Indian, recently gave a TEDx Talk about history myths including Columbus and Thanksgiving", "dc": {"title": "Kevin Gover Talks History Myths at TEDx: Columbus, Thanksgiving, and Imaginary Indians"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/19/kevin-gover-talks-history-myths-tedx-columbus-thanksgiving-and-imaginary-indians-162674", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Kevin Gover, National Museum of the American Indian, First Thanksgiving, Wampanoag, Trail of Tears, Andrew Jackson, Christopher Columbus, Sacajawea, Pocahontas, King Philip\u2019s War", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-12-19T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Kevin Gover Talks History Myths at TEDx: Columbus, Thanksgiving, and Imaginary Indians"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18d8\"", "article_summary": "Kevin Gover, Pawnee, began his TEDx Talk with the Christopher Columbus song \u201cIn 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re in elementary school, you don\u2019t question what you\u2019re learning, you assume the teacher knows everything,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo I know that Columbus discovered America in 1492.\u201dThe Columbus myth is one of our \u201corigin stories\u201d he says, pointing out that a large painting of the discovery hangs in our nation\u2019s capital.\nGover goes on to discuss the First Thanksgiving myth and how Squanto learned English.\n\u201cThink about how powerful that notion is, that Columbus discovered America.\n\u201cOur origin myths in America mostly include Indians,\u201d he says mentioning Squanto, Pocahontas, and Sacajawea."}
