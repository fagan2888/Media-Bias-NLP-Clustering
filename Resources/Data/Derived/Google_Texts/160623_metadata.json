She shared a tiny studio apartment with her father, brother and a cousin after arriving from El Salvador more than 20 years ago.\n\nBut after she married and wanted a home of her own, she had to drive 23 miles west, past tracts of empty land and vacant mansions whose owners visit only a couple of weeks a year, to the mobile home park where she now lives.\n\nThe drive eventually wore her down, and she decided to take lower-paying work closer to home. \u201cThat commute \u2014 it becomes 10 hours a week. It\u2019s like working an extra day,\u201d said Garcia, 49. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to live here.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe divide between the haves and have-nots in Aspen reflects a division that cuts across the country: The richest are getting richer while the rest of the population is essentially treading water. From 2009 to 2012, inflation-adjusted income for the wealthiest 1 percent of U.S. households surged 31 percent, according to economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley. For everyone else, income inched up just 0.4 percent.\n\nIn Aspen, that division is magnified because the gap is geographic as well as financial. The people who clean the vacation homes, maintain the mansions\u2019 gardens and work in the hotels must find housing in mobile home parks or subdivisions squeezed into the few acres of developable space dozens of miles to the west. A lucky few \u2014 about half of Aspen\u2019s year-round population of 6,700 \u2014 are able to score units in the town\u2019s unusual affordable housing program that, on the open market, would sell for millions each.\n\nMeanwhile, residents who struggle to find affordable real estate watch an increasing number of houses in town become rarely inhabited vacation properties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror image of Detroit, where wealth, not poverty, is driving population down,\u201d said Mick Ireland, a former three-term Aspen mayor.\n\nAspen\u2019s dilemma is similar to that of other resort towns, from Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Park City, Utah, especially those nestled in the jagged terrain of the western United States. In the West, vast tracts of public land and sheer mountain faces prevent the easy development of suburbs to house workers, pushing clusters of more affordable housing many miles away. The jobs in these communities are largely in the lower-paying service industry, yet the resort towns are a destination for the global upper class, said Bill Hettinger, author of \u201cLiving and Working in Paradise,\u201d a book on resort towns.\n\nAspen\u2019s median family income of $71,000 is higher than the state average. But the further \u201cdown-valley,\u201d or to the west, you drive, the more incomes drop until you hit Glenwood Springs, 51 miles west, where the median family income of $54,000 is below average and carpenters, plumbers and other laborers regularly spend hours commuting to Aspen.\n\nThe situation would be worse had Aspen not gone to extraordinary lengths to try to avoid being hollowed out by the departure of middle-class and working-class residents. Financed by a 1.5 percent charge on real estate sales and a mandate that any new projects include affordable housing, the city and county run a 40-year-old program that allows people who have worked for one year or longer in Aspen to rent, or buy, cheap residences.\n\nDoctors and lawyers, as priced out of most homes here as carpenters and bartenders, take advantage of the program. Everyone in town praises the program for maintaining a critical mass of year-round families that give Aspen a more lived-in feel than many of its competitors.\n\nBut many in town grumble about inequality. The mordant joke is that the billionaires are pushing out the millionaires. Cheaper eateries frequented by locals are relentlessly replaced by upscale restaurants and high-end shops, and even the Aspen realtor\u2019s association office was pushed out of town because it couldn\u2019t afford to pay the skyrocketing rents in a town where the average property sale is $5 million.\n\nAdam Frisch, 47, an Aspen city councilman, father of two and former banker, said he doesn\u2019t feel the town has changed, just the severity of income inequality nationally, which shows up here in a concentrated form.\n\nSome here say living amid rampant inequality is just the price one pays for residing in what locals sometimes call \u201cDisneyland for adults.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Milias, a former official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration who writes a blog critical of Aspen\u2019s political establishment, said she has grown tired of complaints. \u201cThere\u2019s that sense that, my God, their lives would have been so much better if they lived in Cleveland,\u201d she said. \u201cAspen can\u2019t exist without high-end tourists. They signed up for that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Jose Herrera moved to these mountains from Mexico. The 25-year-old construction worker can\u2019t afford the prices in town and lives dozens of miles away in a mobile home park. But he doesn\u2019t resent the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe company where I work builds houses for rich people, and because of that it pays well,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cOne way or another, we help each other out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It's a mirror image of Detroit, where wealth, not poverty, is driving population down,\" said Mick Ireland, a former three-term Aspen mayor.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\"It's a mirror image of Detroit, where wealth, not poverty, is driving population down,\" said Mick Ireland, a former three-term Aspen mayor.", "title": "In Resort Towns, Working Class Squeezed Out As Rich Move In", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/in-resort-towns-working-class-squeezed-out-as-rich-move-in/200671/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Downtown_Aspen_CO_with_view_to_ski_slopes.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It's a mirror image of Detroit, where wealth, not poverty, is driving population down,\" said Mick Ireland, a former three-term Aspen mayor.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Downtown_Aspen_CO_with_view_to_ski_slopes.jpg", "title": "In Resort Towns, Working Class Squeezed Out As Rich Move In", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "wealth gap", "published_time": "2015-01-12T09:12:57-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f2a\"", "article_summary": "The jobs in these communities are largely in the lower-paying service industry, yet the resort towns are a destination for the global upper class, said Bill Hettinger, author of \u201cLiving and Working in Paradise,\u201d a book on resort towns.\nA lucky few \u2014 about half of Aspen\u2019s year-round population of 6,700 \u2014 are able to score units in the town\u2019s unusual affordable housing program that, on the open market, would sell for millions each.\n\u201cThe company where I work builds houses for rich people, and because of that it pays well,\u201d Herrera said.\nThe 25-year-old construction worker can\u2019t afford the prices in town and lives dozens of miles away in a mobile home park.\nAspen\u2019s dilemma is similar to that of other resort towns, from Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Park City, Utah, especially those nestled in the jagged terrain of the western United States."}
