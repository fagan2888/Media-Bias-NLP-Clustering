A magnitude-4.5 earthquake jolted the Big Island of Hawaii early Saturday morning, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.

The quake struck at 2:18 a.m., geologists said in a news release. It was reportedly centered about 5 miles north of the small town of Naalehu at a depth of 6 miles.

Big Island volcanoes did not seem to be affected, according to geologists.

Shake: A magnitude-4.5 earthquake jolted the Big Island of Hawaii early Saturday morning, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said

The observatory said it 'received 70 felt reports within an hour of the earthquake.

'Light shaking (Intensity IV) has been reported across the island.

'At these shaking intensities, damage to buildings or structures is not expected.'

Small aftershocks under magnitude-2 were recorded in the hours after.

The observatory said that as of 3:30am, it recorded aftershocks with magnitudes 1.6, 1.5 and 1.4.

'The depth, location, and recorded seismic waves of today's earthquake suggest a source on the large fault plane between the old ocean floor and overlying volcanic crust, a common source for earthquakes in this area,' geologists explained in the news release.

They said the early Saturday morning quake is the sixth tremor 'with magnitudes greater than 4.0 and at depths of 5â€“13 km' to strike near Naalehu in a thirty-year period.

At Kilauea Caldera, an unrelated magnitude-3.1 earthquake took place approximately one minute ahead of the 4.5 tremor, geologists said.
