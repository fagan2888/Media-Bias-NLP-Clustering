Massachusetts\u2019 groundbreaking health reform, Republican nominee Mitt Romney said, would never work for the country as a whole.\n\nDemocrats widely dismissed Romney\u2019s comments as politically opportunistic, an effort to distance himself from the plan he backed as governor. Now, given the epic scale of problems that have bedeviled the rollout of President Obama\u2019s plan, some state legislators, insurance and hospital executives, and others around the country are returning to Romney\u2019s refrain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas the Massachusetts plan, in hindsight, really the best blueprint for the nation?\n\n\u201cThey should have allowed more flexibility on a state-by-state basis,\u201d said Massachusetts state Senator Richard Moore, a Democrat and key architect of the state\u2019s health reform law.\n\nWhile the Massachusetts model may work for some states, Moore said, imposing a uniform standard across the country was folly because it did not take into account the unique dynamics of local insurance markets, regional variation in health care delivery, and even the political and social culture of other states.\n\nObama and other Democrats in 2009 and 2010, when they were drafting their law, Moore added, would have been better served to use the Massachusetts model as a flexible framework for states to adopt over time, rather than a blueprint for a mandatory national plan.\n\n\u201cNot every state has the same set of circumstances that we inherited to our benefit,\u201d said Moore. He said the federal government could have set broad goals such as universal coverage, sliding scale subsidies, and minimum coverage standards that allow states to use a mix of federal and private dollars to expand. There should still be an individual mandate, he added, but only if coverage is affordable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew Dreyfus, chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and another supporter of the Massachusetts and national health care plans, said the question has popped up in meetings he has attended around the country, with increasing frequency.\n\n\u201cPeople keep peppering me with the question about Massachusetts wherever I go outside the state,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven what\u2019s going on in Washington, was the Massachusetts model a good one to use?\u201d\n\nDreyfus said he believes the answer is yes \u2014 the Massachusetts model is still a viable option for the country in the long term \u2014 but that \u201cit isn\u2019t right for every state now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways, we may see the Affordable Care Act evolve into a more state-based system,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cSome states may look very much like Massachusetts, and some may look a lot different or may take a lot longer period to get to where we got.\u201d\n\nThese are the sorts of assessments that were thrust to the forefront this week at an annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Washington, where the organization\u2019s health reform task force examined how states are responding to the mass public confusion caused by the law\u2019s botched rollout. \u201cIt\u2019s the most daunting challenge I\u2019ve faced in 20 years as an elected official,\u201d said Alabama state Representative Greg Wren, the task force\u2019s Republican cochairman. \u201cThe feds passed something the states did not have involvement with, and yet we\u2019re being forced to implement a patchwork of federal ideas, and now we\u2019re being asked to help in saving the health law.\u201d\n\nLike Massachusetts, the federal plan mandates that most Americans buy insurance in 2014 or face a tax penalty; requires insurance plans to be sold through an online marketplace where consumers could make comparisons; provides insurance subsidies for low-income individuals; and fines larger companies that don\u2019t offer insurance to their employees.\n\nAlready, the unified sweep of the federal law has splintered considerably. Following a Supreme Court ruling in 2012 that made Medicaid expansion optional for states, 25 of them, including Maine and New Hampshire, have opted out of that portion of the law.\n\nAnd because of widespread Republican resistance to the law from governors and state legislators, 36 states, including Maine and New Hampshire, have not launched their own online insurance portals, leaving it to the federal government to oversee those marketplaces. Consumers living in states that set up websites have had a much smoother shopping experience overall.\n\nAs Obama attempts to weather wave after wave of controversy, he continues to move back deadlines and give states increasing flexibility to adapt.\n\nFor example, seeking to recover politically from his broken promise that all people could keep their health care plans, Obama gave individual states the option of allowing noncompliant plans to remain in place for another year. About two dozen states, including many that have embraced health reform such as Massachusetts, Washington, and New York, have said no. The other half, including Florida, New Hampshire, and Maine, will allow the renewals of such plans.\n\n\u201cThere are now four or five variations of what state markets could look like,\u201d said Dreyfus, whose company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, was the only individual insurance plan in the country that filed a friend of the court brief backing the Affordable Care Act during the Supreme Court case.\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress, including those who have sponsored bills to amend the federal law, say they are not ready to dismiss the Massachusetts blueprint despite their misgivings about the law\u2019s implementation. \u201cWe looked at the Massachusetts-type model because it\u2019s based on a competitive, Republican-style market-based plan,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and member of the Energy and Commerce Committee that drafted the House version of the health bill.\n\nAn aide to Senator Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who is pushing a bill to allow consumers to keep their noncompliant insurance plans indefinitely, said the problems with the rollout are inexcusable but in states willing to embrace the health overhaul, the Massachusetts plan is working.\n\nSenator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, who was a senior member of the committee that drafted the House version of the health bill, said it is the federal government\u2019s responsibility to ensure a right to health care rather than leaving it up to each state to create a patchwork of policies.\n\n\u201cEvery American should have access to quality, affordable health care just as Medicare and Social Security provide vital benefits that millions of Americans depend on, regardless of the state in which they live,\u201d Markey said in a prepared statement. Still, it is difficult for Republicans not to gloat.\n\n\u201cI do think that one of the fundamental problems we\u2019re seeing now is that the Obama administration was attempting to federalize something that ultimately cannot be federalized,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, Romney\u2019s policy director during the 2012 campaign. \u201cGovernor Romney\u2019s criticism turns out to have been quite accurate.\u201d\n\nWhat worked in Massachusetts will probably not work in all 50 states, each with its own political dynamics, he said \u2014 not to mention that insurance has always been regulated at the state level. \u201cIf you try to impose a one-size-fits-all framework, you\u2019re going to run into some difficulties, and I think the administration is learning that the hard way,\u201d Chen said. \u201cSo what the Obama people wanted \u2014 a single federal system \u2014 will never come to pass.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts law had distinct advantages, having evolved over nearly two decades and building on practices that were already in place, such as insurers not being allowed to deny coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions. The state law also garnered bipartisan support, as well as industry buy-in.\n\nJohn McDonough, a Harvard public health professor who helped craft the Massachusetts and federal laws, said he cannot conceive of another health reform model that would have achieved a similar level of progress and gotten through Congress in 2010. The law was a compromise cobbled together with conservative ideas such as the individual mandate and having a competitive market-based plan to appease those wary of a single-payer government-run system some Democrats had advocated.\n\n\u201cThe Massachusetts model was the worst possible framework for federal reform,\u201d McDonough said dryly, \u201cexcept for all the alternatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.1146986988", "eomportal-id": 1020288, "description": "Republican Mitt Romney warned during the 2012 campaign that Massachusetts\u2019 ground-breaking health reform, which Romney signed into law as governor in 2006, would never work for the country as a whole.
