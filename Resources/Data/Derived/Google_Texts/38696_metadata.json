Crystal Merkes said.\n\nDespite the mileage, they didn't give up, making it all the way to Panama City at Bay Memorial Sunday afternoon.\n\nIf you would like to donate to the Honor Flight Network, you can visit honorflight.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bart Steele and Crystal Merkes are walking in support of the Honor Flight Network, an organization that sends WWII vets to Washington D.C. to visit the War Memorial.", "language": "english", "author": "Meg Rose", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/A-Military-Couple-Travels-64-Miles-To-Pay-Tribute-To-WWII-Vets-277390641.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/wwii5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bart Steele and Crystal Merkes are walking in support of the Honor Flight Network, an organization that sends WWII vets to Washington D.C. to visit the War Memorial.", "title": "Military Couple Travels 64 Miles To Pay Tribute To WWII Vets"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bart Steele and Crystal Merkes are walking in support of the Honor Flight Network, an organization that sends WWII vets to Washington D.C. to visit the War Memorial.", "title": "Military Couple Travels 64 Miles To Pay Tribute To WWII Vets", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/A-Military-Couple-Travels-64-Miles-To-Pay-Tribute-To-WWII-Vets-277390641.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/wwii5.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Military Couple Travels 64 Miles To Pay Tribute To WWII Vets", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Military Couple Travels 64 Miles, To Pay Tribute To WWII"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadb9\"", "article_summary": "As for Steele's girlfriend Crystal Merkes, she's joining in not only to support Steele, but to pay it back to the vets.\nHe's walking in support of the Honor Flight Network, an organization that sends WWII vets to Washington, D.C. to visit the WWII Memorial.\nOn day four of their 64-mile trek from Eglin Air Force Base, Bart Steele and Crystal Merkes approach Panama City late Sunday afternoon.\nCrystal Merkes said.\nBut as a veteran who served four years in Army Aviation in Seoul Korea, Steele is used to a challenge."}
