The Bible is his life, and he is serious about it, so much so that he is investing millions into the construction of a monumental museum about the Scriptures, called simply the \u201cMuseum of the Bible.\u201d\n\nPlanning for the museum has been in the works for some time, as previously reported by The Inquisitr, but the name has only recently been confirmed.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, Green says, \u201cWe don\u2019t need more to tell people who and what we are.\u201d The name says it all. The museum is about the Bible: its stories, its history, and its impact on the world.\n\nThe Green family began collecting Biblical artifacts and historic Bibles in 2009. According to a video from the Museum of the Bible, that collection has grown to over 40,000 artifacts, including more than 3,000 complete Torah scrolls, some of which survived the Jewish Holocaust under the Nazis, and 12 fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls. One of those fragments is the earliest surviving fragment from a passage in John 8, dating back to the third century. The collection that the Hobby Lobby President\u2019s family has amassed in just a few short years is believed to be one of the world\u2019s largest private collections of rare Biblical texts and artifacts.\n\nThe family has already been sharing their Bible findings with the public in tours that have traveled throughout the world, giving researchers and devotees alike the privilege of seeing first-hand Biblical antiquities that previously only the most connected had access to. Soon, visitors, students, and scholars from all over the planet will have the opportunity to participate in the interactive Museum of the Bible and see their faith come alive.\n\nThe Museum of the Bible is intended to be a \u201chigh-definition sensory ride,\u201d complete with a replica of ancient Nazareth, Steve Green told the Washington Times.\n\n\u201cFrom explorations of the Bible\u2019s striking narratives to keen, scholarly engagement with some of the world\u2019s rarest biblical treasures, there will be something at Museum of the Bible to engage everyone.\u201d\n\nThe mission statement of the organization, reports the New Republic, is to \u201cbring to life the living word of God, to tell its compelling story of preservation, and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the bible.\u201d\n\nAccording to Green, the Museum of the Bible is not designed just for believers. \u201cThe Bible can speak for itself, explain itself.\u201d Skeptics, critics, and believers alike will be welcome at the facility, which will be set up much like a science museum.\n\nLike the name, the logo for the new Museum of the Bible is very simple. According to Jonathan Ager of C&G Partners, the company that created the logo, \u201cWhen you are making an identity to reflect a museum about the Bible, it has to be simple and respectful.\u201d\n\nThe logo is a simple letter B on its side, for \u201cBible\u201d; however, it could also be interpreted as the tablets of the Ten Commandments, the curled pages of an open book, or an M for \u201cmuseum\u201d underlined.\n\nEven the font for the Bible museum is symbolic. The font is the European DIN font, \u201coriginally invented to make roadway signs in Europe more visible and safe. It was designed for clarity, to help people find their way.\u201d A writer for The Huffington Post says, \u201cHow very Biblical.\u201d\n\nConstruction is set to begin soon on the building, which will be in downtown Washington, D.C., four blocks from the U.S. Capitol, and two blocks from the National Mall. The plan is for the opening of the eight-story, 430,000 square foot Museum of the Bible to be in September of 2017.\n\nHobby Lobby President Steve Green is excited about the museum. He says, \u201cWe invite everyone \u2013 adults and children, the intellectually curious and most seasoned of scholars alike \u2014 to the Museum of the Bible to explore the most important and influential book ever written.\u201d\n\n[images via the Museum of the Bible]", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Hobby Lobby President Steve Green told Congress that the Bible was important to him and his family, he didn't view it as a convenient argument put forth as", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "When Hobby Lobby President Steve Green told Congress that the Bible was important to him and his family, he didn\u2019t view it as a convenient argument put forth as", "title": "\u2018Museum Of The Bible\u2019 Coming Soon, Complements Of Hobby Lobby President", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1521166/museum-of-the-bible-coming-soon-complements-of-hobby-lobby-president/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Museum-Of-The-Bible-Steve-Green-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-05T21:25:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T21:45:12+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Museum-Of-The-Bible-Steve-Green-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-10-05T21:25:54+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bible,dead sea scrolls,hobby lobby,museum of the bible,steve green,torah scrolls,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Museum-Of-The-Bible-Steve-Green-670x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "When Hobby Lobby President Steve Green told Congress that the Bible was important to him and his family, he didn\u2019t view it as a convenient argument put forth as"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Hobby Lobby President Steve Green is excited about the museum.\nEven the font for the Bible museum is symbolic.\nThe Museum of the Bible is intended to be a \u201chigh-definition sensory ride,\u201d complete with a replica of ancient Nazareth, Steve Green told the Washington Times.\nThe plan is for the opening of the eight-story, 430,000 square foot Museum of the Bible to be in September of 2017.\nThe museum is about the Bible: its stories, its history, and its impact on the world."}
