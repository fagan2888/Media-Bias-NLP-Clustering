Tom Cole on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe was echoed by Roy Blunt of Missouri, who said on Fox News that \u201cany law you pass that discourages people from working can\u2019t be a good idea.\u201d\n\nThe problem, as I noted last week, is that Obamacare doesn\u2019t discourage people from working. Rather, by providing for the purchase of health insurance, it gives people the option to retire early, move to part-time work, or quit jobs to pursue other options. Now, under the Affordable Care Act, you can leave your corporate office to take care of your kids, secure in the knowledge that you could still afford health insurance for you and your family.\n\nIn the pre-Obama era, Conservatives might have praised this as a family friendly reform. Now, however, they see it as an attack on the \u201cdignity of work,\u201d and an unjust form of \u201credistribution.\u201d\n\nLast week, for instance, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan called the Affordable Care Act a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d that would discourage lower-income Americans from working more:\n\n\u201cI guess I understand \u2018better off\u2019 in the context of healthcare. But \u2018better off\u2019 in inducing a person not to work who is on the low-income scale, not to get on the ladder of life, to begin working, getting the dignity of work, getting more opportunities, rising their income, joining the middle class, this means fewer people will do that.\"\n\nAnd the Washington Post quotes Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who frets about the justice of subsidizing a person\u2019s ability to leave a job they don\u2019t like. \u201cWhat the White House wants you to think is, if a person chooses to make less income, they must be doing something that makes them better off,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat conservatives would have you ask is, is it an appropriate use of someone else\u2019s money to put you in that position to choose?\u201d\n\nThese quotes are absolutely striking, in that they give a clear glimpse into the ideological commitments of the Republican Party. From Sen. Blunt and Rep. Cole, we get the revelation that\u2014for conservatives\u2014the only \u201cwork\u201d worth acknowledging is wage labor. To myself, and many others, someone who retires early to volunteer\u2014or leaves a job to care for their children\u2014is still working, they\u2019re just outside the formal labor market. And indeed, their labor is still valuable\u2014it just isn\u2019t compensated with cash.\n\nBy contrast, conservatives\u2014both thoughtful and otherwise\u2014have defined \u201cwork\u201d as equivalent to \u201cwage labor,\u201d which\u2014in a real way\u2014devalues the countless forms of work that allow society to function, from childrearing to community involvement. If we borrow Paul Ryan\u2019s formulation, then wage labor is the only work that comes with \u201cdignity,\u201d where dignity is being forced to work a job for health insurance, with the knowledge that\u2014if you don\u2019t\u2014you could face destitution, or worse.\n\nAs an aside, it should be said that, as far as the \u201cdignity of work\u201d goes, it only applies to low-income Americans. Republicans aren\u2019t as worried as the idle rich, who\u2014I suppose\u2014have earned the right to avoid a life of endless toil. Otherwise\u2014if Republicans really wanted everyone to work as much as possible\u2014they\u2019d support confiscatory tax rates. After all, nothing will drive an investment banker back to the office like the threat of losing 70 percent of her income to Uncle Sam.\n\nIn any case, from Douglas Holtz-Eakin, we get the related view that there\u2019s something morally suspect about the Affordable Care Act and other laws that use government to end this kind of coercion. Writing at Salon, Elias Isquith walks through the implications of this view. If it\u2019s wrong to use government to free individuals from the threat of poverty or ruinous disease, then\u2014in practical terms\u2014the only \u201cfree\u201d people are the wealthy, who don\u2019t have to work to survive, and who can act and take risks without worry.\n\nIf this sounds like an unfair description of Republican views, then consider it in the context of their recent actions, from blocking emergency unemployment insurance to cutting food stamps and refusing a minimum wage increase. At each turn, when offered the choice between improving life for low-wage workers or forcing them into a state of dependence\u2014where they\u2019re at the whims of employers, or out of the labor force altogether\u2014Republicans choose the latter.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402101415, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Republicans to America: 'Work, Moochers!'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Conservatives are attacking the Affordable Care Act by defining \"work\" as wage labor, and condemning anyone who chooses to step away from the market.", "title": "Republicans to America: 'Work, Moochers!'", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/10/republicans-to-america-work-moochers.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/republicans-to-america-work-moochers/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1392059286347.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Conservatives are attacking the Affordable Care Act by defining \"work\" as wage labor, and condemning anyone who chooses to step away from the market.", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-10T14:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/republicans-to-america-work-moochers", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Republicans to America: \\\\u0027Work, Moochers!\\\\u0027\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/10/republicans-to-america-work-moochers.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/republicans-to-america-work-moochers/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46401976.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/republicans-to-america-work-moochers\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-10T14:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d77\"", "article_summary": "Conservatives are attacking the Affordable Care Act by defining \"work\" as wage labor, and condemning anyone who chooses to step away from the market.\nFrom Sen.
