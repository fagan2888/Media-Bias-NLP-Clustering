Of those plans, 78 will be available to individuals.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased that the rates approved by the Minnesota Department of Commerce are the lowest average rates in the country, providing competitive prices and better coverage for our consumers,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cYear after year, Minnesota has been recognized as a national leader in health reform.\u201d\n\nMNsure will offer insurance in four different plan levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.\n\nPlan will cost as low as $90 a month for a 25 year old, $115 for a 40 year old and $245 for a 60 year old.\n\nAnd rates could go lower using federal tax credits from the new health care law, according to MNsure Executive Director April Todd-Malmlov.\n\n\u201cThe tax credits are based on a percentage of income, and so based on that percentage of income, regardless of where you live or what your age may be, your premium will be based on your income,\u201d Todd-Malmlov said.\n\nOfficials could not promise people will pay less compared to current coverage, but are confident they will get more for their money. About half of participants are expected to qualify for tax credits to help defray the cost.\n\nRepublicans, including Senate Minority Leader David Hann, have attacked the new exchange.\n\n\u201cThese rates are higher than what is currently available on the open market. It seems we were sold a bill of goods,\u201d Hann said.\n\nAnd Democrats are firing back. Rep. Joe Atkins (DFL-Inver Grove Heights) says the adage \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d also applies to health care.\n\n\u201cYou can go on e-insurance and buy a product for $50 and you\u2019re buying a piece of crap,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cIf you go to a store and you buy a flannel shirt and its falling apart, it\u2019s not worth paying the price for it.\u201d\n\nThe insurance plans MNsure will offer are from Minnesota\u2019s best known health insurance companies: Blue Cross Blue Shield. Medica, Preferred One, Group Health and UCare.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether Minnesotans will pay less than they do right now, but state officials say they will get many more benefits.\n\nMNsure goes live October 1, and everyone must have insurance under the new federal health care law on January 1, 2014.\n\nWEB EXTRA: MNsure Cost Calculator\n\nThe state has ads running right now featuring Paul Bunyan, in hopes of getting more than a million Minnesotans to sign up.\n\nEnrollment begins on Oct. 1, but they already have a call center to answer questions.\n\nCoverage begins in January.\n\nTwo studies found that in the other states that already have health care exchanges, most customers pay lower premiums, but not all.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
