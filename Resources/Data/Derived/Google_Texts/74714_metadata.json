In an Election Day in which the Tea Party lost almost every race it was in, but by margins small enough to suggest that the Tea Party was competitive and could have won, the trenches in the GOP Civil War have only been dug deeper.\n\nFrom the mainstream side of the argument, the growing \u201ckick all the bums out\u201d sentiment that is growing among the public and a history of legislative impediments \u2014 whose single highlight currently revolves around harking the failures of the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care insurance exchanges\u2019 public implementation \u2014 are bolstering the interpretation from moderates\u2019 wins in New Jersey, Virginia and Alabama that the Republican base is no longer responding to political extremism.\n\nFrom the Tea Party side of the argument, however, it is more an issue that the Republicans are not conservative enough. In Virginia, where \u2014 for the first time in three decades \u2014 a governor has been elected of the same party as the sitting president, Republican lieutenant gubernatorial candidate E.W. Jackson and gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli took the opportunity to blame the Democrats for their losses, instead of addressing faults in their campaigns.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cThey lied to us, they vilified us, they took the things we said and twisted them, turned them, contorted them, perverted them and said everything about us they could make up,\u201d Jackson said during his concession speech of Democratic campaign spending \u201cBut folks, I stand before you unbroken, unbowed and unwilling to quit.\u201d\n\nBefore the governor\u2019s race was called, Virginia Republican Chairman Pat Mullins said, \u201cOur candidates are decent, honest family men. They love their families, they love their God, they love their country and this commonwealth, but for the last six months they\u2019ve been nonstop demonized by Democrats,\u201d \u201c[Democrats say] we hate women, we hate minorities, we hate everything. But that\u2019s not who these people are.\u201d\n\nThe centralist option\n\nHowever, in New Jersey \u2014 a historically blue state that has reliably voted Democratic in presidential elections in recent history \u2014 the interpretation is different. There, Chris Christie, a centrist Republican, has won re-election by one of the largest margins in any state-based election in New Jersey history. In an interview with NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Christie echoed the Republicans\u2019 \u201cautopsy\u201d of the 2012 election \u2014 \u201cThe Growth & Opportunity Project.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got 61 percent of the vote\u2026 in a blue state that had just re-elected Barack Obama a year ago by 17 points,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThat was nearly a 40-point turnaround between voting for a Democrat at the top of the ticket and voting for a Republican. And, you know, getting 51 percent of the Hispanic vote, I\u2019m very proud of that, because I\u2019ve worked hard with the Hispanic community to let them see how our policies can help their families.\u201d\n\nChristie \u2014 who is seen with apprehension in the Republican Party due to his willingness to work and campaign with the president \u2014 represents the epicenter of the Republican in-fighting. With his support among moderates from both parties and his appeal toward independents, Christie \u2014 more than any other Republican \u2014 is best suited to face former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton for the presidency in 2016 among the current suite of potential nominees. According to a recent NBC/Esquire Magazine poll, 51 percent of all Americans see themselves as centrists, so Christie should be able to offer ample challenge to the Democrats.\n\nDespite this, because of the extreme ideology of the current party, he is also the least likely to survive a Republican primary. When asked in an interview if Christie could unite the party\u2019s factions, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current host of CNN\u2019s Crossfire, responded: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think Chris Christie has any interest in bridging that divide because he\u2019ll run as an aggressive, Northeastern moderate who can get something done. I don\u2019t see him using conservative language. He might be able to get nominated, but it will be running as a personality leader, not a movement leader.\u201d\n\nChuck Henderson, a Tea Party activist from Manhattan, Kan., told the New York Times, \u201cHe won his re-election, bully for him, but for him to make the jump up the next rung of the ladder, well, he\u2019s not going to find any support from the people I mix with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so frustrated with all this Christie talk we can\u2019t see straight,\u201d said Scott Hofstra, a Tea Party volunteer from Vine Grove, Ky. \u201cHe\u2019s no more conservative than [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid [(D \u2013 Nev.)].\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party, deconstructed\n\nWhile the Tea Party may be more partisan than ever, its sway in the Republican Party may be eroding. According to a September 26 Gallup poll, support for the Tea Party is at a near-record low \u2014 22 percent. With 27 percent explicitly opposing the Tea Party, 78 percent of all Americans are either against the conservative movement or have no definitive opinions of it. Only 38 percent of Republicans identify with the Tea Party, compared to 65 percent in 2010.\n\n\u201cU.S. support for the Tea Party is at a low ebb at a time when key issues of concern for the movement \u2014 funding for the Affordable Care Act and raising the U.S. debt ceiling \u2014 are focal points in Washington, with Tea Party-backed Sen. Ted Cruz prominently fighting both policies,\u201d reported Gallup. \u201cThe discomfort he has created in the Republican caucus is merely emblematic of the ambivalence national Republicans feel toward the movement. Although few Republicans outright oppose the Tea Party, far more are neutral toward it than support it.\u201d\n\nIf the geography of the Tea Party was taken into consideration \u2014 Congressional districts that elected a member of the Tea Party Caucus and/or have at least 10 individuals enrolled or registered in Tea Party-supporting or -leaning organizations per every 10,000 residents \u2014 one can see a few obvious things. First, the districts typically do not represent major cities, areas near transportation hubs or areas that have high minority populations. Second, these districts are centered in the South and the Lower Midwest. Finally, with the exceptions of Reps. Michele Bachmann (R \u2013 MN-6th), Vicky Hartzler (R \u2013 MO-4th), Cynthia Lummis (R \u2013 WY) and Diane Black (R \u2013 TN-6th), these districts are represented by white males.\n\nFor a party that \u2014 at its heights in 2010 \u2014 only had about 67,000 registered members throughout America, excluding those that state they sympathize with the Tea Party, the realities of the changing times are daunting. With white America to be surpassed by the Latino community as the nation\u2019s majority by 2043, with once safe states \u2014 such as Virginia and Texas \u2014 increasingly coming into play and with minority votes \u2014 such as the black vote in the Virginia gubernatorial race \u2014 deciding more and more races, the old arguments that pandering only to the white Protestant voter will be enough to win elections are being generally panned.\n\nThis \u201csmall-world\u201d vision, coupled with a rejection of the Republican Party\u2019s traditional ally \u2014 the business community \u2014 has created a \u201cworld gone mad\u201d situation in which the Tea Party \u2014 backed by the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Club for Growth \u2014 are primarying mainstream Republicans, and the mainstream \u2014 backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 are primarying the Tea Party.\n\n\u201cThe results in Virginia and Alabama will allow the Tea Party wing to keep alive an alternative narrative,\u201d said one GOP strategist who was granted anonymity by the Washington Post. \u201cThey\u2019re bolstered by a parallel universe of bloggers, talk radio hosts and their own political strategists \u2014 most of whom have never actually worked in campaigns, like at Heritage Action and FreedomWorks.\u201d\n\nMoving into 2014, both the mainstream Republicans and the Tea Party remained deadlocked \u2014 with millions of dollars in contributions buoying them \u2014 in a death spiral that threatens to sink the party as a whole. While it is unsure if the infighting will result in a party split or with the Tea Party capitulating, one thing is sure; until the party can stand together, it will continue to fall apart at the feet of the Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tea Party remains relevant for the time being, but its recent election losses, narrow agenda, and America\u2019s changing demographics foreshadow its looming demise.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Frederick Reese", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The Tea Party remains relevant for the time being, but its recent election losses, narrow agenda, and America\u2019s changing demographics foreshadow its looming demise.", "title": "Tea Party\u2019s Future Appears Bleak Amid Divided GOP, Changing Political Landscape", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/tea-party-identity-crisis/172472/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Infographic-11-11-690x707.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-12T08:49:39-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Tea Party remains relevant for the time being, but its recent election losses, narrow agenda, and America\u2019s changing demographics foreshadow its looming demise.", "title": "Tea Party\u2019s Future Appears Bleak Amid Divided GOP, Changing Political Landscape", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111113_tea_4x3.jpg", "creator": "@FrederickReese", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "Tea Party", "published_time": "2013-11-12T05:00:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-12T08:49:39-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf56a\"", "article_summary": "Tea Party\u2019s Future Appears Bleak Amid Divided GOP, Changing Political LandscapeThe Tea Party's recent election losses, narrow agenda and America\u2019s changing demographics foreshadow its looming demise.\nIn an Election Day in which the Tea Party lost almost every race it was in, but by margins small enough to suggest that the Tea Party was competitive and could have won, the trenches in the GOP Civil War have only been dug deeper.\nFrom the Tea Party side of the argument, however, it is more an issue that the Republicans are not conservative enough.\nAccording to a September 26 Gallup poll, support for the Tea Party is at a near-record low \u2014 22 percent.\nWith 27 percent explicitly opposing the Tea Party, 78 percent of all Americans are either against the conservative movement or have no definitive opinions of it."}
