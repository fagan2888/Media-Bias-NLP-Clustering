More than 8,000 people die of MRSA infections each year, while C. diff kills at least 27,000 annually, according to the article.\n\nBut the consumer safety group said poor ratings related to MRSA and C. diff also \"can be a red flag that a hospital isn't following best practices in preventing infections and prescribing antibiotics. That could not only allow C. diff and MRSA to spread but also turn the hospital into a breeding ground for other resistant infections that are even more difficult to treat.\"\n\nThe ratings are based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from October 2013 to September 2014, according to an announcement from Consumer Reports. This year's ratings added MRSA and C. diff to ratings of central-line blood stream infections, surgical-site infections and urinary tract infections associated with catheters.\n\nHigh-profile hospitals receiving lower ratings included Ohio's Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, the magazine noted.\n\nThe nine hospitals ranking highest for overall infection avoidance were Northwest Texas Healthcare System in Amarillo, Texas; Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter, Florida; White County Medical Center in Searcy, Arkansas; Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas; Biloxi Regional Medical Center in Biloxi, Mississippi, Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon, Virginia; Lima Memorial Health System in Lima, Ohio; Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead City, Arizona; and South Baldwin Regional Medical Center in Foley, Alabama.\n\nLast month Consumer Reports looked at the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. The magazine's prescription drugs editor told FierceHealthcare at the time that the U.S. stands to lose the gains it has made in modern medicine if the healthcare industry doesn't take immediate action.\n\nThe White House has taken note: President Obama requested an additional $1.2 billion in the 2016 budget to monitor and diagnose antibiotic-resistant superbugs and try to eliminate their spread in healthcare settings.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the article\n\n- here's the announcement\n\n- check out the ratings (subscription required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs: 'Health crisis of this generation'\n\nWhite House wants $1.2B to fight antibiotic resistance\n\nCRE part of a greater public health crisis\n\nReusable sharps containers may spread C. diff in hospitals\n\nNon-toxic version of bacteria could help treat hospital-acquired infections", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only 6 percent of 3,000 hospitals examined by\u00a0Consumer Reports\u00a0scored well for controlling two of the most serious and prevalent infection-causing bacteria--C. diff and MRSA.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Only 6 percent of 3,000 hospitals examined by\u00a0Consumer Reports\u00a0scored well for controlling two of the most serious and prevalent infection-causing bacteria--C. diff and MRSA.", "title": "Majority of hospitals rate poorly in controlling C.diff, MRSA", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/majority-hospitals-rate-poorly-controlling-cdiff-mrsa/2015-07-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "C. diff,Consumer Reports,hospital-acquired infections,MRSA,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The good news: 322 hospitals had zero MRSA infections, and 357 had no C. diff infections.\nMore than 8,000 people die of MRSA infections each year, while C. diff kills at least 27,000 annually, according to the article.\nThis year's ratings added MRSA and C. diff to ratings of central-line blood stream infections, surgical-site infections and urinary tract infections associated with catheters.\nConsumer Reports said it focused on C. diff and MRSA because both are common and deadly.\nOnly 6 percent of 3,000 hospitals examined by Consumer Reports scored well for controlling two of the most serious and prevalent infection-causing bacteria--C. diff and MRSA."}
