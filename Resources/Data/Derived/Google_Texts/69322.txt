Business Breakfast Highlights How to Avoid Scams

Thomas College and the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce held their business breakfast this morning in Waterville.

The main topic of discussion was common scams and how to avoid them.

Amy Schram, with the Better Business Bureau in Massachusetts was the keynote speaker.

She highlighted the major red flags to watch out for and the steps you can take to protect your business.

She says many scammers have stopped the ‘prize giveaway’ trick in which they contact you about a special trip, or prize of some sort, and then require financial information from you in order to collect.

Instead, scammers are impersonating your personal and trusted financial institutions to steal your money.

“People are calling and they’re impersonating the IRS, or your bank, or your credit card company and it’s not even really catching us off guard because it sounds so incredibly realistic. They have a lot of information on us already from the Internet or from pieces of information that they’ve found here or there, so we just get into this very conversational mode with the person on the other end and we end up giving away more information than we think we are,” said Amy Schram.

Schram suggests letting unknown numbers on your caller I.D. go straight to voicemail as scammers are less likely to leave a message.

She also recommends calling your credit card company or bank back in the event you find the call suspicious.

She says you should contact the Attorney General’s office if you believe you’re being scammed.
