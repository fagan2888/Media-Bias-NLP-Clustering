For Ryan, however, it was just another extension of his overarching strategy to bring his foes in and try to soften them from the inside. (Ryan was meeting with House Freedom Caucus members until nearly 11 p.m. Tuesday, trying to get them to back the Republican budget.)\n\nBut Ryan wasn\u2019t completely deferential to Heritage Action, the hectoring political arm of the Heritage Foundation, which keeps track of how often a member of Congress votes with the conservative group through a scorecard. He used the speech as an opportunity to try to temper the group\u2019s sometimes-unruly strategies and lofty expectations.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to say to you today is this: Don\u2019t take the bait. Let\u2019s not fight over tactics. And don\u2019t impugn people\u2019s motives,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you disagree. And there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s rotten in Washington -- there\u2019s no doubt about that -- but we can\u2019t let how someone votes on an amendment to an appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Action scorecards have become a proxy test of conservatism in recent years, and many Republican members worry which way -- or whether -- Heritage will score a particular vote.\n\nRyan, who called himself a \u201cJack Kemp, Ronald Reagan conservative,\u201d said the GOP movement could no longer demand things that are unrealistic, specifically name-checking a repeal of Obamacare while President Barack Obama was still in office. \u201cAll it does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that anymore. It won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican suggested that establishing those sorts of expectations were setting the GOP up for failure, whereas he wants to exceed expectations and help Republicans be successful.\n\nRyan\u2019s plan to achieve that success is to unite the GOP behind a common vision. He went on to once again lay out his five-point agenda: national security; jobs and economic growth; health care and entitlement reform; poverty and opportunity; and restoring the Constitution.\n\n(Ryan said that last piece was \u201cso critical to all the others,\u201d as the conservative Heritage crowd nodded their heads and greeted the platitude with plenty of mmm\u2019s.)\n\nDuring a brief question-and-answer period, Ryan called Obamacare \u201cnothing more than basically a proxy and a plan to get to government-run health care,\u201d and he said Republicans have to show voters -- \u201cWe owe you!\u201d -- an Obamacare replacement. It\u2019s been an open question whether Republicans would actually produce a health care replacement bill -- one that could be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and voted on by vulnerable Republicans in Congress -- and Ryan has been cagey on those details.\n\nAn audience member also asked Ryan what his deadline was for passing appropriations bills, and whether he would replace any chairman who didn\u2019t meet that deadline, a question that was met with laughter and applause. Once everyone calmed down, Ryan said the actual deadline is Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, but he wanted to get them done before July.\n\nAgain, though, if Republicans can\u2019t adopt a budget, they might find themselves doing zero appropriations bills. And then Republicans might be asking themselves who set the unrealistic expectations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The speaker is trying to bring the gadfly conservative group back into the fold.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-04 11:30:29 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The speaker is trying to bring the gadfly conservative group back into the fold.", "title": "Paul Ryan to Heritage Action: Can You Not?", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-heritage-action_us_56b220a9e4b04f9b57d7faf7", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b223421a00009c01ab1e90.jpeg?cache=prklnyxphp", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The speaker is trying to bring the gadfly conservative group back into the fold.", "creator": "@MEPFuller", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b223421a00009c01ab1e90.jpeg?cache=prklnyxphp", "height": 1000}, "title": "Paul Ryan to Heritage Action: Can You Not?", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-03 11:30:29 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56b220a9e4b04f9b57d7faf7", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "published_time": "2016-02-03 11:30:29 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-04 00:40:50 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "But Ryan wasn\u2019t completely deferential to Heritage Action, the hectoring political arm of the Heritage Foundation, which keeps track of how often a member of Congress votes with the conservative group through a scorecard.\n(Ryan said that last piece was \u201cso critical to all the others,\u201d as the conservative Heritage crowd nodded their heads and greeted the platitude with plenty of mmm\u2019s.)\nConservative groups were a constant headache for former Speaker John Boehner, whose appearance at a Heritage Action conference would have been almost shocking.\n(Ryan was meeting with House Freedom Caucus members until nearly 11 p.m. Tuesday, trying to get them to back the Republican budget.)\n\u201cTo quote William Wallace in 'Braveheart,' we have to unite the clans,\u201d Ryan said."}
