Eight Okaloosa County teens are charged with inciting a riot Saturday night at a detention facility.

Deputies responded to a 911 call at the Gulf Coast Treatment Center in Fort Walton Beach around 8:30 night.

Reports indicated the teens were taking staff members' radios, assaulting the staff, and damaging property.

The Fort Walton Beach Police department also arrived on scene.

Staff members say some of the juveniles began throwing chairs, flipping tables, and speaking gang jargon.

Law enforcement transported the eight teens to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Crestview.

No injuries are reported although one juvenile who was not arrested is at Fort Walton Beach Medical Center for treatment of an asthma attack.
