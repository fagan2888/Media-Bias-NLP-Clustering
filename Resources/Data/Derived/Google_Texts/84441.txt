The U.S.Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday over the fate of the Affordable Care Act.

The question before the court is whether low-income residents are entitled to subsidized health insurance in more than two thirds of the states that declined to establish their own insurance marketplaces. Here is what could happen if the justices rule that the text of the law precludes subsidies in states without their own marketplaces, called exchanges:

Subsidies in states that rely on the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, would disappear, unless or until the states established their own marketplaces. In all, more than six million people already have received tax credits for 2015 through the federal exchange. A group of Republicans is considering a short-term extension of financial assistance, in the event the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies.

Itâ€™s unclear how many of those who currently receive subsidies would continue to pay for insurance without the tax credits, but if a significant number fled, experts say, the price of insurance could increase, driving even more Americans out of the program. Many would face no penalty for failing to purchase health insurance; the so-called individual mandate applies only if affordable insurance relative to income is available.
