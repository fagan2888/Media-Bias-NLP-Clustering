( Walt Hester / Trail-Gazette )\n\nLegend, folklore and history over time germinate and grow about a mountain. After a time with this process, a mountain can take on an aura -- a personality. The trails, topography and ecosystems lend flavor to the mountain's story. Next to Longs Peak, Twin Sisters Peaks have some of the most unique colorful mountain history and lore in the area. The Twins have been the setting of much human history, both fact and fiction, humorous, romantic, tragic, mundane, earthy and dramatic.\n\nEven before the twentieth century, Twin Sisters Peaks trails were among the most traveled hiking trails in this part of the Rockies. The trails to both summits are accessible year-round and do not require snowshoes or skis, even during the winter months.\n\nWhile being an excellent \"conditioner\" for peaks of a higher altitude, a trip up the Twins is a worthwhile and enjoyable hike in its own right.\n\nThe trail begins with a multitude of switchbacks on the western slope until trekkers reach the ridgecrest. At this point, the trail is routed in a southerly direction, eventually taking trekkers to timberline. A few more switchbacks in a rocky terrain brings climbers to the tundra saddle between the two peaks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost trekkers climb the western summit that provides grandiose camera views of Longs Peak, Mt. Meeker, Estes Cone and Battle Mountain to name a few of the famous summits that are visible. Traversing the tundra valley between the two peaks and negotiating between the huge boulders, will bring trekkers to the eastern summit. This summit is actually 50 feet higher than its western twin. The views from the eastern summit provide landscapes of the upper and lower foothills and on into the plains of eastern Colorado. On a clear or pollution free day, it is possible to see Pikes Peak near Colorado Springs far to the south.\n\nThe \"third twin\" can also be seen from the eastern summit. It is not uncommon for hikers to include this summit in a day's adventure. The route to reach the third sister involves some elevation loss, with a decent to the saddle between the peaks. Many hikers feels it is well worth the effort.\n\nAs an added bonus, trekkers may see early tundra flowers blossoming in the saddle between the two peaks. Such blossoms can include fairy primrose, moss campion, golden drabas, yellow stonecrop, alpine mertensias, alpine harebell and alpine sandwort.\n\nSign up information is listed at the Estes Valley Library, Komito Boots and cmc.org.
