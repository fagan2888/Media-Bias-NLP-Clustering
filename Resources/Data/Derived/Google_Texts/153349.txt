Authorities say a weekend tornado that touched down in southwest Florida with winds up to 135 mph damaged several homes, left thousands without power for a time, but caused no serious injuries or deaths.

Police say the tornado caused scattered damage over about 12 square miles in Cape Coral on Saturday evening. Only a few minor injuries were reported.

"We have numerous power lines down, we have numerous homes that have been damaged," Cape Coral Police spokesman Dana Coston said shortly afterward. Coston says nearly 10,000 people lost electricity but power was being restored.

Photos showed overturned cars, a roof nearly torn off and large trees down across yards. The Red Cross opened a shelter at a school for residents unable to immediately return home.
