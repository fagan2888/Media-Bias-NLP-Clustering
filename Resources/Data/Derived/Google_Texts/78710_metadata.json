She visualizes different kinds of conditions that might face her in races, even jots down potential questions from the media in a notebook so she can offer thoughtful answers.\n\nThe precocious 18-year-old from Eagle-Vail makes her Olympic debut Tuesday in giant slalom, and she has thought out every conceivable scenario.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve envisioned this moment for quite a while,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI\u2019ve visualized myself on the top step of the podium, and on the third step of the podium. I\u2019ve envisioned myself crashing, because I know what mistake I (would have) made to crash, and I know I\u2019m not going to do that in the race.\u201d\n\nThat raised a question: Is it possible to be too prepared? She was ready for that one, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to be too prepared, but it\u2019s possible to think too much,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick on race day, to turn all those extra thoughts off and just know that I\u2019ve been preparing for this for my entire life, really. Whether I knew it or not at the time, every event that\u2019s happened to me has been preparation for this, and this is preparation for whatever happens in my future. I\u2019ve always been really aware of that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also a thinker, so some races I think a little too much and I start to doubt myself. I don\u2019t feel any doubt right now. I just feel really excited.\u201d\n\nAt the world championships last year in Schladming, Austria, Shiffrin was the favorite in slalom. She was third-fastest in the first run, but both of the women ahead of her had poor second runs. Hers was solid, and she became the third-youngest world champion, proving she has what it takes to perform under big-event pressure.\n\nThat was the best preparation for the Olympics.\n\n\u201cI think there will definitely be more nerves, because this means something to the rest of the world, so it also makes it mean something more to me,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cIn the starting gate, I\u2019m expecting to feel jitters because I\u2019m about to leave the start and go as fast as I can, trying to hit hard, plastic gates. I can really get nervous thinking that. But it\u2019s a really enthusiastic nervousness, and I\u2019m starting to be able to channel that to make it into good skiing.\u201d\n\nShiffrin knows the Olympics are notorious for producing unexpected champions. Favorites emerge from a World Cup season that spans months, but funny things happen in a sport that separates winners and losers by fractions of seconds.\n\n\u201cSometimes on race days, especially at the Olympics, it\u2019s hard for the best skier or the fastest skier to actually win,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for the ones who, people think, don\u2019t have a chance. \u2026 It\u2019s been interesting for me to see, it\u2019s a learning lesson that no matter how good you are, you cannot take your foot off the gas. We\u2019re all here to ski, we\u2019re all here to inspire the rest of the world with our sport, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m planning to do.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, Shiffrin gets to ease herself into the Olympic experience. She is a contender in GS, based on having two career podium appearances, both she\u2019s not the favorite. She is the favorite Friday, because she has been the best slalom skier in the world the past two seasons.\n\nTeammate Julia Mancuso, the 2006 Olympic champion in GS, has expressed concern about how courses could become rutted because of warm temperatures. Shiffrin won\u2019t go there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI have heard several athletes say it was too soft. On race day, I\u2019m not planning to have that as an excuse. If I don\u2019t win, it\u2019s because of something I did with my skiing. And if I do win, then it\u2019s because of something I did with my skiing.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin ready to make Olympic skiing mark at Sochi Games", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin ready to make Olympic skiing mark at Sochi Games", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/17/mikaela-shiffrin-ready-to-make-olympic-skiing-mark-at-sochi-games/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140217__mikaela-shiffrin-sochi-olympicsp1.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140217__mikaela-shiffrin-sochi-olympicsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-17T17:18:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:53:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa7b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSometimes on race days, especially at the Olympics, it\u2019s hard for the best skier or the fastest skier to actually win,\u201d Shiffrin said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to be too prepared, but it\u2019s possible to think too much,\u201d Shiffrin said.\nIf I don\u2019t win, it\u2019s because of something I did with my skiing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for the ones who, people think, don\u2019t have a chance.\nI just feel really excited.\u201dAt the world championships last year in Schladming, Austria, Shiffrin was the favorite in slalom."}
