Although the proposed ordinance was initially put before Berkeley City Council at its April 7 meeting, the council opted to push consideration of the issue to May after hearing concerns from several public commenters about the effect the ordinance might have on small businesses.\n\nThe ordinance follows other actions taken by the city to reduce tobacco use, such as a ban \u2014 implemented last May \u2014 on smoking in multi-unit housing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a continuum of how we can continue to make tobacco less available,\u201d said Councilmember Linda Maio.\n\nAccording to Councilmember Susan Wengraf, the benefits of discouraging smoking must be weighed against the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the 1,000-foot buffer, which, according to the ordinance\u2019s agenda item, would affect 80 percent of licensed tobacco retailers in the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of tobacco \u2014 tobacco\u2019s all bad,\u201d Wengraf said. \u201cBut I need to understand what the impacts will be to our small business owners.\u201d\n\nThe proposed ordinance also provides a grace period of one to two years to alleviate negative financial impacts. But according to Steve Duffy, a legislative consultant for the National Association of Tobacco Outlets, Inc., the grace period does not provide sufficient leeway. He added that tobacco retailers generally have little interest in selling tobacco products to minors and that regulations already exist to prevent such sales.\n\n\u201cThe 1000 foot distance is arbitrary and capricious, and would not pass even the low \u2018rational basis\u2019 test of judicial scrutiny,\u201d Duffy wrote in a letter to City Council.\n\nCouncilmember Kriss Worthington, however, said he has seen the proliferation of too many smoke shops in his district, which he thinks ought to be reduced for the sake of public health.\n\nDan Acland, a campus assistant adjunct professor of public policy, said it seems likely that the long-term health benefits of restricting tobacco product sales would outweigh the effects on local businesses.\n\nIn regard to the part of the proposed ordinance that would require tobacco retail licenses for e-cigarette sellers, Rick Evans, the owner of Delux Vapor, emphasized that while e-cigarettes dispense nicotine, they are distinct from tobacco products.\n\nThe proposed regulations are set to return to City Council for further consideration May 12. Some council members have said that in light of the various concerns brought up about the issue, they expect a compromise to be made.\n\nMelissa Wen is the executive news editor.
