CANNES, France (AP) — Relationship drama “My King” pairs Emmanuelle Bercot and Vincent Cassel, two of the busiest people in Cannes.

Bercot stars in the French film as one half of a couple enduring a roller-coaster 10-year romance, and also directed the festival’s opener, juvenile-delinquent drama “Standing Tall.”

Cassel plays her charming, possessive partner — the king of the partly ironic title. He’s also in two other royalty-themed Cannes entries, appearing as a lustful fairy-tale king in Matteo Garrone’s “Tale of Tales” and lending his voice to animated “The Little Prince.”

Directed by French actress-filmmaker Maiwenn, “My King” is a female take on relationships, in a year when the place of women in the film industry is being hotly debated at Cannes.

“My King” is one of only two female-directed films among 19 competing for the Palme d’Or, and “Standing Tall” — which is not in competition — is the first film by a woman to open the festival since the 1980s.

“People keep referring to women here, women there,” Maiwenn said, a touch wearily, at a press conference for “My King” Sunday. “Maybe in a couple of years’ time they will start saying there aren’t enough Moroccans … We aren’t chosen because of our gender or this or that. We’re chosen because of our film.”
