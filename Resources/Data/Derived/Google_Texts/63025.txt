NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Some 15% of those who don’t currently have or plan to purchase long term coverage in the next five years have an alternate plan in place, according to a new survey by Genworth.

“The good news for the nearly three-quarters of Americans who are willing to make some concessions to ensure they are properly prepared for long term care is that there are options for funding long term care,” said Pam Nelson, vice president of consumer insights with Genworth.

Options can include an annuity.

“We are using annuities with long term care riders attached for some of our clients that would be uninsurable under a traditional plan due to their current or past medical issues,” said Brian Gordon, president of MAGA, a national long term care brokerage firm in Chicago.

There are also hybrid life insurance plans with long term care riders attached from insurers such as Lincoln, Mass Mutual and Guardian.

“The benefit of hybrid long term care insurance plans is being able to hedge multiple risks with the same dollar,” said Yan J. Katz, insurance specialist with the Bulfinch Group. “And if the policy holder does not end up needing the long term care rider, premiums paid could be recouped and passed to the beneficiary through the death benefit rather than being lost.”

Although single premium whole life insurance policies with long term care rider options attached only require a one time deposit rather than ongoing contributions, the downside is steep upfront costs to buy it.
