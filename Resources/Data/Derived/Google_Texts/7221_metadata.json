In 2012, 46.7% of Ryan White clients were African American, according to HRSA\u2019s State Profiles.\n\nMore importantly, the care that Ryan White provides makes a difference. Ryan White clients have higher rates of retention in care, and better viral suppression, compared with national data, although results lag somewhat for African American Ryan White clients.\n\nThe Ryan White infrastructure that makes these results possible is comprised of clinical protocols, care engagement models, and other activities that guide the delivery of HIV/AIDS care to populations served by the Ryan White program. The path to further progress can be found in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and its focus on reducing disparities\u2013especially the HIV care continuum\u2019s goal to maximize engagement in care and viral suppression\u2013as well as the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mission to expand health care coverage to all Americans.\n\nAfrican American Ryan White Initiatives\n\nIn recognition of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day on February 7 and this year\u2019s theme \u201cI Am My Brother\u2019s and Sister\u2019s Keeper: Fight HIV/AIDS,\u201d a recap of Ryan White technical assistance, training, and other activities\u2013from models of care to special initiatives\u2013is provided below:\n\nEngaging Black MSM in Care\n\nHRSA has supported numerous initiatives over the decades to enhance care delivery for hard-hit populations. Among the latest is the Center for Engaging Black MSM Across the Care Continuum (CEBACC), which is in the midst of identifying best practices and effective models for HIV care targeting Black men who have sex with men (BMSM).\n\nWorth a Read\n\nCEBACC\u2019s focus group findings on key challenges and successful strategies.\n\nAddressing Stigma: A Blueprint for Improving HIV/STD Prevention and Care Outcomes for Black & Latino Gay Men (NASTAD, 2014)\n\nOptimal Care Checklists for MSM (NASTAD), 2012)\n\nInnovations in Care Delivery\n\nThe Ryan White SPNS program is part of the success with Ryan White client outcomes in its decades-long investigation of innovative models of HIV/AIDS care, including those focused on minority and under served populations. One recent example is the Enhancing Access for Women of Color Initiative, 2009-2014.\n\nSome of the findings from this project have been compiled in the implementation guide, Enhancing Access to HIV Care for Women of Color, developed under the IHIP: Integrating HIV Innovative Practices, a HRSA initiative that is turning SPNS innovation into practice with manuals, curricula, webinars, and tools.\n\nMultiple SPNS projects target innovations for African Americans living with HIV/AIDS, including transgender women of color, young MSM of color, substance users (under the buprenorphine initiative), and persons in correctional settings or those soon to be released to the community.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
