A New Jersey man faces up to 16 years in prison after pleading guilty to racketeering and admitting he was a leader of a major drug network in Camden.

Thirty-one-year-old Michael “Bute” Rivera pleaded guilty in state court in Camden on Friday.

The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office says that as part of the deal, he faces up to 16 years in federal prison.

Sentencing is scheduled for April 10.

Authorities say Rivera was partners with Noel Gonzalez in running the ring that was among the biggest in Camden. The 44-year-old Gonzalez died of natural causes in 2013.

Thirty-six alleged members were arrested in 2012 and most have now pleaded guilty.
