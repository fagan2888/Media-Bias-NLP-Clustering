One man is dead and Victor McBeath is in custody after a fatal shooting on County Road 101 in Neshoba County, early Wednesday morning.

It's a sentence you'd never want to hear.

"He said I just killed your brother," says Irene Conners-Williams, sister.

Williams peace of mind gone after hearing those words.

"Very evil spirit person you know to do these things," says Williams.

Sheriff Tommy Waddell says they received a 911 call early Wednesday morning, saying shots were fired at a home on County Road 101.

"The 911 call from a third party that was at the residence, that was living at the residence and he escaped and went down the road a short ways and that's when he placed the 911 call," says Waddell.

Officers arrived on the scene, forced their way into the home, that was on fire. Inside they found 83-year-old, Ozie Mcbeath dead. After the officers were able to put out the fire, 23-year-old Victor Mcbeath was found in the woods near the home and taken into custody for killing his step-father.

"It's still under investigation. We've got a lot of work to do. We do believe that we have the murder weapon, which is going to be shotgun," says Waddell.

Waddell says the shotgun gauge and the size of the shell found in the Mcbeath's back bedroom match. It was sent to Mississippi crime lab for investigation. Waddell says Mcbeath is a habitual offender previously charged with drug violations.

"He was a troubled person, but there's no reason he should have shot him. It's just so sad that he would do something to someone that has always been there for him," says Williams.
