But that\u2019s over 10 years and covers more than just the previously uninsured.\n\nFULL QUESTION\n\nI saw an article in the Daily Mail online edition that claims there is an updated CBO report that says Obamacare will cost taxpayers $50,000 for every person who is insured. Is that accurate?\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nMany readers have been asking us about a viral claim that the Affordable Care Act will cost $50,000 per insured person \u2014 or $50,000 per person, period, as some headlines on conservative sites say. The claim appears to have originated in a Jan. 26 article in the British tabloid the Daily Mail. That article says: \u201cIt will cost the federal government \u2013 taxpayers, that is \u2013 $50,000 for every person who gets health insurance under the Obamacare law, the Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what the CBO said. Instead, the Daily Mail takes the CBO\u2019s Jan. 26 budget report and does its own calculation on the numbers.\n\nThe CBO presented its updated estimates on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s costs and impact on insurance coverage in a 15-page appendix. It estimated that the total net cost of the insurance coverage provisions of the law would be $1.35 trillion over 10 years, from 2016 through 2025. This net cost includes gross costs of $1.993 trillion, which includes spending on subsidies for insurance obtained through the exchanges, tax credits to small businesses and expanded Medicaid coverage, minus revenues of $643 billion, which includes penalty payments from those who don\u2019t obtain insurance and employers who don\u2019t provide it.\n\nThe CBO also estimated that \u201cthe annual number of uninsured is expected to \u2026 [be] between 24 million and 27 million fewer than would have been uninsured in the law\u2019s absence.\u201d In order to derive the \u201c$50,000 in taxpayer money for every American who gets health insurance,\u201d the Daily Mail divides the 10-year net cost, $1.35 trillion, by the annual number of people who gained insurance under the law, 27 million.\n\nComparing the 10-year cost of the program to a one-year number of those who will gain insurance is illogical, however. The director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, Gerald Kominski, told us that kind of calculation amounts to \u201ccrazy math.\u201d\n\nAlso, the spending related to the law doesn\u2019t only go toward those gaining health insurance, as the Daily Mail\u2018s math suggests. As the CBO writes, the nearly $2 trillion (gross) that will be spent in the next 10 years is \u201cfor subsidies for insurance obtained through the exchanges and related spending and revenues, for Medicaid and CHIP, and for tax credits for small employers.\u201d The CBO estimates that 27 million fewer people will be uninsured in 2020 under the law, compared with what would have been the case without the ACA, but 34 million would get either subsidized insurance on the exchanges or coverage through Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nIn the more immediate future, CBO expects 16 million to get subsidies in 2016 and 13 million to gain Medicaid/CHIP coverage. The spending on those individuals, however, is expected to be close to $5,000 per person that year, without accounting for any revenue from the ACA. The CBO estimates that the 16 million getting subsidies for exchange health policies in 2016 would get an average subsidy of $4,700, and the $64 billion spent on Medicaid and CHIP that year comes out to $4,923 per new Medicaid enrollee.\n\nWhether subsidizing health insurance for people other than those previously uninsured is a worthwhile government expense is a matter of opinion, of course. But readers should know that the law\u2019s spending goes beyond the uninsured.\n\nFinally, the Daily Mail article laments the \u201cstunning\u201d spending figures from the \u201cbombshell\u201d report, but the CBO\u2019s latest spending projections are in fact downward revisions of previous estimates.\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Jan. 26: Compared with the projection from last April, which spanned the 2015\u20132024 period, the current projection represents a downward revision in the net costs of those provisions of $101 billion over those 10 years, or a reduction of about 7 percent. And compared with the projection made by CBO and JCT in March 2010, just before the ACA was enacted, the current estimate represents a downward revision in the net costs of those provisions of $139 billion \u2014 or 20 percent \u2014 for the five-year period ending in 2019, the last year of the 10-year budget window used in that original estimate.\n\nKominski stressed to us that while the costs associated with the ACA are not insignificant, they are a small portion of total national health expenditures in the United States. In 2013 alone, national health spending totaled $2.9 trillion, more than double the 10-year net cost of the ACA. The nation\u2019s total spending for that year amounted to $9,255 per person.\n\n\u2014 Alexander Nacht\n\nSources\n\nBeattie, James. \u201cCBO: Obamacare To Cost $50,000 Per Person.\u201d Western Journalism. 27 Jan 2015.\n\nMartosko, David. \u201cObamacare program costs $50,000 in taxpayer money for every American who gets health insurance, says bombshell budget report.\u201d Daily Mail. 26 Jan 2015.\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \u201cThe Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025.\u201d 26 Jan 2015.\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \u201cAppendix B: Updated Estimates of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d 26 Jan 2015.\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \u201cUpdated Estimates of the Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act, April 2014.\u201d 14 April 2014.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In 2013 alone, national health spending totaled $2.9 trillion, more than double the 10-year net cost of the ACA.\n\u201cObamacare program costs $50,000 in taxpayer money for every American who gets health insurance, says bombshell budget report.\u201d Daily Mail.\nWhether subsidizing health insurance for people other than those previously uninsured is a worthwhile government expense is a matter of opinion, of course.\nThe CBO presented its updated estimates on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s costs and impact on insurance coverage in a 15-page appendix.\nKominski stressed to us that while the costs associated with the ACA are not insignificant, they are a small portion of total national health expenditures in the United States."}
