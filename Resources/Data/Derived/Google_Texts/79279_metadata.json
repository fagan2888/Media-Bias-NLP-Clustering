However, as Carolyn Boteler, President of Tempstaff, told us recently, the company definitely qualifies as a major Mississippi employer.\n\n\u201cWe issued about 4,200 W-2\u2019s last year,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of our growth, and we consider Tempstaff to be the top staffing company in Mississippi.\u201d\n\nCarolyn came to her entrepreneurial journey in a slightly different way than many do, who start companies and build them from scratch.\n\n\u201cI was working for the company that became Tempstaff,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I did pretty well at the job, because the owner at the time offered to sell me the company when he decided to do other things. So I bought it, and he even helped me with the financing.\u201d\n\nThat has propelled Carolyn not only to the top of the staffing world in Mississippi, but also makes her the owner of one of Mississippi\u2019s top woman-owned businesses.\n\nBorn and raised in Mississippi, she told us she lived a very \u201csheltered life\u201d in Florence growing up. After working for Allstate, she eventually landed a job at the staffing company that would become hers down the road, and has never looked back.\n\nToday, the company is organized into 4 different divisions: basic office support; light industrial; professional placement; and advanced office support. Tempstaff was originally incorporated in 1981 and aside from the bump that everyone experienced during the housing and financial crisis, which had a major impact on jobs at all levels, the company has grown and progressed in a remarkable manner through the years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a great management team, most of whom have been with me for more than 10 years. We\u2019ve build really great relationships through the years, and today, our customers have learned to trust us to make the right hiring decisions for their needs.\u201d\n\nShe points out that no business can stay on top \u201cwithout paying attention to doing things right\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have a simple goal: to be the best at what we do,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s a challenge, and our business is definitely about multi-tasking.\u201d\n\nCarolyn loves Mississippi and can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.\n\n\u201cI love the people of our state,\u201d she said. \u201cThe quality of life is really great, and people care about each other.\u201d\n\nAs have many companies these days, Tempstaff has switched to an online-based application process.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we have taken people out of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll still interview with one of our staffing supervisors before you\u2019re placed in a position.\u201d\n\nTempstaff also conducts background and reference checks, along with a drug test, skills evaluation, and a full orientation process. These are just some of the basics that Carolyn considers essential in order to match the right candidates with the right positions.\n\nOf course, life isn\u2019t all sweetness and light, and Carolyn points to the challenge to hers and similar businesses, that have come as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe decided to play ball on that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a challenging and expensive process to meet all of the compliance and regulatory requirements.\u201d\n\nFrom her perspective, Obamacare was definitely \u201cnot designed for restaurants, retailers, and staffing companies\u201d.\n\nHer other challenge these days is dealing with what she sees as a \u201clabor shortage\u201d, particularly in the skilled labor areas.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to become acute as the baby boom generation retires,\u201d she suggested. \u201cThere simply aren\u2019t enough folks coming up who can do some of those jobs, particularly in the skilled sense.\u201d\n\nOne thing is for certain: with her experience, determination, and enthusiasm, if the people can be found, Carolyn will find them. And that has made her one of Mississippi\u2019s top women entrepreneurs.\n\nA short video featuring Carolyn can be seen on our website, MSBusiness.com, or on our YouTube channel, mbjournal.\n\n\u00bb Contact Mississippi Business Journal publisher Alan Turner at alan.turner@msbusiness.com or (601) 364-1021.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "f you ask the typical Mississippi businessperson to name the state\u2019s largest employers, it\u2019s lik...", "title": "ALAN TURNER \u2014\u00a0Carolyn Boteler of Tempstaff: One of  Mississippi\u2019s premier women entrepreneurs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/entrepreneur-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T08:24:10-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/10/alan-turner-carolyn-boteler-of-tempstaff-one-of-mississippis-premier-women-entrepreneurs/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Columns", "tag": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-10-08T09:08:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T08:24:10-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you ask the typical Mississippi businessperson to name the state\u2019s largest employers, it\u2019s likely that very few would include Tempstaff on the list.\u00a0 However, as Carolyn Boteler, President of Tempstaff, told us recently, the company definitely qualifies as a major Mississippi employer. \u201cWe issued about 4,200 W-2\u2019s last year,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re really proud ...", "creator": "@mbjournal", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/entrepreneur-e1444312971753.jpg", "title": "ALAN TURNER \u2014\u00a0Carolyn Boteler of Tempstaff: One of Mississippi\u2019s premier women entrepreneurs - Mississippi Business Journal", "site": "@mbjournal", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4"}, "article_summary": "However, as Carolyn Boteler, President of Tempstaff, told us recently, the company definitely qualifies as a major Mississippi employer.\nAfter working for Allstate, she eventually landed a job at the staffing company that would become hers down the road, and has never looked back.\n\u201cThe quality of life is really great, and people care about each other.\u201dAs have many companies these days, Tempstaff has switched to an online-based application process.\nThese are just some of the basics that Carolyn considers essential in order to match the right candidates with the right positions.\nA short video featuring Carolyn can be seen on our website, MSBusiness.com, or on our YouTube channel, mbjournal."}
