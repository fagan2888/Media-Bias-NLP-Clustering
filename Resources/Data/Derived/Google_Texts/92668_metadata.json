year.\n\n\n\nSince Nov. 15, HealthCare.gov has made few headlines except when the Obama administration touts its number of sign-ups so far.\n\n\n\nIt's a far cry from last fall, when the enrollment portal melted down and cast doubt on the future of the new system.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at ObamaCare enrollment, then and now.\n\n\n\nThen: Obama blames traffic for glitches on Oct. 1\n\n\n\nNow: Obama touts 'improved' HealthCare.gov\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration was focused on ending the government shutdown when HealthCare.gov debuted on Oct. 1, 2013.\n\n\n\nThe political brinksmanship that consumed Washington's attention drew focus from the website's massive flaws for several weeks.\n\n\n\nSlowly, intelligence from insurance companies, computer scientists and consumers began to shed light on the extent of the site's problems.\n\n\n\nAnalyses pointed to deep structural issues that could take millions of lines of rewritten code to fix.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged on Oct. 1 that the system would face glitches, but he initially blamed the problems on unexpectedly high traffic.\n\n\n\nThis year, after months of repairs, HealthCare.gov relaunched and passed its first major deadline with only very minor glitches on the front end.\n\n\n\nWhile insurers still complain that the back end needs work, Obama was able to tout the site's functioning on its first day back online.\n\n\n\n\"We've spent the last year improving and upgrading HealthCare.gov, to make it faster and easier to use,\" he said in a weekly address.\n\n\n\nThen: Six people signed up on Oct. 1\n\n\n\nNow: 100K new applications on Nov. 15\n\n\n\nOver the month of October 2013, it became apparent that HealthCare.gov was thwarting most users as they sought to apply for coverage.\n\n\n\nOn Oct. 31, House Republicans released an internal administration memo that revealed just how bad the picture was.\n\n\n\nOnly six people had successfully selected plans during the system's first day online, according to the notes from the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight.\n\n\n\nThis year, more than 100,000 people submitted applications for health plans on Nov. 15, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\n\n\nThen: Sebelius: 'I don't know' number of ObamaCare enrollees\n\nNow: HHS: Nearly 500K enrolled in the first week\n\n\n\nFormer HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Kathleen SebeliusFighting for assisted living facilities The chaotic fight for ObamaCare California exchange CEO: Insurers \u2018throwing ObamaCare under the bus\u2019 MORE became the butt of jokes on Oct. 7, 2013 when she told comedian Jon Stewart that she didn't know how many people had signed up for ObamaCare.\n\n\n\nThe department was under heavy pressure to reveal more statistics about the site, and to critics, Sebelius's remark signaled that the calls were falling on deaf ears.\n\n\n\nHHS eventually became more forthcoming with its data, but the initial silence contributed to longstanding tensions between the department and the press.\n\n\n\nEnrollment figures have are much more public this year, with HHS releasing weekly and monthly reports.\n\n\n\nBurwell is taking public pains to improve the department's \"culture of transparency,\" especially after Republicans revealed that HHS miscounted 400,000 health plans last spring.\n\n\n\nThen: Poll: More hold unfavorable view of ObamaCare\n\n\n\nNow: Poll: Half dislike ObamaCare\n\nNot everything about ObamaCare's rollout has improved this year.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for the administration, the law still remains largely unpopular with the public.\n\n\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Nov. 1, 2013 found that 44 percent held an unfavorable view of the law while 38 held a favorable view.\n\n\n\nIn December 2014, the picture had not shifted much: nearly 50 percent dislike the law while 41 percent support it.\n\n\n\nA separate Gallup poll from November found that only 37 percent support the Affordable Care Act, a new low for the survey.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "There's no doubt about it: ObamaCare enrollment is going
