I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to believe that\u2019s not true in some part.\u201d\n\nSerpas, the former police superintendent in New Orleans, who has also served as police chief in Nashville and Washington state, dismisses the Ferguson effect theory.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence that officers are rolling up in a fetal position and afraid to do their jobs,\u201d Serpas said. \u201cAre there some police and departments that feel way? You can\u2019t exclude that possibility. But the concept that police are being watched by the public did not explode in 2015. It\u2019s a bit insulting to say the business of policing would stop because police are being observed by the public, because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing with since we started 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nOfficers \u2018Not Deterred\u2019\n\nTo make his point, Serpas says the advent of dash cam video cameras on police vehicles occurred during his career as police chief. But more recently, police departments are adopting body-worn cameras for officers, and citizens have become emboldened to capture interactions with police on their phones.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, T.J. Smith, the director of media relations for the Baltimore Police Department, rejected the idea that the department\u2019s officers are reluctant to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cOur officers are not deterred\u2014absolutely not,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey are still putting themselves in harm\u2019s way, and many officers get offended, given that some people are saying they are deterred.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Baltimore police union, meanwhile, has said that some officers have reported being afraid to do their jobs since six of their peers were charged in Gray\u2019s death.\n\nStill, Smith called the city\u2019s 2015 murder rate an \u201canomaly,\u201d noting that killings were on pace with recent years in the early months of the year before the unrest in April.\n\nGun Violence\n\nSmith does not tie the sudden rise in murders to outrage over Gray\u2019s death.\n\nInstead, like other cities such as Chicago, which had the most homicides of all U.S. cities in 2015, Smith says that police are finding more illegal weapons with high-capacity magazines.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s officers seized 30 percent more illegal guns than last year. The Baltimore Sun reports that gun violence, including nonfatal shootings, increased more than 75 percent in the city compared to last year, with more than 900 people shot. More than 2,900 people were shot in Chicago in 2015.\n\nJeffrey Ian Ross, a University of Baltimore criminologist, says most gun violence today is related to drugs and gang activity.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of it is connected to drugs and gangs,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s control of territory, markets, competition inside gangs for leadership control and also among rivals, keeping them at bay. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in most cities experiencing an increase in murder and violent crime.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St.Louis criminologist, believes that drugs are driving violent crime, specifically over heightened demand for heroin.\n\n\u201cI am convinced some of the increase [in homicides] is due to drug market expansion, and we have to hope, like the crack-cocaine epidemic, this is short-lived,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cOn the drug user side, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a need for more treatment. On the violent crime supply side, it\u2019s not clear to me what police can do that they\u2019re not already doing.\u201d\n\nCriminal justice reform proposals in Congress would allow low- or medium-risk offenders to earn time off their prison sentences if they participate in drug rehabilitation programs.\n\nEngaging the Community\n\nSmith of the Baltimore Police says the department is taking action to stem violent crime.\n\nThe department is working with federal law enforcement agencies to go after gun traffickers, and the new Baltimore Police Commissioner, Kevin Davis, has said he wants the legislature to make possession of an illegal firearm a felony.\n\nTo engage more closely with the community, Smith says the department is launching a \u201chistory of Baltimore\u201d program this year, where officers beginning with the police academy will take part in a curriculum to learn about the city\u2019s churches, neighborhoods, and other offerings.\n\nSimilarly, starting with police recruits, Smith says the department will pair officers with a community member \u201cto learn how literally to walk and talk and engage in conversation\u201d with a specific neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe are confident in the direction we\u2019re heading with building community relations,\u201d Smith said. \u201cJust doing foot patrol is not enough. It\u2019s doing foot patrol that is not tactical in nature, where we\u2019re just out and have a conversation with the community.\u201d\n\nBy improving training, holding police accountable and bolstering trust with the community, the hope is that witnesses to crimes will report what they see so prosecutors can bring charges against a suspect.\n\nThe Sun reports that Baltimore has closed barely 30 percent of its homicide cases from 2015.\n\n\u201cThere are some parts of the country ruined by drugs and crime where they need a proactive police force,\u201d said Serpas, the former police chief. \u201cBut the ultimate goal for police should be their guardian role, which I have always believed in.\u201d\n\nSerpas explained:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2015 year in crime was marked by a sharp rise in murder rates in many U.S. cities, although crime declined overall.
