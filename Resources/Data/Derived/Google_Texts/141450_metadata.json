Los Angeles. Austin. Asheville. Wait, what? That's right, Asheville, North Carolina, can now join the ranks of cities that have chosen to move beyond coal. On Tuesday night the city council voted UNANIMOUSLY to move the city from coal-fired electricity toward a clean energy future. I was just in Asheville in July with my new friend Ian Somerhalder (of TV's \"Vampire Diaries\" fame) to speak at a rally where hundreds of people gathered to urge the city to invest in clean energy. Here's video from that rally.\"\n\n\n\nActivists Across PA Join Global Monsanto Protest, Could Help Achieve Statewide GMO Labeling\u2014by ProgressivePatriotPA: \"A small fraction of the states in our union are seemingly on the verge of requiring GE foods to be labeled as such, and while Pennsylvania isn't as close to passing ours as they are, we have our own statewide proposal that is steadily gaining momentum. To be able to know and choose what we put into our bodies ought to be a human right. Of course, if all these activists that came crawling out of the woodwork in PA to join the worldwide Monsanto protest also hit the streets for the political campaigns of candidates that support their position on GE food labeling, that momentum could culminate in enacted law a lot sooner than it otherwise would.\"\n\nThis Week in Freewayblogging\u2014by freewayblogger: \"Lately the trend in freewayblogging has been back to the basics: \"Save the Planet\" and \"Save the Earth\" signs in bold fonts like Impact, Arial and Cooper Black. While future sociologists may interpret this as a sign of heightened societal urgency - a sort of artistic/semiotic supplication or existential pleading - it could also be that I found a bunch of moving boxes. I passed by this sign - up for over two weeks now by LAX - on my way to San Francisco.\"\n\nClimate Chaos\n\nPower Shift: Youth Activism and Hope for the Future \u2014by: \"It is 8:00 on a Monday morning, and I sit in the Pittsburgh Airport, waiting to fly back home to Milwaukee after an amazing weekend at Power Shift, a massive environmental conference focussed on youth engagement. Last Monday, I had no idea I would be here. On Tuesday, organizers at the Sierra Club and 350.org contacted me, hoping that the Overpass Light Brigade could be a part of their closing keynote ceremony. 'The Light Brigades,' one organizer told me, 'are the most exciting things happening in grassroots activism, and we want you to be a part of this event!' [...] There were numerous fantastic speakers. After Bill McKibben's earnest articulation of urgency, the lights went down. The Reverend Lennox Yearwood, head of the Hip Hop Caucus and collaborator with 350.org, introduced an OLB video. The arena went dark and our Letter To The President, created late last winter by Minnesota film maker Dusan Harminc began.\"\n\nWe Must Stay on the Path to Clean Air\u2014by SenatorBoxer: \"The battle is on. The Obama administration is moving to clean up dangerous pollution from coal-fired plants and other sources. Many in Congress will fight this. Reducing conventional air pollutants and carbon pollution go hand in hand and we must stand with the President and support his leadership on these issues. And we must also note that the Keystone XL pipeline is not without problems. It will carry the dirtiest oil known to man through our country. Environmental safeguards are not only good for public health, but they are also good for the economy. Over the last 40 years, air pollution has dropped 68 percent, while our national GDP has grown 212 percent. And for every dollar we invest in complying with the Clean Air Act, we get more than $40 of benefits in return.\"\n\nWhen will your City's \"climate departure\" occur? For NYC & DC estimate is 2047\u2014by Lefty Coaster: \"This is sobering news on what climate change holds in store in the near future for when particular cities and regions are expected to be wrenched our of historic norms our stable climate we have known since our species emerged on this planet. We now have a rough timetable of when a particular locale or megalopolis will experience their \"climate departure\" and begin the long process of a climatic regression to a distant prior age when our planet had CO2 levels similar to the massive economic/energy experiment our species has embarked on that is altering the basic makeup of our atmosphere and the chemistry of our Oceans. Two very big factors in out planetary environment we all share.\"\n\nThe cost of carbon: Join over 18 million as they face reality\u2014by VL Baker: \"We are now into the 24 hours of reality: The cost of carbon.

The letter is a litany of the familiar objections raised by financial institutions and endowments to the idea of divestment: that seeking social ends will cost them money; that divestment reduces their investment options; that, rather than ostracize them, they prefer engagement with fossil fuel companies to \u201cencourage them to become a positive force.\u201d But Faust also breaks new ground with a novel rhetorical contortion by claiming Harvard will not be divesting because\u2026academic freedom!\"\n\nEnergy\n\nHow Long Did It Take Tesoro to Leak 865,000 Gallons of ND Oil?\u2014by dweb8231: \"I don't know about you, but my sense is that 865,000 gallons of oil covering seven acres of land is a big deal. This story obviously is not something the oil or pipeline industries want to publicize, especially given the interest in the proposal to construct the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the US Gulf to feed US refineries with Alberta Tar Sands Oil.\"\n\nMore Fun With Shale Jobs Numbers in Pennsylvania\u2014by ThirdandState: \"Last week, the Marcellus Shale Coalition trumpeted a new claim on the shale drilling industry's positive impact on Pennsylvania jobs: Raymond James analysts crunched the numbers, and between 2005 and 2012 almost 90 percent of the job growth in Pennsylvania at that time came from oil and gas jobs ... That\u2019s the highest percentage of any state, according to analysts Pavel Molchanov and J. Marshall Adkins, who based the math off data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As meaningless statistics go, this is one of the more meaningless. Here's why: Since 2005, many states, including Pennsylvania, have created few jobs overall. Pennsylvania averaged 5,704,000 jobs in the 12 months of 2005 versus 5,746,000 for the 12 months ending August 2013 \u2014 a 42,000 increase. Given this small increase in the overall number of jobs, it doesn't take a lot of shale jobs to account for a high percentage of this increase. In other words, 90% sounds like a lot (leaving aside whether the 90% claim is even accurate), but 90% of a small number is, well, a small number.\"\n\nAn argument for fusion\u2014by Frank Paine: \"Last weekend, I bumped into Senator Markey at a charity event. I asked him a question about Hydrogen Fusion research funding at MIT, which had been cut again because of sequestration. He commented that the Department of Energy does not want to fund fusion research. I also contacted with a small independent fusion research team based in New Jersey called Lawrenceville Plasma Physics. Their response after sharing the funding link was DOE has a policy of not funding fusion research. MIT'\u0099s research lab is top in the nation and can not get funding while small independent teams won't apply for grants. The Department of Energy Portal doesn't list fusion! Doesn't this contradict the Obama administration \"all of the above\" focus on energy?\"\n\nRenewables\n\nMA Voters Keep Rejecting Wind Turbine Restrictions\u2014by TheGreenMiles: \"It's happened again, this time in Plymouth. Once again, an effort to limit wind turbines was put before voters, citing hazy \"health\" concerns, and once again clean energy has won in a landslide. The Plymouth Town Meeting on Saturday rejected a de facto ban on new wind turbines. [...] The Plymouth vote comes on the heels of similar election results over the last few months in the nearby towns of Fairhaven and Falmouth. Falmouth elected officials put a plan to tear down the town's wind turbines before voters, who rejected it by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. And in Fairhaven, voters chose a pro-reality candidate for Board of Health over an turbine hysteria candidate, also by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.\"\n\nGOOD NEWS: Ann Arbor City Council Passes Resolution to Divest Retirement Fund of Fossil Fuels\u2014by peregrine kate: \"[T]he resolution was taken up for discussion, and PASSED by a vote of 9-2. This makes Ann Arbor among the first dozen or so municipalities in the U.S. to take such a step. Now, there were some changes introduced to the resolution which could have the effect of watering it down, or delaying implementation. As the Ann Arbor Chronicle reports, language requiring immediate action has been deleted, and language that \"urges\" the board to take action has been replaced by 'requests.'\"\n\nHow to Build a Clean-Energy Future\u2014by Michael Brune: \"By now, we know what to expect if we fail to act on climate disruption: more severe storms, wildfires, droughts, and destruction. To avoid that future, we have to make stopping carbon pollution a priority. But at the same time, people are also realizing that this is more than an urgent challenge -- it's a fantastic opportunity. We have the chance to do something that's never been done: build a society that is 100 percent powered by clean energy. Instead of being daunted, we should be thrilled. [...] To reach that future, we (and the president) need to do more than move beyond dirty fuels like coal, gas, and oil. We need to move beyond pessimism -- the kind of thinking that limits our ambition and our willingness to fight for big ideas.\"\n\nUtility Transition\u2014by gmoke: \"The second largest utility in Germany, RWE, says, \"\u2026we will position ourselves as a project enabler and operator, and system integrator of renewables.\" RWE is based in Essen, Germany and provides 50,000 MW of electricity generated from coal, oil, and gas-fired plants to 24 million customers throughout Europe.

Maybe TransCanada has never seen a recumbent trike before and thought it was a real rocket? The irony, of course, is it is actually TransCanada and the tar sands industrial complex\u2014blinded by the disease of greed -- that are terrorizing life on Earth through their lethal exploitation of Canadian tar sands and the construction of Keystone XL's 485-mile southern leg in Texas and Oklahoma. This is a common tactic used by guilty parties: Dishonestly accuse others of what they themselves are actually doing to deflect attention from their own sordid acts.\"\n\nFor the Koch brothers: Possible $100 billion in tar sands profit if Keystone XL pipeline is approved\u2014by Meteor Blades: \"Authors of a 40-page report by the liberal think-tank International Forum on Globalization have concluded that the billionaire duo, David and Charles Koch, stand to make as much as $100 billion in profits from their holdings in the tar sands of Alberta if President Obama approves the Keystone XL pipeline. Because it would cross the boundary between Canada and the United States, the pipeline, which would connect the tar sands to refineries on the Texas gulf coast, requires a presidential permit based on U.S. national interest. Given the mandates of the review process, a decision isn't likely until early 2014.\"\n\nThe Great Outdoors\n\nLast Most Beautiful Moment in Nature\u2014by erratic: \"It's been awhile since I've done one of these, partly because there haven't been many for me recently, but a few days back I stopped on the way back from the dentist for a run along the Potomac River, and had an amazing one. Before I get into it, for those who are new to the series, what was your last most beautiful moment? It's easy to get caught up in all the Things That Are Going Wrong, And Are Not As They Should Be. I still hope that one day all the headlines will read \"Everything's fixed! Things are great!\", but that seems statistically unlikely. Which it's why it's important to sometimes celebrate the moments of beauty that we experience. I love trail running in nature. I don't like running on roads or sidewalks or paved trails. Give me a curving trail of hard-packed dirt through nature, jumping fallen logs and weaving through trees, along stream banks, and I'm in bliss. I don't have that near me right now, and have not been exercising much the last few months, but a few days back everything came together and dropped me on a trail from Carderock, along the Potomac, downstream of Mather Gorge.\"\n\nMorning Open Thread - Restoring the Atleo River\u2014by Joy of Fishes.\n\nEco-Related DC & State Politics\n\nWhich 12 Dems Voted Against Protecting Environmental Review for Water Projects?\u2014by Liberty Equality Fraternity and Trees: \"Today, in a nearly unanimous vote, the House passed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, which authorized waterways and port projects across the country. Many Democrats expressed their concerns about how the bill could weaken environmental protections, but they voted for it anyway. Numerous amendments were proposed, but I'd like to highlight one in particular, the one that addressed the problem noted above. Rep. Pete DeFazio (OR-04) proposed an amendment to delay the streamlined environmental review process until the backlog of projects falls to less than $20 billion from its current level of about $60 billion.\"\n\nGovernor Brown fails to show for environmental award under pressure from protest\u2014by Dan Bacher: \"Over 60 people, including indigenous leaders, environmentalists and labor activists, gathered at the Le Parc Hotel in San Francisco on Thursday, October 17 from 5:30 to 7 pm to protest the Blue Green Alliance\u2019s honoring of Governor Jerry Brown with its 'Right Stuff' Award. Faced with the protest condemning his anti-environmental policies, Brown apparently decided to back out from receiving the award. In particular, the protest focused on Brown\u2019s support for fracking, a massive twin tunnels project and his emissions trading scheme.\"\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown\u2019s 10 Worst Environmental Policies\u2014by Dan Bacher: \"Every year, the Apollo Alliance Project of the BlueGreen Alliance Foundation recognizes business, community, environmental and labor leaders for their 'outstanding work in advocating for family-sustaining jobs, clean energy, stronger infrastructure, and a better future for all of us.' This year, they selected Governor Jerry Brown as a winner in the government category. (http://www.bluegreenalliance.org/....) Outraged over the selection of Brown for the award after he has advanced so many bad environmental policies such as promoting fracking, a coalition of environmentalists, indigenous leaders and labor activists organized the protest to expose the real, abysmal environmental record of Governor Brown. [...] Brown's ten worst environmental policies were outlined in an alternative program that protesters handed out to attendees of the dinner. [Among them]: California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA): Brown is trying to weaken or even eliminate CEQA, one of California's greatest environmental laws, to fast-track big developments for giant corporations like Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, Valero and Chevron.\"\n\nThe Worst Kind of Government Waste: Promoting Climate Change\u2014by Michael Lux: \"Far worse than simple corporate subsidy waste, though, is when we hand out money to companies to do things that actively harm us. One of the worst examples of this right now is the federal government, through the Export-Import Bank, is directly subsidizing overseas carbon-vomiting coal production. Because Ex-Im is handing out money to extract coal in places like Australia, this doesn\u2019t even create American jobs. Meanwhile, it is going to contribute dramatically to over-heating the planet even faster. It is an obscenity that our government is doing this. The Export-Import Bank, which backs loans to boost US exports abroad, has financed a number of coal projects in the past few years. And this support is growing: Funding for fossil fuel projects has shot up from just under $3 million in fiscal year 2009 to $9.6 billion in 2012. Loans for renewable energy, meanwhile, have barely moved an inch.\"\n\nVitter blocks DOE nominee over delays in NASA's Orion project that have nothing to do with her\u2014by Meteor Blades: \"Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana placed a hold Monday on President Obama's nominee for undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Energy. The nominee, Elizabeth Robinson, is currently the chief financial officer at NASA. Vitter said he's imposed the hold because she has delayed approving contracts for work on the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The contracts would provide 300-600 jobs at the facility, according to Vitter. In fact, budget cuts at NASA that Vitter has raised no objection to are a key element in the delay. The program's developers are also part of the problem.\"\n\nWhy expiring Monsanto Protection Act is huge\u2014by nicteis: \"The Monsanto Protection Act, thankfully allowed to expire in December thanks to Senator Tester and associates, would turn government approval of any particular GM crop into a one-way gate, irreversible in court by discovery of any future harms. It took an article in a recent Nature ('US regulation misses some GM crops') to bring home to me just how wide-open that one way gate currently is. [...] I'm probably in a minority here on dKos, in that I support the development of GM crops in principle. But I agree with the majority that it should be allowed only under the auspices of a precautionary principle\u2014which would have outlawed all the most common GM crops in use today\u2014and not only should GM foods be labeled, they should have each GM 'ingredient' listed, altered gene by altered gene.\"\n\nCritters\n\nThe Daily Bucket - Pssst, Check This Out!\u2014by enhydra lutris: \"Yep, it's that time of year again.

For us it's a tasty healthy treat, for them it's pure energy to fuel growth, reproduction and overwintering.After getting stung by a Yellowjacket last summer, I became very cautious and watchful in all my doings outdoors from then on. We had a particularly bad Yellowjacket season this year because our spring was mild and dry, unlike the last two springs. I'd forgotten how aggressive they can be in the later part of the season! Besides donning full-body protection to pick fruit, I also started paying closer attention to who else was enjoying my blackberries, pears, raspberries, figs and apples. As I watched, I noticed there were changes in the foraging insect populations.\"\n\nStephen Colbert rips into black rhino hunters\u2014by BruinKid: \"Last night, Stephen Colbert tore into the Dallas Safari Club, which is auctioning off a permit to hunt and kill an endangered black rhino in Namibia... in order to \"protect\" the black rhino.

Because of our status as a center for the importing of exotic pets and houseplants from overseas, and our neo-tropical climate, we have been invaded by everything from kudzu plants to Burmese pythons. One of these non-native settlers is the Black-Hooded Parakeet, also known as the Nanday Parakeet or the Nanday Conure. A small parrot, Aratinga nanday is native to Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It's diminutive size, its brash personality and its high intelligence have made it a long favorite in the pet trade\u2014fand that's how it got here. [...] There is no missing a flock of Black-Hooded Parakeets. The birds are about a foot tall, with a two-foot wingspan, and travel low to the ground, in flocks of 20-30. The bright electric-green body with bluish breast and jet-black hood and beak make them conspicuous and unmistakeable, but their loud raucous continuous calls and piercing squawks usually mean you can hear them long before you can see them. Urban Florida is a perfect habitat for the birds. In the wild, they feed on seeds, palm fruits, and flower buds, and prefer habitats at the edges of clearings and in open grasslands. Urban areas, with their parks and suburban lawns, suit them wonderfully. They nest in tree cavities, and have broods of three or four at a time. In their native wild, they are one of the few parrot species that are not in environmental danger. So what is the State of Florida planning to do about the uninvited guests? There's nothing it can do.\"\n\nDawn Chorus: Random Bird Pictures\u2014by matching mole.\n\n\n\nAraneus trifolium?\n\nThe Daily Bucket - Halloween Pumpkin \u2014by: \"Spiders and their webs are everywhere at this time of year.

The full statement is, a common carrier like a train, bus, or plane that running a profit based on passenger revenue while paying its full operating and capital cost is charging too much for its tickets. The radical abbreviation of the title is in part because of the radical abbreviation of the lie that is commonly used as a frame. The lie is that a common carrier like a train, bus or plane that is paying for its full operating and capital costs out of passenger revenue ought to run a profit, commonly expressed as a charge of, \"SERVICE_XYZ is losing money, it needs to be reformed!\", which assumes that Service_XYZ is supposed to be making a profit. And, of course, in the sense described above, if its a common carrier transport service, of course it shouldn't be making a profit.

An updated version was passed in 1970 with the Plant Variety Protection Act which allows farmers to save conventional seeds but not to sell them. (you can copy and burn a CD, but you can't start selling CD's) My response to the GRAIN piece was that it raised legitimate concerns, but breeding has become more sophisticated and resource intensive, the seeds add more value, breeders need to be rewarded properly and their rights protected.\"\n\nMacca's Meatless Monday: Veggie caucus on the hill\u2014by VL Baker: \"Finally some good news coming out of Capital Hill with the formation of the new 'Vegetarian Caucus'. Roll Call breaks the news which was a long time coming. Interest in and membership of the Vegetarian Caucus has exploded in the weeks since the group was profiled in a March 14 article in Roll Call. That was when the 10-member staff organization went public with its quest for better and more diverse vegetarian and vegan options in the eateries scattered throughout the Capitol complex. In the aftermath, 20 staffers, including Dominguez, reached out and joined the caucus\u2019s efforts.\"\n\nStill think Big-Ag is the answer? Read Bittman\u2014by angelajean: \"I've been following [Mark] Bittman's writing since my boys bought me his cookbook, How To Cook Everything, a few years ago. His ideas, as well as his cooking style, matched my own and I've been watching him insert difficult topics into everyday cooking conversations. While he writes about food, he also makes people think about how they eat and what they eat. I hope that he helps people change their approach to food as well. Which is why I want to share his opinion piece with you. I've seen many people on DailyKos argue that we can't feed the world without BigAg. That's exactly the topic that Bittman tackles and he explains very well why we can and must feed the world through 'peasant farming.'\"\n\nMonsanto: Poisoning Argentina & The World\u2014by Joieau: \"Apart from the United States, Argentina has been a world showcase for Chemical/GMO giant Monsanto's one-two punch for establishing industrial agriculture dominance, the pairing of its glyphosate weed-killer 'Roundup' and crop seeds genetically engineered to resist glyphosate poisoning. Known as 'Roundup Ready,' Monsanto has engineered a number of staple food/feed crops including corn, soybeans, sorghum, canola, alfalfa and cotton. The Roundup Ready cultivars became immediately popular in the U.S. due to a food production model relying on extensive monocropping on an industrial scale and a Big-Ag supporting EPA that regulates agricultural chemicals based on cost-benefit analysis. This means the potential of harm to farm workers and other rural dwellers (including deaths, miscarriages, stillbirths and birth defects) is weighed against the presumed benefits to farmers of those chemicals, and routinely comes down on the side of Big-Ag against the health of farmers, farm workers and assorted 'other' rural dwellers. (including all their families).\"\n\nSuperBugs & The GMO Connection\u2014by War on Error: \"I think I can prove a possible connection between Genetically Modified Drugs/Foods and SuperBugs, antibiotic resistance bacterial infections. Bear will me as I present the research to support my conclusion which was inspired by FRONTLINE this week. One of my life teachers taught me 'If you ask the wrong question, you always get the wrong answer.'\"\n\nSaturday Morning Garden Blog Vol. 9.36\u2014by Merry Light: \"Some of my plants are getting ready for the long winter's night, and some are just now perking up. Frankie's cranesbill is a nice contrast with the pansy purple and yellow. Some trees are turning a beautiful red. [...] I also got busy with some winter storage. I put up several jars of pickles, both regular and hot dills, along with all the hot peppers I grew this summer. I also have some squash and pumpkin. I thought I'd try a red kuri, so I got one from the farmer's market, roasted it in the oven, and turned it into a delicious cream soup. I've got a cinderella pumpkin and a kabocha, hanging out in my cool back room waiting to be turned into something yummy.\n\nButterfly Woman\u2014Food Justice Blogathon\n\nButterfly Woman: Announcing the 2013 Blogathon for Food Justice\u2014by Aji: \"I'm honored to announce the launch of this year's annual Daily Kos blogathon to fight hunger in America. This year, we're taking a bit of a different approach: We're focusing on food justice specifically for underserved populations, including those in communities of color, and on local community programs designed to help provide nutritious food raised in sustainable ways. It's a two-fer: fighting hunger while supporting food sovereignty and food justice. We know from the experiences described by Kossacks that national and international efforts at 'feeding the hungry' too often have nothing to do with food justice \u2014 that is, with supporting homegrown efforts in specific communities to ensure food security and food sovereignty for their members. Food justice is a concept that encompasses all of these issues. It's not merely a series of stopgap measures to provide whatever food might be most readily available to people who would otherwise go without at this moment.\"\n\nButterfly Woman: Growing Power, Growing Food and Justice for All\u2014by Growing Power: \"I started Growing Power 20 years ago. As farmer, founder and CEO I travel all over the country and even the world, talking about urban agriculture. I have over 50 years of experience in sustainable agriculture. But I am also committed to dismantling racism in the food system. That\u2019s why we started the Growing Food and Justice for All Initiative. GFJI is a network of activists who are working toward a just food system and world. It works to develop a shared language and common understanding of the historical roots of racism in the United States and how it has impacted our food system. GFJI is leading a critical path toward creating new organizational structures that can end hunger and poverty in our communities.\"\n\nThe Hunger Games: Let\u2019s Stop Shaming the Poor and Start Solving the Problem\u2014by Phaedra Ellis Lamkins: \"There has been an alarming increase in the number of Americans who rely on food stamps\u2014it jumped from 26 million in 2007 to 48 million today. That should be a red flag\u2014not that people are taking advantage of the system, as conservatives seem to think\u2014but that something\u2019s very wrong with our economy. After all, most of those receiving food stamps are children and the elderly. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re feasting\u2014the average benefit in 2012 worked out to $4.45 a day. The assault on food stamps would be appalling enough on its own. But the truth is, it\u2019s just the latest in a series of escalating attacks on the most vulnerable among us. From the crusade against the Affordable Healthcare Act and Medicare to efforts to shrink Social Security, what we\u2019re seeing in Congress these days looks a lot like a war on the poor.\"\n\nFood Justice - Context\u2014by NikkiHenderson: \"The lived experience of those working toward a healthier, just food system is a critical building block of solutions that work. As an Executive Director of a food justice organization in Oakland (CA), I\u2019ve attempted to incorporate my experiences and those of our team into the ways we operate\u2014from our management practices to our community outreach approaches. If I interacted with the grandmother at the 99 Cents store on my way into the office and I arrive with a heavy heart, can I take that feeling and utilize it during our outreach to the housing project across the street? If we all notice 10 year olds at the liquor store, can we use that experience to design our youth programming? This methodology has dramatically impacted our programmatic success, and more significantly, it has supported our team with having a personally sustainable approach to community-based work in the midst of very difficult circumstances.\"\n\nButterfly Woman: Heifer International and Food Justice---Looking Beyond the Cuddly Animals\u2014by Mrs. side pocket: \"Most people who recognize the name Heifer International think of it as 'that group that gives animals.' Those who know a bit more are probably familiar with Heifer\u2019s policy of 'passing on the gift.' When a family receives a gift of livestock from Heifer, it is always with the understanding that the first offspring of that animal will be passed on to another family. When side pocket and I visited Heifer projects in Honduras in 2008, we learned that passing on the gift may take many forms. In one case it was putting the first profits from one\u2019s honey sales back in a revolving loan fund so that the next family could borrow to buy hives. But, it was the passing on of learning that seemed to please people the most. You may not have thought about this, but before a person can receive an animal, she must provide shelter for it, know what it needs nutritionally, maybe even plant a new crop. She must know how to provide medical care if it becomes ill and how to assist it in birthing if necessary. This training may take up to a year before Heifer actually brings in animals. Then, when the offspring are passed on, all the learning is passed on as well. Every recipient becomes a giver and a teacher. This practice reflects Heifer\u2019s concepts of community development that are somewhat countercultural for us, like: 'we can accomplish more if we help each other than if we each try to make it on our own,' and: \u201cwe can\u2019t truly prosper until the whole community prospers and the environment thrives\u201d. Hmm\u2026'\"\n\nButterfly Woman: Healthy Food is Human Right\u2014by Patriot Daily News Clearinghouse: \"There are 50 million people hungry in the U.S., and that includes 17 million children. Nikki Henderson (one of our special guests for our Butterfly Woman Food Justice Blogathon, and Executive Director of People's Grocery in West Oakland) talks about the importance of food justice and cultural appropriateness: Food justice is the belief that healthy food is a human right, so everyone has an inherent right to access healthy, fresh food. Access is a mixture between location, affordability, and cultural appropriateness. Food justice is important for everyone because food is culture. Food is your family. Food is part of how we communicate with one another; it\u2019s a way we share our love. Being able to enjoy and prepare food that actually nourishes the body and keeps us healthy is connected to our ability to stay sane as human beings.\"\n\nHunger in America\u2014by Barbara Lee: \"When I was a single mom in the 1970s, food stamps were a bridge over troubled waters. I would not be where I am today without that vital safety net. In recent years, I\u2019ve participated several times in the SNAP Challenge, in which one lives on $4.50 a day, the food budget of a food stamp recipient. The Challenge is difficult to sustain, fattening due to cheap processed food and unhealthy. I challenge more Members of Congress to see how difficult it is to eat cheaply and healthfully. It boggles the mind that Tea Party Republicans want to cut SNAP benefits during these difficult economic times. I am very proud that Oakland is home to some excellent food justice programs, bringing nutritious food to under-served neighborhoods.\"\n\nButterfly Woman: A Blogathon for Food Justice\u2014Anti-EBT Bigotry\u2014by Denise Oliver Velez: \"As the number of hungry people, and food insecurity has increased, government programs have expanded, and today close to 1 in 6 Americans receive some type of food assistance or supplement. Rather than addressing the real reasons for this, in the wealthiest nation in the world, the right wing noise machine daily fuels anti-food stamp/EBT bigotry, aided and abetted by individuals who spew a continuing stream of hate and misinformation in online comments, on their facebook pages, on youtube, and in their family and social networks. Piling on top of the racist memes of \"welfare queens\", and \"lazy parasitical illegals\" the myths, lies and distortions continue to spread, culminating in our current head of state being labelled as the \"food stamp president\" and bullshit stories of rampant fraud abound. We need to increase our efforts to dispel the myths, and fight back against the lies.\"\n\nButterfly Woman: Food Justice in Indian Country, Even Unto the Seventh Generation\u2014by Aji: \"This is the fourth year in a row that I've participated in the Daily Kos blogathon to fight hunger in America. It's also the fourth year in a row that I've focused my efforts specifically on the concept of food justice in Indian Country. This year, I have the honor of introducing you to a Native-founded, Native-run organization that works specifically to ensure food justice, and food sovereignty, in Native communities. My predecessors in this year's blogathon have done an excellent job of explaining what we mean by 'food justice.' I want to expand the understanding of that concept in the context of specific cultural and historical traditions and ethnic health variations. For our peoples, this is nothing less than an existential issue: Traditional Native foods and foodways are inextricably linked with our cultural identities, but also with our very physical survival. Their near-destruction over the past ~200 years has jeopardized our peoples' survival\u2014and for too many, the destruction is already complete. For we who remain, the risk likewise remains, manifested daily in staggering rates of obesity, diabetes, and other means of death.\"\n\nButterfly Woman: Food-like products are making us sick\u2014by rb137: \"I don't begrudge genuine advances in agriculture. What I detest is the big lie -- the one that tells us that we either support high tech agribusiness or we want to let poor people starve. That leaves Big Ag, Big Pharm, and Big Chemical beyond reproach in all of their practices -- because they produced a necessary solution a century ago. It's time we call this a logical fallacy. [...] We have an image of a wholesome country farm with a proud farmer working hard to feed his community\u2014it appears on packages, in advertisements, and in grocery stores. That is the big lie. What should come to mind is a convergence of Big Ag, Big Pharm, Big Chemical, and Big Energy standing around a lab table stirring a beaker. And if you don't think our food is chemicalized, I challenge you to eat for one week without consuming a single food additive, nutritional isolate, or processed food chemical. MSG, high fructose corn syrup, and trans-fatty acids barely scratch the surface.\"\n\nButterfly Woman: Do We Really Take Care Of Our Own?\u2014by Avila: \"I am my brother's keeper. I am my sister's keeper. These exact words are what I grew up believing, and have never had a reason to doubt. You don't have to go to church, and you don't have to like my \"messenger,\" President Obama. It's very simple: If you're hurting, then I hurt for you. And let's face it, there are more people hurting and hungry today than I can even believe when I look at the data. Roughly 49 million Americans don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from. The Great Recession and its aftermath have provided us with a lot of numbers, and none of them are encouraging.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Every week Daily Kos diarists write dozens of environmentally related posts.
