Early in the conversation, he did a credible Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. I compared him to Rich Little, the impressionist who frequented \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d when Maher\u2019s idol Johnny Carson hosted. Little is an outspoken conservative these days.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s said some nasty things about me in the press,\u201d Maher said. \u201cI\u2019ve upset Rich Little -- my work is done here.\u201d\n\nCompared to a year ago, are you more or less optimistic about the state of the world in general?\n\nMaher: I\u2019m a little more optimistic, despite the fact that it\u2019s been a horrible month for liberals, with the roll-out of the Obamacare website and all those self-inflicted wounds.\n\nBut one story that\u2019s lost in all that is that four polls showed Obamacare is more popular than ever, even with all the (screw)-ups. People are getting it: \u201cHey, we can go to a doctor now. That\u2019s good.\u201d And of course, that\u2019s what the Republicans feared, that people would actually like being able to do that.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s probably positive is that the Tea Party is taking the Republican Party down with it. Virginia is probably one of those states that the Republicans probably could have, and should have, won (in the recent statewide election), but they nominated somebody way too far to the right. Just the way they lost Delaware when my old sparring partner Christine O\u2019Donnell was the (Republican Senate) candidate in 2010.\n\nShe was the witch?\n\nMaher: The witch! I was the one who exposed her as the witch. I had all the old tape from (his former show) \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d where she said, \u201cYes, I used to be a witch.\u201d\n\nPeople forget that videotape doesn\u2019t just degrade.\n\nMaher: What astounds me is that they make statements as if it doesn\u2019t exist ... The Republicans in Congress do it all the time. \u201cWe have you just six months ago saying we should not go into Syria, and now you\u2019re saying we should?\u201d\n\nWhatever Obama does, they have to do the opposite. That\u2019s what I call \u201cblack-tracking.\u201d It is the act of changing your mind because you have found that Obama has agreed with you, and of course, if you agree with him, you get Kenya cooties.\n\nAll that said, you still count yourself as slightly more optimistic than a year ago?\n\nMaher: A year ago, I was scared to death that Mitt Romney was going to be president. I was a million dollars scared. When I look back, it\u2019s, \u201cReally? Mitt Romney? The cure for common charisma as the President of the United States?\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem possible, but of course it was possible.\n\nI feel like the country is actually way more liberal than it seems. If you added in all the people who can\u2019t vote for various reasons, and the people who don\u2019t vote because they\u2019re so discouraged, most of those people would probably vote a progressive point of view.\n\nAnd when you see a state like Virginia, part of the Old South, a very conservative state, turning off to somebody like this Ken Cuccinelli guy (the Republican attorney general and failed gubernatorial candidate), you realize that the country is changing.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s driving them crazy. That\u2019s why, after Obama had been in office for 10 minutes, the first thing he heard was, \u201cWe want our country back.\u201d As if it had gone somewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s the whole montage in their minds: a black president, gay marriage is now legal in a third of the country, two states have voted to legalize marijuana. It\u2019s this whole idea of black, and gay, and drugs, this whole \u201860s dorm room that they are so afraid of, coming to life. And that\u2019s why they get all (excited) about issues like gay marriage that actually have nothing to do with their life.\n\nDid it surprise you how quickly marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington?\n\nMaher: Quickly? I\u2019ve been waiting for it to happen since 1974!\n\nBut from where the conversation was a few years ago \u2026\n\nMaher: It\u2019s sort of the same thing with gay marriage. It\u2019s a tipping point. It\u2019s slow, slow, slow, like a roller coaster, and then when it gets to the top, boom, it goes down quickly.\n\nBILL MAHER What: The unabashedly liberal comedian and host of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d brings his stand-up comedy show to New Orleans. When: Saturday, Nov. 16, 8 p.m. Where: Saenger Theatre, 1111 Canal St., 504.287.0351. Tickets: $48.75 to $78.75 plus service charges through Ticketmaster.\n\nAs soon as gay marriage hit 51 percent approval in the polls, you saw a lot of Democratic politicians very quickly \u201cevolve.\u201d There was a lot of \u201cevolving\u201d when it hit 51. They all used that same excuse: \u201cWell, my kids have gay friends. And they came over to dinner, and they didn\u2019t try to leap over the table and have sex with me, so it must be cool.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re seeing the same thing with marijuana. Tick, tick, tick, and then boom. But what took you so long? I remember having discussions in the dorm room in the \u201870s, saying, \u201cWe know pot is cool. When we get a little older, things will change.\u201d\n\nWell, it took until I was 57. I thought it would be a little sooner than that.\n\nI take it you have your own medical marijuana card in California.\n\nMaher: Absolutely. I have a card to take care of whatever it is I tell them I have.\n\nYour job is stressful.\n\nMaher: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what it is. I\u2019ve been trying to nail that down. It\u2019s stress. That\u2019s why I need it.\n\nHow did the government shutdown affect you personally?\n\nMaher: I don\u2019t think it did. I don\u2019t visit national parks. I\u2019m lucky enough not to be on assistance. So I was one of the many millions of Americans that it did not really affect. But it did affect tens of millions of Americans in a very real way.\n\nAnd this is one of those parts of why I\u2019m a little optimistic. I think the American people finally noticed whose fault it was. When the results came back from polling, there was like a 20-point gap in who they blamed, the Republicans versus Obama. That\u2019s the beginning of maybe electing a Congress that is more workable for Obama, as opposed to the House we have now, which is where all progress goes to die.\n\nWhat is your primary source of news?\n\nMaher: I try to be an omnivore about that. We get the L.A. Times and USA Today and the New York Times. And then I\u2019ll go online and read blogs and the Huffington Post. Anything that I can surf around, click on from one thing to the next. I can spend hours doing that.\n\nAnd sometimes, like everybody else, you want to know, \u201cWhat did fall out of Kim Kardashian\u2019s dress?\u201d\n\nWho is your go-to guest on \u201cReal Time\u201d?\n\nMaher: I\u2019ve learned not to answer that question, because then somebody else who I didn\u2019t mention will say, \u201cI thought I was your favorite guest.\u201d I don\u2019t talk about guests.\n\nBecause of the delicate egos.\n\nMaher: Oh, man, you wouldn\u2019t believe how delicate.\n\nI mostly interview musicians, so I do have some inkling.\n\nMaher: They\u2019re in the biggest bubble of all. Really. It\u2019s close between models and athletes, but musicians, as far as people who live in their own world, they take the cake.\n\nYou still get a charge out of doing stand-up, even without the back-and-forth debates of your TV show.\n\nMaher: It\u2019s so much fun. I wouldn\u2019t do it if I didn\u2019t have a great time doing it. It\u2019s pure, first of all. The television show is a hybrid. It\u2019s funny, hopefully, and serious at times. There\u2019s a panel, and guests.\n\nStand-up, it\u2019s just you and the audience and jokes. The whole point is just to make them laugh very hard for 90 minutes, and then leave to a standing ovation. If you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019re not doing it right.\n\nThe areas that are of interest to me would be familiar to people who watch the \u201cReal Time\u201d show on HBO. But the format is different. Stand-up is about hard, hard laughs. If you\u2019re not doing that, then you\u2019re not a comedian. You\u2019re a humorist, or a commentator, or a professor, or a lecturer, or a speech-giver.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in any of those things. I started as a comedian. And at some point, they will put me out to pasture, as far as TV goes. They do it to everybody. They\u2019re doing it to Leno now. They did it to Carson when he was the biggest star on television. And they\u2019ll do it to me.\n\nI\u2019ve had a 20-year run, which is fantastic, but it\u2019s not going to last forever. And when it ends, I will still have stand-up.\n\nI spoke with Jerry Seinfeld in September, prior to his show at the Saenger Theatre. He\u2019s also way into the craft and art of stand-up. Obviously he doesn\u2019t need the money.\n\nMaher: Well, I do need the money. I\u2019ve got to pay back that million dollars I gave to Obama (during the 2012 campaign, Maher donated $1 million to a pro-Obama SuperPAC). I call this my Making My Million Back Tour.\n\nUnlike Seinfeld\u2019s observational-style show, yours is mostly topical.\n\nMaher: To me, that\u2019s the most fun thing about the kind of stand-up I do. It\u2019s always changing, because the news is always changing.\n\nWhen I was a younger comedian, I was much more of an observational type, talking about evergreen things. That is very hard, because so much of that material has been picked over by the many thousands of comedians who have come before me.\n\nBut politics is always changing. The news is never the same. Whatever I\u2019m talking about in my act today, I can almost guarantee you wasn\u2019t in my act a year ago. People didn\u2019t know who Ted Cruz was a year ago.\n\nIf you see me on a Saturday night and then a Sunday night, it\u2019s going to be basically the same show. But people who have seen me a month or two later will say, \u201cWow, that was a lot of new stuff.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, because a lot happened.\u201d\n\nI generally allow two or three years (between shows in the same city) because I don\u2019t want people to see the same act. I want them to see something completely new.\n\nKeith Spera can be reached at kspera@nola.com or 504.826.3470.
