Ted Cruz\u2019s audacious theory of the 2016 race was supposed to be put to one of its most important tests. Michigan\u2019s primary on Tuesday \u2014 and especially what happens that day in the Detroit suburbs that in 1980 were ground zero for a new political species, \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d \u2014 will answer this question: Can Cruz (R-Tex.) locate and motivate legions of recently nonvoting conservatives, millions of them nationwide, especially whites without college experience, who can be pulled back into voting in numbers sufficient to determine the election in November?\n\nBut the best-laid plans of mice and men and even senators often go awry, and one problem with Cruz\u2019s plan is that it was formulated in olden days, in the world B.D.T. \u2014 Before Donald Trump. Trump, too, is courting this cohort of the disaffected, whose grievances about politicians certainly cannot this year include being ignored by them. But although Trump may bestride the political scene mastodon, Patrick Colbeck and Wendy Day are undaunted.\n\nColbeck, 50, was an engineer with no interest in politics until, six years ago, he did something almost unprecedented even among members of the national legislature: He read the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. He concluded that \u201cthis is about control and has nothing to do with care.\u201d Now he is a Republican state senator, the first Michigan legislator elected from the tea party, and a thorn in the side of the GOP\u2019s legislative leadership on spending and other matters. Which is to say, he is somewhat like Ted Cruz, of whose Michigan campaign Colbeck is chairman.\n\nDay, 43, is the wife of a soldier who has a Purple Heart from two tours in the Middle East, and the mother of a 19-year-old soldier just back from his first deployment, in Kuwait. She was working with war widows before becoming state director of the Cruz campaign because \u201che\u2019s been to Babylon and survived.\u201d Meaning he\u2019s resisted \u201cthe seductive nature of Washington.\u201d Now she travels with a spreadsheet, supplied by Cruz\u2019s national campaign headquarters in Houston, detailing the expected March 8 vote in all of Michigan\u2019s 4,500 precincts and the number of votes Cruz needs to get in each to win the state.\n\nHouston projects that Cruz needs 345,000 of the 1.08 million votes the campaign expects to be cast. Day has on her phone a picture of two of those voters who, with no prompting from the campaign, set up a table outside a tractor supply store to educate voters about Cruz\u2019s enthusiasm for the Second Amendment. Other volunteers held a fundraiser at a gun range to pay for a Cruz billboard.\n\nYes, each such anecdote testifies to Cruz\u2019s ability to energize a passionate cadre, and, yes, as has been said, the plural of \u201canecdote\u201d is \u201cdata.\u201d Today, however, much more than when Winston Churchill said so eight decades ago, \u201cWe have entered the region of mass effects.\u201d In Michigan, as in many of the Super Tuesday states, the Cruz campaign has mounted the most ambitious efforts to create telephone-and-shoe-leather get-out-the-vote operations, all of which strengthen the sinews of American democracy. In its approach to Iowa, the campaign identified 150 clusters of Iowans for special attention, including a group of 60 who signed a petition seeking legalization of the sale of fireworks in the state, a group that received a blessing from Cruz in his libertarian mode.\n\nBut today\u2019s saturation journalism about presidential politics \u2014 and especially the insatiable appetite of television for the garish sights and sounds of Trump, whose campaign consists almost entirely of feeding this appetite \u2014 can raise waves of passion and distraction that wash away more methodical ways of engaging with voters.\n\nA Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll, taken Feb. 14 to 16, after Iowa\u2019s caucuses and New Hampshire\u2019s primary but before South Carolina\u2019s primary and Nevada\u2019s caucuses, presented a microcosm of the GOP\u2019s national problem: Trump led among likely Michigan GOP voters with 25.2 percent, followed by undecided 21.3, Cruz 15, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) 11.8, Ohio Gov. John Kasich 10.5, Ben Carson 9, Jeb Bush 5.3. Trump had the highest unfavorable rating (41.3), but the combined 37.3 percent support of likely voters for the three serious Trump rivals still in the race is too fragmented to derail him. And Kasich, from contiguous Ohio, is targeting Michigan.\n\nMichigan\u2019s primary comes a week \u2014 an eternity \u2014 after Super Tuesday\u2019s 11 primaries altered the political landscape. Michigan is one of the 18 states (and the District of Columbia) \u2014 with 242 electoral votes \u2014 that Republicans have lost in six consecutive presidential elections, so attention must be paid.\n\nRead more from George F.
