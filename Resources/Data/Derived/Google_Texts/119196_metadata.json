And so except by the standard of the remarkable performance of the last year or two, a fluctuation of this kind in historical terms is more like a four-inch snowfall in Boston than it is like a one-foot snowfall in Boston.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there is going to be pressure on a number of major emerging markets. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be an immense story in terms of its direct impacts on the United States, but I do think a number of countries \u2014 Turkey, South Africa for example \u2014 have gotten themselves in very difficult situations because they\u2019ve come to rely on easy money as an alternative to strong policy. And as the world economy grows and as financial conditions change, they\u2019re going to be challenged.\u201d\n\nOn where the U.S. is now in the recovery\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the fall of 2008 was worse than the fall of 1929. The winter of 2009 was worse than the winter of 1930. And what\u2019s followed bears no resemblance to the depression, to what happened between 1930 and 1933. And that\u2019s a tribute to the strong polices that President Obama put into place. I think there are deep concerns about the capacity of our economy to grow rapidly with financial stability. As you point out, growth has been positive. We\u2019ve been growing \u2014 that\u2019s a real achievement. But it hasn\u2019t been at a rate that\u2019s sufficient to re-employee people substantially. It hasn\u2019t been at a rate that enables us to close the gap between the economy\u2019s capacity and its potential.\u201d\n\nOn the need to improve infrastructure in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have been obsessed in recent years by the paper debt we might leave our children \u2014 but debt that carries a 3 percent interest rate. When I think of the burdens that my generation\u2019s going to leave to my children\u2019s generation, it\u2019s not the paper debt that I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s deferred maintenance on a nation\u2019s infrastructure that in too many respects is collapsing. It\u2019s an education deficit of people who used to receive the best educations in the world and now aren\u2019t in the top 20. It\u2019s the debt represented by the fact that we have dipped into all the funds for science and innovation and aren\u2019t maintaining them at the rate we used to at a time when the rest of the world is investing ever more in science and technology. Those are the debts \u2014 and those are debts that incur interest rates and costs much more than the 0 or 3 percent on treasuries. Those are the debts I worry about most.\u201d\n\nOn income inequality in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that inequality is an absolutely central issue. Inequality limits demand in our economy, which holds back economic growth. Inequality distorts the composition of political power and influence. What\u2019s particularly tragic about American inequality is that it is increasingly translating into inequality of opportunity. Since George Washington, the vast majority of Americans have lived better than their parents. America has been a country where there\u2019s been more and more equal opportunity in every generation. And that process has stopped in recent years, and that, I would suggest to you, is unacceptable. We\u2019re never going to completely eliminate inequality \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t want to. Some people work harder, some people are more productive than others. But it is not acceptable that every child in the United States does not have a chance.\u201d\n\nGuest", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former U.S. Treasury Secretary says he's more worried about leaving future generations with work that should be done now.", "application-name": "WBUR: Here and Now", "og": {"site_name": "hereandnow", "description": "The former U.S. Treasury Secretary says he's more worried about leaving future generations with work that should be done now.", "title": "Larry Summers: U.S. \u2018Obsession\u2019 With Paper Debt Is Misguided", "url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/02/11/larry-summers-economy", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2014/02/0211_larry-summers-624x431.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/02/11/larry-summers-economy", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2014/02/0211_larry-summers-624x431.jpg", "site": "@HereAndNow", "card": "summary", "title": "Larry Summers: U.S. 'Obsession' With Paper Debt Is Misguided"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-11", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "Lawrence Summers, who served as economic adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, says that more than any paper debt, he\u2019s worried about leaving future generations with costs of work that should be done now.\nWhen I think of the burdens that my generation\u2019s going to leave to my children\u2019s generation, it\u2019s not the paper debt that I\u2019m worried about.\nBut it hasn\u2019t been at a rate that\u2019s sufficient to re-employee people substantially.\nSummers tells Here & Now\u2019s Jeremy Hobson that with interest rates so low, taking on debt is a better option than deferring infrastructure maintenance or cutting investment in education, science and innovation.\nInterview Highlights: Larry SummersOn volatility in the stock market\u201cIf you look at history in the vast majority of years, markets go down by a few percent several times."}
