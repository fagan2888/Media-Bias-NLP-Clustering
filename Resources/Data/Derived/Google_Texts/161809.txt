Sioux Falls, SD

A multi-million dollar project near the Sioux Empire Mall should ease traffic flow on Louise Avenue and help prevent future flooding in the area.

Crews are widening Solberg Avenue from 49th Street to 57th Street and making a detention pond near I-29 bigger.

It's one of the city's biggest construction projects this summer. When it's finished, Solberg Avenue will go from two lanes to four north of 57th Street and a giant storm sewer detention pond on the southwest side of the Empire Mall will have a bigger capacity.

"I like it. I'm glad it's being increased in size. Very happy," Marlin Westra said.

Westra has managed the South Hampton apartments nearby for 13 years. He's seen flooding in the area twice during that time.

Sioux Falls Principal Engineer Joshua Peterson says these new improvements should fix the issue. Originally, the pond could hold enough runoff to flood 61 football fields in one foot of water.

"We're going to add about 10 more feet to that. So it would be about 71 football fields a foot deep or one football field 71 feet deep," Peterson said.

On top of the pond, the new four-lane road will feature a new traffic light at 49th and Solberg, next to the mall.

"I have waited many minutes to get onto 49th," Westra said.

With a new light and more lanes, Solberg Avenue should become a main corridor on the west side of town.

"It will really help that traffic and maybe take some of that pressure off of Louise which is a very busy street for us," Peterson said.

The $3.5-million project should finish in October.
