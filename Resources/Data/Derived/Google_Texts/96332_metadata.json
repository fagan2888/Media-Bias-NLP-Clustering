The FTC believed that the elimination of competition between ProMedica and St. Luke\u2019s would enhance the merged entity\u2019s ability to obtain supra-competitive reimbursement rates from commercial health plans and their members. The FTC claimed that the transaction would reduce the number of competitors in general acute-care4 inpatient hospital services in Lucas County from four to three, with a combined market share of close to 60%. According to the Commission, the transaction would also reduce the number of competitors in inpatient obstetrical services in Lucas County from three to two, with a combined market share of more than 80%. On March 29, 2011, the district court granted the FTC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and required the hospitals to maintain St. Luke\u2019s as an independent competitor pending completion of the FTC\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter a full administrative trial, the FTC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an Initial Decision on December 5, 2011, agreeing with the FTC staff that the transaction reduced the number of competitors in the market for general acute-care inpatient hospital services from four to three, and would increase ProMedica\u2019s bargaining power with commercial health plans, leading to higher reimbursement rates that would be passed on to the plans\u2019 customers (local employers and their employees). The ALJ did not agree with the staff\u2019s definition of \u201cinpatient obstetrical services\u201d as a separate relevant product market, but on the basis of the expected increase in consumer prices in the general acute-care inpatient hospital services market, he ordered that ProMedica divest St. Luke\u2019s to an FTC-approved buyer within 180 days after the final order.\n\nOn March 22, 2012, the Commission upheld most of the ALJ\u2019s Initial Decision, finding that the merger increased ProMedica\u2019s market share far above the threshold required to create a presumption that the merger would lessen competition. The FTC ruled that ProMedica\u2019s acquisition of St. Luke\u2019s was likely to substantially lessen competition and increase prices for general acute-care inpatient hospital services and inpatient obstetrical services sold to commercial health plans in Lucas County. The FTC\u2019s Opinion defined the relevant market somewhat differently than the ALJ, but noted that \u201cthe outcome of this case is the same whether or not [inpatient obstetrical] services are included in the [general acute-care] inpatient hospital services market \u2026 As the ALJ found, regardless of which market definition is used, market shares and concentration levels exceed the thresholds for presumptive illegality provided in the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines and the case law. Respondent does not dispute this.\u201d\n\nThe FTC rejected ProMedica\u2019s contentions regarding the commercial health plans\u2019 countervailing bargaining power, lack of competitive effects evidence post-transaction, likely repositioning by competitors, and St. Luke\u2019s questionable financial viability. Thus, the Commission agreed with the ALJ and ordered ProMedica to divest St. Luke\u2019s.\n\nThe parties appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit. The appellate court analyzed what it believed to be extensive data considered by the FTC at the administrative level regarding product markets, concluding that the relevant product markets were: (1) a cluster market of primary (but not OB) and secondary inpatient services, and (2) a separate market for OB services. Then the court turned to ProMedica\u2019s arguments that the FTC incorrectly presumed the merger illegal based solely on significantly high market concentration (HHI) levels, contending that such an analysis \u201capplies only in \u2018coordinated-effects\u2019 cases, rather than in \u2018unilateral-effects\u2019 ones.\u201d5 The Sixth Circuit responded by considering ProMedica\u2019s pre-merger market shares and relatively higher price levels, and concluded that ProMedica\u2019s pre-merger bargaining power, coupled with the HHI data, were sufficient for the FTC to apply a presumption of illegality with respect to the merger.\n\nThe court considered the merging parties\u2019 failure to show any efficiencies or benefits to consumers. Though these types of arguments can enable merging parties to overcome the presumption of illegality, the court noted the lack of evidence contrary to the presumption, while declaring that there was \u201ca wide range of evidence\u201d6 supporting the FTC\u2019s views on the merger. Finally, ProMedica\u2019s use of a \u201cweakened firm\u201d defense was identified by the court as a \u201cHail-Mary pass\u201d and, as did the FTC, the court rejected the argument due to St. Luke\u2019s pre-merger increase in market share and \u201csufficient cash reserves.\u201d7\n\nAnalysis\n\nMergers involving hospitals and health care providers remain very much on the radar of federal and state antitrust enforcers, regardless of the size of the transaction or the fact that the merger was not challenged pre-consummation. Moreover, the Pro-Medica decision reconfirms that while a \u201cfailing company\u201d defense to a merger suit rarely succeeds, a \u201csick company\u201d defense has even less of a possibility of success.\n\nRecently, in response to the FTC\u2019s success in the St. Luke\u2019s case, Rep. Jim McDermott asked the Commission to issue additional guidance on potential antitrust issues raised by Affordable Care Act (ACA)-inspired health care mergers.8 As noted in that court\u2019s decision, and by Rep. McDermott, health care organization mergers can be in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act even when they would improve patient outcomes and quality of care -- goals of the ACA. Additional guidance would provide such organizations more clarity as they attempt the coordination encouraged by the ACA.\n\n1 ProMedica Health System, Inc.v. Fed.

The most basic are \u201cprimary services,\u201d such as hernia surgeries, radiology services, and most kinds of inpatient obstetrical (OB) services. \u201cSecondary services,\u201d such as hip replacements and bariatric surgery, require the hospital to have more specialized resources. \u201cTertiary services,\u201d such as brain surgery and treatments for severe burns, require even more specialized resources. And \u201cquaternary services,\u201d such as major organ transplants, require the most specialized resources of all.
