Overall, 3 percent of nonprofits offering health benefits (with 10 or more workers) reported that they elected the accommodation.\n\nAs part of the ACA's preventive services coverage requirement, most employers that offer health insurance are required to include coverage for no-cost contraceptives for women. Houses of worship and other religious institutions whose primary purpose is to spread the faith are exempt from the requirement.\n\nFor other religious-affiliated nonprofit groups, the administration argues that the accommodation creates a generous moral and financial buffer between religious objectors and birth control funding. The nonprofit groups only have to attest that paying for any or all of the 20 devices and methods approved by government regulators would violate their religious beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new analysis from Kaiser Family foundation finds 10 percent of large nonprofits requested accommodation from birth control requirement.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A new analysis from Kaiser Family foundation finds 10 percent of large nonprofits requested accommodation from birth control requirement.", "title": "One in 10 larger nonprofits sought \u2018accommodation\u2019 from Obamacare birth control mandate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/12/01/one-in-10-larger-nonprofits-sought-accommodation-from-obamacare-birth-control-mandate/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2015/12/2015-11-06T191005Z_01_WAS308_RTRIDSP_3_USA-COURT-CONTRACEPTION.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bylenasun"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/12/01/one-in-10-larger-nonprofits-sought-accommodation-from-obamacare-birth-control-mandate/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "birth control, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, contraceptive, Supreme Court, health insurance, employee, ACA, healthcare, provider, Hobby Lobby", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "birth control, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, contraceptive, Supreme Court, health insurance, employee, ACA, healthcare, provider, Hobby Lobby"}, "article_summary": "For other religious-affiliated nonprofit groups, the administration argues that the accommodation creates a generous moral and financial buffer between religious objectors and birth control funding.\nOverall, 3 percent of nonprofits offering health benefits (with 10 or more workers) reported that they elected the accommodation.\n(AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)The Kaiser analysis found that for nonprofits with more than 1,000 employees, 10 percent reported that they had requested an \"accommodation.\"\nThe nonprofit groups only have to attest that paying for any or all of the 20 devices and methods approved by government regulators would violate their religious beliefs.\nHouses of worship and other religious institutions whose primary purpose is to spread the faith are exempt from the requirement."}
