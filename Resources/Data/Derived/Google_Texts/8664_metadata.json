For most people, buying two health insurance policies would be a waste of money, but for a small subset of individuals with medical challenges, having access to a broader network could be lifesaving, even if expensive. (I am assuming no subsidies.) I wanted to know if it is legal to do this under ObamaCare, but no health care policy expert I spoke to knew.\n\nThis post describes my effort to get an answer to this question by telephoning the Maryland exchange.\n\nI called in on Sunday, December 29 at 1:22 pm, and went through a fairly extensive menu. At 1:25 pm an automated voice told me 20 people were ahead of me in line, and my estimated wait time was 120 minutes.\n\nI stayed on hold, listening to the same riff repeatedly, punctuated every five minutes or so with a recommendation that I try the website. The music was rather irritating after 45 minutes, but I assume that's intentional: they understandably hope you will hang up and try the website. Unfortunately, in my case, I already had; the answer to my question wasn't there.\n\nAt 2:51 pm a live person answered the phone to say they were closing, and would take my name, number and reason for calling and they would call me back tomorrow.\n\nWhen I explained why I was calling, the staff person (to her credit) decided to give me an answer immediately because I simply had a question instead of needing help filling out a time-consuming form.\n\nI explained that I simply wanted to know if a person who already had health insurance with a limited network could purchase a second policy, without a subsidy, on the exchange in order to get access to a larger network of health providers.\n\nAt first she was a little confused about my question, and asked if I am on Medicare. I said no, and rephrased my question.\n\nShe then seemed to understand the question, and said no, I could not purchase insurance through the exchange. She explained that the exchange is only for people who do not have a minimum level of insurance \u2013 unless I wanted dental only (I told her I did not).\n\nI noticed some hesitation in her voice, so I politely asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d She replied that the subsidies are only for people who do not have insurance already. I replied that I don\u2019t want a subsidy; I just want to know if I am allowed to purchase at full price a second policy in order to expand my access to additional networks. She expressed surprise, and said that she had never helped a person before who did not want a subsidy (!). In that case, she said, she thought I probably could do it. She said I should try to do it, because she thought the website would let me.\n\nI pointed out \u2013 politely, again, as she was being very polite to me, and probably worked a bit late to help me, besides \u2013 that she did not seem very sure. I asked if she was suggesting that I buy the policy and then try to use it, and if I was prevented from using it, then I would know that I was not allowed to buy it?\n\nShe said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nI have to give full marks to the lady who spoke to me for her politeness and willingness to help, but a definitive answer remains elusive.\n\nStay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/resource/MarylandHealthConnectionLogo1213.jpg?fileId=24148328", "description": "Last week, I described my fruitless effort to determine from the Maryland Health Connection (Obama...", "title": "Can I Buy an Additional Health Insurance Policy Through My ObamaCare Exchange?
