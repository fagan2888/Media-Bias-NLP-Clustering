Clemson would become the first 15-0 FBS champion while Alabama would win its fourth national title in seven seasons.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nClemson QB Deshaun Watson vs. Alabama\u2019s front seven. Watson set the Atlantic Coast Conference mark for total offense with 4,731 yards, 1,032 of those coming on the ground. He\u2019s led Clemson to 10 straight games with 500 or more yards of offense. Watson, though, may not have seen a group like Alabama\u2019s defensive line and linebackers, who had nine sacks in slowing down Mississippi State\u2019s Dak Prescott \u2014 possibly the best dual-threat QB the Tide have faced before Watson.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nAlabama: RB Derrick Henry is the Heisman Trophy winner with 2,061 yards rushing and 25 touchdowns in his first season as the Crimson Tide\u2019s fulltime starter. The rushing yards and touchdowns are SEC records. He surpassed Herschel Walker\u2019s yardage total and the TD mark of Tim Tebow and Tre Mason.\n\nClemson: CB Mackensie Alexander is the leader of the secondary, a lock down corner who usually shadows the opponent\u2019s best receiver. This time, that\u2019s Calvin Ridley of Alabama. Alexander has six pass break ups, but zero interceptions \u2014 mostly because quarterbacks don\u2019t test him much.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nAlabama leads the country with 97 victories since 2008. Clemson has 77 wins in that same span. \u2026 Clemson has never appeared in a No. 1 vs. No. 2 game. \u2026 Alabama has won last 12 meetings with Tigers, the last game between the two a 34-10 win to start the 2008 season. \u2026 Clemson\u2019s three winningest coaches (Frank Howard, Danny Ford, Dabo Swinney) are all graduates of the University of Alabama. \u2026 The Crimson Tide held Michigan State to 239 yards of offense, the 10th time season an opponent been kept below 300 yards. \u2026 Clemson kicker Greg Huegel tied the school\u2019s single-season scoring record of 128 points set by All-American tailback C.J. Spiller in 2009.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alabama-Clemson National Championship capsule", "title": "Alabama-Clemson National Championship capsule", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/10/alabama-clemson-national-championship-capsule/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110_010104_national-championship.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110_010104_national-championship.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T13:04:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:23:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "KEY MATCHUPClemson QB Deshaun Watson vs. Alabama\u2019s front seven.\nClemson would become the first 15-0 FBS champion while Alabama would win its fourth national title in seven seasons.\n\u2026 The Crimson Tide held Michigan State to 239 yards of offense, the 10th time season an opponent been kept below 300 yards.\n1 Clemson (14-0), 8:32 p.m. EST (ESPN) at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.Line: Alabama by 6 1-2.\nWatson set the Atlantic Coast Conference mark for total offense with 4,731 yards, 1,032 of those coming on the ground."}
