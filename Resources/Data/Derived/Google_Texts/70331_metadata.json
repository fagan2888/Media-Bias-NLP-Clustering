She talked with a doctor and a ride engineer, and visited Tampa's Busch Garden with Florida Matters producer Lottie Watts, who takes us for a ride on SheiKra.\n\nThis week on Florida Matters (Tuesday, June 30 at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday, July 5 at 7:30 a.m.), we take a look at the physics and engineering of extreme roller coasters -- and what they do to your insides \u2013 with Jeff Hornick, Director of Design and Engineering at Busch Gardens and Dr. Michael Longley, medical director at Florida Hospital Wesley Chapel, about how to keep that adrenaline rush safe.\n\nJust hearing the CLICK, CLICK, CLICK of a roller coaster car making its ascent makes some of us on the ground break into a cold, cold, cold sweat.\n\nThe heart's racing. And you're queasy. Very, very queasy.\n\nBut what exactly is happening inside those bodies brave enough to be strapped into massive body harnesses so they can head up, up, up\u2026 and very far down in three minutes or less?\n\nA lot, says Dr. Michael Longley, medical director at Florida Hospital Wesley Chapel. Coaster riders experience higher heart rates, tossed internal organs, and a dizzying array of visual images that the brain struggles to process.\n\n\u201cWhen you get over the top of the hill and you\u2019re already accelerating down toward the ground and you start feeling that G-force as that car reaches the bottom of that hill, the body senses a change in motion,\u201d says Longley, an emergency room physician.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s an unfamiliar force and an unfamiliar direction, it automatically sends signals and again you\u2019re going to be releasing adrenalin from your adrenal glands and that will trigger your heart rate.\u201d\n\nWhile the motion gets the heart racing, it\u2019s what the eyes see and the brain receives that causes the not-so-great uneasiness and the real possibility of vertigo, Longley said. The good news is it\u2019s only temporary.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a roller coaster, some of the motion of the train on the tracks is so fast that the brain is actually getting mixed signals,\u201d he said.\n\nJeff Hornick is Director of Design and Engineering at Busch Gardens Tampa, home to seven thrill coasters, including SheiKra, a floorless, diving coaster that reaches 60 miles per hour.\n\nHe says computer simulation models help find the balance between a ride that thrills, but doesn\u2019t kill.\n\n\u201cWe design around what is called the heart line. So whatever design it is, we\u2019re making sure that we are designing right around where your heart is in your chest,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the reason we do that is that we don\u2019t want the blood to rush to your head or to your toes for an extended period of time.\u201d\n\nG-forces \u2013 that fantastic speed coasters are known for \u2013 is only one aspect engineers worry about, Hornick said. The thrills they want to provide can\u2019t come at too dangerous a pace.\n\n\u201cMost of the times you want to have your highs and lows. So you want to have points where you have lots of high Gs, and maybe negative Gs,\u201d said Hornick, who has been involved on designs of many coasters at Busch Gardens, including the soon-to-open Falcon\u2019s Fury. \u201cBut you also want points where you can reset yourself and prepare for the next element.\u201d\n\nThose reset \u2018breaks\u2019 come and go too fast for most riders to notice. But Longley says every inch of the body reacts.\n\n\u201cThose forces are experienced by all of your organs: your brain, your heart, your eyes, your blood vessels, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really don\u2019t get into a lot of trouble until about nine Gs.\u201d\n\nNone of the seven thrill coasters at Busch Gardens reach that extreme level of force \u2013 most are closer to 4 Gs, according to roller coaster fan websites.\n\nBut the rides do have strict height requirements and stern warnings to riders who might be pregnant, or have weakened hearts or back or neck problems \u2013 that litany of warnings you hear as you wait in line. Longley says those who are healthy \u2013 and love the thrill of a coaster \u2013 are good to go.\n\n\u201cThe statistics show that you have a higher chance of a serious injury driving to the amusement park or home from the amusement park than you actually do riding a roller coaster,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, for some people, the adrenalin of just standing in line is too much to take. Longley says the heart rate is usually highest before you get on a ride, or during that initial climb. It\u2019s only human, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really not a whole lot you can do. You can learn to deal with that feeling of the adrenalin. But there\u2019s really not anything you can do about preventing the adrenalin from actually being there,\u201d he said.\n\nThat fear some people feel near coasters can be very real. Hornick said that\u2019s why Busch Gardens designs rides to go near guests who want to keep their feet planted firmly on the ground. That way the less adventurous \u2013 or those too young or short to ride - can enjoy the rush, he said.\n\nPeople who want to overcome that anxiety do have options, Longley said.\n\n\u201cSure, you can overcome that with say, behavioral therapy - just like any other phobia. It\u2019s kind of funny to think of it in terms like that, but it is actually a sort of phobia. And it would require behavioral therapy to kind of get over that fear of not even wanting to get on the ride.\u201d\n\nWhen you start riding, you think, Oh Man, this looks great. And then you start realizing how high you are getting. And you start getting really nervous, like, how high will we go?\n\nHornick says he knows that not all riders are smiling when the ride hits the brakes. When what he calls \u201cadverse reactions\u201d do happen, certain rides can often be blamed.\n\n\u201cA lot of people get sick on the continuous forces, like a spinning type of ride, like if you have a fast carousel or something where like that where you are just spinning, or the swinging ships as well,\u201d said Hornick, an avid coaster rider. \u201cThat continuous cycle over and over again is where a lot of the uneasiness and queasy feels.\u201d\n\nDr. Longley said it\u2019s best to not have a completely empty stomach when getting on a coaster. But also avoid eating an enormous meal before getting in line. And hold back on the liquid intake.\n\n\u201cWhen your body is moving, accelerating, decelerating up and down, umm, your stomach is doing the same thing, your intestines are doing the same thing, and the increase in motion and the fluid wave that may be inside your belly from a 22-ounce beer, or even a soda, or whatever liquid you so choose to drink, will really enhance those sensations,\u201d he said.\n\nOr you can take a tip from those who feel queasy on a cruise ship or drive along mountain roads. Take a few Dramamine.\n\n\u201cThere definitely are medications you can take to blunt that effect of, of the nausea and vomiting and motion sickness associated with those rides,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a great option.\u201d\n\nAnd then there's always a safer option: sitting on the sidelines and smiling as screaming riders fly by.\n\nYou can hear more about the adrenaline rush of roller coasters Sunday, Aug. 24 at 7:30 a.m. on Florida Matters on WUSF 89.7 FM or online any time at wusf.org/floridamatters.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
