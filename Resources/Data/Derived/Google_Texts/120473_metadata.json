They also investigated whether the debt ratio had an impact on the kind of growth countries experienced.\n\nRelated: Ending Debt Limit Uncertainty May Note Help the Economy\n\nThe surprising answer to the first question was no. The researchers, in their own words, found \u201cthere is no simple threshold for debt ratios above which medium-term growth prospects are severely undermined. On the contrary, the association between debt and growth at high levels of debt becomes rather weak when one focuses on any but the shortest-term relationship.\u201d\n\nHowever, they added, this is not to say that debt has no impact at all on growth.\n\n\u201cWe have found some evidence that higher debt appears to be associated with more volatile growth,\u201d the authors write. \u201cAnd volatile growth can still be damaging to economic welfare.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the short-run effect of debt on growth was found to be significant. As debt-to-GDP approaches 90 percent, countries\u2019 one-year growth rate goes to near zero, and plunges into negative territory at all levels above that. However, a five-year timeframe shows positive growth rates at nearly all debt-to-GDP ratios.\n\nRelated: The GOP Debt Ceiling Vote \u2013 Surrender of Strategy?\n\nBut once the lens is pulled back to look at long-term growth\u2014meaning 10- and 15-year timeframes \u2013 the debt level shows little impact at all on growth rates.\n\nWhat did have a measurable effect, however, was what the authors of the paper called the \u201ctrajectory\u201d of a country\u2019s debt.\n\nEven over the long-term, a country\u2019s expected growth rate at almost all levels of debt is significantly higher, by as much as a full percentage point of GDP growth per capita, if its debt ratio is declining rather than rising.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even countries with debt ratios of 130\u2013140 percent but on a declining path have experienced solid growth,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis observation suggests that the high debt itself is not causing the low growth in these episodes but other factors, associated with increasing debt, are more strongly implicated.\u201d\n\nRelated: Unemployed and Hoping for Help from Congress\n\nThe authors caution that their paper alone is not enough evidence to base policy decisions on, but it at least suggests the possibility that, for the U.S., our current situation\u2013 U.S. debt held by the public is currently about 74 percent of GDP \u2013 doesn\u2019t doom the country to poor medium-term economic growth.\n\nHowever, the study points out that it would be better if the trajectory of the debt, which is expected to increase to 79 percent of GDP in 2024, were headed in the other direction.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study suggests that there may be no clear connection between the level of debt a country carries and its medium-term economic growth prospects.", "title": "Study Clouds Relationship between Debt and Growth", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/17/Study-Clouds-Relationship-between-Debt-and-Growth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07292013_GDP_Map_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/17/Study-Clouds-Relationship-between-Debt-and-Growth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07292013_GDP_Map_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new study suggests that there may be no clear connection between the level of debt a country carries and its medium-term economic growth prospects.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3502\"", "article_summary": "They also investigated whether the debt ratio had an impact on the kind of growth countries experienced.\nThe researchers, in their own words, found \u201cthere is no simple threshold for debt ratios above which medium-term growth prospects are severely undermined.\n\u201cAnd volatile growth can still be damaging to economic welfare.\u201dTo be clear, the short-run effect of debt on growth was found to be significant.\nEven over the long-term, a country\u2019s expected growth rate at almost all levels of debt is significantly higher, by as much as a full percentage point of GDP growth per capita, if its debt ratio is declining rather than rising.\nOn the contrary, the association between debt and growth at high levels of debt becomes rather weak when one focuses on any but the shortest-term relationship.\u201dHowever, they added, this is not to say that debt has no impact at all on growth."}
