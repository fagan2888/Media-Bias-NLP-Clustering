So, too, have all of her accomplishments as the head of the newsroom.\n\nAmanda Hess corrects the record over at Slate:\n\nWhen Abramson was unexpectedly fired from the Times on Wednesday\u201417 years after joining the paper, and just two-and-a-half years after being tapped to run it\u2014media reporters noted that she had made history as the first female executive editor in the paper\u2019s 160-year history. But shooting off that brief line makes it seem as if her contribution to women was as simple as ticking off a box on the Times\u2019 diversity checklist. According to a half-dozen women who worked with her, though, Abramson\u2019s brief stint as the female leader of a male-dominated institution proved to be a transformative experience. By the time she left, media critics would report that staffers deemed her \u201cpolarizing,\u201d \u201cbitchy,\u201d and \u201cnot approachable.\u201d But to many women at the New York Times, Jill Abramson was everything. [\u2026] The mark Abramson made on her female employees wasn\u2019t just a matter of optics. Abramson was committed to increasing women\u2019s representation at the paper, and she got results. In 2013 alone, Abramson tapped political editor Carolyn Ryan to replace David Leonhardt as Washington bureau chief and replaced national editor Sam Sifton with weekend editor Alison Mitchell. She also handed over the reins at the Sunday Book Review from Sam Tanenhaus to Pamela Paul, who has since made enormous strides in representing women, both female authors and critics, in the review. Abramson created a race and ethnicity beat at the paper, tapping national correspondent Tanzina Vega to cover it, and poached star local D.C. reporter Nikita Stewart from the Washington Post to report on New York\u2019s City Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s a point of pride,\u201d Abramson told Times public editor Margaret Sullivan about successfully achieving gender equity among the paper\u2019s highest-ranking editors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"brusque\" former executive editor made it her business to help women in journalism.
