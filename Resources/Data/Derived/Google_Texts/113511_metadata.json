The study\u2019s findings are described in a paper published today in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about in this study is not simply life expectancy, but quality-adjusted life expectancy,\u201d Stewart explained. \u201cMany studies have measured this in different ways, but this is really the first time we\u2019ve been able to measure it in the entire U.S. population using such a rich measure over a long period.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the news is good. The study shows that Americans are healthier than ever. The data show people living longer and reporting more energy, less depression and anxious moods, and less impairment in everyday tasks like walking and caring for themselves. All of the groups examined \u2014 blacks, whites, females, and males \u2014 showed improved quality-adjusted life expectancy.\n\nThe health improvements were, however, more concentrated among the elderly. Younger people did not show the same declines in walking problems and pain, the study found, and there was an increase in anxious mood among young and middle-aged people in the 2000s.\n\n\u201cIronically, many of the clearest gains have come at older ages, where people were once disabled by things like vision problems and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cThose conditions today are far more treatable than they were in the past, so what we\u2019re left with at the very oldest ages are things like Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, while at younger ages we\u2019re seeing problems that appear to be related to a sedentary lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the improvements are almost certainly the result of health care improvements,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are a number of conditions, such as heart disease, that used to be very, very impairing. It used to be that after a severe heart attack, people would essentially be bed-ridden, or they would wind up in nursing homes. We\u2019re not seeing that very much anymore.\u201d\n\nWhat has taken the place of cardiovascular disease, Cutler said, are chronic, degenerative conditions, like Alzheimer\u2019s, that remain largely untreatable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming to where those are the dominant health issues reported for the elderly, rather than heart disease or stroke-related impairment,\u201d he said.\n\nTo capture this long-term snapshot of the nation\u2019s health, Stewart, Cutler, and Rosen took on a daunting challenge that had stymied researchers.\n\n\u201cNo one has been able to fully get their hands around this question,\u201d Cutler explained. \u201cThere are many examples in the literature where a study looks at some aspects of health in a segment of the population, but there has not been consistent detailed health tracking over time.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is measure health beyond the simple measure of life expectancy, so what we set out to measure was health-related quality of life,\u201d he added. \u201cBut historically that\u2019s been very difficult to measure because there are so many dimensions to it. There\u2019s the physical and the mental, but there are also aspects like energy, vitality, and pain. To try to bring all those together in a single number is challenging.\u201d\n\nBeginning with national surveys that asked Americans about their health in various ways over the last 21 years, the researchers identified areas where studies overlapped, allowing them to build a single, large data set that represented the entire population over more than two decades.\n\n\u201cWe felt that there is all this data out there, let\u2019s try to make the maximum use of the information the federal government has already paid to collect,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere have been many calls for some sort of consistent way to measure quality-adjusted life expectancy over time. That\u2019s the major methodological contribution of this paper.\u201d\n\nWhile the study offers interesting insights into the past performance and current state of the health care system, Cutler said its value will increase in the next few years when a number of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the individual health care mandate, take effect.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason we want to do this type of study is because we need to know what\u2019s happening to the health of the population,\u201d he said. \u201cThat information is valuable in and of itself, but it\u2019s also important that we have a baseline that we can use to measure whether and how things change once the ACA goes into effect.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Cutler said, the study parallels the work of Harvard economist Simon Kuznets, who constructed national income accounts through 1930s and \u201940s. Though not perfect, the measure of gross domestic product is a vital tool that provides an understanding of how the economy is doing; it offers researchers a window through which they can study a host of important questions related to the national economy.\n\nCutler said he wanted a comprehensive study of QALE that would do the same for the health care system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laying the foundation for allowing us to determine how to get more of what we want from the health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives us a window into something we were never able to see \u2014 until now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ultimate output of the system should be health,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have a mechanism for measuring the output of the health system. That was our ultimate goal in doing this. We weren\u2019t trying to come up with yet another health measure, because there are already so many out there. We were trying to maximize our use of the existing data to enable measurement of whether the system is delivering health.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#99283c", "news_keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, Allison Rosen, Cardiovascular Disease, David Cutler, Economics, Elderly, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, FAS, Harvard, Health, Health data, Heart Disease, Life Expectancy, News Hub, Obesity, Peter Reuell, QALE, Research, Sedentary lifestyle, Susan Stewart,", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Gazette", "description": "By synthesizing the data collected in multiple government-sponsored health surveys conducted in recent decades, researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research, Harvard University, and the University of Massachusetts were able to measure how the quality-adjusted life expectancy of Americans has changed over time.", "title": "The good life, longer", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/09/the-good-life-longer/", "image": "http://media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/091213_Cutler_043_605.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harvard", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvard"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Harvard Gazette", "robots": "all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 593072576, "page_id": 105930651606, "app_id": 135898969862440}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/themes/gazette20/a/i/appletouch.gif", "keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, Allison Rosen, Cardiovascular Disease, David Cutler, Economics, Elderly, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, FAS, Harvard, Health, Health data, Heart Disease, Life Expectancy, News Hub, Obesity, Peter Reuell, QALE, Research, Sedentary lifestyle, Susan Stewart,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "description": "Americans enjoy more healthy years than a generation ago, sweeping study says | By synthesizing the data collected in multiple government-sponsored health surveys conducted in recent decades, researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research, Harvard University, and the University of Massachusetts were able to measure how the quality-adjusted life expectancy of Americans has changed over time."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about in this study is not simply life expectancy, but quality-adjusted life expectancy,\u201d Stewart explained.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is measure health beyond the simple measure of life expectancy, so what we set out to measure was health-related quality of life,\u201d he added.\nAll of the groups examined \u2014 blacks, whites, females, and males \u2014 showed improved quality-adjusted life expectancy.\n\u201cThere have been many calls for some sort of consistent way to measure quality-adjusted life expectancy over time.\nTo capture this long-term snapshot of the nation\u2019s health, Stewart, Cutler, and Rosen took on a daunting challenge that had stymied researchers."}
