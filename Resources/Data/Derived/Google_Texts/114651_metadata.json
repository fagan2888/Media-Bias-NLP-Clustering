With Great Britain, Germany, Australia, South Korea and 42 other countries essentially snubbing President Obama by teaming up with the Chinese, the emerging infrastructure bank intends to pump at least $100 billion into much needed energy and infrastructure project throughout Asia and the Middle East.\n\nRelated: China\u2019s New Development Bank: How Obama Blew It in the Pacific (Again)\n\nThe deal signed yesterday is meant to be a win-win for Pakistan and its Chinese patrons. The idea of building an economic corridor through Pakistan first emerged in the early 2000s, but didn\u2019t get off the ground until President Xi arrived on the scene.\n\nThe plans call for construction of a 1,500-mile network of highways, rails and oil pipelines linking the port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea with Xinjiang Province in western China.\n\nChina and its new bank will invest about $34 billion in energy projects and provide roughly $12 billion in loans for infrastructure projects to be built along the corridor over the next 15 years, according to reports. This would be a huge break for Pakistan\u2019s struggling economy and would overshadow the $7.5 billion that the U.S. pledged over the past five years to help develop and stabilize the region.\n\nThe project would be a huge boon for China as well. A critical feature of the plan is construction of a rough equivalent of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S. Roughly $9 billion of the $46 billion would go for a massive pipeline to carry crude oil from the port of Gwadar northeast through Pakistan\u2019s sparsely populated Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces to the Pakistan-Chinese border \u2014 the shortest possible route for bringing Persian Gulf oil to China, according to a recent report from Global Risk Insights. The proposed economic corridor of new roads and railways would also afford China easier sea access to markets in Africa, South Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\nRelated: Paulson Says China Must \u2018Reboot\u2019 Its Staggering Economy\n\nBut there\u2019s the one glaring problem with China\u2019s investment strategy: The corridor would run right through one of the world\u2019s most dangerous and unstable regions.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Balochistan province has been riven by insurgencies for decades and is the site of almost daily violence and killings. The New York Times reported yesterday that separatist rebels were accused of staging an attack near the port of Gwadar just ahead of Xi\u2019s address to Pakistan\u2019s parliament. Ghulam Ali, an analyst for the Central Asia Caucuses Analyst, wrote recently that the Chinese-backed project faces \u201cdaunting challenges.\u201d He added that until the insurgency is contained in the region, the project \u201cwill remain a dream.\u201d\n\nSecurity appeared to be very much on the minds of Xi and Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who said in a speech that \u201cPakistan considers China\u2019s security as its own security.\u201d Moreover, the Pakistani military reportedly assured Xi that it would create a special security division to protect Chinese nationals working on the development projects in Pakistan. This is a matter of no small concern to Beijing. In 2004, three Chinese engineers who were assisting in building the Gwadar port were shot to death by suspected insurgents.\n\nIt may have simply been a coincidence, but the Pakistani government chose the day of Xi\u2019s visit to carry out the executions of at least 17 prisoners who had been convicted of rape, murder and other serious crimes.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "China is wasting little time gearing up its new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank i", "title": "China Gambles on Its Own \u2018Keystone Pipeline\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/22/China-Gambles-its-Own-Keystone-Pipeline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-property-guangzhou_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/22/China-Gambles-its-Own-Keystone-Pipeline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-property-guangzhou_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "China is wasting little time gearing up its new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In 2004, three Chinese engineers who were assisting in building the Gwadar port were shot to death by suspected insurgents.\nA critical feature of the plan is construction of a rough equivalent of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S.\nThe plans call for construction of a 1,500-mile network of highways, rails and oil pipelines linking the port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea with Xinjiang Province in western China.\nThe proposed economic corridor of new roads and railways would also afford China easier sea access to markets in Africa, South Asia and the Persian Gulf.\nThe project would be a huge boon for China as well."}
