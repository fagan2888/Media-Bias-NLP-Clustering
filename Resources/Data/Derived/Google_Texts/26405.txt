Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul will host a “Stand with Rand” meet and greet inside the Prospector Hotel conference room on Thursday, Sept. 17 starting at 4 p.m. His visit, which will come hot off the heels of the Republican debate on Sept. 16 in Los Angeles, will be one of multiple stops through Nevada the same day that include another meet and greet in Carson City and a rally at the University of Nevada, Reno campus.

As a Senator from Kentucky and son of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, Rand Paul has run his presidential campaign on conservative principles of limited government.

“My policies will defeat the Washington Machine and unleash the creative spirit of the American people,” Paul is quoted as saying on his campaign’s website.

His policies include ending NSA bulk information collecting practices, repealing the entire IRS tax code and replacing it with a flat tax, repealing Obamacare and building the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Tickets to the meet and greet were made available for free through Paul’s campaign website.

White Pine County Chairman for the Republican party Mike Coster said he feels “honored that Dr. Paul has selected Ely in his rural Nevada tour” and that he hopes more presidential candidates will follow suit in coming to town. According to Donna Bath, the last presidential candidate to visit Ely was Richard Nixon.
