However, the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision leaving Medicaid expansion up to the individual states has dealt a significant financial blow to hospitals and health systems in those states that have not expanded Medicaid, including Virginia.\u201d\n\nSean Connaughton, president and CEO of VHHA, says these financial challenges mean that \u201ceach hospital and health system will have to make tough decisions regarding the breadth and depth of the services they provide.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some instances, they can look at reducing administrative positions or not hiring when a position goes vacant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, however, can only go so far. Tightening budgets, curtailing educational opportunities for personnel, and revising scheduled maintenance and capital projects are next. Finally, practices and specialties, and entire facilities, will need to be looked at to make budgets balance.\u201d\n\nFred Rankin, president and CEO of Mary Washington Healthcare in Fredericksburg, Va., can speak of the tough choices hospitals and health systems have had to make.\n\n\u201cJust three weeks ago we laid off 66 good people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile that\u2019s just about 2 percent of our workforce, to those 66 people it was devastating. Another 150 people had their hours reduced. And we\u2019ve eliminated another 250 to 300 jobs through attrition.\u201d\n\nRankin says that Mary Washington Healthcare \u201chistorically has been a very profitable organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we lost $22 million in 2012, the first time we lost money in probably 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2013, we lost $8 million. That\u2019s a $13 million improvement, but it\u2019s still a loss.\u201d\n\nThe financial crunch has forced Mary Washington Healthcare to look hard at which services and procedures they should offer the community.\n\n\u201cWe got out of the pediatric mental health business because we thought our resources would be better deployed to the adolescent population,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re starting to make decisions we\u2019ve never had to make before. For example, if a doctor wants to bring in a new procedure, we go through a very detailed analysis of what the cost of that procedure will be, and we weigh the cost of the procedure against the benefit.\u201d\n\nHealthcare providers across the state are facing these same painful choices, Rankin says. And while he is optimistic the huge shift in how the U.S. healthcare system operates eventually will mean better care for Virginians, Rankin says \u201cthere\u2019s no magic bullet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur industry is in the midst of a transformational change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are moving toward an economic model where we get reimbursed for keeping people healthy and keeping them out of the health system. We\u2019re migrating from a \u2018sick\u2019 healthcare system to a \u2018wellness\u2019 healthcare system.\n\n\u201cBecause so much of how we get paid is based on the old volume-based model, as we migrate, all healthcare organizations feel the stress of the built-in reductions that are part of the ACA,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cThe industry eventually will find a new equilibrium, but in the meantime it\u2019s chaos.\u201d\n\nConnaughton says it is up to individual hospitals and health systems \u201cto come up with creative ways to reduce costs and eliminate or change services that have the least impact on patients and their communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that said,\u201d he added, \u201cit will be very difficult to make cuts that in some way do not impact the patient. Even not adding new technology, upgrades to the building and cutting cost on maintenance and food services still will ultimately impact all patients.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospital-finances-suffering-amidst-transformational-change", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare-transformational-change.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A new report by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association paints a grim picture of the daunting financial challenges facing hospitals and other healthcare organizations in that state.", "title": "Hospital finances suffering amidst 'transformational change'"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare-transformational-change.jpg"}, "title": "Hospital finances suffering amidst 'transformational change'", "description": "A new report by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association paints a grim picture of the daunting financial challenges facing hospitals and other healthcare organizations in that state.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "A new report by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association paints a grim picture of the daunting financial challenges facing hospitals and other healthcare organizations in that state.&#13; Citing the \u201cunprecedented levels of change in the statutory and regulatory system\u201d driven by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the report highlights the impact of uncompensated care in Virginia.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe252e\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re migrating from a \u2018sick\u2019 healthcare system to a \u2018wellness\u2019 healthcare system.\n\u201cThe ACA sought to address some of these challenges by expanding Medicaid and health insurance coverage and reducing the overall costs of health care services.\n\u201cWe are moving toward an economic model where we get reimbursed for keeping people healthy and keeping them out of the health system.\nA new report by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association paints a grim picture of the daunting financial challenges facing hospitals and other healthcare organizations in that state.\nCiting the \u201cunprecedented levels of change in the statutory and regulatory system\u201d driven by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the report highlights the impact of uncompensated care in Virginia."}
