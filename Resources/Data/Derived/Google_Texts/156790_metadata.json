Two hours, nine minutes, and 17 seconds after the race started, Lelisa Desisa became the first runner to cross the finish line, just like he did two years ago.\n\nTwenty hours after the race started, Maickel Melamed, a Venezuelan man with muscular dystrophy, crossed the finish line surrounded by a crowd of well-wishers in what one spectator called \u201cone of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d At 5 a.m. with rain pouring down on him and his supporters at his side, Melamed crossed the finish line with two words on his lips: \u201cBoston Strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night I watched a report by Jorge Quiroga about a man from Venezuela who was still running the marathon long after everyone had packed up and went home,\u201d spectator Michael Blanchard said in a Facebook post. \u201cHis name is Maickel Melamed and he has muscular dystrophy. When I watched the video on WCVB Channel 5 Boston around 1 a.m., someone commented that he was just passing through Brookline and scheduled to finish between 2-3 a.m.\u201d\n\nFor his courageous effort, Mayor Marty Walsh awarded Melamed with an honorary medal after competing in his fifth marathon. Melamed\u2019s message of hope and inspiration could not be more fitting with the backdrop of the Boston Marathon. Melamed explained that Boston has always held a special place in his heart after being brought to the city at a young age for treatment.\n\n\u201cSince I am up all night anyway, I decided to head into town to try and photograph him crossing the finish line,\u201d Marchland added. \u201cWhen I got there, I was told by a cameraman that he was still in Brookline. Knowing it would be a while before he made it to Copley Square, I drove to Beacon Street to see what the deal was. Soon I came upon about a hundred people walking (very slowly) and singing while cars passed by them. It was truly one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "maickel, melamed, boston, marathons, final, finisher, completes, race, despite, muscular", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Maickel Melamed, a Venezuelan man with muscular dystrophy, had two words for reporters after finishing the Boston Marathon 20 hours after the start of the race: \"Boston Strong.\"", "title": "20 Hours Later, The Boston Marathon Ends With A Hero [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/maickel-melamed-boston-marathons-final-finisher-completes-race-despite-muscular-330300", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/22/maickel-melamed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maickel Melamed, a Venezuelan man with muscular dystrophy, had two words for reporters after finishing the Boston Marathon 20 hours after the start of the race: \"Boston Strong.\"", "title": "20 Hours Later, The Boston Marathon Ends With A Hero [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/maickel-melamed-boston-marathons-final-finisher-completes-race-despite-muscular-330300", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/22/maickel-melamed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/maickel-melamed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-22T11:04:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T11:04:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Maickel Melamed, a Venezuelan man with muscular dystrophy, had two words for reporters after finishing the Boston Marathon 20 hours after the start of the race: \"Boston Strong.\""}, "article_summary": "Melamed\u2019s message of hope and inspiration could not be more fitting with the backdrop of the Boston Marathon.\n\u201cSince I am up all night anyway, I decided to head into town to try and photograph him crossing the finish line,\u201d Marchland added.\nTwo hours, nine minutes, and 17 seconds after the race started, Lelisa Desisa became the first runner to cross the finish line, just like he did two years ago.\nOn the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, the crowd gathered around the 26.2-mile course for what was sure to be an emotional day for anyone with clear memories of April 15, 2013.\nMelamed explained that Boston has always held a special place in his heart after being brought to the city at a young age for treatment."}
