Asa Hutchinson\u2019s efforts to renew his state\u2019s Private Option Medicaid expansion likely depend on the results of three state Senate primaries next month.\n\nHutchinson has proposed an alternative he is calling Arkansas Works that would take effect when the Private Option expires at the end of the year. But many state legislators see Arkansas Works as little more than a new name for the Private Option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply the Obamacare-expanded Medicaid Private Option 2.0, is all it is,\u201d State Rep. Donnie Copeland, a Republican primary candidate in the Arkansas Senate\u2019s 34th District, told Watchdog.org.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s plan to ask the federal government for the Medicaid waivers necessary for Arkansas Works has already run into resistance from Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCopeland is doubtful the Obama administration will grant any meaningful waiver requests for work requirements, cost-sharing or the other aspects of Hutchinson\u2019s Arkansas Works plan that would differentiate it from the Private Option.\n\n\u201cIt is an attempt to obfuscate, and the whole farce of going to Washington and getting exemptions is totally ludicrous,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cIf you\u2019re the president of the United States and your goal is to expand the welfare state and you\u2019ve got a state that took the money, why would you give them any exceptions?\u201d\n\nCopeland said that even Hutchinson\u2019s proposed waivers would do little to improve the Private Option, which uses funding from the 2010 health law to buy insurance plans for Arkansans with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line.\n\n\u201cEven with the exceptions, we\u2019ve got a hugely expanded welfare program and the bill is going to come due shortly. I\u2019m totally opposed to it,\u201d Copeland said, noting that Hutchinson promised to end the Private Option \u2014 not just rename it.\n\nThe Private Option was designed to make Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion palatable to Republican lawmakers, but costs have rocketed past supporters\u2019 projections. Arkansas Works is backed by a legislative task force created when lawmakers voted to end the Private Option.\n\nBACKGROUND: Will Arkansas Republicans renew Obamacare expansion?\n\nCopeland \u2014 who is challenging incumbent Private Option supporter Sen. Jane English in the March 1 primary \u2014 is one of several Arkansas Senate candidates hoping to stop Arkansas Works in its tracks and avoid a Private Option repeat.\n\nThe Arkansas Senate District 7 and Arkansas Senate District 29 Republican primaries are also pivotal for the long-term viability of Arkansas Works, even if Hutchinson manages to push throgh approval of the program this spring.\n\nIn the 7th District, Private Option opponent Sharon Lloyd is running against State Rep. Lance Eads, who was hand-picked by allies of Private Option supporter State Sen. Jon Woods when Woods opted not to seek re-election.\n\nHutchinson appeared at a fundraiser for Eads on Feb. 12.\n\nIn the 29th District, Private Option opponent R.D. Hopper is challenging incumbent Private Option supporter Sen. Eddie Joe Williams.\n\nEnglish, Eads, and Williams did not respond to requests for comment on Arkansas Works and the Private Option.\n\nCopeland told Watchdog.org he believes a few more anti-Obamacare votes in the Arkansas Senate would be enough to guarantee Arkansas Works doesn\u2019t get a foothold after the Private Option expires in December.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so close in the Senate now,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cWith one to two \u2014 definitely with three \u2014 votes in the Senate, we kill it dead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas Gov.
