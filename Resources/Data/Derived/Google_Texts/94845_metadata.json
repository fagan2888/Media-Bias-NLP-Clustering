It is fundamentally about growth and creating value through accelerated expansion,\u201d Executive Chairman Alex Behring said on a media call.\n\n>>> No Fooling: U.S. Has Highest Corporate Tax Rate in World\n\nBehring told investors that he expects overall taxes to remain \u201clargely consistent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not being driven by tax rates,\u201d Behring said of the merger.\n\nSpeaking to bloggers and other communicators at Heritage today, Moore made a connection between the burger chain\u2019s plans and his latest book, \u201cAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of States: How Taxes, Energy, and Worker Freedom Change Everything.\u201d\n\nMoore, former economics writer for The Wall Street Journal, said:\n\nThe book makes the case taxes really do matter. Burger King is the tip of the iceberg [to show that this is true]. You will see more of these so-called inversions in the next few years because of the U.S. \u2018Head Start\u2019 policy that makes other countries [with lower tax rates] more attractive to do business.\n\n>>> These Two Charts Totally Explain Burger King\u2019s Move to Canada\n\nThe nation\u2019s effective corporate tax rate, combining national, state and local rates, is nearly 40 percent\u2014the highest across all 34 countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nCanada\u2019s rate is just above 26 percent.\n\nIf Burger King were to move, it would not be unusual. More than 70 U.S. companies have reincorporated abroad for tax reasons since the early 1980, according to data from the Congressional Research Service, and more than half of those so-called inversions occurred since 2003.\n\nMoore says it might take drastic action for the trend to change:\n\nWhy not get rid of the corporate income tax rate? You could still tax shareholders for those profits. That would be the patriotic thing to do. Provide incentives for companies to stay here and foreign businesses to come here.\n\n>>> How Smarter Policies Can Transform the States\n\nJudging from recent action taken by Democrats, Moore said, more politicians are beginning to embrace tax cuts.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has made it a priority to rid his state of its reputation as a high-tax state, and has pushed tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, who invest in job-creating enterprises.\n\n\u201cSome Democratic governors are figuring this stuff out,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a lot of blue states catching on about tax cuts. It\u2019s just not economical. It\u2019s political.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Burger King\u2019s move to Canada dramatizes businesses' itch to relocate unless the U.S. lowers the corporate tax rate, economist Stephen Moore says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Burger King\u2019s move to Canada dramatizes businesses' itch to relocate unless the U.S. lowers the corporate tax rate, economist Stephen Moore says.", "title": "'Taxes Really Matter': Whopper of a Lesson From Burger King", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/82504244.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-27T09:26:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1sxq3uK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Burger King\u2019s move to Canada dramatizes businesses' itch to relocate unless the U.S. lowers the corporate tax rate, economist Stephen Moore says.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/82504244.jpg"}, "title": "'Taxes Really Matter': Whopper of a Lesson From Burger King", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2014-08-26T17:03:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T09:26:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Burger King, inversion, tax inversion, Stephen Moore, Tim Hortons, Canada, Andrew Cuomo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0eee\"", "article_summary": "Under the deal, Burger King insisted later today it does not plan to relocate to Canada, where corporate taxes are significantly lower.\nBurger King is the tip of the iceberg [to show that this is true].\nIf Burger King were to move, it would not be unusual.\nFollowing Burger King\u2019s example, more companies will aim to move their headquarters to other countries if the United States doesn\u2019t lower \u2014 or eliminate \u2014 the corporate tax rate, a prominent economist says.\nMoore says it might take drastic action for the trend to change:Why not get rid of the corporate income tax rate?"}
