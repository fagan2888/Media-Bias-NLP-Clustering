Prepare to die.\u201d\n\nThe crowd laughed, as did Mr. Cruz.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing all week,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151113131735, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Cruz, Ted", "ttl": "The Princess Bride (Movie)", "keywords": "Cruz Ted,Movies,Presidential Election of 2016,The Princess Bride (Movie),Uncategorized", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who once aspired to be an actor, saves his best impressions for his favorite movie, \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Nick Corasaniti", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Nick Corasaniti", "byl": "Nick Corasaniti", "twitter": {"description": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who once aspired to be an actor, saves his best impressions for his favorite movie, \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d", "title": "Ted Cruz Lets Out His Inner Actor With 'The Princess Bride'", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/13/ted-cruz-lets-out-his-inner-actor-with-the-princess-bride/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@nytnickc", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004035998, "news_keywords": "2016 Presidential Election,Movies,Ted Cruz", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 13, 2015", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-11132015.jsonp", "article": {"published_time": 1447438655, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/nick_corasaniti/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T01:16:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151114011613, "PUD": 20151113, "pdate": 20151113, "des": "Movies;Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/13/ted-cruz-lets-out-his-inner-actor-with-the-princess-bride/", "site_name": "First Draft", "type": "article", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who once aspired to be an actor, saves his best impressions for his favorite movie, \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d", "title": "Ted Cruz Lets Out His Inner Actor With 'The Princess Bride'"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Ted Cruz Lets Out His Inner Actor With 'The Princess Bride'", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 13, 2015"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2070\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s why I love that movie,\u201d Mr. Cruz said as he finished to applause.\nPrepare to die.\u201dThe crowd laughed, as did Mr. Cruz.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s the best line,\u201d he said to the man, before quickly dropping back into Mr. Montoya.\nMr. Cruz was impressed.\nDuring a campaign event last month at Iowa Central Community College, Mr. Cruz quoted the movie while criticizing media reports on the Affordable Care Act."}
