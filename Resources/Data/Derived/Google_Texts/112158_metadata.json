(Photo: AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Barack Obama won't be on the ballot next November, and most Americans say the 2016 election isn't a debate over whether to continue his policies as president.\n\nWhile Republican candidates often rally their supporters by blasting President Obama \u2014 for the Affordable Care Act and his leadership on national security, among other things \u2014 GOP voters are particularly resistant to the idea that the 44th president should play a central role in the choice of the 45th president to succeed him.\n\nIn a national USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, a 51% majority of all those surveyed disagreed with a statement that the election \"boils down to whether or not we want to continue Barack Obama's policies for an additional four years.\" Forty-four percent agreed with it; the rest were undecided.\n\nDemocrats by 51%-43% agreed with the statement, a signal of the continuing influence Obama has over those in his own party.\n\nBut Republicans by 57%-40% disagreed. Four in 10 said they \"disagreed strongly.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken Dec. 2-6, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1YddzY0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "But most Democrats say the campaign is about whether to continue the president's policies", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "But most Democrats say the campaign is about whether to continue the president's policies", "title": "Poll: Republicans say 2016 isn't about Obama", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/12/13/poll-republicans-say-2016-isnt-obama/77248122/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But most Democrats say the campaign is about whether to continue the president's policies", "title": "Poll: Republicans say 2016 isn't about Obama", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a86aee0ba3a61183c3f5877534e1d124d816db28/c=422-0-2108-1686&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Hillary Clinton 2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Hillary Clinton 2016 Presidential Campaign", "title": "Poll: Republicans say 2016 isn't about Obama", "author": "Susan Page", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections/2016", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5be95ebb8c4457e3992ca5c07b450578c451a207/c=632-0-1897-1686/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58365d8ad5a532868d73e8511afa471081c6c5d4/c=422-0-2108-1686/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b3adfd8646b71ba1690f24bba65b709b4faad7a/c=143-0-2385-1686/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e75b1d915cb0499178933f09cf5ae0f196260e4/c=0-129-2529-1558&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-13T14:28:42-05:00", "shorthed": "Poll: Republicans say 2016 isn't about Obama", "articleid": 77248122, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb2d0b5ee1775dd8b3c425b5d8562718bc0ca761/c=0-129-2529-1558/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21c31e8848a06540201264c27ffd892f748e5a1e/c=792-0-1736-1686/local/-/media/2015/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635856135330327305-AP-OBAMA-US-IRAQ-66426016.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "President Obama, poll, Suffolk University, Republicans, 2016, third term, Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c25\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: AP)WASHINGTON \u2014 Barack Obama won't be on the ballot next November, and most Americans say the 2016 election isn't a debate over whether to continue his policies as president.\nPresident Obama in August 2014.\nDemocrats by 51%-43% agreed with the statement, a signal of the continuing influence Obama has over those in his own party.\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken Dec. 2-6, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\nBut Republicans by 57%-40% disagreed."}
