Santorum makes a Kenya joke about Obama\n\nThe world is a dangerous and complex place, former Sen. Rick Santorum told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, even more so than when he ran for the presidency in 2012.\n\nHe called out President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in particular, two perennial targets at the annual gathering of conservative activists.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need just someone with a strong economic plan. Thanks to the Obama-Clinton foreign policy team, we have gone from a policy of peace through strength to a policy of leading from behind,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the president\u2019s popularity is so bad around the world today that I heard a source that the Kenyan government is actually developing proof that Barack Obama was actually born in America,\u201d he joked.\n\nSantorum broached the possibility of a GOP candidate facing Clinton in the general election next year. That candidate had better call \u201cradical Islam\u201d by its name, he said.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that we\u2019re going to face a former secretary of state means that we need someone who has a long and deep understanding of the threats we confront, particularly the threat of radical Islam,\u201d he said, adding that the president\u2019s \u201cprofound lack of experience has created problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommander in chief is not an entry-level position,\u201d the former Pennsylvania senator said, touting his time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nSantorum called for boots on the ground to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well as increased aid to Jordan and Egypt.\n\n\u201cWe need to start by crushing ISIS. Now,\u201d he said, using an alternative name for the terrorist group. \u201cWe must start in Iraq. We need to get ISIS out of Iraq. The first thing we need to do is arm the Kurds. Instead of sending them bandages and bodybags, we need to send them weapons.\u201d\n\nIf Iran develops a nuclear weapon, Santorum warned, the U.S. will have failed in its negotiations.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming address to Congress has become a political flashpoint, with many Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden, declining to attend.\n\n\u201cIn the end, Prime Minister Netanyahu would not be coming to America, he would not be risking the most important national security arrangement that Israel has if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he believed in his heart that Iran\u2019s and the United States\u2019 nuclear negotiations was going to end up being an existential threat to his country,\u201d Santorum said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He called out President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He called out President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.", "title": "Santorum makes a Kenya joke about Obama", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/rick-santorum-cpac-2015-speech-115593.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/27/20150227_santorumjoke_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Rick Santorum,Rick Santorum 2016", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NickGassReports"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5c0\"", "article_summary": "Santorum makes a Kenya joke about ObamaThe world is a dangerous and complex place, former Sen.
