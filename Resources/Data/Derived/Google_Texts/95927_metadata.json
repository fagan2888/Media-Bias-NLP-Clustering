She would become the first black woman to serve as the nation\u2019s top law officer.\n\nDozens of Senate Republicans have opposed her for various reasons, chiefly her support of Obama\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nThe president spoke at a news conference alongside visiting Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Asked about Lynch\u2019s nomination, Obama praised \u201csome outbreaks of bipartisanship and common sense\u201d in Congress recently on issues such as fixing a longstanding problem with Medicare payments to doctors.\n\n\u201cYet what we still have is this crazy situation where a woman everybody agrees is qualified \u2026 has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined,\u201d Obama said. He said there was no reason for the delay other than \u201cpolitical gamesmanship in the Senate\u201d on issues unrelated to Lynch.\n\n\u201cThis is embarrassing, a process like this,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"What are we doing here?\" Obama said. \"I have to say there are times when the dysfunction in the Senate just goes too far.
