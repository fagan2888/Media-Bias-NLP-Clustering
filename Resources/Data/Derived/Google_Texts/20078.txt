Yes, labor unions improved work conditions. But it's not the 19th century anymore.

EDITOR: Recent letters decrying right-to-work legislation have had at least two things in common. One has been the constant harking back to the beginning of the labor movement and its resultant beneficial effects on the plight of laborers and the development of a strong middle class. The other is the incessant invoking of the Koch brothers as the drivers of such legislation.

While there is little argument regarding the place of unions in the economic history of the country, I believe it also can be said that the conditions that cried out for the development of the union movement no longer apply to the extent that supports the current hysteria surrounding right to work. It strikes me somewhat like the president's recent comment attempting to establish moral equivalency between the Islamic State group and the Crusades. Yes, the Crusades are a fact, as were the conditions that spawned the labor movement. But how applicable are they today?

With respect to the Koch brothers, why is it that George Soros' name or the fact that labor unions consistently contribute enormous amounts of money to liberal causes they espouse is any more acceptable than conservatives supporting their interests? Or is it just another expression of moral equivalency?
