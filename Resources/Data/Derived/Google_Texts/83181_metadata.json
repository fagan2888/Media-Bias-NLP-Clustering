STD rates have been increasing for more than a decade.\n\nAmong its findings, the department reported:\n\n\u2022 Chlamydia is the state's No. 1 reported infectious disease, responsible for 82 percent of the state's STD diagnoses. Chlamydia hit a new high of 21,238 cases in 2015, up 7 percent from 2014. Most cases occurred in Minnesotans ages 15 to 24. One-third occurred in greater Minnesota; at least three cases were reported in every Minnesota county.\n\n\u2022 Gonorrhea remains the second most commonly reported STD in Minnesota with 4,097 cases reported in 2015 compared to 4,073 in 2014. Just under half of all gonorrhea cases occurred among among 15- to 24-year-olds, with 77 percent of cases in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.\n\n\u2022 Syphilis cases rose 4 percent to 654 last year, but \"a new concern emerged with a 70 percent increase between 2014 and 2015 in syphilis cases among women,\" the department said. \"The increase occurred primarily among women of child-bearing age in all racial and ethnic groups, including pregnant women.\" New infections remain centered in the Twin Cities, \"particularly among men who have sex with men.\"\n\n\u2022 Infection rates for chlamydia and gonorrhea are higher among people of color compared to whites. Higher syphilis infection rates were seen among American Indian and African-American women, and men of all races who have sex with other men.\n\n\"Addressing disparities is a health department priority, particularly among those racial and ethnic groups with limited access to STD testing and prevention programs due to longstanding social, medical or income disadvantages,\" Ehlinger said.\n\nMinnesotans can protect themselves from infection by abstaining from sexual contact, limiting the number of sexual partners, using condoms the right way during sex and not sharing needles for drug use, piercing or tattooing, the department said.\n\nPartners of STD-infected patients should get tested based on their risk behaviors and be treated at the same time to prevent reinfection and spread to others, officials added.\n\nMPR News reporter Lorna Benson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"mpr-content-group": "2016/04/11/mn-sexually-transmitted-disease-record-2015", "mpr-collection": "Health", "description": "Increases in chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis are a disturbing trend, state officials said Monday.
