One hundred and one center-left economists signed onto a letter to Congress opposing any change to the Cadillac tax without some alternative \u201cthat would more effectively curtail cost growth\u201d in employer health plans. And Sarah Kliff at Vox presented the prevailing opinion that labor and business hate the law \u201cbecause it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nRelated: Democrats Begin the Long, Tortuous Retreat from Obamacare\n\nKliff bases her opinion on a study of 2014 employer health benefits by the Kaiser Family Foundation, showing that 13 percent of large companies have already downgraded their benefit packages to avoid the tax, and 53 percent have researched the possibility. The tax doesn\u2019t take effect until 2018.\n\nThe Kaiser survey certainly shows that employers are giving worse health plans to their employees. But that doesn\u2019t actually show the Cadillac tax is working, at least not fully, because the tax has two goals. One is to lower overall health costs by creating more monetary pain for high-cost plans, and nudging businesses and individuals to be smarter health care shoppers. The other is to boost worker pay.\n\nThe theory here is that, as employers lower health care spending, the savings get plowed into higher wages, equalizing overall compensation. Economic studies have typically looked at this the other way around, finding a relationship between falling wages and rising health care costs. \u201cIn the long run if insurance costs rise, they will take a toll on wages,\u201d said Paul Starr of Princeton University. \u201cThe reverse should be true \u2014 in the long run, but in the short run maybe not.\u201d\n\nRelated: An Obamacare Change to Medicare Is Backfiring\n\nThe problem with this reverse-engineering is that it\u2019s highly theoretical. There\u2019s no study, for example, showing that the large companies that already downgraded employee health plans also boosted wages. It would be hard to know even how to design such an experiment, given all the factors that go into wages. \u201cI don't think there is any real research to document or refute that claim,\u201d said Harold Pollack of the University of Chicago, one of the academics who signed the pro-Cadillac tax letter. \u201cIt is well-grounded in economic principles but difficult to empirically test.\u201d\n\nThe theory can bump up against realities of the labor market, such as the low labor force participation rate we\u2019re seeing today. Companies may not have to transfer benefit cuts to higher wages to retain workers, who might have trouble finding new employment. That\u2019s especially true if most companies make the same cuts, making other job prospects less attractive. And if there\u2019s no pressure to return profits to workers, the last 40 years have demonstrated that businesses won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI am dubious that in the current economic context that the things being done to lower premiums is resulting in higher wages to offset them,\u201d said Larry Mishel of the labor-allied Economic Policy Institute (EPI). \u201cNo evidence speaks to all this.\u201d\n\nRelated: 8 Benefits Questions to Ask This Open Enrollment Season\n\nJosh Bivens of EPI even questioned whether economic studies showing a textbook trade-off between health benefits and wages give the full picture. \u201cMost of the public data don\u2019t have an employee co-pay to their premium,\u201d Bivens said, suggesting that without this, you don\u2019t get the real value of the health plan. A 2013 study by Darren Lubotsky and Craig Olson of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign included employee co-pay data in studying Illinois teachers between 1991-2008, and it found \u201cno evidence that changes in teachers\u2019 salaries respond to changes in insurance cost.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, an earlier version of the same paper did find such a relationship, suggesting how hard it is to wring the truth out of the data. \u201cIt does shake me that we can\u2019t find it really robustly with good studies,\u201d Bivens said. \u201cThe theory turns to dust when trying to find the trade-off.\u201d\n\nThere are other problems with the excise tax. Even if workers do get a wage boost, the bulk of it would go to paying higher out-of-pocket costs. \u201cOnly if people forego doctor visits do they get any benefit,\u201d Bivens said. That cuts against a central goal of Obamacare itself: to increase preventive care and arrest costly health problems before they metastasize. People cut back on health spending in random and often self-destructive ways. Instead of squeezing out wasteful spending, the Cadillac tax could eliminate useful spending that makes people healthier.\n\nRelated: \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 Looms for Larger Employer Health Plans\n\nMoreover, hitting \u201chigh-cost health care plans\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily target lavish ones. States have considerable variation in health costs, and the tax disproportionately affects those high-cost states even though plans there pay for less coverage. Older Americans are more likely to have a high-cost plan simply because of allowable actuarial modeling. The size of a firm also matters: Smaller companies have less bargaining power to get a better price for their health plans.\n\nIn theory, the Cadillac tax should decrease health care utilization, making individuals more discerning in their choices. But health care is nearly an impossible market in which to be a good shopper, with its opaque costs and tendency for people to listen to their doctors. As EPI\u2019s Elise Gould notes in a paper on the subject, \u201cForcing Americans to pay a higher share of health costs will not induce them to shop around and compare prices when they are experiencing chest pains or their child is suffering from an asthma attack.\u201d\n\nGould\u2019s paper finds that increased cost-sharing proposals hit patients who need the most care. Indeed, the Kaiser Family Foundation identifies cost-sharing as the real driver in health spending over the past few years. While overall health inflation has been contained to some degree, deductibles are skyrocketing. This is driving down usage of medical care, including medically necessary treatment: \u201ca penny-wise, pound-foolish result,\u201d Gould writes.\n\nRelated: Americans Have Insurance but Can\u2019t Afford to Use It\n\nThe Cadillac tax raises $91 billion over the next decade, and Clinton wants to offset the cost of repeal, though she hasn\u2019t specified a funding source. Elites want to preserve the tax to \u201cbend the cost curve\u201d of health spending and shift compensation to wages. But they hang their hopes on large assumptions about the labor and health care markets, and if the goal is better systems in both, they may miss the mark.\n\n\u201cWhere the United States stands out on health care isn\u2019t on the utilization side. We stand out on stuff being expensive,\u201d Josh Bivens said. \u201cWe should focus on prices and not quantities. And the excise tax is all about ratcheting down the quantity of health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton upended the delicate consensus on health care policy in the Democratic", "title": "Hillary Clinton Is Right: The Obamacare \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 Is a Lemon", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/02/Hillary-Clinton-Right-Obamacare-Cadillac-Tax-Lemon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11072013_Obamacare_Cast_Solo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/02/Hillary-Clinton-Right-Obamacare-Cadillac-Tax-Lemon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11072013_Obamacare_Cast_Solo.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ddayen"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Hillary Clinton upended the delicate consensus on health care policy in the Democratic", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But that doesn\u2019t actually show the Cadillac tax is working, at least not fully, because the tax has two goals.\nRelated: \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 Looms for Larger Employer Health PlansMoreover, hitting \u201chigh-cost health care plans\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily target lavish ones.\nHillary Clinton upended the delicate consensus on health care policy in the Democratic Party\u2019s upper echelons this week.\nThe Washington Post editorial board said Clinton \u201ccanceled out any claim to responsibility\u201d on health care, and suggested she only made the decision to appease unions, which generally have good employer health care plans.\nIn theory, the Cadillac tax should decrease health care utilization, making individuals more discerning in their choices."}
