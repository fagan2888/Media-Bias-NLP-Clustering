Guys came ready to play and wanted to contribute.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki was rested most of Monday\u2019s game after going 1-for-4 in a long rain-delayed game Sunday against the Giants in Denver. He pinch hit in the ninth inning against the Reds and struck out.\n\nGonzalez was a late scratch from Monday\u2019s lineup because of stomach flu, according to manager Walt Weiss. CarGo looked healthier after the game than he did before it and probably won\u2019t be out long.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as green now,\u201d Weiss said after the Rockies beat the Reds 5-4 and improved to 18-25.\n\nThe Rockies were bolstered by Arenado going 3-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs and Charlie Blackmon\u2019s three stolen bases and two runs scored. Ben Paulsen and DJ LeMahieu had two hits apiece. Nick Hundley hit safely for the 20th time in his past 24 games.\n\n\u201cWe have to get three, four, five guys hot at a time to get on a roll,\u201d said Weiss, whose team ended an 11-game losing streak May 14. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scuffling a little bit. But I see us turning it around. I see us pitching better, taking better at-bats. Just playing better.\u201d\n\nLyles update. Jordan Lyles is with the Rockies on this road trip, but his next start remains in doubt because of a toe injury. The right-hander was scheduled to throw a side session before determining whether he will pitch Saturday at Philadelphia.\n\nFootnotes. First baseman Justin Morneau did not travel with the Rockies. He strained his neck during a game two weeks ago and has had concussionlike symptoms. His neck has healed, Weiss said, but the concussionlike symptoms will keep him out longer. \u2026 Jason Marquis, a former Rockies pitcher who made a start for Cincinnati on Monday, batted in the No. 8 slot in the Reds\u2019 lineup. It was the first time a Cincinnati pitcher batted in that slot since 1933. Marquis hit a double and finished 1-for-2.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (1-2, 6.51 ERA) at Reds\u2019 Michael Lorenzen (1-1, 3.79), 5:10 p.m. Tuesday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nDe La Rosa became the Rockies\u2019 career leader in strikeouts last week when he struck out five against the Philadelphia Phillies and passed Ubaldo Jimenez with 774. De La Rosa has a 2.31 ERA in his past two starts. But against the Phillies, he lasted just 4 innings with three earned runs allowed. The Rockies, though, won that game. They\u2019re 2-4 this year when De La Rosa starts. The left-hander is 3-2 against Cincinnati. He has won his past two starts against the Reds, in 2013 and 2014. Lorenzen, a rookie, will be making his fourth start and his first against the Rockies.\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Kyle Kendrick (1-6, 6.58 ERA) at Reds\u2019 Mike Leake (2-3, 4.14), 10:35 a.m., MLB\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Rockies\u2019 TBA at Phillies\u2019 Cole Hamels (5-3, 2.98), 5:05 p.m., ROOT\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Latest Rockies win comes with Troy Tulowitzki, Carlos Gonzalez not making starts", "title": "Latest Rockies win comes with Troy Tulowitzki, Carlos Gonzalez not making starts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/25/latest-rockies-win-comes-with-troy-tulowitzki-carlos-gonzalez-not-making-starts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150515_054742_troy-tulowitzki.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150515_054742_troy-tulowitzki.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-25T19:24:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:45:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re 2-4 this year when De La Rosa starts.\nDe La Rosa has a 2.31 ERA in his past two starts.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as green now,\u201d Weiss said after the Rockies beat the Reds 5-4 and improved to 18-25.\nCINCINNATI \u2014 Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez \u2014 veteran pillars propping up the Rockies\u2019 hopes after they returned from injuries in 2014 \u2014 did not make starts together Monday for the first time this season.\n\u2026 Jason Marquis, a former Rockies pitcher who made a start for Cincinnati on Monday, batted in the No."}
