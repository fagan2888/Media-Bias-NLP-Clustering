Past News Releases RSS\n\nBenefit Corporation of America, LLC (BCA), a leader in the development of specialized employee benefits software, has released several major enhancements to BenefitScape\u00ae, a cloud-based outsourcing platform for ACA Compliance. The new features provide for stand alone e-filing of IRS reporting and e-delivery of required employee communications.\n\n+ACA compliance presents unique challenges coordinating internal data and guidance.\n\nWhile HR and Benefits will often direct the ACA compliance effort, significant input and approval is needed from legal, finance, IT, tax, payroll, communications etc. \u201cThe overall complexity, number of contributors, and immediate timeframe of ACA compliance make it a perfect candidate for outsourcing,\u201d said Ken Phillips, President of BCA. \u201cThe real challenge is to make outsourcing affordable.\u201d Employee benefits professionals often need to react quickly and economically to legislative, regulatory or Marketplace change. Making the required changes to complex HRIS, payroll, and benefits administration platforms is expensive, time consuming and often impossible due to resource constraints. BenefitScape has built a Data Warehouse that fills the gaps in these complex systems enabling ACA compliance without major development and cost.\u201d See a Video on the BenefitScape Data Warehouse approach to affordability titled \u201cComplexity to Simplicity\u201d.\n\n+Flexible Delivery Model for IRS reporting complements established capabilities.\n\n\u201cOur clients have internal capabilities or outsourced vendors that provide payroll, benefit administration, etc., but they may often lack one or more necessary features such as employee communications, hours tracking or IRS reporting,\u201d according to Andy Miller, ACA Development Analyst. \u201cThe BenefitScape Data Warehouse provides the flexibility to offer a specific component, such as IRS Form 1095-C reporting by using the Value Added Network (VAN) features of the BenefitScape Data Warehouse.\u201d The VAN creates a secure link to the IRS Affordable Care Act Information Return (AIR) Program as required for electronic filing. The cost reduction for an organization is obtained because BenefitScape creates the link once and extends it at low cost to VAN users.\n\n+BenefitScape is a different outsourcing model, centered on the \u201cemployee experience\u201d.\n\nBenefitScape technology makes it possible to communicate to each employee individually, providing each employee a personalized experience available 24/7. We present a clear, optimistic and uplifting vision of your organization for each employee, while creating opportunities to build relationships and deepen engagement with every interaction. BenefitScape helps connect employees, their colleagues, and their community in a dialog on health plans, all in an era of new contemporary concepts, such as Healthcare reform.\n\n+Why focus a compliance effort on the employee experience?\n\nFirst and foremost, the analysis, communications and reporting of individual employee health plan eligibility and status is the major focus of and the reason for most of the ACA Employer Shared Responsibility provisions. If an organization approaches ACA compliance primarily as a technical exercise, downplaying employee communications, they will be overwhelmed with inquiries, problems and requests for clarifications from employees, their families, Healthcare marketplaces, employee advisors, and the IRS. BenefitScape approaches ACA compliance as a major communications event, focused on creating employee understanding and satisfaction while keeping costs in check.\n\nTo find out more about ACA outsourcing services and pricing visit http://www.benefitscape.com\n\nand our Affiliate Program http://www.benefitscape.com/AboutUs/BenefitScapeAffiliateProgram.aspx\n\n+About BenefitScape\u00ae\n\nBenefitscape is an agile platform developed by Benefit Corporation of America, LLC (BCA) http://www.bencorpusa.com/ specifically to enable affordable outsourcing of ACA Compliance.
