Many families fear that without safeguards, a medical emergency or family obligation that pulls them away from work could mean financial disaster.\n\n\u201cFamilies are really struggling, and part of the reason they can\u2019t get ahead is they lack basic protections,\u201d said Vicki Shabo of the National Partnership for Women & Families, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe challenges they\u2019re facing are not their individual problems to face \u2014 they\u2019re not alone. These are challenges that really sweep the country.\u201d\n\nIn June, Oregon became the fourth state to approve a paid sick leave law, joining California, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The new law requires employers with 10 or more employees to give each worker five paid sick days a year. The law is designed to help low-wage workers, who are least likely to have the benefit and least able to afford losing even a single day\u2019s pay.\n\nIn California, the state Assembly is mulling a bill, approved by the Senate in June, that would broaden that state\u2019s paid family leave measure, which was the first of its kind in 2002 and led to similar laws in New Jersey and Rhode Island. This year, 18 other states considered paid family leave laws, which typically allow workers to take time off work to care for a newborn or ailing relative.\n\nIn 10 states, legislators have introduced measures to curb unpredictable, on-call shift scheduling, which can complicate the family lives of retail, restaurant and janitorial workers.\n\nA relatively new part of the push to address work-life balance issues is the effort to regulate employers\u2019 scheduling practices. Some workers complain that their employers craft unpredictable work schedules that make it nearly impossible for them to meet their family obligations.\n\nThe California proposal, for example, would require large food and retail establishments to give workers their schedules two weeks in advance and compensate them for last-minute changes. At least nine other states considered similar measures this year, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a hunger for a solution to this growing problem,\u201d said Liz Watson, senior counsel at the center. \u201cNo one should have to live this way.\u201d\n\nJake Grovum, Stateline.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Years after the recession ended, many Americans still do not feel economically secure.", "og": {"description": "Years after the recession ended, many Americans still do not feel economically secure.", "title": "Lawmakers aim to help people balance work, family", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150725-lawmakers-aim-to-help-people-balance-work-family.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150725-biz_wrk-balance_sh_45091555.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BIZ_WRK-BALANCE_SH_45091555.JPG", "height": 870}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-25T23:30:45Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-25T23:30:45Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Lawmakers aim to help people balance work, family\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150725-lawmakers-aim-to-help-people-balance-work-family.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150725-biz_wrk-balance_sh_45091555.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BIZ_WRK-BALANCE_SH_45091555.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2374810\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-25T23:30:45Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150725-biz_wrk-balance_sh_45091555.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/BIZ_WRK-BALANCE_SH_45091555.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-07-25T23:30:45Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2406\"", "article_summary": "Some workers complain that their employers craft unpredictable work schedules that make it nearly impossible for them to meet their family obligations.\nThis year, 18 other states considered paid family leave laws, which typically allow workers to take time off work to care for a newborn or ailing relative.\nMany families fear that without safeguards, a medical emergency or family obligation that pulls them away from work could mean financial disaster.\nThese are challenges that really sweep the country.\u201dIn June, Oregon became the fourth state to approve a paid sick leave law, joining California, Connecticut and Massachusetts.\nTheir focus on issues such as paid leave and protections for pregnant workers reflects a sobering fact: Years after the recession ended, many Americans still do not feel economically secure."}
