To prepare for these changes, Fairchild Insurance Specialists agent, Dolly Fairchild, recommends all Americans read, \u201cObama Care Survival Guide: The Affordable Care Act and What It Means for You and Your Healthcare.\u201d Kyle Fairchild and Dolly Fairchild are partners at Fairchild Insurance Specialists in Cambridge.\n\nThis non-fiction book summarizes The Affordable Care Act in 299 pages and makes it easier to understand than the original law text which is over 2,700 pages. Dolly believes this condensed version should be in every home in America.\n\nWritten by Nick J. Tate and published by Humanix Publishing LLC, the book is available for purchase at bookstores and online for $12.99. Inside the book, readers will find a calendar listing what changes will occur and when. The author\u2019s good advice is highlighted on page sidebars. For example, \u201cObamaCare\u2026prevents insurance companies from dropping your coverage after you get sick because you made a minor error when you filled out your application. And thanks to ObamaCare, they can no longer refuse to give you coverage because you have a pre-existing health condition or charge you a higher premium because you\u2019re older or have a chronic disease that increases your use of healthcare.\u201d\n\nQuality healthcare for senior citizens and disabled people is important to Dolly and her son Kyle Fairchild. They are committed to being their clients service agents for life. Dolly and Kyle go above and beyond to make sure their clients get the best medical and dental coverage they can afford. Their clients appreciate the personal service they receive from Dolly and Kyle, and they refer them to others frequently.\n\nOpen enrollment for senior citizens and disabled people for 2014 is Oct. 15 through Dec. 10, 2013.
