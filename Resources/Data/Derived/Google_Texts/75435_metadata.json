Standing naked, he bashed it again and again against the walls of his cell.\n\nThe air stank. The door to another cell nearby stood vacant, its walls splattered with dried feces. Inmates often do that, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy William Hong explained as the tour of the jail\u2019s mental health units continued, to dormitories where men deemed less dangerous to themselves or others sat shackled to tables, watching television. Then it was on to the hospital for the most seriously ill. There, the cells are larger than usual, so deputies can maneuver while holding down patients who resist medication.\n\nOn this day, nobody was fighting. In cell after cell, shapeless figures lay huddled under blankets.\n\nOne out of every five Los Angeles County Jail inmates has been diagnosed with a mental illness, a statistic that leads authorities to describe he jail system as the nation\u2019s largest mental institution.\n\nOne county study found the vast majority of the system\u2019s mentally ill are there for petty crimes related to homelessness, such as public urination or sleeping on the sidewalk. It warned such people are being incarcerated largely because there\u2019s nowhere else to put them.\n\nWith a sane person, many \u201cquality of life\u201d offenses result in a warning or fine. But advocates say when a mentally ill person is challenged by a law enforcement officer, tensions can quickly escalate, with the ill person responding inappropriately. Further, such persons have often missed court summonses on previous citations, and the officer has grounds to take them custody. Legal competency evaluations and other complications can turn a trivial offense into weeks behind bars. In that time, some mentally ill jail inmates spin more and more out of control.\n\nIn June, citing sloppy supervision and a dramatic increase in jail suicides, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it was seeking court oversight of how mentally ill county inmates are treated. In a report, DOJ investigators describe jail cells as \u201cdimly lit, vermin-infested, noisy, unsanitary, cramped and crowded,\u201d conditions that worsen the unstable prisoners\u2019 distress.\n\nMeanwhile, county officials are moving forward with plans to develop their own \u201cmental health jail.\u201d As part of a plan to replace the aging Men\u2019s Central Jail and ease chronic overcrowding, jail officials will seek to house mentally ill inmates in the proposed Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility, which would offer more mental health services. Most other inmates would remain in the county\u2019s other large jail next door, Twin Towers.\n\nStill, as county supervisors consider plans for the new, $1.7 billion facility, officials are considering how to keep some mentally ill inmates out of the jail system altogether.\n\nOne leading advocate for change is Los Angeles\u2019 District Attorney, Jackie Lacey.\n\nIn May, she convened a summit of law enforcement leaders and mental health workers to possible reforms in the county criminal justice system\u2019s treatment of mentally ill offenders.\n\nIn collaboration with the federal government\u2019s Gaines Center, Lacey is preparing recommendations on diverting mentally ill arrestees from the penal system. That report is due in September.\n\nAddressing county supervisors recently, Lacey said training law enforcement, prosecutors and judges is crucial to identifying mentally ill offenders and directing them to alternatives to jail time where appropriate. Further, the county needs more housing and support services for the mentally ill, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople with mental illness are often dumped back into the street after being stabilized in medical facilities or jails,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral question at hand in this process. Are we punishing people for simply being sick? Public safety should have a priority, but justice should always come first.\u201d\n\nIn late July, supervisors deferred action on a proposal to set aside some $20 million as initial funding for such programs, pending receipt of Lacey\u2019s recommendations and their own budget planning sessions this fall. But in deferring the funding decision, several supervisors acknowledged the need for a new approach to the mentally ill.\n\n\u201cI think yes, $20 million is only a down payment,\u201d Supervisor Gloria Molina said. \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have a plan. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nPeter Eliasberg, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said he was disappointed at the delay.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s more than enough information to know this amount of money will be necessary, and having the money set aside will help things move quickly once the DA comes back with her report,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, there seemed to be unanimous commitment on this issue that diversion is a board priority and it needs to be done.\u201d\n\nIn a joint report issued last month, Eliasberg\u2019s organization and the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law note that diversion programs including the Nathaniel Project in New York City, Thresholds in Chicago, and, in Florida, Miami-Dade County\u2019s Criminal Mental Health Project have dramatically reduced recidivism rates among the mentally ill.\n\n\u201cWe really do know how to do this correctly. There are experts in the field and research in the field now that didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago,\u201d said Mark Gale, criminal justice chairman for the Los Angeles Council of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\n\u201cBefore it was like, \u2018Well, we\u2019re really not sure what to do,\u2019 and anybody trying something new, it\u2019s so new it\u2019s untested. We now have evidence-based practices. There are best practices. There are consultants who can literally map your system for you.\u201d\n\nGale wants pre-booking diversion programs that let a law enforcement officer direct an apparently mentally ill person detained for a minor offense to a psychiatric emergency room or similar facility where he can be evaluated and offered treatment.\n\nGale also supports post-booking diversion for more serious misdemeanors and even some felonies. Typically, such programs operate in \u201cbehavioral courts,\u201d where mental health caseworkers help defendants to receive housing, counseling, vocational training and other services. Participation, in lieu of time behind bars, is voluntary, and the crime must be linked to the client\u2019s mental illness. People who fail to comply with the services offered them are incarcerated.\n\nCurrently, the federal government does not underwrite the cost of mental health treatment in jail, but it does subsidize community treatment programs outside the lockup.\n\nTerri McDonald, assistant sheriff for custody, said a five-member sheriff\u2019s department team has begun helping inmates apply for benefits under the Affordable Care Act and Medi-Cal, so they can receive treatment at a community facility rather than jail. Diversion programs could eventually assign up to 1,000 mentally ill inmates who do not pose a threat to others to such community-based centers, McDonald said.\n\nThe county\u2019s commitment to such services can easily mean the difference between life and death, according to the mother of a 23-year-old man committed suicide in the county jail last year.\n\nThe woman, who agreed to be interviewed on condition that neither she nor her son be identified, said in a previous incarceration, her son had informed jail deputies that he wanted to kill himself, and they placed him on suicide watch. A judge ordered that the young man be transferred to a facility that treats mental illness and addiction. Instead, the jail released him in the middle of the night.\n\nThe young man\u2019s mother said she and her husband were worried that their son, who was highly agitated following his release, might do himself harm. A detective advised her to swear out a new arrest warrant so the young man could be kept safely in custody until a bed in the treatment facility was available, the woman said.\n\nThis time, she said, even though her son\u2019s fellow inmates told deputies of his threats to kill himself, he was given a bed sheet and placed alone in a cell. Deputies later found he\u2019d used the sheet to hang himself.\n\nIn her grief, the woman has appealed personally to county supervisors to support diversion programs, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be doing what I\u2019m doing, but there\u2019s other people out there like my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I did nothing at all, I would not be able to live with myself. My son did not deserve this, and these people that this is happening to did not deserve this.\u201d\n\nOne organization that Lacey has cited as a possible model for community-based mental health services is Amistad de Los Angeles, the Los Angeles campus of Amity, a non-profit substance abuse treatment agency. With support from government contracts and private donations, Amity offers probationers, parolees and homeless people housing, counseling, substance-abuse therapy, job training and other \u201cwraparound services.\u201d\n\nPeter Starks credits Amity with saving his life. For 15 years, Starks said, he tried to medicate himself with heroin for mental illness rooted in the domestic violence he witnessed as a child and his combat experiences in Vietnam. During that time, he was incarcerated repeatedly. In 2009, he came to Amity, and he\u2019s been sober ever since. In May, the organization hired Starks to advise Amity clients struggling with similar addictions and mental illnesses.\n\nTypically, when a mentally ill inmate is released from county jail, he walks straight onto Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row, where people immediately begin offering drugs, Starks said. His path to sanity started with the fact that an Amity worker picked him up immediately upon his release and drove him straight to Amistad, Starks said.\n\n\u201cThat the county is even considering building another jail, a so-called \u2018mental health jail,\u2019 that\u2019s insane,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be taking that money and putting it into mental health services.\u201d\n\nOriginally posted at California Healthline Report.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1374972679394361}, "description": "By Chris Richard.
