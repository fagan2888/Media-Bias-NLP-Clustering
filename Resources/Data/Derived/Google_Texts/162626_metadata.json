Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, teased his plan in December and is scheduled to release the details of his bill on Tuesday. Until then, Saviello isn\u2019t talking about it other than to say expansion will benefit Maine in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe can accomplish this task by learning from the other states that have extended this coverage,\u201d said Saviello in a written statement Monday. \u201cIncreasing access to health coverage means increasing access to mental health counseling, drug addiction treatment and counseling and preventative health care, providing measureable cost saving and beneficial health outcomes across Maine.\u201d\n\nLittle has changed since the five previous times since 2013 that legislators \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 tried but failed to expand Medicaid eligibility, notwithstanding vetoes from Gov. Paul LePage. Saviello\u2019s fellow Republicans, who, in general, make up the opposition over fears that expanding Medicaid \u2014 known here as MaineCare \u2014 would be too expensive for future taxpayers, hold a majority in the Senate.\n\nThe new effort, sponsored by Saviello and backed by an array of progressive political groups and public health advocates, touts Medicaid expansion as a way for Maine to address a drug addiction crisis. And with a handful of Republican governors in other states changing their positions to allow Medicaid expansion, advocates say there is hope.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nProponents framing this year\u2019s version of expansion as a way to fight Maine\u2019s drug crisis.\n\nAnn Woloson, a policy analyst for Maine Equal Justice Partners, said Monday that she has not seen Saviello\u2019s bill but understands that it samples from the highlights of other states\u2019 expansion plans. Does that mean Medicaid expansion has a chance in Maine this year? Possibly.\n\n\u201cI do hope this year is different,\u201d she said. \u201cSubstance abuse and addiction is not a partisan issue. It\u2019s something that is affecting all of us.\u201d\n\nThere is some evidence that expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a plan under which the federal government has vowed to pay 90 percent of additional costs \u2014 eased costs in some other states\u2019 criminal justice systems.\n\nThe State Reform Assistance Network, which is supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is a proponent of expanding health care across the United States. The organization published a report in November that found Medicaid expansion in some states led to lower medical costs for treating prisoners, better drug relapse prevention rates when prisoners are released and lower recidivism.\n\nThe study claims that Colorado, Michigan and Ohio saw savings of $5 million to $13 million a year on criminal justice costs by expanding coverage that allowed low-income adults to access substance abuse and mental health treatment.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick said Medicaid expansion\u2019s potential benefits in treating addiction could sway some lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWhat is different is that people are starting to make connections between the importance of Medicaid expansion and treatment as we fight the drug epidemic,\u201d said Eves. \u201cThat is something that hasn\u2019t been part of the conversation before and our law enforcement agencies tell us [expanding health coverage] is a critical piece of fighting this.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Justin Alfond of Portland said Saviello\u2019s bill \u2014 though Alfond also hasn\u2019t seen the details \u2014 uses a hybrid approach that melds signing up some Mainers for Medicaid while urging others to buy low-cost insurance on the private market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard it all this session: Law enforcement and health care advocates all saying the same thing, that lack of access to health care is a barrier,\u201d said Alfond. \u201cSen. Saviello is putting forth a new piece to the conversation. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to turn into votes or not but it\u2019s definitely a different approach.\u201d\n\nBut LePage is as opposed to it as ever.\n\nNobody\u2019s more philosophically opposed to Medicaid expansion than LePage, and nothing has changed since his last veto.\n\nHis office rarely comments on legislative proposals in their infancy, but when Saviello announced his in December, the governor pounced with a radio address referring to Saviello and Sen. Roger Katz, R-Augusta \u2014 another expansion proponent \u2014 as \u201cliberal politicians.\u201d\n\nHe suggested they\u2019re looking for votes in the 2016 election \u2014 even though the two moderates are among Maine\u2019s safest legislators, each winning more than 70 percent of district votes in 2014 \u2014 saying he\u2019ll veto such a proposal \u201cevery time electioneering politicians try to bring it up.\u201d\n\nHis main argument is that it will bust Maine\u2019s budget: Recently, he pointed to an October review by the Associated Press of 14 states that have seen Medicaid enrollment surge under expansion, with lawmakers worrying that costs may explode when federal aid decreases. LePage\u2019s administration has rejected studies that say Maine could save money under expansion.\n\nLePage and his lieutenants have argued aggressively against expansion, not just in Maine, but nationally: Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew has warned New Hampshire and Florida lawmakers against expansion.\n\n\u201cIt was the wrong thing to do then,\u201d the governor said in his radio address, \u201cand it\u2019s the wrong thing to do now.\u201d\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s no way for the Legislature to break that stalemate.\n\nMedicaid expansion has passed the Legislature before, but two-thirds majorities are needed to overturn LePage vetoes. Democrats have never been able to wrangle enough votes to do so. The last time it was tried in 2014, LePage\u2019s veto was sustained by just four votes.\n\nBut Democrats held both chambers then. Now, Republicans have control of the Senate and have gained on House Democrats, who have just a nine-member majority.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that an expansion plan would pass in the House, where Democrats are aligned in favor. But Republicans have a 20-14 edge in the Senate with one vacancy, so if only Saviello and Katz join Democrats in favor of expansion, it\u2019ll fail and won\u2019t get to LePage.\n\nSenate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, who has opposed expansion, said Monday that he hasn\u2019t seen details of Saviello\u2019s plan and wants to wait until then to comment on it.\n\nBut Thibodeau acknowledged the proposal\u2019s political uphill battle, saying he\u2019s waiting to see \u201cwhat the significant difference is between what he\u2019s proposing and what we\u2019ve already seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s something significantly different, I would say that it would be highly unlikely to gain traction,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 The Maine Legislature is about to embark \u2014 again \u2014 on another debate over whether the state should expand its Medicaid program under the provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act.
