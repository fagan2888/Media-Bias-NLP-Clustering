And before deciding whether the bill should become law, Susan Ladd says Governor McCrory should consider the confusion this bill will create at the county level.\n\nWhile HB 318 would impact food stamp recipients,the Greensboro News & Record columnist explains this bill would also negatively affect immigrants:\n\nCase in point: House Bill 318, which among other things, banned consular cards and IDs created by communities or nonprofits, such as the FaithAction IDs, as acceptable forms of identification.\n\nGuilford County Register of Deeds Jeff Thigpen and other registers of deed across the state are scrambling to figure out whether they are bound by the language of this bill and how they will deal with Hispanic residents seeking marriage licenses and birth certificates for their children if Gov. Pat McCrory signs it into law. The vast majority of Hispanics use \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 consular IDs to apply for both these vital documents.\n\n\u201cIt would have a significant impact on Hispanics,\u201d Thigpen said. \u201cEven some Hispanics who are citizens use the consular card. The question is, to what extent are we going to deny an applicant who has an unapproved ID, who otherwise has the right to marry?\u201d\n\nHis office conducts an average of 20 marriages each day, and Hispanics using consular cards account for several of those.\n\n\u201cSo much time and energy was put into making consular cards a good standard of identification,\u201d Thigpen said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of work to make sure those cards are secure and solid. If we can\u2019t use that, what does that mean? Do we then accept your power bill? If we can\u2019t use that, are we relying on a less-secure form of identification?\u201d\n\nThere is no explicit guidance in existing statutes about what kind of identification the register of deeds office can accept, but most offices use a common set of guidelines. House Bill 318, however, covers \u201cany government official,\u201d which likely would include employees of the register of deeds.\n\nFor Thigpen, it\u2019s another headache from a legislature that is focused more on its next election slogan \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m tough on immigration\u201d \u2014 than the practical effects this bill might have.\n\n\u201cIt was not well thought out, and there was no discussion with our folks,\u201d Thigpen said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was coming, and haven\u2019t had time to discuss the implications of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "House Bill 318, however, covers \u201cany government official,\u201d which likely would include employees of the register of deeds.\nThe vast majority of Hispanics use \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 consular IDs to apply for both these vital documents.\n\u201cIt would have a significant impact on Hispanics,\u201d Thigpen said.\n\u201cSo much time and energy was put into making consular cards a good standard of identification,\u201d Thigpen said.\nAnd before deciding whether the bill should become law, Susan Ladd says Governor McCrory should consider the confusion this bill will create at the county level."}
