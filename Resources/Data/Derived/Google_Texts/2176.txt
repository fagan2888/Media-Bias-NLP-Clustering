Authorities on Tuesday arrested a man suspected of attacking a Swedish tourist who was slashed on a subway train while making her way to the airport to fly home, the New York Police Department said.

The suspect, a 32-year-old Brooklyn man, had been arrested 54 times previously, nine of which involved some type of knife or blade, a law-enforcement official said.

The victim, a 29-year-old woman, was on her way to John F. Kennedy International Airport with her father when she was assaulted on an A train near the subway station at Euclid Avenue and Pitken Avenue in Brooklyn at about 6:15 p.m. on Monday, authorities said.

Police called the attack unprovoked and said it occurred as the woman went to sit down next to her father. The assailant approached her without saying anything and slashed her on the left side of her neck with a sharp object before fleeing the train, police said.

Her father was about to chase the attacker but the victim called him back as she started to bleed profusely, the official said.

The woman was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for treatment of lacerations to her neck and released, authorities said.

The attacker was captured on surveillance video, police said. The suspect was identified by a tipster, and police found the man at his home on Fountain Avenue in Brooklynâ€™s Cypress Hills neighborhood, still wearing the sweatshirt and pants seen in the surveillance image and with a spot of blood on his hand, the official said.
