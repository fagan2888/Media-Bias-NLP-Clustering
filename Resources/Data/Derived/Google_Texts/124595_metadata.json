While Nelson was able to gingerly walk to the sideline early in the first quarter of Sunday\u2019s 24-19 exhibition loss to Pittsburgh, it might be the last sign of Nelson in his familiar No. 87 jersey this year.\n\nWhile Packers coach Mike McCarthy stressed the defending NFC North champions \u201cwill look for good news\u201d when Nelson is re-evaluated in Green Bay on Monday, quarterback Aaron Rodgers\u2019 expressed equal parts frustration and mystification.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to lose a guy like that in a meaningless game,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nThe play that may change the course of Green Bay\u2019s season started innocently enough. The Packers were driving crisply down the field on their opening possession when Rodgers hit Nelson on a little hitch route. Nelson leapt to make the catch and planted his left leg while turning to face Pittsburgh cornerback Antwon Blake only to unexpectedly drop to his knees, a potentially devastating blow for the Packers and dynamic playmaker who set career highs in receptions (98) and yards receiving (1,519) in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the \u2018What if\u2019 game,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what his status will be. I\u2019m just hoping for the best.\u201d\n\nSo are the Steelers after Pro Bowl center Maurkice Pouncey exited in the first quarter with a left ankle injury coach Mike Tomlin said will likely require surgery. Pouncey, who missed all of 2013 after tearing multiple ligaments in his right knee in the opener against Tennessee, is out indefinitely.\n\n\u201cHe got rolled up on but he walked it off,\u201d Steelers right tackler Marcus Gilbert said. \u201cI was hoping that it wasn\u2019t nothing too bad. Once he got carted off, it struck me.\u201d\n\nREADY TO GO\n\nWhile Nelson and Pouncey are sidelined, Rodgers and Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger appear ready to go.\n\nRodgers completed 4 of 5 passes for 57 yards during two series of work, with one drive ending with a touchdown run by Eddie Lacy and the other with Rodgers getting sacked by James Harrison for a safety. Rodgers banged his forearm on the play and iced it afterward but said he could have continued if it was the regular season.\n\nLacy gave the Packers the lead four plays after Nelson\u2019s exit with a remarkably easy 7-yard touchdown sprint through a massive hole on the left side of the line. A 2-point conversion by James Starks \u2014 through an equally massive hole on the right side \u2014 put Green Bay up 8-0.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done some really good things the first two weeks, but shoot, there\u2019s a lot of football still,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nRoethlisberger finished 11 of 14 for 100 yards and a score, though it took some time to get going.\n\nThe Steelers struggled in the first quarter \u2014 a 58-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Antonio Brown was wiped out by an offensive pass interference penalty \u2014 but regrouped in the second. Working out of the hurry up offense, Roethlisberger led the Steelers 51 yards in seven plays, the last one a little 5-yard flip to a wide open Markus Wheaton that put the Steelers up 9-8 before the reserves took over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a ton of red zone work and that\u2019s one of the plays we\u2019ve been working on and we got the look we wanted,\u201d said Wheaton, who added he\u2019s never been that open when the offense has run that play during training camp.\n\nQUARTERBACKS\n\nGreen Bay second-string quarterback Scott Tolzien completed 11 of 19 passes for 102 yards and a 21-yard score to Richard Rodgers late in the first half.\n\nBruce Gradkowski\u2019s preseason debut was brief. The primary backup behind Roethlisberger spent the first three weeks of training camp on the physically unable to perform list with a sore arm. He connected on 3 of 5 passes for 12 yards before leaving with a left finger injury.\n\nThird-stringer Landry Jones, trying to convince the Steelers to keep him around, tossed a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns to complete a rally from a 10-point deficit.\n\nOTHER INJURIES\n\nGreen Bay guard T.J. Lang went out in the first half to be monitored for a concussion. Linebacker Adrian Hubbard and cornerback Damarious Randall were treated with IV fluids due to dehydration.\n\nPittsburgh defensive lineman Stephon Tuitt injured his left ankle.\n\nIN A RUSH\n\nThe Steelers collected six sacks in all, including two by rookie linebacker Bud Dupree. The first-round pick from Kentucky was also in the area when Harrison tagged Rodgers for Pittsburgh\u2019s first score.\n\n\u201cI just feel like things are starting to come together a little bit, just being patient,\u201d Dupree said. \u201cI know eventually I\u2019m going to keep doing good and get better and better each week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jordy Nelson leaves with knee injury as Packers fall to Steelers", "title": "Jordy Nelson leaves with knee injury as Packers fall to Steelers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/jordy-nelson-leaves-with-knee-injury-as-packers-fall-to-steelers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_011840_jordy-nelson.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_011840_jordy-nelson.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T13:16:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:03:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9279\"", "article_summary": "A 2-point conversion by James Starks \u2014 through an equally massive hole on the right side \u2014 put Green Bay up 8-0.\nThe Packers were driving crisply down the field on their opening possession when Rodgers hit Nelson on a little hitch route.\nOnce he got carted off, it struck me.\u201dREADY TO GOWhile Nelson and Pouncey are sidelined, Rodgers and Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger appear ready to go.\nWhile Packers coach Mike McCarthy stressed the defending NFC North champions \u201cwill look for good news\u201d when Nelson is re-evaluated in Green Bay on Monday, quarterback Aaron Rodgers\u2019 expressed equal parts frustration and mystification.\nTwo steps later, Green Bay\u2019s Pro Bowl wide receiver was on the turf, his left knee injured and his season very much in doubt."}
