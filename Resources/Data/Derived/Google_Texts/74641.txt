(Digital Journal) Chile’s first drawbridge has been hit with an engineering fault: one of it’s traffic decks was built upside down in an error blamed on Spanish engineers.

The bridge, in Valdivia, was supposed to open this month after a $30 million engineering programme.

It was reported that the mistake was only noticed when engineers inspected their handy work.
