Jeff Fischbach is a digital forensics expert and an Obamacare enrollee. Well, he was an Obamacare enrollee. Unfortunately, Kaiser Permanente terminated his coverage in January. And now the health care behemoth is threatening to refer him to a collections agency. Why? Well, we’ll let him explain in his own words:

@KPMemberService dropped my #ObamaCare in Jan, didn't tell me until Feb, blamed it on @CoveredCA, who blame it on @KPShare & won't return the $1600 premiums I paid. Now I'm being sent to collections for $0.00, due to services I received in Jan. Anyone need a good news story? A photo posted by Jeff Fischbach (@fischtech) on Apr 28, 2015 at 4:49pm PDT

That’s what Democrats call a smashing success, right Sen. Harry Reid?

We look forward to Fischbach’s review of Covered California on Yelp.
