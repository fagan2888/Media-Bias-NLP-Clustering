An arrest is not a presumption of guilt.\n\nThe Southern Arizona Rescue Association has been responding to more calls for help from hikers the past several weeks, according to officials with the agency.\n\nThey said the number of rescues has increased to one every few days, and even multiple rescues on the weekends.\n\nSome hikers said they prepare and pack what they need for all of their hikes.\n\n\"Fruit and granola bars and water. Usually like a bottle of water for every hour,\" said Jim Keyes, who hikes multiple times a week.\n\n\"We always take water, sometimes we take snacks, and we take our binoculars because we like to look at everything. The other thing we take is our cellphone,\" said Marty and Dennis Kelly.\n\nBut some hikers are less prepared or get injured while enjoying the trails and call for help.\n\n\"The hikers can be out of water, dehydrated, injured, sometimes ankle injures sometimes worse than that. Sometimes just heat exhaustion,\" said Shelley Littin, an EMT with SARA,\n\nLittin, along with the other trained volunteers with the organization say they're ready for any kind of a call. They work along side Pima County Sheriff deputies when a hiker calls 911.\n\nShe said they get the most calls in the afternoon and right as it gets dark. Volunteers with SARA are on-call 24 hours a day.\n\n\"We provide medical assistance if it's required. Offer them whatever assistance they need to get them out,\" Littin said.\n\nLittin stresses the importance of being well prepared when heading outdoors. Food, water and a cell phone are a must, but she said it's better to take more than what you think you might need.\n\n\"Light, breathable, comfortable clothing for exercise. Good, solid, sturdy shoes. Take lights even if you're not intending to be out after dark.\n\nSARA is made up of volunteers. Littin said there are about 40 active volunteers.\n\nFind more information about SARA here: http://sarci.org/sara/\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
