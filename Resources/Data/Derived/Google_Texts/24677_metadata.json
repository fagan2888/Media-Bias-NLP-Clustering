The federal government helps cover the cost of the healthcare plans for members of Congress and their staffs.Johnson said the special treatment afforded Congress and their employees creates a \"wedge\" with constituents.This week, a federal judge dismissed Johnson's suit on the grounds that Johnson did not have legal standing to bring it. Johnson said he is considering an appeal. He accused Obama of \"revising history\" for political purposes by \"unilaterally\" changing the law.In this week's conflicting federal court rulings, one court said the IRS should not have offered subsidies to people who buy insurance in the federal exchange, while another court upheld the subsidies, according to Fox News \"Both courts came to different conclusions, but you know, from my standpoint it's pretty clear. It says the subsidies can be paid to policies purchased on exchanges established by the state, and it's just very clear in its wording.\"What we're seeing repeatedly with Obamacare is President Obama, even though his allies wrote it, he signed it \u2014 this is his signature piece of legislation \u2014 [but] he continues to make changes to the law. He amends it, he delays it, and he does not have the executive authority,\" Johnson charged.He predicted the Affordable Care Act will end up back before the Supreme Court.\"Unless [Obama] is stopped, unless he is checked, unless the judiciary actually does engage in these separation of powers disputes, he will continue to be this arrogant,\" Johnson said. \"He will continue to govern unilaterally, unconstitutionally, and that threatens everybody's freedom.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare, appeals courts, rulings, Affordable Care Act, Ron Johnson", "pubdate": "2014-07-23T12:17:08", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The two conflicting rulings issued this week by separate courts about Obamacare subsidies  strike to the heart of the problem of Obamacare, Sen.
