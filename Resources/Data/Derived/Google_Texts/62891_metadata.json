Kay Hagan (D-NC) visited Cherokee on Wednesday, Aug. 6 and met with tribal leaders while touring sites around the reservation.\n\nShe met with Tribal Council representatives, Principal Chief Michell Hicks, Vice Chief Larry Blythe, several tribal program directors, and she ended her day by meeting with children at the Birdtown Recreation Center.\n\n\u201cI took a tour of the Casino which was impressive, had an incredible lunch and met a lot of people, a lot of workers,\u201d said Sen. Hagan. \u201cWe had a lot of discussion about the new casino going up in Murphy and just about the economic opportunities that it affords, not just with jobs, but also with the investment back into the community.\u201d\n\nSen. Hagan praised the Tribe for putting money into education, child care, and other essential programs. \u201cThat is what\u2019s building the Cherokee nation. It is very important. To me, it\u2019s all about education and that early education to ensure that the children learn and are in a safe environment and are able to be very productive Cherokees.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about the school and the Big Cove Road issue as well as the National Park Service and the ruling that will come out soon about the ramp gathering.\u201d\n\nChief Hicks commented, \u201cWe\u2019re obviously very glad that she\u2019s here, but I think that the thing we wanted to show today was the progress that the Tribe has made especially with the services that we\u2019re providing.\u201d\n\nHe said it was nice to be able to show Sen. Hagan the new school, the Kituwah Academy, and the progress being made on the construction of the new hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about something, but it\u2019s more meaningful if you can talk and see it at the same time. We can make a lot more progress that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s aware of a lot of the major initiatives now, and as she goes back to D.C. she can think about some of the things that we\u2019re doing and maybe help us in more ways than even we thought about. I definitely think the visit has helped our relationship.\u201d\n\nVice Chief Blythe related, \u201cShe\u2019s been able to spend almost an entire day with us today. We just want to continue to show what we\u2019re doing here with the Tribe, and some of the things that she\u2019s voted on help us and impact the services that we\u2019re able to provide for our people.\u201d\n\nHe said key votes on legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) have been \u201cvery beneficial\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s taken some tough votes and some tough hits, but as I told the Council, she\u2019s my Senator and I support her. Getting her here today is good for the Tribe. It\u2019s a good way for us to put our best foot forward\u2026it\u2019s just part of good governance and keeping up good relationships.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Magazine3 Framework", "og": {"site_name": "The Cherokee One Feather", "description": "Sen.
