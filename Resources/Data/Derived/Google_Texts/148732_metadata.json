Water was expected to cover Colorado 144 and railroad tracks to the east near Good rich on Monday.\n\nThe Antelope, Kiowa and Bijou creeks that cross under Interstate 76 as they flow toward the main stem of the South Platte were rising with higher water flowing toward the highway.\n\nMorgan County authorities issued pre-evacuation alerts, notifying residents of Orchard and Goodrich to be ready to run.\n\n\u201cIt has not crested yet in our area,\u201d Undersheriff Dave Martin said. \u201cThe ground is saturated now \u2013 not absorbing much because it is saturated.\u201d\n\nThe Arkansas River in southern Colorado was flowing at near flood levels, too, according to weather bulletins. And until noon Monday, meteorologists said, they also saw a potential for flooding along the Cache La Poudre River near Greeley as well as low land in several eastern counties.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is a lot of the county roads are under water. We\u2019ve got flooding water that will be slowly moving down the Platte over the next 24 hours,\u201d Weather Service forecaster Scott Entrekin said.\n\nThe South Platte level was expected to peak at 11.2 feet near the town of Weldona on Monday \u2014 less than the 19.2 feet during the 2013 floods, Entrekin said.\n\nMeanwhile, metro Denver and other northern Front Range residents \u2014 who on Sunday navigated slushy roads and dealt with tree branches torn from snow-laden trees \u2014 likely will see calmer conditions.\n\nTemperatures were expected to drop below freezing Sunday night but should warm to the 50s Monday along the Front Range, weather service meteorologist Jim Kalina said. Possible fog Monday morning likely will lift, leading to cloudy and partly cloudy conditions Monday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see any additional rainfall or snowfall,\u201d Kalina said.\n\nThe question remains whether the unusual storm that hit Saturday was a blip \u2014 or a sign of the increased extreme weather some climate change models predict in the future.\n\nWidespread flooding in northern Colorado in September 2013 has piqued concerns among Colorado city, county and state officials, who are trying to build resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had times where we had tornadoes, blizzards and floods at the same time,\u201d Kalina said, referring to the 1980s.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s pretty uncommon to get everything at once. Sign of things to come? Hard to say. Here in Colorado, you always get unusual weather and this has happened in the past. It is probably going to happen in the future.\u201d\n\nPower outages affected about 43,350 Xcel Energy customers in metro Denver before it was restored. The Colorado State Patrol reported no fatalities or major accidents due to weather.\n\nThe floodwaters east of metro Denver swamped and tipped over an ambulance in Morgan County. A patient and paramedics escaped.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Pueblo firefighters rushed to rescue a 15-year-old stranded in the Arkansas River, where the water surged too high as the boy was fishing with a friend. The firefighters formed a chain and waded into the raging waters to pull him out of the river.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really high and it\u2019s still going up,\u201d Pueblo police Sgt. Dustin Dodge said. \u201cIt\u2019s running way too high to go wading.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Flood-level waters rage eastward, swamping Colorado prairie", "title": "Flood-level waters rage eastward, swamping Colorado prairie", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/10/flood-level-waters-rage-eastward-swamping-colorado-prairie/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510_093207_colorado-snow.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510_093207_colorado-snow.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T08:58:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T21:44:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The National Weather Service has forecast moderate to severe flooding in northeastern Colorado through Wednesday along the South Platte River.\nTemperatures were expected to drop below freezing Sunday night but should warm to the 50s Monday along the Front Range, weather service meteorologist Jim Kalina said.\nWe\u2019ve got flooding water that will be slowly moving down the Platte over the next 24 hours,\u201d Weather Service forecaster Scott Entrekin said.\nWidespread flooding in northern Colorado in September 2013 has piqued concerns among Colorado city, county and state officials, who are trying to build resilience.\nWater was expected to cover Colorado 144 and railroad tracks to the east near Good rich on Monday."}
