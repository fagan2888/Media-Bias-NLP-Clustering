That is the view shared by 100 health care professionals who gathered at the 33rd annual meeting of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness in Ontario, California over the weekend. They forecast a future of decreased quality of health care and access to doctors if current policies continue.\n\n\u201cWhat do I mean by medical meltdown? Well, sadly ,I\u2019m here to tell you that the medical care you\u2019ve enjoyed in the past in your life is simply not going to be there in the future,\u201d said orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lee Hieb, who addressed the conference.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nJust like a black hole is so dense that no light gets out, \u201cWe have so much regulation that almost no medical care gets out,\u201d Hieb told the audience. \u201cWe have over 160,000 pages of Medicare regulation and counting.\u201d She continued, \u201cObamacare is Medicare on steroids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason we have a shortage of doctors today and we\u2019re going to get worse in the future began in the early 70s because the great gurus of government looked around and they said probably\u2026look at all this money that\u2019s being sent to all these specialists.\u201d Hieb went on to say that government bureaucrats decided to limit the number of specialists.\n\nHowever, Lieb notes, that the U.S. is only seeing 350 new general surgeons a year. That is not even a replacement rate, she observed.\n\nHieb professed that being taxed to death and having to send so much money to the government is a disincentive for doctors to work at full capacity.\n\n\u201cOur young people are not trained as well as we were,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWe are now the number one profession for suicide. We lose 400 doctors a year to suicide. That\u2019s like losing an entire medical school,\u201d Hieb stated.\n\nHieb also cited a shortage of \u201cthings\u201d or medical supplies\u2013the first she has seen in her 40 years of involvement in medicine. She recalled almost having to close an operating room for shortages of propofols, which are used to put people to sleep; as well as shortages of tetanus vaccine, shoulder catheters and thyroid medication shortages, among other items.\n\nThe cause, according to Hieb, is \u201cthis huge over-regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nShe elaborated on the thyroid example, saying,\n\nThese are old medicines that have lost their patent and they\u2019ve been produced without a problem in these factories for years, but the government rolls in and says you have to bring this factory up to some arbitrary new standard and these guys say, well, we can\u2019t do that because\u2013guess what? you guys price fixed. You tell us what you\u2019re going to pay, Medicare\u2019s going to pay for this stuff. We can bill anything we want to, we get paid what you tell us you get paid, and now you\u2019re telling us we have to spend all this money to modernize our factories. We\u2019re going to lose money, we can\u2019t do that, so we\u2019re going to shut down. So after a few factories shut down in one of these nationwide shortages in classic bureaucratic fashion, the government says well wait a minute, wait a minute, you can\u2019t shut down.\n\nYou said, \u201cwhat, what do you mean we can\u2019t shut down?\u201d\n\n[They say] Well, okay, I guess you can shut down, but you\u2019re going to have to give us six months notice.\n\nThey just don\u2019t get it.\n\nShe pointed the audience to Venezuela as a picture of the \u201cend game.\u201d\n\nHieb cited a story written by Dr. Richard Amerling and published in the Wall Street Journal (and summarized in Newsmax) that documented the plight of Pedro Gonzalez. Gonzalez, Amerling wrote, checked into a leading Venezuelan public hospital for life saving heart valve surgery. About two months later, all of the cardiac ward patients were discharged due to lack of operating room supplies according to a letter issued. Gonzalez collapsed and died a week later.\n\n\u201cThe free market doesn\u2019t come up with shortages this way, but we are starting to see it,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cIf you live in a very affluent area and you\u2019re privately insured and your neighbors are privately insured, you will probably not\u2026won\u2019t see it as quickly as other places.\u201d\n\nHieb referenced work in an Arizona area where 85% of payers were government-paid through Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. Four orthopedic surgeons would do the work that 10, 11 or 12 in more affluent Flagstaff would take on. She said the average orthopedic surgeon in America takes care of 12,000 people. Conversely, the region where Hieb worked was serving approximately 90,000, which later ballooned to 120,000 as Hieb left and only three surgeons remained. She said her 53-year-old former colleague from the region died thereafter under the long and strenuous work.\n\n\u201cThe big black hole is already starting to open up,\u201d Hieb said.\n\nShe mentioned traveling two hours to reach an obstetrician, waiting six hours to be seen by an orthopedic surgeon, or three or four months to see a rheumatologist as problems facing those in less affluent regions.\n\n\u201cIn a free market, when there\u2019s a shortage, it gets filled,\u201d Hieb said.\n\nHieb then launched into health recommendations for \u201chow to save yourself.\u201d She said going into the future, \u201cyou want to be so healthy that you don\u2019t need a doctor\u201d in light of the impending medical shortages which she had detailed.\n\nDr. Hieb is listed in the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness program as \u201can orthopedic surgeon specializing in spine surgery and a past president of the Assn. of American Physicians and Surgeons.\u201d\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "America faces a deep shortage of doctors as Obamacare is implemented.
