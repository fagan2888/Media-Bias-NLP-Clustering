Having said that, people who commit crimes and in this case, felonies as I understand it, need to be excluded and removed from our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving in America is a privilege. Coming to America is a privilege and those who come to America and commit crimes \u2014 serious crimes under the comprehensive immigration reform passed by the Senate and every other common sense view of immigration reform, in my opinion, includes assuring that we will remove [them] from the country from wherever they may be located \u2014 people who commit serious felonies in our country, particularly multiple felonies \u2014 as was the case here,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nWhen asked if cities that are safe havens to illegal immigrants should inform federal authorities when they have such an individual, Hoyer responded, \u201cIn my view, yes.\u201d\n\nFour years ago an illegal immigrant from Ecuador raped a 9-year old girl in Baltimore, and the city\u2019s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings Blake, signed an order one-year later banning police and social agencies from asking any person about their immigration status.\n\nRepublican House leadership has in recent years not acted on legislation that went after sanctuary cities either. Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta proposed in July of 2011 a bill that would prohibit federal money to any city that did not comply with federal immigration law. The legislation went as far as the Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement and died in committee.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s order also barred city funds, resources or staff from investigating anyone suspected of violating federal immigration law.\n\nfollow @KerryPicket on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kerry Picket", "description": "House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer says that the over 200 sanctuary cities like Baltimore and San Francisco should be informing federal authorities like ICE when", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "WASHINGTON -- House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer says that the over 200 sanctuary cities like Baltimore and San Francisco should be informing federal authorities when local law enforcement arrest felons", "title": "Hoyer To Sanctuary Cities: Inform Feds About Felons", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/07/hoyer-to-sanctuary-cities-inform-feds-about-felons/", "image": {"width": 794, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T164516Z_1_CBRE9B21AJN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1398785735471.jpg", "height": 342}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'People who commit crimes and in this case, felonies as I understand it, need to be excluded and removed from our country'", "title": "Hoyer To Sanctuary Cities: Inform Feds About Felons Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/07/hoyer-to-sanctuary-cities-inform-feds-about-felons/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T164516Z_1_CBRE9B21AJN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1398785735471.jpg"}, "creator": "@KerryPicket", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-07 14:21:49", "sailthru.title": "Hoyer To Sanctuary Cities: Inform Feds About Felons", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "illegal-immigration,kerry-picket", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "illegal immigration,sanctuary cities,steny hoyer", "sailthru.description": "WASHINGTON -- House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer says that the over 200 sanctuary cities like Baltimore and San Francisco should be informing federal authorities when local law enforcement arrest felons", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T164516Z_1_CBRE9B21AJN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1398785735471.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The mayor\u2019s order also barred city funds, resources or staff from investigating anyone suspected of violating federal immigration law.\nPennsylvania Republican Rep.
