Georgetown finally showed it can be a bully in March again.\n\nD'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 25 points, Mikael Hopkins had 10 points and nine rebounds, and fourth-seeded Georgetown avoided another NCAA tournament upset by beating No. 13 seed Eastern Washington, 84-74, on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we were playing basketball. I wouldn\u2019t want to wrestle or play football against them,\u201d said Eastern Washington coach Jim Hayford. \u201cThey were intense.\u201d\n\nFor good reason, too.\n\nThe Hoyas had lost four of their last five tournament games \u2014 all to teams seeded 10th or worse \u2014 and fell behind by seven in the first half to the 3-point happy Eagles. Hayford had also predicted on a national radio show Wednesday that the Eagles would win, grabbing headlines that reached Georgetown\u2019s locker room.\n\nHoyas coach John Thompson III said his players told him of the interview, and they were as eager as anybody to show \u2014 not talk about \u2014 what they could do.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need to stoke them up and didn\u2019t want to calm them down,\u201d Thompson said, then fired a friendly verbal jab back at Hayford\u2019s failed prediction.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me, but when I think of that, I think of Joe Namath, I think of Muhammad Ali, I think of Larry Bird and the 3-point shooting contest,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe kids brought it to me and said, \u2018Their coach is guaranteeing victory.\u2019 I kind of looked down there at him. Thought he didn\u2019t foot the bill of guys that usually guarantee victory. Our guys were fired up about that.\u201d\n\nGeorgetown got its groove back behind effort, energy and its own long-range touch. The Hoyas went ahead by 23 points early in the second half and held off Eastern Washington\u2019s late rally.\n\nThey will face No. 5 Utah on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe felt like we had something to prove just in general,\u201d said Georgetown\u2019s Jabril Trawick, who added 10 points.\n\nNational scoring leader Tyler Harvey finished with 27 points, and Venky Jois had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Eagles, who entered averaging 80.8 points behind Harvey\u2019s 22.9 per game.\n\nHayford said he didn\u2019t regret his comments \u2014 they were meant to give his players confidence. And Hayford and his players agreed the words had little impact on the game.\n\nInstead, the outcome had everything to do with Georgetown.\n\n\u201cWe needed to shoot really well. Credit to them \u2014 they stopped us,\u201d Jois said.\n\nThe Hoyas had hoped to exploit their size advantage, but Joshua Smith \u2014 their 6-foot-10, 350-pound center \u2014 picked up his second foul with 15:46 remaining in the first half and went to the bench. Smith was called for his third foul just nine seconds into the second half and exited again.\n\nThe Eagles spread the floor and played just the kind of game they wanted: fast and filled with lots of 3-point attempts.\n\nThe problem? Georgetown could shoot, too.\n\nEastern Washington made six of its first 12 shots from beyond the arc and took a 24-17 lead. But the Hoyas found their own stroke from deep, closing the half with a flurry to go up 43-33.\n\nGeorgetown finished 11-for-23 from long range. Eastern Washington was 9-for-28.\n\nSmith-Rivera put the exclamation point on Georgetown\u2019s streaky shooting by hitting consecutive 3-pointers during a second-half spurt that put the Hoyas ahead, 58-35.\n\nThe Eagles, who rallied from 11 points down to beat Montana in the Big Sky championship, put a stir into the crowd when they closed within seven in the final seconds, but their last comeback bid simply ran out of time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All the talk that the Hoyas couldn't handle underdogs can hush.
