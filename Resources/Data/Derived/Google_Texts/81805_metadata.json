It has only posted profit once in the past nine years and has been hit with high operating costs, according to Business Wire. The company previously filed for bankruptcy in 2007, and closed 104 stores but re-emerged a year later.\n\nHancock is one of the world\u2019s largest fabric retailers, more than $283 million in sales in 2014. The company was founded in 1957 in Tupelo, Mississippi, as a low-cost retail store. By 1971, it owned over 81 stores and had over 265 franchise stores in 19 states.\n\nThe retailer is currently having a nationwide \u201cGoing Out of Business Sale,\u201d with the company offering 20 to 50 percent off all merchandise in store and online. All sales are final.\n\nHancock operates four stores in the Greater Washington area, including Alexandria, Manassas, and Gaithersburg.
