Madison, SD

A work crew at Dakota State University has set up new bat houses on campus.



The placement of the bat roosts is the latest step in finding alternative housing for the flying mammals, which have gone inside some campus buildings and even interrupted a class.



Each of the two new bat roosts can house up to 250 bats. Students, the Madison Area Arts Council and other community members earlier hosted an event to raise funds to pay for the houses.



The houses come from a Wisconsin-based company and are certified by Bat Conservation International.
