Louisiana is now ranked 51 in social justice. We are not making that up.\n\nThe Times-Picayune actually wrote it up as a serious news story.\n\nLow-income families, immigrants and workers of color are worse off in Louisiana than anywhere else in the nation, Loyola University researchers said Thursday (March 17). The inaugural \u201cJustSouth\u201d index purports to measure social justice. It ranked Louisiana dead last on measures of poverty, racial disparity and exclusion \u2014 \u201ca grim picture,\u201d Jesuit Social Research Institute policy specialist Jeanie Donovan said. The other Gulf states were almost as bad. Alabama placed 48th, Texas 49th and Mississippi 50th. Florida had the highest ranking in the region, 41st place. Vermont scored the highest, followed by New Hampshire and Hawaii. The study was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Among the problems in Louisiana: The average low-income household earned only $11,156 in 2014. The institute calculates that a two-person family needs to earn \u201c$45,840 a year to afford basic necessities,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nAlmost all low-income households spent more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent.\n\nMinority workers earned, on average, four fifths what their white peers made.\n\nOne third of poor families lacked health insurance.\n\nJust 59 percent of immigrants in Louisiana had health insurance, and it could not all be explained by immigration status. It reflects the region\u2019s history of \u201cslavery, Jim Crow segregation and continuing inequality,\u201d said the Rev. Fred Kammer, director of the institute.\n\nWhen Louisiana doesn\u2019t meet leftist expections on poverty and income inequality they just blame it on slavery and segregation. That\u2019s always been the ticket. It\u2019s never the fault of institutionalized corruption, a failed education system, and the lack of a competitive and diversified economy. But then again, leftists really don\u2019t want to focus on the failures of government do they.\n\nThe social justice \u201cstudy\u201d measured three things: poverty, racial disparity, and immigrant exclusion (whatever the hell that is.)\n\nThen Loyola University, which is about as Catholic as Planned Parenthood, brought up some sob stories to go along with their \u201cstudy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre the numbers really sad? Yes. But that\u2019s the reality that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Cristi Rosales-Fajardo, an immigrant advocate. \u201cThese numbers represent someone\u2019s life. These numbers represent my life.\u201d Rosales-Fajardo revealed that she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer three days before. Her doctor asked why she hadn\u2019t come for an exam in four years. \u201cI could not afford it,\u201d she said. Even emergency trips to the hospital were a burden.\n\nBut I thought Obamacare and Planned Parenthood were supposed to provide this.\n\nErika Zucker, a policy advocate at the Workplace Justice Project, described employers cheating workers who were vulnerable: women, immigrants and people of color, sometimes threatening or intimidating them to keep it quiet. For instance, restaurant workers might not be allowed to clock in until several hours after they began work. Contractors sometimes don\u2019t pay workers, claiming the owner hasn\u2019t paid them. \u201cWage theft is pervasive across industries,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cIf it\u2019s someone that you think is a low-wage worker, we\u2019ve probably seen them come through the door.\u201d Shorting workers also contributes to the state\u2019s budget crisis, Zucker said, by keeping various taxes out of the coffers. Louisiana faces a $70 million budget gap for the fiscal year that ends in June, and a $750 million gap next year. If companies were forced to pay their employees and to report it accurately, \u201cWe could fill a little bit of that hole,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is illegal. Here\u2019s a question, instead of spending money on this \u201cstudy\u201d wouldn\u2019t that money be better spent on I don\u2019t know, educating workers on their rights under the law?\n\nDon\u2019t worry though, these guys have solutions. Stop me if you\u2019ve already heard them already:\n\nExpand Medicaid under Obamacare\n\nDouble the Earned Income Tax Credit\n\nMore \u201chousing subsidies\u201d such as Section 8\n\nIncrease the minimum wage\n\nNowhere in those \u201csolutions\u201d include actually growing and diversifying Louisiana\u2019s economy. That\u2019s how you will cure systematic poverty in this state. You won\u2019t solve this problem with more government programs and artificial minimum wage hikes so contractors and business owners can not pay their employees more money.\n\nBut John Bel Edwards, the socialists at Loyola University, and the whole lefty social justice crowd are not actually interested in lifting people out of poverty. They want to shift the blame for poverty to their political enemies and make them pay more money to lefties in the name of \u201cfighting poverty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "A leftist outfit at Loyola University New Orleans has produced a leftist-funded study saying Louisiana's leftist government fails at a whole bunch of leftist issues.
