A coincidence or an omen? Colorado State University’s mascot CAM the Ram died in the hours leading up to the 2015 Rocky Mountain Showdown, CSU President Tony Frank confirmed Saturday.

CAM’s replacement, a young Rambouillet sheep, was in attendance at Saturday’s game at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

The Fort Collins-based university has had about two dozen CAM the Rams in its history, beginning the tradition in 1945.
