Brian Schweitzer \u2014 a self-styled populist Democrat who has long been rumored to be planning a run for the White House in 2016 \u2014 says that Southern men \u201care a little effeminate\u201d and that outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor sets off his \u201cgaydar\u201d to around \u201c60-70 percent.\u201d He also criticizes Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s relationship with the NSA, implementing a metaphor in which the influential California Democrat is likened to a prostitute. As you might imagine, these comments have not gone unnoticed.\n\nWhen Salon called Schweitzer earlier this week (before the National Journal profile was published), though, the two-term governor and current MSNBC contributor had other things than effeminacy and the sex trade on his mind. In a wide-ranging interview conducted just after Schweitzer had appeared on \u201cThe Ed Show,\u201d Schweitzer sounded off on the latest news from Iraq, why the Middle East isn\u2019t America\u2019s problem, why we should think twice before trusting the judgment of Hillary Clinton, how President Obama mucked-up healthcare reform and why he decided to speak at Mitt Romney\u2019s annual donor gala. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow\u2019ve you enjoyed your new gig on MSNBC, and being a media guy in general?\n\nI\u2019m supposedly a media guy, but I\u2019m not reporting any news. I\u2019m saying what I think about things. I\u2019ve done that most of my life. I did it for a time as governor of Montana. I was governor for eight years. Before that I was in private business. Now I\u2019m in private business again, but this gives me an opportunity to say to a new group of people what I think about things.\n\nWhich issues have you been most fired up about discussing with this new, larger audience?\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been fired up for some time, if you\u2019ve heard my discussion [on MSNBC]. I lived in the Middle East. I lived in Libya for a little less than a year, Saudi Arabia for about seven [years] during the \u201980s. I was living in Saudi Arabia, working in Saudi Arabia, while Iraq was fighting its war with Iran. I fully understood, like everybody else in the Middle East, that Iraq was the tip of the spear for the rest of our allies \u2014 Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait \u2014 and while Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, let\u2019s be honest: the Saudi Royal Family, the Kuwaiti Royal Family, the Egyptian leaders \u2026 there\u2019s a limited number of good guys that are running countries in the Middle East.\n\nBut the one thing everybody seems to agree on among our Sunni allies is that the most dangerous actor in the neighborhood was Iran. So Iraq lost about a million people and Iran lost about a million people in that conflict; but Iraq was keeping Iran busy. So few people would listen to [former Sen.] Robert Byrd or, for that matter, this rancher in Montana who was screaming at the top of their lungs to anyone who would listen, \u201cWhat are you doing? Iraq is what\u2019s keeping the Middle East stable right now because they\u2019re occupying Iran\u2019s time. The enemy of your enemy is your friend!\u201d So then we went into Iraq under completely false pretenses, but any of those folks who supported going in either knew, or should\u2019ve known, it didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nIt does feel a bit as if we\u2019re leaving a dream period when we thought we could just forget about Iraq \u2014\n\nNo! No, no, no. Let\u2019s think about this for a little bit. I don\u2019t want to hear revision history from Lindsey Graham or George Bush people or Wolfowitz or Perle. I don\u2019t want to hear anybody who supported going into Iraq saying, \u201cOh, well, gee, if only we would\u2019ve stayed there longer \u2026\u201d You\u2019ve lost your right to give me an opinion because you were so wrong and so many people lost their lives.\n\nI\u2019m passionate about this. The second day I was governor of Montana, I got in a Blackhawk helicopter and I went to my first funeral for a young man who came back dead [from Iraq]. The day that I was sworn in, I had no idea that I would be governor during the longest period of war in the history of the state. I had no idea that I would go to more of these funerals than any governor in the history of Montana. And at every single one of them I seethed with anger \u2014 anger at those people in Washington, D.C., who decided to send these people to their deaths, and maimed people. Because it was a false mission from the beginning \u2026 I looked around during these funerals, and I saw the grieving families, and I hugged the grieving mothers, and I did everything I could do to comfort them. I didn\u2019t see those [pro-war] senators [at the funeral]. I didn\u2019t see those people at the Department of Defense who sent them [to Iraq]. I didn\u2019t see them at those funerals, helping those families get back on their feet.\n\nAnd now to have the same cats in some cases, and the same kind of cats in other cases, trying to tell us why it is that we ought to go back to Iraq, and sort of defend those lines that were written at the end of WWI, separating the Sunnis and the Shiites and the Kurds, and calling it a place called Iraq and calling it other countries \u2026 these borders only make sense because we were dividing up the oil assets of the Middle East at the time. And [intervening in the region] only makes sense if we need the oil assets from the Middle East in the future \u2014 and we don\u2019t. We are moving rapidly to energy independence.\n\nSince you mentioned the basically artificial nature of many of the borders between states in the Middle East, I wanted to ask you if you agree with those who want to revisit a plan Vice President Biden put forward back when he was senator that would\u2019ve essentially partitioned Iraq, allowing each group \u2014 Sunni, Shia and Kurds \u2014 to run their own affairs?\n\nBiden wasn\u2019t wrong at all. You could\u2019ve asked me and I would\u2019ve given you the same [answer]. The only glue that kept Iraq together was a strong-armed dictator that was willing to kill you if you crossed him. He used the chemical weapons that we gave him the capacity to make on the Iranians \u2014 and for that we cheered him, apparently \u2014 and when he starting using them on the Kurds we said, \u201cOh, now, come on! That\u2019s not very nice!\u201d\n\nThis [conflict] goes back a long time. The difference between Sunni and Shiite goes back a long, long time. The Sunnis believe that, after Mohammed died, they ought to be able to, as an Islamic nation, elect a new leader of Islam. The Shiites said at the time, and ever since, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t elect it. It has to be a direct descendant of Mohammed.\u201d That\u2019s the key difference between Sunni and Shiite. Within the Sunnis there are the Wahhabis \u2014 [who] are very conservative within Saudi Arabia [and] who spawned Osama bin Laden \u2014 who were outraged that an infidel army (us, the United States) was propping up \u2026 the Saudi Royal Family \u2026 To have an infidel army in the country that protects the hajj cities is what was making these Wahhabis crazy. We spawned Osama bin Laden. By the way, we also funded him when he was called the Mujahedin and was in Afghanistan fighting the Russians, but I digress \u2026\n\nSo you support the idea of partitioning the country?\n\nHere\u2019s what I think about it: Put your pencil away! They can partition their own country. We\u2019re not going to partition them. Build your energy supplies in the United States; then you don\u2019t need the Persian Gulf; then you don\u2019t need those oil resources. Then it becomes the problem of the people who live in the Middle East and those people who need to buy [the Middle East\u2019s oil] \u2014 the Asians and the Europeans. Let them worry about it.\n\nHow do you feel Obama has been handling the drumbeat to get involved again with Iraq, this time because of ISIS?\n\nI don\u2019t know. The drums are beating and I see the guys holding the sticks like Jon McCain and Wolfowitz and all the Bushies. I think I don\u2019t hear that music [laughs]. Put down the instruments. You\u2019re done playing the music. Some people listened to you one time before. What was it, 79 senators voted to go to war and 250 or so members of the house who voted to go in Iraq? They didn\u2019t listen to those of us who knew better last time. So all of you who played that music, put the instruments down. We don\u2019t want to hear that anymore.\n\nDo you feel the same way about people who maybe weren\u2019t playing it, but they were dancing to it?\n\nYep.\n\nDo you feel that supporting that war should sort of be disqualifying on foreign policy issues, forever?\n\nTo have been so wrong so recently about a thing and a place \u2014 and now offering opinions on the same place \u2014 I think so. I think you\u2019ve lost your credibility. Here\u2019s the way I see it: If somebody lights fire to your barn and all your livestock get out, they don\u2019t get to complain because the livestock are eating their corn. They burned the barn down!\n\nI got to say, this sounds to me like you\u2019re talking about Hillary Clinton. Are you talking about Hillary Clinton?\n\nNo. There you go. I haven\u2019t mentioned anybody\u2019s name; I actually mentioned Graham, and McCain, the Bushies, Wolfowitz \u2026\n\nThat\u2019s true. You only named Republicans.\n\nYou take any particular senator who voted for the war. That\u2019s fine. You can do that. You could\u2019ve said the name Chuck Schumer. You could\u2019ve said the name Max Baucus. I can tell you the names you couldn\u2019t say, I almost have them memorized, starting with Robert Byrd and Debbie Stabenow \u2026 There\u2019s a long list of those who didn\u2019t vote to go to war. Some of them who voted for it have said publicly, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not perfect. I make mistakes.\u201d \u2026 Probably the best thing you can do is say, \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019ve made mistakes. I\u2019ll try not to make them again.\u201d\n\nWhat did you think of Clinton\u2019s recent statement that she didn\u2019t publicly rescind her support for the war sooner because she wanted to keep faith with the troops?\n\nThe way I [kept faith with the troops], I would hug a mom, a father. I would hold a son or a daughter in my arms before, during and after a funeral. I refused to say the things to them that politicians like to say: \u201cYour son died making this country free,\u201d as if it was WWII or the Revolutionary War. I wouldn\u2019t say that because I didn\u2019t believe it. What I did was, I hugged them and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what God\u2019s plan was. I don\u2019t know why this happened to your family, but here,\u201d and I would write my personal cellphone number on a piece of paper and I would put it in their hand and close their hand on it and say to them, \u201cIf I could help you in any way \u2014 tomorrow, next week, next month, next year \u2014 call me. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week. I\u2019ll help you get through this, if I can.\u201d\n\nYou feel that\u2019s the most a politician can do?\n\nThat\u2019s all I could do as governor. I didn\u2019t have a vote. What I had was a National Guard [unit] \u2026 The best I could do was make sure they had all the equipment and all the training that they could to maximize the chance they would return in one piece. That\u2019s all I could do as a governor.\n\nTo move away from foreign policy, I want to ask you about economic inequality. How do you approach that issue?\n\nHere\u2019s something we know for sure: One of the great equalizers is education. To make education available to everybody is one of the most important things we can do \u2026 It starts with an early education system. Secondly, it requires a system so that higher education is economically available for all of this country \u2026 [I]t starts with giving opportunities for education, but it doesn\u2019t stop there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016 presidential wannabe Brian Schweitzer unloads to Salon on neocons, inequality and why we need single-payer", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "2016 presidential wannabe Brian Schweitzer unloads to Salon on neocons, inequality and why we need single-payer", "title": "\u201cWe spawned Osama bin Laden\u201d: Brian Schweitzer isn\u2019t done talking", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/19/we_spawned_osama_bin_laden_brian_schweitzer_isnt_done_talking/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/schweitzer_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2016 presidential wannabe Brian Schweitzer unloads to Salon on neocons, inequality and why we need single-payer", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/schweitzer_rect.jpg", "title": "\u201cWe spawned Osama bin Laden\u201d: Brian Schweitzer isn\u2019t done talking", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cWe spawned Osama bin Laden\u201d: Brian Schweitzer isn\u2019t done talking", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, brian schweitzer, Chuck Grassley, Editor's Picks, Hillary Clinton, Inequality, interviewe, isis, Max Baucus, Mitt Romney, MSNBC, Obamacare, single payer, Warren Buffett", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ce9\"", "article_summary": "I lived in the Middle East.\nIraq is what\u2019s keeping the Middle East stable right now because they\u2019re occupying Iran\u2019s time.\nAnd [intervening in the region] only makes sense if we need the oil assets from the Middle East in the future \u2014 and we don\u2019t.\nThen it becomes the problem of the people who live in the Middle East and those people who need to buy [the Middle East\u2019s oil] \u2014 the Asians and the Europeans.\nI was living in Saudi Arabia, working in Saudi Arabia, while Iraq was fighting its war with Iran."}
