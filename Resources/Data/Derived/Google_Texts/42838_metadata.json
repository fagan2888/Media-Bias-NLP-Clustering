Even though fewer companies will be selling plans on the federal exchange in South Carolina this year, \u201cplan variety should not be an issue,\u201d said Ray Farmer, director of the agency.\n\nOnly four companies, down from five during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s past open enrollment window, will offer policies to South Carolina residents on HealthCare.gov when sign-ups start Nov. 1.\n\nTime Insurance Co. \u2014 also marketed as Assurant Health \u2014 will not sell plans in the state anymore, Farmer said. The Associated Press reported last month that the Wisconsin-based company is closing its health insurance divisions.\n\nMeanwhile, South Carolina regulators are still reviewing rates submitted by other companies for 2016 insurance plans. Their review won\u2019t be finished until early August, Farmer said, but this much is clear: Prices are going up.\n\n\u201cHealth care is expensive and this is going to be a reflection of that,\u201d he said.\n\nAdrian Grimes, a spokeswoman for Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan, confirmed that premiums will be higher this time around.\n\n\u201cInsurance goes up every year, even way before the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cYou have rare cases where it goes down, but there are always increases at renewal time. That is a very general statement.\u201d\n\nConsumers\u2019 Choice, a nonprofit health insurance cooperative, is one of four carriers that will continue selling plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace to state customers.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, the largest private health insurance company in the state, its licensee, Blue Choice, and Coventry Health Care have also sold South Carolina plans on HealthCare.gov since 2014.\n\nGrimes said the price customers will pay out of pocket depends on several factors, including the county they live in, the coverage they choose and their age.\n\nAlso, most low- to middle-income customers who purchase Affordable Care Act policies qualify for federal subsidies to offset the cost they pay. The full sticker price may not reflect the amount they will owe each month.\n\nIn South Carolina, the federal government estimates 154,000 people already receive these subsidies for health insurance, and they qualify for an average $281 monthly discount.\n\nThe vast majority of South Carolinians who are insured through their employer, or by Medicare and Medicaid, do not receive these subsidies.\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "South Carolina insurance regulator: Affordable Care Act prices will increase, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,Department of Insurance,Health care,health insurance,Obamacare,Ray Farmer", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "South Carolinians shopping for Obamacare policies later this year will be faced with higher prices, the head of the state Department of Insurance said this week.", "title": "South Carolina insurance regulator: Affordable Care Act prices will increase", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150716/150719524/south-carolina-insurance-regulator-affordable-care-act-prices-will-increase", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150716/PC16/150719524/AR/0/AR-150719524.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150716/PC16/150719524/AR/0/AR-150719524.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Carolinians shopping for Obamacare policies later this year will be faced with higher prices, the head of the state Department of Insurance said this week.", "title": "South Carolina insurance regulator: Affordable Care Act prices will increase", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150716/PC16/150719524/AR/0/AR-150719524.jpg?201507162127", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150719524}}, "keywords": "South Carolina insurance regulator: Affordable Care Act prices will increase , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,Department of Insurance,Health care,health insurance,Obamacare,Ray Farmer", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-16T12:31:13Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T21:27:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "South Carolinians shopping for Obamacare policies later this year will be faced with higher prices, the head of the state Department of Insurance said this week."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccab8\"", "article_summary": "Open enrollment on HealthCare.gov for 2016 Affordable Care Act plans starts Nov. 1 and will run through Jan. 31.\nAlso, most low- to middle-income customers who purchase Affordable Care Act policies qualify for federal subsidies to offset the cost they pay.\nBlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, the largest private health insurance company in the state, its licensee, Blue Choice, and Coventry Health Care have also sold South Carolina plans on HealthCare.gov since 2014.\n\u201cInsurance goes up every year, even way before the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Grimes said.\nMeanwhile, South Carolina regulators are still reviewing rates submitted by other companies for 2016 insurance plans."}
