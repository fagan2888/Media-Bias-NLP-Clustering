Norfolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins agreed, rejecting Fontbonne\u2019s claim that hiring Barrett would infringe on its constitutional rights because it views his marriage to a man as incompatible with its religious mission.\n\nThe judge said Barrett\u2019s duties as a food services director did not include presenting the teachings of the Catholic church.\n\n\u201cAs an educational institution, Fontbonne retains control over its mission and message. It is not forced to allow Barrett to dilute that message, where he will not be a teacher, minister or spokesman for Fontbonne and has not engaged in public advocacy of same-sex marriage,\u201d Wilkins wrote in a ruling issued Wednesday.\n\nThe decision represents \u201ca frontal assault on religious freedom, an appalling subordination of the First Amendment to the Massachusetts gay rights law, and a victory by homosexual activists in their campaign to coerce Christians into compliance with same sex marriage,\u201d the Catholic Action League said in a statement released Thursday.\n\n\u201cReligious liberty is guaranteed not only by the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but even more broadly, by Article II of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution,\u201d C. J. Doyle, the league\u2019s executive director, said in the statement. \u201cReligious freedom consists not merely of the right to worship, but of the right of religious institutions to govern their internal affairs free of state interference.\u201d\n\nBut the judge found that a religious exemption to the state anti-discrimination law applies only if a religious organization limits admission to people of a certain religion. Fontbonne is open to students and employees of all faiths, with the exception of its administration and theology faculty.\n\n\u201cJudge Wilkins\u2019s decision would compel Catholic institutions to hire those who reject and despise Catholic teaching, fatally impairing the constitutionally protected right of those institutions to carry on their mission,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThis is precisely the sort of \u2018excessive entanglement\u2019 of government with religion decried and prohibited by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman.\u201d\n\nThe ruling highlights \u201cthe charade-like character of the religious exemption to the 1989 Bay State gay rights law,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Fontbonne plans to appeal the ruling. Fontbonne\u2019s attorney, John Bagley, did not immediately respond to a phone message and email seeking comment. A message was also left at the school.\n\nBarrett\u2019s attorney, Ben Klein of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, said the judge has found that Fontbonne is liable to pay damages to Barrett for lost wages and compensatory damages for discrimination. A hearing has not yet been scheduled.\n\n\u201cMarriage equality has been the law of Massachusetts for over a decade and it is now the law of the land. But you can\u2019t have equality if you can get married on Saturday and fired on Monday,\u201d Klein said.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/17/judge-rules-against-milton-catholic-school-in-gay-hiring-retraction/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Sup-ct-demo-e1453915055875.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "anti-discrimination, boston, Catholic school, court rulings, employment law, Milton, religious exemption, same-sex marriage"}, "description": "An all-girls Catholic prep school in Milton violated state anti-discrimination law by rescinding a job offer to a man in a same-sex marriage, a judge ruled.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Sup-ct-demo-e1453915055875.jpg"}, "keywords": "boston,milton,catholic school,same-sex marriage,anti-discrimination,court rulings,employment law,religious exemption", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Judge rules against Milton Catholic school in gay-hiring retractionPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/17/judge-rules-against-milton-catholic-school-in-gay-hiring-retraction/Demonstrators gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of its June 2015 ruling that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide.\nThe judge said Barrett\u2019s duties as a food services director did not include presenting the teachings of the Catholic church.\n\u201cJudge Wilkins\u2019s decision would compel Catholic institutions to hire those who reject and despise Catholic teaching, fatally impairing the constitutionally protected right of those institutions to carry on their mission,\u201d Doyle said.\n\u201cMarriage equality has been the law of Massachusetts for over a decade and it is now the law of the land.\n(Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.org)BOSTON (AP) \u2014 An all-girls Catholic prep school in Milton violated state anti-discrimination law by rescinding a job offer to a man in a same-sex marriage, a judge ruled, spurring a blistering attack from the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts on Thursday."}
