Source: Colorado Department of Education\n\nRecent final approval of new state graduation guidelines means local school districts are starting to talk about reworking their own requirements to earn a high school diploma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA state law passed in 2007 required the development of statewide high school graduation guidelines. A task force developed initial recommendations in 2008, then the Legislature extended the deadline to 2013 so state standards could be developed first.\n\nThe state Board of Education adopted an initial menu of options in 2013 as recommended by a Graduation Guidelines Council. But the initial guidelines were widely criticized, so a task force of educators tried again.\n\nThe state board adopted the final guidelines earlier this month but included a plan to convene a committee of parents, educators and industry representatives in 18 months to see if other additions are needed \u2014 and to repeat that process every two years.\n\nThe graduating class of 2021 \u2014 current seventh-graders \u2014 will be the first class that will need to meet the new requirements.\n\n\"The sooner we make decisions around graduation requirements, the better,\" said Boulder Valley Superintendent Bruce Messinger. \"When they start ninth grade, we want them to have a good understanding of what they need to graduate.\"\n\nMost of the state options require students to earn a certain score set by the state on a test, including the ACT and SAT college entrance exams and advanced placement and International Baccalaureate tests.\n\nThere's also an option to demonstrate competency through concurrent enrollment at a college, a capstone project or an industry certificate.\n\nDistricts must choose one or more of the state's measures for both English and math, then can add their own requirements. Districts can make the scores students need to achieve on a measure higher, but not lower.\n\nThe guidelines also allow districts to request waivers \"that meet the intent of the law.\"\n\n'Rigorous and attainable'\n\nNow, Colorado's districts generally require that students pass a specified list of classes and accumulate a total number of credits, but they don't require them to attain a specific score on a test.\n\nBoulder Valley requires a total of 22 credits, including four years of language arts, two years of math that must include algebra, two years of science, a year of a world language, a semester each of fine arts and practical experience, and a money management class.\n\nSt. Vrain Valley requires a total of 24.5 credits, including four years of language arts, three years of math and science, and a semester each of fine arts and practical experience.\n\nSt. Vrain Assistant Superintendent Connie Syferd said the district is in a good place to move forward with graduation requirements, especially given the work on post-secondary readiness and high school focus programs.\n\nMost St. Vrain high schools now offer focus programs, including a medical and bioscience program at Longmont High, an energy academy at Mead High and a leadership academy at Silver Creek High.\n\nSome programs already include internships, mentorships and capstone projects, Syferd said, while many St. Vrain high school students participate in concurrent enrollment programs with community colleges.\n\nThe district also wants to start an IBM's Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools, or P-TECH, program.\n\nP-TECH schools combine high school and two years of community college, with students graduating with a no-cost associate degree in applied science, engineering or computers within six years.\n\nSyferd said St. Vrain plans to finalize new graduation requirements next school year. Before they're finalized, she added, the district will seek input from students, parents and the community.\n\n\"We want it to be rigorous and attainable and for kids to have a number of options,\" she said.\n\nDefining success\n\nIn Boulder Valley, Messinger said the district first wants to analyze how many students would meet the new requirements today, then look at what the district could do to increase success.\n\nHe added that Boulder Valley was one of the districts pushing for the inclusion of a capstone project, with a goal of making sure there are alternate pathways so passing a test isn't the only option \u2014 with the reliance on standardized tests a main criticism of the new guidelines.\n\n\"That will give us more flexibility,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that capstone experiences have yet to be defined by the state or developed by the district, but that Boulder Valley may be interested in working with other districts on developing them.\n\nAsking for community input, including from students and parents, is another priority, he said.\n\nEvaluating graduation requirements also is one of Boulder Valley's priorities for the implementation of its \"Success Effect\" strategic plan. A group focused on the district's goal of graduating \"curious, lifelong learners\" is tasked with developing graduation recommendations.\n\nCentaurus High Principal Rhonda Haniford, who's in that group, said she wants to balance the external test requirements of the state with \"empowering students to define success for themselves.\"\n\nShe said one idea she wants to explore is a more open-ended measure that could include leading a community service project. A capstone experience, she added, should be based on student work throughout high school, not just a single project senior year.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to having flexibility in the options,\" she said.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28839374/districts-revise-grad-requirements-after-state-issues-new", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28839374:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-20T11:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Recent final approval of new state graduation guidelines means local school districts are starting to talk about reworking their own requirements to earn a high school diploma.", "title": "Districts to revise grad requirements after state issues new guidelines", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28839374/districts-revise-grad-requirements-after-state-issues-new", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0918/20150918__19DCAGRAw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0918/20150918__19DCAGRAw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-09-20T22:52:08-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-20T09:56:45-0600", "description": "Recent final approval of new state graduation guidelines means local school districts are starting to talk about reworking their own requirements to earn a high school diploma.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-09-18T18:00:21-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-20T11:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Districts to revise grad requirements after state issues new guidelines", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28839374/districts-revise-grad-requirements-after-state-issues-new", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Recent final approval of new state graduation guidelines means local school districts are starting to talk about reworking their own requirements to earn a high school diploma.", "title": "Districts to revise grad requirements after state issues new guidelines"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0918/20150918__19DCAGRAw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementA state law passed in 2007 required the development of statewide high school graduation guidelines.\nSource: Colorado Department of EducationRecent final approval of new state graduation guidelines means local school districts are starting to talk about reworking their own requirements to earn a high school diploma.\nThe state Board of Education adopted an initial menu of options in 2013 as recommended by a Graduation Guidelines Council.\nEvaluating graduation requirements also is one of Boulder Valley's priorities for the implementation of its \"Success Effect\" strategic plan.\nA capstone experience, she added, should be based on student work throughout high school, not just a single project senior year."}
