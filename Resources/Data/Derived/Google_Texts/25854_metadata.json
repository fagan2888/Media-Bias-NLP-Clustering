The agency now answers fewer than 50% of the phone calls it gets from citizens, a level IRS Commissioner John Koskinen calls \u201cmiserable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to only get worse over the next two weeks \u2013 not only because April 15 is approaching, but also because this year brought new reporting requirements under President Obama\u2019s healthcare law.\n\n\u201cThis really looks like a perfect storm,\u201d Brookings Institution scholar Elaine Kamarck warns. \u201cWe face a terrible combination: the addition of new forms for ACA [the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare] and the subtraction of IRS capacity to help.\u201d\n\nAnd those new forms are \u2013 like many IRS forms -- daunting.\n\nTaxpayers whose health insurance came through their employer, or through Medicare or Medicaid, don\u2019t have to worry; all they need to do is check a box on their tax return confirming that they had health insurance. (That covers more than 80% of us.)\n\nBut about 10 million taxpayers who got insurance via Obamacare, with tax credits to absorb part of the cost, must file a new form to tell the IRS whether the credits were too high, too low or just right.\n\nThat\u2019s where the trouble could arrive. The two-page form, Form 8962, is pretty complicated. The instruction booklet is 22 pages long.\n\nEven worse, the federal government and several states, including California, sent thousands of taxpayers erroneous information about the subsidies they received (via another form, Form 1095-A). The IRS says if you already filed your return based on incorrect information, you don\u2019t need to file again \u2013 but you may want to check to see whether you\u2019re due a bigger refund.\n\nThere\u2019s one more group of people likely to feel extra-grouchy this year: those who decided not to buy health insurance at all. Under Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, many of them will be assessed a penalty which will either reduce their tax refund or add to their tax bill. They can apply for exemption from the mandate \u2013 but that will take (of course) another form, Form 8965.\n\nSurprisingly, Koskinen told me, there hasn\u2019t been a flood of complaints about the new filing burden.\n\n\u201cWe monitor the call centers, and there\u2019s been no significant problem,\u201d he said.\n\nOne reason, he suggests, is that more than 90% of taxpayers rely on either tax preparers or software to fill out their forms, so they aren\u2019t feeling much pain.\n\nOr, perhaps, pain is what we\u2019ve come to expect when April 15 approaches.\n\nFollow Doyle McManus on Twitter @doylemcmanus and Google+", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Tax returns and Obamacare: a perfect storm?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "In my Wednesday column , I wrote that Congress keeps asking the Internal Revenue Service to do more work even as Congress cuts the IRS budget.", "title": "Tax returns and Obamacare: a perfect storm?", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-taxes-obamacare-20150401-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-551c5ee8/turbine/la-ol-taxes-obamacare-20150401", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "irs, taxes, obamacare, Form 8962", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83199109", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-01", "Description": "In my Wednesday column, I wrote that Congress keeps asking the Internal Revenue Service to do more work even as Congress cuts the IRS budget.
