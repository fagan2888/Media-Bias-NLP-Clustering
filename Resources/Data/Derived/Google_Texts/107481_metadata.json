The focus was not just on what needs to be improved, but what the city and UH are currently doing to improve. Speakers included Mayor Annise Parker, Harris County Judge Ed Emmett and President and Chancellor Renu Khator.\n\nParker spoke about the importance of obtaining mental health care for the homeless. There are about 8,500 homeless individuals in the city.\n\nFor those homeless who need to visit the emergency room or otherwise receive health care, high medical bills are a serious problem, Emmett said.\n\n\u201cWe have to change that. Families are not able to take care of them because it is too expensive, so they end up in jail,\u201d Emmett said.\n\nEmmett\u2019s focus is to \u201cget everyone preventive care and out of the emergency room and into medical homes.\u201d\n\nFaith Foreman, assistant director at the Houston Department of Health and Human Services, discussed the state of public health in Houston.\n\nThe top concern was obesity, as 65 percent of Houston adults are overweight and 35 percent of children are obese. Houston will partner with UH to establish diabetes centers, which will help fight the rise of diabetes the city has seen since 2002. One of those centers, the Diabetes Awareness and Wellness Network Third Ward Multi-Service Center, has UH interns already serving the under-served.\n\nForeman addressed the issue of lack of grocery stores in certain parts of Houston, colloquially called \u201cfood deserts.\u201d The Food Desert Task Force will incentivize grocers to set up in low-income areas. Parker also discussed how they are implementing produce wagons to set up in food desert areas, giving access to fresh food to those who may otherwise go without.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act in effect, many of the conference attendees wanted to know how to shop for the best health plan.\n\nThere are four different levels of coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. For example, a 27-year-old with an income of $25,000 on the lowest level, bronze, with a tax credit will pay $81 as a premium.\n\n\u201cWorking out in the community, we see many people who fall in the \u2018donut hole,\u2019 and I\u2019m really concerned about their access to healthcare,\u201d said Lance Bean, community relations specialist at Texas Children\u2019s Health Plan.\n\nThe donut hole refers to those who cannot afford to buy a plan under the new marketplace, yet who do not qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe city has begun knocking on doors to get people insured and answer any questions on the new healthcare reform.\n\n\u201cSo far, there have only been a couple of hundred calls to our call center,\u201d said Benjamin Hernandez, an executive in public health administration at City Hall.\n\nHernandez said he believes this number will increase in approximately a month once many get access to the website and information.\n\nThe conference allowed Houston and UH professionals, community members and others to find ways to unite in reducing the amount of uninsured citizens.\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "The UH Hilton was abuzz Friday with everything from obesity and mental health to Medicaid expansion and the recent Affordable Care Act at the Faculty Senate\u2019s 15th Scholarship and Community Conference, \u201cGreater Houston\u2019s Health-Urban Healthcare in the 21st Century.\u201d The conference featured a variety of speakers who shared their experiences and knowledge on Houston health. \u2026", "title": "Houston's health heats up conference - The Daily Cougar", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DSC07705.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-07T22:10:32+00:00", "url": "http://thedailycougar.com/2013/10/08/houstons-health-heats-up-conference/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thedailycougar", "section": "Activities & Organizations", "tag": "UH Hilton", "published_time": "2013-10-08T05:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-07T22:10:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 37502686}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "The UH Hilton was abuzz Friday with everything from obesity and mental health to Medicaid expansion and the recent Affordable Care Act at the Faculty Senate\u2019s 15th Scholarship and Community Conference, \u201cGreater Houston\u2019s Health-Urban Healthcare in the 21st Century.\u201d The conference featured a variety of speakers who shared their experiences and knowledge on Houston health. \u2026", "title": "Houston's health heats up conference - The Daily Cougar", "image": {"src": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DSC07705.jpg"}, "creator": "@thedailycougar", "site": "@thedailycougar", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23f7\"", "article_summary": "Houston\u2019s health heats up conferenceThe UH Hilton was abuzz Friday with everything from obesity and mental health to Medicaid expansion and the recent Affordable Care Act at the Faculty Senate\u2019s 15th Scholarship and Community Conference, \u201cGreater Houston\u2019s Health-Urban Healthcare in the 21st Century.\u201dThe conference featured a variety of speakers who shared their experiences and knowledge on Houston health.\nParker spoke about the importance of obtaining mental health care for the homeless.\nFor those homeless who need to visit the emergency room or otherwise receive health care, high medical bills are a serious problem, Emmett said.\nThe conference allowed Houston and UH professionals, community members and others to find ways to unite in reducing the amount of uninsured citizens.\nWith the Affordable Care Act in effect, many of the conference attendees wanted to know how to shop for the best health plan."}
