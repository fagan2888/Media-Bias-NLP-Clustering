This week, the state\u2019s attorney general and a state assemblyman introduced a bill that would ban the sale and manufacture of any face wash, toothpaste, soap, or exfoliant that contains these microscopic spheres that slip through water filtration plants and into waterways.\n\nLast year scientists reported finding tens of millions of microbeads bobbing to the surface in Lake Erie (see \u201cDon\u2019t Lather, Don\u2019t Rinse, Don\u2019t Repeat\u201d). The plastic balls pollute water and potentially poison fish and other wildlife that mistake the colorful orbs for food.\n\n\u201cFrom the Great Lakes to the Hudson River to Long Island Sound, our commitment to protecting and restoring New York\u2019s waters is among our most important responsibilities,\u201d says Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman.\n\nA number of companies that make the 200-plus products that contain these microbeads\u2014including Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson\u2014have already volunteered to take them out. But that\u2019s not enough, argues 5 Gyres, an organization that combats plastic pollution in waterways. The group worked with the lawmakers on the bill and is planning on rolling out this legislative model in other places. A California assemblyman who collaborated with the organization plans to introduce a bill banning the sale of microbeads today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at a one-state strategy,\u201d Stiv J. Wilson, 5 Gyre\u2019s policy director, tells the New York Times. \u201cThis is the alpha, not the omega.\u201d For those of you who don\u2019t speak Greek, he\u2019s saying microbead bans are only getting started.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Other states may not be far behind as the common cosmetic compound is clogging up countless lakes and rivers", "title": "New York don\u2019t want no scrubs: State seeks ban on microbeads", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Other states may not be far behind as the common cosmetic compound is clogging up countless lakes and rivers", "title": "New York don\u2019t want no scrubs: State seeks ban on microbeads", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/17/new_york_dont_want_no_scrubs_state_seeks_ban_on_microbeads/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/exfoliation-620x412.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Other states may not be far behind as the common cosmetic compound is clogging up countless lakes and rivers", "title": "New York don\u2019t want no scrubs: State seeks ban on microbeads", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/exfoliation-620x412.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Susan Cosier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, microbeads, Mussels, New York, New York Times, OnEarth.org", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: microbeads, Mussels, New York, New York Times, OnEarth.org, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on OnEarth.org.\nLast year scientists reported finding tens of millions of microbeads bobbing to the surface in Lake Erie (see \u201cDon\u2019t Lather, Don\u2019t Rinse, Don\u2019t Repeat\u201d).\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at a one-state strategy,\u201d Stiv J.
