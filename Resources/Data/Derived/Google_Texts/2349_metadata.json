The dynamic and often confusing way the tax code is structured is the main culprit.\n\n\"Every year, changes are made to the tax code and annual renewals of proposed deductions or credits,\" says Dennis G. Raible, a visiting professor of accounting at Saint Joseph's University. \"Those changes and the complicated nature of the tax code itself can lead taxpayers to miss out on deductions or pay extra money on taxes because they made key filing mistakes.\"\n\nKate Wilson, a 23-year-old Pittsburgh career development writer and recent college graduate, brings up an interesting point on the topic of tax filings, and how some rules can really trip you up \u2014 and cost you money.\n\nFor Wilson, the issue was scholarship money and how the IRS treated it at tax time.\n\n\"Most colleges bill you for the entire academic year in the fall, so for example, your spring 2014 semester would be billed in the fall of 2013,\" Wilson says. \"If you receive scholarships, however, they're usually disbursed in halves. So you receive your scholarship for the fall 2013 semester in the fall and your scholarship for the spring 2014 semester in the spring.\"\n\n\"On your 1098-T tax form, then, it looks like you weren't billed for anything in 2014, and you were simply awarded a surplus sum of money for your scholarship. This is typically only an issue for graduates because the disparity lies between the academic year and the calendar year,\" she says.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "Uncle Sam always has a few surprises in store for taxpayers, so you should get to know them.", "author": "Brian O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Uncle Sam always has a few surprises in store for taxpayers, so you should get to know them.", "title": "Tax Quirks and Complications to Look for in Education, Work and Job Searches", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/tax-quirks-and-complications-to-look-for-in-education-work-and-job-searches", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/tax-deductions.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/tax-deductions.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Taxes", "date": "2015-02-24T11:00Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "taxes, tax, scholarship Pittsburgh, tax deduction, tax deductions, IRS, tax tricks, tax problems, tax complications", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Taxes", "tag": "tax complications", "published_time": "2015-02-24T11:00Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/459200"}, "guid": 13054549, "twitter": {"description": "Uncle Sam always has a few surprises in store for taxpayers, so you should get to know them.", "title": "Tax Quirks and Complications to Look for in Education, Work and Job Searches", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/tax-quirks-and-complications-to-look-for-in-education-work-and-job-searches", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/tax-deductions.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/tax-deductions.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "taxes, tax, scholarship Pittsburgh, tax deduction, tax deductions, IRS, tax tricks, tax problems, tax complications"}, "article_summary": "The dynamic and often confusing way the tax code is structured is the main culprit.\n\"Every year, changes are made to the tax code and annual renewals of proposed deductions or credits,\" says Dennis G.
