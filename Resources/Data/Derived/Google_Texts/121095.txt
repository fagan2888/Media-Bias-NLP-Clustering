The unfavorable rating of the Supreme Court is at a 30-year high, largely fueled by Republicans after major decisions on Obamacare and gay marriage, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center In March, 39 percent of Americans said they had an unfavorable opinion of the Supreme Court. In the survey taken from July 14-20, 43 percent said they now view the high court unfavorably.While that is not a huge jump, Pew notes that it is the highest unfavorability numbers the Supreme Court has had since 1985.Forty-eight percent of Americans said they have a favorable view of the court, in the poll taken of 2,002 American adults across the country.The most significant change comes from Republicans, the Pew survey found. Only 33 percent of those in the GOP said they have a positive opinion of the court and 61 percent have an unfavorable view. In March, 50 percent said they have a favorable view of the Supreme Court and 40 percent had an unfavorable impression of the high court.By comparison, the Supreme Court is more liked by Democrats than it was in March, when 54 percent said they had a favorable view of the court. In the July survey, 62 percent of Democrats said they have a positive opinion.In addition, 68 percent of conservative Republicans said that the high court is liberal. That number jumped 20 percentage points from the March survey. Almost half of liberal Democrats think the court is moderate.
