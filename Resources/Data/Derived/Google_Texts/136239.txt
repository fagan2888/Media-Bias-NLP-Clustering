Warm weather didn't keep people from attending Union's 39th annual Country Day. The square was closed off for food, fun, and live music.

Union's Country Day offers a variety of vendors from home-made goods to fair food. They also have unique gifts including clothing, furniture, and more. Local event goers say it never gets old. Country day always offers something different for all ages to enjoy
