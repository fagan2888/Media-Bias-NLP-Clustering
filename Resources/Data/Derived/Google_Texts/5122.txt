NEW YORK (MainStreet) —This week as Republicans swept into power, Senator Lamar Alexander (R - Tenn.) said that his top priority would be to “simplify and deregulate” higher education in the course of renewing the Higher Education Act.

Alexander introduced legislation on Wednesday that would significantly reduce the length of the application for federal student aid and consolidate federal grant and loan programs. His plan, which he first rolled out last year, also calls for restoring year-round Pell Grants.

He also got behind a proposal introduced on Wednesday by Senator Angus King, a Maine independent, and Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, that would streamline federal student loan repayment plans. It also adopts limits on the amount of loan forgiveness that high-debt borrowers can receive, something the Obama administration has already proposed.

But the central focus in Alexander's Senate speech was the reform of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

“Senator Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) and I were at a Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor and Pension) Committee meeting where we heard from four people, from different points of view, saying the same thing,” he said. “Instead of the current FAFSA’s 108 questions, we only need two questions to answer 95% of what we need to know.”



A stripped down FAFSA would be one of the things he said he would deliver in legislation he introduced called the Fast Act.
