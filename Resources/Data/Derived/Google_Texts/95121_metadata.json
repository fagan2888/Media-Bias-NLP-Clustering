And while most people make some sort of personal resolution, or a list, to improve their life, businesses should do the same.\n\nHowever, personal New Year\u2019s resolutions seem go out the window if not adhered to for at least the first 30 days. So let\u2019s look at these as business strategies instead. Here are seven New Year\u2019s resolutions\u2014or strategies\u2014every business owner should adopt for 2014.\n\nBetter define your role: Many business owners, solution providers included, go into business because they have a great idea and want to run their own company. They want to build something and provide a need in the marketplace. However, as exciting as all this may seem, the business still has to be managed. It is easy to get caught up in the day-to-day grind and lose sight of why you ventured out on your own to begin with. As the New Year approaches, take the time look at how you are spending your workday: Are you living the dream you initially envisioned, or did you just create a job for yourself?\n\nEvaluate your staff: Nothing changes if the people doing the actual work don\u2019t change. This is especially true in a small business, as every employee counts. Businesses leaders need to look at hard look at their overall workforce and make tough decisions on personnel. This may include moving employees into positions where they will thrive, getting training for those that need help, removing those who may be problems and making smart hires where it makes sense.\n\nEvaluate your products and services: The product and services mix of any business needs to be twofold: provide sustainable, renewable incoming revenue and position the company for growth. Any product or service that doesn\u2019t meet either of these two criteria should be dropped. Continuing a service just for one customer may not make sense anymore. You need to look at the resources involved, the margins and whether that customer can be migrated over. Offering too many services and having too many one-offs is not healthy, so evaluate your products and services and focus on the ones driving sustainable revenue and new business, and drop those that are draining resources.\n\nEvaluate your customers: The phrase, \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d gets a lot of businesses in trouble. Some customers are just bad business. While you always want to satisfy your customers, you want to make sure they also understand you are running a business. Customers that always cause you to sacrifice margins, sweeten the pot or expect unreasonable service are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. Not only can they overwhelm your resources and pinch your profit margins, but they also cause employee morale to suffer. Never let a customer berate any of your employees or put you in a position where servicing them will put that contract in the red.\n\nChange your culture: What work environment have you created while building your businesses? Is it one where people work hard, have room for advancement, get along and believe they are treated fairly? Or have you created the exact culture that you yourself fled and swore never to work under again? Although your employees need to understand that work is just that: work, there should be some satisfaction involved. Employees should not feel threatened in their work environment, fearful of losing their job or feel like they are being taken for granted. This all leads to a hostile and oppressive work environment, and while you may believe that constantly cracking the whip is the way to get things done, it actually eventually leads to less productivity and an employee exodus. Create a positive, friendly and productive culture for your workers and they will be loyal. Remember, they have families to provide for as well.\n\nInvest in infrastructure: In tough economic times, business owners get gun-shy about making any type of large-scale investments. That is understandable. However, the risk of not having the right technology and equipment will put any organization at a competitive disadvantage\u2014especially in the IT space. Interest rates are still extremely low and experts are expecting them to start inching up in the coming year. Take this opportunity to evaluate your infrastructure and make the necessary upgrades to make your operations more efficient, your employees more productive and your company more nimble while the borrowing is still cheap.\n\nInvest in employees: Your employees are your lifeblood. Everyone is an extension of your brand. They need to be treated fairly, given growth opportunities and feel valued. One of the biggest concerns among workers moving forward is health care. Because of the changes and confusion brought on by ObamaCare, people are nervous about their healthcare coverage and costs. Anything your company can do to simplify and alleviate these fears will go a long way toward their loyalty. Health care will be a major decision-factor for people when it comes to changing jobs going forward. It is an area where employers can truly show how much they value their employees. Do whatever you can as a business owner to provide good healthcare benefits to your employees and reduce their anxiety.\n\nA new year is approaching. Make 2014 a better one for yourself, your family, your employees and your customers. If you do these things, it will be a better one for business as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here are seven New Year\u2019s resolutions\u2014or strategies\u2014every business owner should adopt for 2014.", "title": "Top 7 Business Resolutions for 2014", "og": {"url": "http://thevarguy.com/business-acceleration-infocenter/top-7-business-resolutions-2014", "image": "http://thevarguy.com/site-files/thevarguy.com/files/uploads/2013/12/happy-new-year.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Well it&rsquo;s that time of year to close the books, put the past behind and look forward.
