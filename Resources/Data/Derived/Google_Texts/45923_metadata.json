However, it\u2019s been known for a long time that Hispanics have the highest level of [uninsured] of all the racial and ethnic groups in the country. This is a big barrier to access to mental health care.\"\n\nAccording to the National Association for Mental Illness (NAMI), there are as few as 29 Latino mental health professionals for every 100,000 Latinos.\n\n\u201cVery often in health and mental health centers there is a lack of interpreters and a lack of bilingual psychiatrics and mental health professionals,\u201d Primm said. \u201cIt is really ideal to conduct evaluation and treatment plan in the language that is preferred by the individual, there are differences in the information that can be gathered if the evaluation is conducted in English as opposed to Spanish.\u201d\n\nHispanics and Latinos also have different attitudes towards mental illness and mental health services, often feeling stigmatized for accessing these services.\n\n\u201c[Hispanics often] have a sense of not wanting to be labeled with a mental illness, seeing the problems they are experiencing within the contexts of their family and their community, perhaps even reaching out to the faith community. They have been known to turn to religious leaders for help, as opposed to seeking services from mental health specialists,\u201d Primm told FNL.\n\nAccording to the APA\u2019s 2010 \u201cMental Health Disparities: Hispanic/Latinos\u201d report, affected individuals may not recognize their symptoms as ones which require attention from mental health specialists, especially because Latinos tend to view mental illness as temporary.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much misunderstanding about mental health issues and a lot of misinformation and just a lack of awareness and knowledge about what mental health problems are, the causes of these problems, and what you can do if you or your loved one is facing one of them,\u201d MaJos\u00e9 Carrasco, Director of the Multicultural Action Center for NAMI, told FNL.\n\nThe opposite ends of the Hispanic population \u2013 youth and older adults \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to the stresses of acculturation and immigration, which may put them at a higher risk for mental illness.\n\nThe APA reports that many older Hispanics find the strain of acculturation overwhelming as traditional values are often at odds with new cultures and languages. Likewise, Latino children have been found to be at higher risk of emotional distress due to the pressure to adopt to American culture as well as possible discrimination, poverty and inequality.\n\n\u201cIn a family, when a child is born in the U.S. but the parents were not, sometimes there can be a clash there because the young people have been acculturated to American ways,\u201d Primm said. \u201cThose ways may be [at odds with] the traditional cultural that the family comes from, which also contributes to vulnerability for the young person.\u201d\n\nAccording to NAMI, the mental health services often provided to Latino and other minorities tend to be of poorer quality than those provided to the white community.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we are facing disparity at every point, from accessing treatment, from recognizing it, to actually receiving quality treatment,\u201d Carrasco told FNL. \u201cWe have a very long road ahead.\u201d\n\nNicole del Castillo is a College Associate for Fox News Latino.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LIFESTYLE/Family, HEALTH/Mental Health, HEALTH/Children's Health, HEALTH/Women's Health, LANGUAGES/English, HEALTH/Men's Health", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-11 06:15:06 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "While Hispanics are affected by mental illness at rates similar to those of the general population, they become a high-risk group once you take into account the massive disparities in seeking services and in following through with treatment.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/health/0/0/Crying%20Latina%20Girl.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Mental Illness An Epidemic Among U.S. Latinos: Only 1 In 11 Seek Treatment\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/health/2014/07/11/mental-illness-epidemic-among-us-latinos-only-1-in-11-seek-treatment/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/health/0/0/Crying%20Latina%20Girl.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"6bed9f1be9c17410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"root\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-11T10:15:06Z\",\"author\":\"Nicole del Castillo\",\"tags\":[\"LIFESTYLE/Family\",\" HEALTH/Mental Health\",\" HEALTH/Children\\u0027s Health\",\" HEALTH/Women\\u0027s Health\",\" LANGUAGES/English\",\" HEALTH/Men\\u0027s Health\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "root", "keywords": "Fox News,mental health", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "While Hispanics are affected by mental illness at rates similar to those of the general population, they become a high-risk group once you take into account the massive disparities in seeking services and in following through with treatment.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:6bed9f1be9c17410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "Fox News,mental health", "classification-isa": "family, mhealth, chealth, whealth", "description": "El gigante de Redmond podr\u00eda lanzar dos nuevos modelos de Xbox One que llegar\u00edan al mercado en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan reporta Kotaku.
