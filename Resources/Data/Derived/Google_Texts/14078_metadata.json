The growth was largely fueled by overtime for city firefighters. LAUREN STEPHENSON / STAFF\n\nBy Josh Sweigart\n\nStaff Writer\n\nSix of the city of Kettering\u2019s 11 highest-paid employees in 2015 were firefighters who received $197,204 in combined overtime last year, according to an I-Team analysis of city payroll data.\n\nThey were among the 105 city employees whose gross wages exceeded $100,000 last year, an increase from 69 in 2014. Much larger Dayton, by comparison, paid 68 employees six figures last year.\n\nAn I-Team investigation found the number of employees at 19 area cities, townships and counties making more than $100,000 increased last year, often because of overtime for police officers and firefighters. Read the full investigation here.\n\n\u201cWe did have an increase for firefighters in overtime last year,\u201d said city manager Mark Schwieterman in an interview this week.\n\nSchwieterman said the main factor fueling exploding growth in overtime pay for firefighters was staffing changes made to cope with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSchwieterman said the city got rid of volunteer firefighters in 2015 and had to cut hours to part-time firefighters to comply with federal healthcare mandates that employees on the clock for more than 28 hours a week \u2014 even if they\u2019re on standby pay \u2014 be provided health insurance.\n\nThis means the full-time firefighters had to work more overtime to maintain fire protection.\n\nOf the 105 city employees who made more than $100,000 last year, 34 were in the fire department.\n\n\u201cUnlike a position in an administrative office where you cover with other staff with no overtime, in fire if we have to fill a position, then we have to fill a position and have three people on the truck to meet those minimum standards,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were 43 Kettering police department employees among those making more than $100,000 last year, though they didn\u2019t get as much overtime as their fire department counterparts.\n\nA full story on the city of Kettering\u2019s payroll costs, how it compares to other governments, what\u2019s driving it and what\u2019s being done about it is coming this week.\n\nGo here for a searchable database of 2014 payroll for local governments, now updated with 2015 payroll with Kettering and many other local governments.\n\nThe I-Team will continue to add local governments to this database as they come in.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six of the city of Kettering\u2019s 11 highest-paid employees in 2015 were firefighters who received $197,204 in combined overtime last year..", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/payroll-project-kettering-firefighters-cash-in-on-/nqrt2/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/03/24/c3/b2/Fire_Science_2.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Six of the city of Kettering\u2019s 11 highest-paid employees in 2015 were firefighters who received $197,204 in combined overtime last year..", "title": "Payroll project: Obamacare spikes Kettering firefighter overtime"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/03/24/c3/b2/Fire_Science_2.JPG", "title": "Payroll project: Kettering firefighters cash in on OT", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "description": "Six of the city of Kettering&rsquo;s 11 highest-paid employees in 2015 were firefighters who received $197,204 in combined overtime last year, according to an I-Team analysis of city payroll data."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/payroll-project-kettering-firefighters-cash-in-on-/nqrt2/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3290838/news/news/local-govt-politics/payroll-project-kettering-firefighters-cash-in-on-/nqrt2/", "keywords": "cmgopayrollproject,Kettering,I-Team", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "Kettering, I-Team"}, "article_summary": "Go here for a searchable database of 2014 payroll for local governments, now updated with 2015 payroll with Kettering and many other local governments.\nThe growth was largely fueled by overtime for city firefighters.\nThey were among the 105 city employees whose gross wages exceeded $100,000 last year, an increase from 69 in 2014.\nSchwieterman said the main factor fueling exploding growth in overtime pay for firefighters was staffing changes made to cope with the Affordable Care Act.\nOf the 105 city employees who made more than $100,000 last year, 34 were in the fire department."}
