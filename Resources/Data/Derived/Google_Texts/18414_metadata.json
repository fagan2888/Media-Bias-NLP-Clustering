Dave Kennedy, Kevin Mitnick, Ed Skoudis, Chris Nickerson, Eric Smith, Chris Gates, John Strand, Kevin Johnson, and Scott White all testified before the House Science and Technology Committee that the website was insecure. In fact, David Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec stated, \"I don't understand how we're still discussing whether the website is insecure or not. It is; there's no question about that. It is insecure - 100 percent.\"\n\n\u201cI am completely shocked,\u201d Kennedy said in a tweet dripping sarcasm. \u201cHealthcare.gov hacked?\u201d Mitnick added, \u201cTell me it isn\u2019t true. Did we just warn these guys at Congress a few months ago?\u201d\n\nBut hey, don\u2019t sweat it, because DHS spokesperson S.Y. Lee told the Wall Street Journal that there is \u201cno indication that any data was compromised at this time.\u201d Yet DHS, FBI and NSA all helped investigate. The FBI \u201ctraced the attack to several Internet addresses\u2014some overseas\u2014but doesn't think it is the work of a state-backed actor.\u201d\n\nIt only took seven weeks to detect the hack \u201cmade possible due to several security weaknesses,\u201d which included a test server that \u201cshould not have been connected to the Internet\u201d and was \u201csecured\u201d with the manufacturer\u2019s default password. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesman Aaron Albright told the New York Times, \u201cWe have taken measures to further strengthen security.\u201d\n\nCMS said the intrusion occurred on July 8 and was discovered on August 25 after someone finally noticed \u201cunusual server traffic.\u201d We are told that malware meant to add a server to a botnet, not steal info, was uploaded to a server used to test code for healthcare.gov. \u201cOur review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information; data was not transmitted outside the agency, and the website was not specifically targeted.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it sounds like we are supposed to be grateful we heard about it at all. An unnamed DHS official claimed, \u201cIf this happened anywhere other than HealthCare.gov, it wouldn't be news.\u201d\n\nPolitico added that CMS wants Americans to put the \u201cevent\u201d in perspective. Based on its analysis, CMS does not \u201cbelieve HealthCare.gov was targeted.\u201d Look at it this way, CMS suggests, \u201cEach and every day, U.S. business and government IT systems and individual consumers face myriad cyber threats, from the attempted theft of U.S. intellectual property through cyber intrusions to distributed denial of service attacks against public facing websites. No website is immune from these attempts.\u201d\n\nExcept this isn't just any website; it\u2019s healthcare.gov. At least the hard drive wasn\u2019t \u201cdestroyed and recycled\u201d like former IRS official Louis Lerner\u2019s was. But who connected the test server to the Internet and left the default password unchanged? WSJ reported, \u201cIt couldn't be learned whether the misconfigured server could be linked to any of the several technology contractors who help set up the website.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that these hackers were not that ambitious is no cause for comfort,\u201d said Center on Democracy and Technology CTO Joseph Lorenzo Hall. \u201cFrankly, they got a pass on this \u2014 this sounds like somebody doing low-level, vanilla sort of hacker craft.\u201d\n\nThe hack is neither particularly impressive, nor hard to pull off. \u201cThis is very, very widespread,\u201d computer forensic scientist Rebecca Mercuri told Polictico. \u201cThis might be the first time we heard about it, but I\u2019d be surprised if this was the first time it happened.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Weekly Standard said, \u201cDespite HHS's assurances after the breach was discovered on August 25 that measures are in place to guarantee security, including \u2018daily security scans and drill hacking exercises,\u2019 at least one test site, akatest.healthcare.gov, is still accessible publicly via a simple web browser.\u201d\n\nSome politicians are coming out with verbal guns firing, such as Sen. Orrin Hatch who stated, \u201cDespite numerous warnings from myself and other lawmakers that security breaches were possible, HealthCare.gov underwent virtually no independent security testing.\u201d\n\nThe federal website \u201cis full of data that criminals covet,\u201d said Rep. Joe Barton. \u201cHandling private information over to the government is bad enough. People should at least know it won\u2019t fall into the hands of hackers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealthCare.gov is \u2018an open invitation for hackers\u2019 because of the amount of personal information required,\u201d warned Rep. Diane Black. Because \u201cthe administration \u2018would be under no obligation to disclose if sensitive personal information were breached\u2019 in the attack,\u201d she \u201curged the Senate to follow the House\u2019s lead and pass a bill requiring the HHS to notify people if their information is stolen from the site.\u201d\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Darrell Issa subpoenaed CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner to testify on September 18. \u201cConsidering this Administration launched healthcare.gov over the objections of CMS, it\u2019s unsurprising that the website has suffered a \u2018malicious attack.\u2019\u201d\n\nIssa also \u201caccused President Obama\u2019s team of lying about the security of the Obamacare website in January.\u201d He said, \u201cWe can find no other basis but to assume that they were lying about the vulnerabilities on the day they went live on October 1, and that they are still lying. You cannot continue to tell people there is no problem, that there was no problem on October 1 \u2014 you cannot tell people it has been mitigated but tell them, \u2018don\u2019t release documents because it\u2019s a pathway for hackers.\u2019\u201d\n\nHealth and Human Services said the hack should have no impact upon the 2015 open enrollment period which begins on November 15.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2603929/healthcare-gov-hacked-if-only-someone-had-warned-it-was-hackable-oh-wait.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/09/emergency-100412909-primary.idge.jpg", "site": "@computerworld", "card": "summary", "description": "Malware was uploaded to a healthcare.gov test server that was not supposed to be connected to the Internet and was secured with the manufacturer's default password.
