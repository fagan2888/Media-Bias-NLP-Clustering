NEW YORK (AP) — Ford is recalling about 850,000 cars and SUVs because of a problem that could stop the air bags from working in a crash.

The recalled models include the 2013-14 Ford C-Max compact, Fusion midsize, Escape SUV and the Lincoln MKZ luxury car, all sold in North America.

Ford says the restraints control module in the car could short circuit, causing the air bag warning indicator to light up. If the short circuit occurs, restraint devices including the air bags, pretensioners, and side curtains might not work in a crash.

The short circuit could also affect the car’s stability control and other systems.

Ford Motor Co. says it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem. Dealerships will replace the restraints control module at no cost.
