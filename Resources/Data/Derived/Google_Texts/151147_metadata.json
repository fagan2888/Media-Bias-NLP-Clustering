But cynicism doesn\u2019t invent the Internet. Cynicism doesn\u2019t give women the right to vote.\u201d\n\nThere you have it: the presidential mind in Year 6. Don\u2019t cry for Argentina \u2014 cry for me!\n\nSelf-pity is never admirable in a public figure, but it seems to be Obama\u2019s default emotion when the going gets tough. Because everything is about him, the whole world is personal.\n\nHe is a victim of a vast conspiracy that includes everything from global upheaval to a domestic mood going from simmer to boil. If only everybody would just shut up and do what he says, all would be well.\n\nAlas, Obama is right about one thing. His presidency and the country are at a crossroads. The problem is that his response \u2014 woe is me \u2014 means things almost certainly will get worse before they get better.\n\nWith polls showing most Americans don\u2019t like his policies, don\u2019t see him as honest and don\u2019t believe he can lead effectively, we\u2019re long past the point where the wheels come off, or even the moment where the car ends up in the ditch.\n\nSomething approaching a national crack-up now appears inevitable. Recent events suggest it is coming sooner rather than later.\n\nThe creation of a new terrorist state out of parts of Syria and Iraq makes attacks on our allies and homeland more likely. Without doubt, Obama\u2019s lack of credibility with friend and foe alike guarantees years of disorder.\n\nThe IRS scandal was bad before, but the ridiculous claim that crucial e-mails from seven officials are permanently lost doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. This is a cover-up of behavior that was probably criminal. If the White House gets away with it, the tax man will become another partisan operative.\n\nThe collapse of security at the southern border also appears intentional and designed to pressure Republicans into an immigration deal. In fact, the opposite will happen. The invasion \u2014 there is no other word for it \u2014 of tens of thousands from Mexico will make sensible compromise impossible.\n\nIn the darkness, two rays of hope are visible.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court rejected Obama\u2019s claim that he can decide when the Senate is in recess and thus avoid its advise-and-consent power. The case involved appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, but the unanimous ruling broadly preserves constitutional safeguards against presidential overreach.\n\nSecond, Speaker John Boehner announced the House will file a lawsuit on similar grounds. It will cite the president\u2019s rewriting of ObamaCare and other laws, without congressional approval, as evidence he is failing his sworn duty to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the laws.\n\nThe actions by the court and Boehner have the potential to \u00adremind Obama of the duties of his office, and its limits. Both moves are predicated on the shared belief that America is a nation of laws, not of men.\n\nMy fear is that Obama is not reconciled to that tradition. When he reacts to congressional rejection of his proposals by warning that \u201cI will not take no for an answer,\u201d he suggests his power is unlimited. When his press secretary says that, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Obama will not be \u201cscaling back\u201d his \u00adappointments, the stage is set for more polarizing conflict.\n\nHow does this end? Not soon, and not well.\n\nStop & think on stop & frisk\n\nThis is what passes for good news in New York: Top cop Bill Bratton is concerned about the surge in violence.\n\nEven better news: He wants to know if the increase has anything to do with the sharp reduction in stop-and-frisk.\n\nThe commissioner ordered a study of why shootings are up 11 percent over last year, even as overall crime is down 2.5 percent, saying, \u201cWe have a very comprehensive analysis under way right now. At this juncture, we really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHis comments offer a contrast with an earlier lack of concern that bordered on nonchalance. Bratton downplayed the rise in shootings last month, telling reporters that \u201ccrime is going to spike from time to time, that\u2019s just the reality.\u201d\n\nHe also said then that he didn\u2019t believe the spike was related to his curtailing stop-and-frisk. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly credited the tactic with getting guns off the street and historic drops in murders.\n\nBut according to The Wall Street Journal, Bratton ordered the study after failing to get satisfactory explanations from top aides about the shootings.\n\nThe about-face is heartening because the attacks on the successful tactic were so blatantly political and reckless. Curiously, Bratton defended stop-and-frisk as a necessary and constitutional tool, but the decline on his watch has been dramatic. Stops through March were down about 85 percent overall and fell even more in some of the precincts where shootings are making a comeback. A connection seems obvious.\n\nThen again, it remains to be seen if the anti-cop regime at City Hall can handle the truth. Inconvenient facts aren\u2019t part of the progressive agenda.\n\nBottoms up, Hillary!\n\nSo Hillary Clinton called Obama \u201cincompetent and feckless\u201d in a boozy reunion with friends, according to Ed Klein\u2019s new book, \u201cBlood Feud.\u201d If a couple glasses of wine helps Clinton speak the truth, let\u2019s buy her a case. Maybe then we\u2019ll find out who she is and what she really believes.\n\nCuomo tipping the balance\n\nOnly a politician can square this circle.\n\nFor nearly four years, Gov. Andrew Cuomo credited bipartisan support for much of his success. From tax cuts and spending caps to gay marriage and pension reform, he took advantage of a power-sharing arrangement in the state Senate to help balance the liberal Assembly. He wasn\u2019t shy about crediting Republicans for their help.\n\nYet, in exchange for the backing of the Working Families Party, Cuomo engineered the end of the bipartisan deal and pledges to help Democrats win the whole Legislature.\n\nGo figure. If Dems had been in charge all along, little of what Cuomo touts as success would have passed.\n\nPolitics, it is said, makes strange bedfellows. Maybe it\u2019s just that politicians are strange.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Say this for President Obama: He\u2019s got an uncanny ability to block out distractions and keep his eye on the ball.\nFacing a horrific expansion of terrorism in the Mideast, a meltdown of public", "title": "Obama\u2019s 'woe is me' attitude", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/170635572sg00044_president__95714165.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@mgoodwin_nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-6068744\"}", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,congress,economy,iraq,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-29 03:01:26", "sailthru.title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018woe is me\u2019\u00a0attitude", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/170635572sg00044_president__95714165.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Say this for President Obama: He\u2019s got an uncanny ability to block out distractions and keep his eye on the ball.\r\n\r\nFacing a horrific expansion of terrorism in the Mideast, a meltdown of public support at home and major rebukes by the Supreme Court, the president remains fixated on No. 1.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m finding lately I just want to say what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d he told a Minneapolis audience Friday, and then ticked off a series of complaints about \u2014 surprise \u2014 Republicans.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do anything, except block me and call me names,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were more interested in growing the economy for you and the issues that you are talking about instead of trying to mess with me, we would be doing a lot better.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe wasn\u2019t finished: \u201cThe critics, the cynics in Washington, they\u2019ve written me off more times than I can count.
