But \u2014 you know there has to be a \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 so does a guy named Barack Obama. Which brings me to one of the enduringly weird aspects of our current pundit discourse: constant calls for a moderate, sensible path that supposedly lies between the extremes of the two parties, but is in fact exactly what Obama has been proposing.\n\nSo, David says that\n\nThe federal government should borrow money at current interest rates to build infrastructure, including better bus networks so workers can get to distant jobs. The fact that the federal government has not passed major infrastructure legislation is mind-boggling, considering how much support there is from both parties.\n\nWell, the Obama administration would love to spend more on infrastructure; the problem is that a major spending bill has no chance of passing the House. And that\u2019s not a problem of \u201cboth parties\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s the GOP blocking it. Exactly how many Republicans would be willing to engage in deficit spending to expand bus networks? (Remember, these are the people who consider making rental bicycles available an example of \u201ctotalitarian\u201d rule.)\n\nAlso, there\u2019s this:\n\nthe government should reduce its generosity to people who are not working but increase its support for people who are. That means reducing health benefits for the affluent elderly \u2026\n\nHmm. The Affordable Care Act subsidizes insurance premiums for lower-income workers, and pays for those subsidies in part by eliminating overpayments for Medicare Advantage. So conservatives are celebrating both ends of that deal, right? Oh, wait, death panels.\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing thing: Obama is essentially what we used to call a liberal Republican, who faces implacable opposition from a very hard right. But Obama\u2019s moderation is hidden in plain sight, apparently invisible to the commentariat.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141024111905, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 24, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Invisible Moderate ( 20141024 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "If only Obama would call for Obama\u2019s policies!", "title": "The Invisible Moderate", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/the-invisible-moderate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "If only Obama would call for Obama\u2019s policies!", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 24, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1414163945, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T15:19:05-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20141024151905, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141024, "pdate": 20141024, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "If only Obama would call for Obama\u2019s policies!", "title": "The Invisible Moderate", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/the-invisible-moderate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/the-invisible-moderate/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Invisible Moderate", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec3d\"", "article_summary": "But Obama\u2019s moderation is hidden in plain sight, apparently invisible to the commentariat.\nThe fact that the federal government has not passed major infrastructure legislation is mind-boggling, considering how much support there is from both parties.\nWell, the Obama administration would love to spend more on infrastructure; the problem is that a major spending bill has no chance of passing the House.\nBut \u2014 you know there has to be a \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 so does a guy named Barack Obama.\nSo, David says thatThe federal government should borrow money at current interest rates to build infrastructure, including better bus networks so workers can get to distant jobs."}
