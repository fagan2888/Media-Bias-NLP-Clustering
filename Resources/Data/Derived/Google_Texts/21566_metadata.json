The Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs the Powerball lottery, had changed the odds of getting all of the matching Powerball numbers in the fall from about one in 175 million to one in 292.2 million. It\u2019s now less likely that players will win the jackpot, but there\u2019s a higher probability of winning a smaller prize (from one in 32 to one in 25).\n\nThat change put the odds of a billion-dollar lottery over a five-year period at 63.4 percent of the time, according to calculations from FiveThirtyEight. Under the previous odds, a billion-dollar lottery only had an 8.5 percent chance over a five-year period.\n\nRelated: New Powerball Rules Make It Harder to Win Big\n\nThe decision to shake up the odds resulted from disappointing ticket sales that plagued the lottery since 2013, the last year of a massive jackpot. Last year sales fell nationally by 19 percent. In New York, Powerball sales plunged 44 percent, by $217 million. Lottery officials were hoping that with the change, there\u2019d be more billion-dollar lotteries that would drum up excitement and sales.\n\nAnd they bet right. With the nation\u2019s largest lottery jackpot ever, people have been lining up to purchase tickets in the hopes of choosing the winning ticket.
