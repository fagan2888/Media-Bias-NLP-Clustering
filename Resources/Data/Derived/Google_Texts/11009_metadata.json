But a preliminary report issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday suggests that, for any who did, it would have been pretty easy.\n\nThe GAO, at the request of members of Congress, conducted what amounted to a sting operation against various health care exchanges using fraudulent identities to apply for, and receive, health insurance coverage and federal subsidies through the exchanges.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Could Go Back to the Supreme Court\n\nIn testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Oversight panel Wednesday, Seto J. Bagdoyan, the acting director of GAO\u2019s Forensic Audits and Investigative Service, testified that 11 of 12 fraudulent applicants were granted insurance and subsidies, and that most are still receiving them.\n\nAccording to Bagdoyan\u2019s testimony, the sole fake applicant who did not receive coverage was denied for refusal to provide a Social Security number. Bagdoyan noted that the remaining 11 fraudulent applicants were \u201cdirected to submit supporting documents, such as proof of income or citizenship\u201d but that the review process was inconsistent.\n\nTwo of the fake applicants submitted similarly fake supporting documentation, which was \u201cverified\u201d by contractors managing the online exchanges. Three submitted nothing at all, and continue to receive the subsidies.\n\nRep Charles Boustany Jr. (R-LA), the chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, said the failure of the exchanges to verify that recipients of government subsidies actually deserved them ought to be a non-partisan issue.\n\nRelated: Senate Zeroes in on Inflated Hepatitis-C Drug Cost\n\n\u201cThis is not simply a question of whether one likes the President\u2019s health care law or the way his Administration has gone about implementing it,\u201d he said in a statement prepared for the hearing. \u201cThe question is whether the Administration is being a good steward of taxpayer dollars and is putting in place adequate controls to protect those dollars from fraud, waste, and abuse. The history of the health care law\u2019s implementation suggests the answer is no.\u201d\n\nThe GAO also tried to test how many people charged with delivering in-person assistance to applicants would actively encourage applicants to misstate their income in order to qualify for a federal subsidy.\n\nThe good news is that in 100 percent of the cases in which investigators reached an \u201cassister,\u201d there was no evidence encouraging fraud. The bad news is that the GAO only got through to one assister. Website failures and excessive call volume prevented five out of six attempts to evaluate the assisters from ever getting through.\n\nAt this point, it remains unclear just how bad the GAO\u2019s findings really are for the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement, primarily because there is no evidence suggesting fraud was widespread.\n\nRelated: How an Obamacare Tweak Could Save Insurers Millions\n\nIf it was, though, it may be a while before anybody knows it.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating eligibility for subsidies, Bagdoyan told the subcommittee, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u201cmust rely on health insurance issuers to self-report enrollment data used to determine how much CMS owes the issuers for the income-based subsidies. Work is underway to implement such a system, according to CMS, but the agency does not have a timeline for completing and deploying it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats did not challenge the GAO\u2019s finding, but some, including Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, asked that the findings be kept in perspective.\n\n\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that the motivation for the fraud fabricated as part of the GAO investigation for a real person would be a desire to receive insurance coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be no financial windfall, as any government subsidy goes directly to insurance companies and not to the consumer seeking that insurance. In fact, people committing these frauds would be risking severe fines and possibly jail time.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that, eventually, the system would work and that fraudulent enrollees would eventually \u201cbe unenrolled from insurance\u201d and \u201cif they have misstated their income, they will have to repay the government for the subsidy that went to their insurance company.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A sting operation by the Government Accountability Office found that it was shockingly easy to apply for and receive health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act using false information.
