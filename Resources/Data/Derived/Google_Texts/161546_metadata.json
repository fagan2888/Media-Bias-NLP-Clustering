( Jeremy Papasso / Daily Camera )\n\nDuring the California gold rush nearly two centuries ago, the first million was made not by a miner, but by a publicist and merchant who sold picks, shovels and other supplies to eager prospectors.\n\nSome are banking on a similar pick-and-shovel play for today's \"green rush.\"\n\nThe legalization of marijuana for adult recreational use in Colorado and Washington coupled with a growing base of states that adopted medical marijuana legislation has spurred a boom in the legal cannabis business.\n\nThe budding industry is expected to tally $2.57 billion in sales this year, according to an ArcView Market Research report released late last year.\n\nIf the \"groundswell\"continues, cannabis could be a $10.2 billion business in 2018, ArcView officials wrote in the second edition of \"The State of Legal Marijuana Markets.\"\n\nOne of the fastest growing areas for investment is the ancillary business segment, which consists of firms that do not handle the marijuana products, but provide services for those who do.\n\n\"One of the reasons that the ancillary sector of the industry has drawn a lot of attention is because some investors feel more comfortable investing in a business that isn't directly tied to the products,\" said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group hosting the Cannabis Business Summit on Tuesday and Wednesday in Denver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome say that activity could fuel the \"Silicon Valley of weed\" in Colorado's capital and northern Front Range communities, establishing areas such as Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins as hubs of the burgeoning multibillion-dollar industry.\n\n\"As these new states or countries legalize (marijuana), they actually are coming here first,\" said Tom Bollich, chief executive officer of Boulder-based Surna Inc., a producer of water-chilled climate control systems for grow houses. \"This is the model of what's going to happen in the future.\"\n\nBrandon Masterson puts together a chiller box, part of Boulder-based Surna's water-chilled cooling systems for marijuana grow operations. (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\nThe 'GE' of weed\n\nSurna Inc. was founded with the aim of acquiring intellectual property, \"disruptive technologies,\" assets and scalable companies in the cannabis industry.\n\nIn April, Surna announced the acquisition of Hydro Innovations LLC, a Boulder firm that launched its first product in 2007 and evolved into a producer of cooling systems for indoor gardens.\n\nSurna paid $500,000 \u2014 made up of cash and potential Surna stock options \u2014 for Hydro Innovation's business, assets and intellectual property, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nWithin a few months' time, Surna has grown to 20 employees from two people and has started filling out 18,000 square feet of industrial space off 55th Street in Boulder.\n\nThe business that last year supplied cooling systems for grow houses ranging from 5,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet now is getting orders for operations in the 150,000-to-400,000-square-foot range, Bollich said. The company's patented technology can maintain the moderate temperatures marijuana plants prefer.\n\nJust as some grower has the potential to hit the branding jackpot and create the \"Coors Light\"of weed, Surna is shooting to become the industry's \"GE,\" he said, referencing the Fairfield, Connecticut-based multinational conglomerate with a $270 billion market capitalization.\n\n\"It's really hard to have a nationwide dispensary; you can't really do it right now,\" Bollich said. \"We can be nationwide. We're (already) worldwide.\"\n\nIn Superior, a cannabis software startup has ambitious goals of its own: to capture the niche homegrower market.\n\nGrowBuddy is a web- and mobile-based journal that allows users to manage their grow operations. The software allows for the tracking of items such as waterings and nutrient schedules and incorporates analytics.\n\nThe executive team of the five-person GrowBuddy compare the cannabis industry to that of the craft brewing business. As the laws change, more people are looking to grow their own marijuana plants and are turning to Internet forums to learn how to grow, said David Standard, GrowBuddy's chief visionary officer.\n\nJames Dietiker works to construct a portion of the EZTRIM bud trimming machine at Easy Trim LLC in Broomfield last week. (Jeremy Papasso / Daily Camera)\n\n\"With beer being readily accessible everywhere you go ... there are still people that brew their own,\" said Rob Rusher, GrowBuddy's CEO. \"It's in the couple million of people in the U.S. who do that now.\n\n\"We take that and compare that to the cannabis industry. (Marijuana) is not available on every corner. We expect those numbers to ramp up much faster.\"\n\nThe majority of GrowBuddy's customer base has come from Colorado, California and Canada. GrowBuddy's software is in public beta and a paid application is in development, Standard said, adding that future upgrades could include the addition of a social network for growers.\n\nThe firm has had promising discussions with investors after pitching at the inaugural Cannabis Capital Summit last month.\n\n\"When we started, it was unheard of,\" Standard said of the investor attention.\n\nInvestor attention\n\nOn Jan. 1, the date that Colorado's retail marijuana law took effect, if someone would have asked Peter Adams whether investors should buy into the cannabis industry, the executive director of the Rockies Venture Club would have advised them not to do so.\n\n\"That was Jan. 1,\" said Adams, whose organization supports \"angel\" investors, or those who provide investments to entrepreneurs or small startup businesses.\n\nNot even two weeks later, during an \"RVC Angels Unplugged\" event, one of the panelists touted that an investment in a cannabis firm generated a tenfold return in a nine-month period.\n\nA month later, officials for Evolutionary Genomics, a Lafayette-based company that landed early stage funding from the Rockies Venture Club and others for developing a gene discovery process for crops, told Adams that they were applying the technology to cannabis.\n\nEvolutionary Genomics raised more than $4 million in two weeks.\n\n\"We've never had a raise like that,\" Adams said.\n\nNoticing heightened investor interest in the cannabis industry in addition to \"wacky\" valuations drawn by some in the marijuana business, the Rockies Venture Club decided to host its first Cannabis Capital Summit.\n\nThe one-day event at the end of May was established to provide some thought leadership and education for investors and a forum for a half-dozen companies in the cannabis industry \u2014 among them GrowBuddy and Broomfield-based Easy Trim LLC \u2014 to pitch their technologies and products.\n\nAdams drew a parallel between the cannabis industry and the dot-com bubble of the 1990s.\n\n\"The reason for the euphoria at that time (was the idea that) the Internet is going to change the way retail works, going to change the way people buy; and the people who get in early are going to make a ton,\" he said. \"In cannabis, it's the same sort of thing. ... There's just a ton of money chasing these deals.\"\n\nTo a certain extent, there's a natural selection that occurs within boom cycles, but trying to predict the billion-dollar idea or when a bust might occur could be more difficult than other industries.\n\n\"What's different is there's a huge unknown of how fast this is going to unroll,\" he said, noting state- and federal-level adoption of cannabis-related laws and whether financing and lending will ease.\n\nAnd while some investors are seeing quick, healthy returns on cannabis products businesses, those on the fringe are becoming attractive targets because of their potential for expansion and adaptability to other markets, he said.\n\n\"If there is going to be a boom and bust, they're going to be more immune to it than others,\" he said.\n\n'Startup industry'\n\nAs the cannabis industry become more sophisticated as do the technologies and products that support the business, those involved should remain focused on their fundamentals, said Taylor West of the National Cannabis Industry Association.\n\n\"This is a booming and profitable industry, but it is not the license to print money that some people perceive it as,\" she said. \"In order to be successful, you have to navigate a lot of challenges. There are a lot of costs associated with this.\"\n\nBoulder-based Miller Soils, which has inoculated biochar and blended the biomass into its organic soils, has gone from supplying 20 yards a month to 100 yards a month, and the company's founder sees the potential to supply a couple thousands yards per month.\n\nLouis Miller, however, has intentionally taken a \"slow and persistent\" approach to growing his business.\n\n\"We've had to adapt to the difficulties that some of our customers have with the banking system as well as working with what basically is a startup industry,\" he said.\n\nDevin Liles, an owner and head of production at The Farm recreational marijuana shop in Boulder and Root Organic, the company's sister medical marijuana shop and grow operation, said 85 percent of his time is spent ensuring his businesses are in compliance with the newly formed state regulations.\n\n\"The biggest help that the state could be to my business is to make sure that everyone is playing by the rules,\" he said. \"I can only assume that they're having as tumultuous and difficult a time implementing as I am trying to comply. I have compassion for (state regulators) and for us and all of us in this scenario.\"\n\nThe industry remains in a formative state and the legalities of the business are complicated. West advises all cannabis industry businesses to have an attorney, to comply with state regulations and be aware of the inherent risk that comes with the business.\n\n\"It is growing and becoming more mainstream every day, but the fact remains, it is considered federally illegal,\" she said.\n\nWhen U.S. Drug Enforcement Agents cracked down on medical marijuana operations in 2012, the moves nearly crippled Easy Trim LLC, a Broomfield-based maker of bud trimming machines, said Mike Cross, who co-founded the company in 2011.\n\n\"I think that put the brakes on for a lot of people,\" Cross said. \"For us, especially, I think we were hit hard because (receiving a trimmer as a shipment) is an obvious red flag.\"\n\nThe climate is more favorable now, Cross said, noting that under new regulations, the trimmers are no longer considered paraphernalia and that the political environment has improved.\n\nA couple weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to defund DEA medical marijuana raids in states that legalized that aspect.\n\n\"I think the momentum is so positive for the industry right now that I don't really have many concerns,\" Cross said.\n\nCross expects \"substantial growth\" for the privately held Easy Trim this year, which notched triple-digit sales growth last year.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or
