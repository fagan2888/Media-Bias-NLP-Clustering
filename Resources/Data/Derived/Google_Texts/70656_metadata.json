Robert Bentley said the decision to reopen the offices for one day a month was necessary despite a tight state budget because residents of those districts need the licenses if they are going to drive.\n\nNow that is the definition of political shamelessness.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile feigning concern for the needs of black people in poor, rural areas, the governor is desperately covering up Alabama\u2019s effort to suppress the black vote. His sudden empathy was prompted by a national outcry over the shuttered offices as a crude act of oppression in a state with a long history of white segregationist politics. Hillary Clinton called the state\u2019s initial actions a \u201cblast from the Jim Crow past.\u201d\n\nThe fallout has prompted critics to sound alarms about the wave of new restrictions on voting across the country. Those new rules clearly depress turnout among minority, young, and elderly voters.\n\nUntil now, that tragic impact has been overlooked. Polls show most Americans \u2014 including most black people \u2014 support the Republican efforts to fight \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d despite a lack of evidence of any such fraud being widespread in Alabama or anywhere else. One study of a billion people who voted from 2000 to 2014 found only 31 cases of voter impersonation.\n\nThe claims of voter fraud are themselves political fraud. And the Alabama story has pulled back the curtain to reveal it.\n\nThe fact is that Alabama\u2019s Republican legislature voted in 2013 to require photo identification from all people trying to vote. Then they raised the price for applying for a license by 50 percent. And now they\u2019ve closed \u2014 for all but for one day a month \u2014 the rural Department of Motor Vehicles offices where licenses are issued.\n\nThese changes come after 2014 elections in which 20 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters did not have identification that included a photograph. The Boston Globe recently reported: \u201cAlabama in 2014 \u2026had the lowest turnout in an election since 1986. Now Alabama is closing offices where state residents can get a license with a photo ID and doing it almost exclusively in places where black people live.\u201d\n\nThe federal government could not stop these changes because the Supreme Court, in a 2013 ruling on a suit filed by Alabama\u2019s Shelby County, ended federal oversight of changes to any state\u2019s voting practices. In a 5-4 ruling, the court\u2019s conservative majority said the formula for determining which states needed pre-clearance was outdated.\n\nUntil Congress acts to revise the so-called \u201ccoverage formula,\u201d there is no pre-clearance requirement for any state \u2013 even those with a proven history of race-based voting discrimination.\n\nLast week, the governor was dismissive of charges that Alabama is suppressing the state\u2019s minority vote.\n\n\u201cTo suggest the closure of the driver\u2019s license offices is a racial issue is simply not true, and to suggest otherwise should be considered an effort to promote a political agenda,\u201d the governor said in a prepared statement.\n\nWhy would any cynic think that closing those offices might be politically subterfuge by Republicans?\n\nWell, here\u2019s why.\n\n\u201cEvery single county in which blacks make up more than 75 percent of registered voters will see their driver license office closed. Every one,\u201d claimed John Archibald, who writes for the Alabama Media Group, which includes the Birmingham News.\n\nArchibald concluded that the Republican governor and legislature had committed an \u201caffront to the very notion of justice in a nation where one man one vote is as precious as oxygen.\u201d He wrote that he\u2019d \u201clove to say\u201d that people who see a dangerous, modern-day brew of race and politics \u201chave us all wrong,\u201d but \u201cthe numbers say they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe lone Democrat in Alabama\u2019s congressional delegation, Rep. Terri Sewell Terri SewellRyan backs voting rights bill \u2014 but tells black caucus it's out of his hands Dems pound drum for voting rights update Juan Williams: GOP disgraces itself with voter ID push MORE, is another voice raised to assert that this is voter disenfranchisement.\n\nIn a state where a quarter of the population is black, Sewell is the only Democrat in Congress. The state legislature\u2019s GOP majority gerrymandered the state\u2019s congressional districts so that six of the seven are represented by Republicans, and blacks are concentrated and isolated in Sewell\u2019s district.\n\nShe was reelected last year with 98.37 percent of the vote while white Republicans enjoy safe and heavily white, Republican districts in the rest of the state.\n\nSewell recently asked the Justice Department for an investigation into whether Alabama is violating existing federal election laws by limiting black citizens\u2019 access to identification while raising the standards for voter ID.\n\nSewell also points out that no Republican is supporting the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 which reinstates federal clearance for changes that impact voting in 13 states with past instances of proven voter discrimination, including Alabama. \u201cWe have over 106 sponsors, and we\u2019re looking for our first Republican,\u201d Sewell told U.S. News & World Report.\n\nAn earlier legislative effort, the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014, would have reinstated pre-clearance for only four states, not including Alabama. That bill had 12 Republican supporters, including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the influential former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, but the Republican House leadership somehow never scheduled a vote.\n\nAs the author of several books on civil rights history, and decades spent covering Washington politics, I am reluctant to assign blame for playing racial politics. Republicans and Democrats, black and white, play the sad game.\n\nBut the crass effort at suppressing the black vote ahead of the 2016 presidential race is a tragic, bright stain on the Party of Lincoln.\n\nJuan Williams is an author and political analyst for Fox News Channel.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "OPINION | Republican moves in Alabama were clearly targeted at suppressing black turnout.", "description": "OPINION | Republican moves in Alabama were clearly targeted at suppressing black turnout.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Juan Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "OPINION | Republican moves in Alabama were clearly targeted at suppressing black turnout.", "title": "Juan Williams: GOP disgraces itself with voter ID push", "url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/257991-juan-williams-gop-disgraces-itself-with-voter-id-push", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/bentleyrobert_042811getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-26T06:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-26T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/257991-juan-williams-gop-disgraces-itself-with-voter-id-push", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-26T06:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Niall Stanage", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "voting rights, Voter suppression, race relations,Terri Sewell, Robert Bentley,Republican Party", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-26T06:00:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-26T06:00:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/257991-juan-williams-gop-disgraces-itself-with-voter-id-push", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "OPINION | Republican moves in Alabama were clearly targeted at suppressing black turnout.", "card": "summary", "title": "Juan Williams: GOP disgraces itself with voter ID push"}, "dcterms.title": "Juan Williams: GOP disgraces itself with voter ID push"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTWhile feigning concern for the needs of black people in poor, rural areas, the governor is desperately covering up Alabama\u2019s effort to suppress the black vote.\nBut the crass effort at suppressing the black vote ahead of the 2016 presidential race is a tragic, bright stain on the Party of Lincoln.\nAn earlier legislative effort, the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014, would have reinstated pre-clearance for only four states, not including Alabama.\nOne study of a billion people who voted from 2000 to 2014 found only 31 cases of voter impersonation.\nLast week, the governor was dismissive of charges that Alabama is suppressing the state\u2019s minority vote."}
