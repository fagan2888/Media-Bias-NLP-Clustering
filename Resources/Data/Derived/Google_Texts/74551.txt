Cultural differences may explain why some girls in minority groups and low-income families – who have a statistically higher risk of cervical cancer – are not getting the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine, according to a new study from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Colorado.

While English-speaking parents said they were concerned over the vaccine’s need and safety, Spanish-speaking parents said they feared the vaccine would encourage sexual activity and that health care providers failed to explain that they needed three shots to be fully immunized.

“The reasons low-income girls did not initiate or complete the HPV vaccination were strikingly different depending on whether their parents spoke English or Spanish” said study author Dr. Sean O’Leary, an investigator at the Children’s Outcomes Research Program, which is affiliated with Children’s Hospital. “This is a safe and effective vaccine. We are seeing huge declines in HPV infection rates in the U.S. overall and especially among those who have received the vaccine.”

The vaccine is given in three doses over six months. Overall, 33 percent of girls have had three shots while 28 percent of those below the poverty line received the injections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

HPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. with 75 percent of Americans infected at some point, O’Leary said. It is also a leading cause of cervical cancer in women and throat cancer in men.

The study’s researchers recommend that health care providers fully explain the need for the vaccines to their patients and he necessity of three shots.

“The HPV vaccine is one of the few tools we have that actually prevents cancer,” O’Leary said.
