One analysis, relying on early rate filings in major urban areas, actually found a slight drop in \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans\u2014a particular category of mid-priced plans sold through the exchanges.\n\nBut the story with premiums is, at minimum, more complicated than that. A new report in The New York Times, which digs through early rate filing data, does a good job of teasing out the complexities.\n\nFor one thing, as the Times notes, it\u2019s not all that helpful to just look at average prices, because \u201cindividual consumers don\u2019t buy the average plan. And the federal government doesn\u2019t pay for the average plan.\u201d And when you look beyond the averages, the premium changes we\u2019re seeing so far don\u2019t look quite so rosy, especially for those who stick with their current plans. \u201cIn many places premiums are going up by double-digit percentages within many of the most popular plans,\u201d the Times reports.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that in one sense, we\u2019re seeing a remarkable restraint in premium growth: Prices for the cheapest plans in the law\u2019s \u201csilver\u201d tier\u2014the middle of the plan hierarchy, which must cover 70 percent of average costs\u2014are expected to drop in some states, and rise just 1 percent overall.\n\nBut the cheapest silver plan last year is not necessarily the same as the cheapest silver plan this year. So if you\u2019re already in the system, and you want to keep your premium from rising, that means you\u2019ll probably have to switch to a different plan, with a different payment configurations and a different network providers.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re on the cheapest plan from last year, and you want to stay in your plan\u2014or if you bought through a federally run exchange and decide to accept the auto-renewal system that the administration has set up\u2014then you\u2019re probably in for big price hikes. \u201cThose prices are going up almost everywhere,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cIn some cases, they have increased by more than 10 percent. The average increase is 8.4 percent.\u201d\n\nSo you can keep your premium\u2014or you can keep your plan. But in many cases, you can\u2019t keep both.\n\nThere are potential upsides here. In theory, it could teach people buying through the exchanges to shop around more frequently, which could create a more cost-effective, competitive health insurance ecosystem. The fact that the low-end of the silver tier is holding steady suggests that insurers may, in fact, be looking to compete with each other on price. Most of the inexpensive plans next year are new entrants, or are plans with fewer members, looking to price low in order to gain market share.\n\nBut how long can that go on? If low-prices exist only as teaser rates, designed to lure in customers whose premiums will be hiked later on, then what we\u2019re really seeing may not be meaningful cost-restraint so much as artificially low prices that aren\u2019t sustainable over time.\n\nAnd to some extent, all the premium prices we\u2019re seeing right now are artificial, or at least experimental, because they are built on the expectation of a significant federal subsidy in the event of unexpectedly high claims costs. Obamacare\u2019s \u201crisk corridors\u201d program\u2014often referred to as its insurer bailout\u2014runs through 2016, and it allows insurers to experiment with potentially unsustainable low pricing. Insurance industry consultant Bob Laszewski recently wrote that he\u2019s heard \u201creports of actuarial consultants going around to the plans that failed to gain substantial market share suggesting they lower their rates in order to grab market share because they have nothing to lose\u201d thanks to the way Obamacare covers insurer losses.\n\nAs Laszewski also notes, there's not much in the way of claims data so far, so insurers don't really have good information about the expected costs of the exchange population, which means the rates they are setting are heavy on guess work.\n\nThe big picture here is that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on with Obamacare premiums. Prices on popular plans are pretty clearly going up, but there does seem to be some effort to compete on price, at least for now. But how long will that last? And how big a success is it really if it requires hefty federal subsidies for both individuals and insurers?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "You might have seen headlines recently trumpeting Obamacare\u2019s success at restraining health insurance premiums next year.
