After beginning her writing career at 16 as a junior columnist for the local paper, Mary spent several years living, working and studying in southwestern Mexico before returning to the United States to finish her studies. Mary has written content for \"The Daily Caller,\" the Mercury One project launch , and the SPCAI\u2019s Operation Baghdad Pups, among other projects. She also served on the proofing team for a book on the history of socialism written by a former member of the CIA under Ronald Reagan. Today she runs a political commentary blog at www.afuturefree.com . Because Mary happens to be a millennial and a woman, she never tires of shocking those who assume she must\u2014by nature\u2014be a liberal. She currently resides with her husband and their dog in Minnesota where she continues to work on a book of immigrants\u2019 stories.\n\nYou\u2019ve see the signs a million times before. In fact, they are relatively commonplace.\n\nThey read something like this: Guns banned on this premise.\n\nI see one every time I open the door to the gym I attend.\n\nIt means that the owner either doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with the Second Amendment as a matter of opinion, or thinks that somehow by banning guns on the premise, the chances of gun-related violence diminish.\n\nWhatever the reason, the premise is simple: the owner doesn\u2019t want guns. So, despite the fact that state and federal laws allow me to (with the correct permits) carry a gun legally, I can\u2019t bring one to that establishment because that owner\u2019s convictions or conclusions about firearms reign supreme.\n\nAs well they should.\n\nEquality as it pertains to our basic rights is vital. And it can have no exceptions. Share:\n\nIt\u2019s that person\u2019s private property, and as such they have a right to establish whatever behavioral parameters they want\u2014so long as they\u2019re not calling for someone\u2019s harm. And you, free citizen of America, aren\u2019t forced to frequent that business.\n\nHere\u2019s the reality of the situation. Sometimes exercising your right to do as you please on your private property means you\u2019re eventually going to offend someone. (And yes\u2014private property includes your business. You hold a deed to your business\u2019 building just like you hold a deed to your private residence, do you not?)\n\nGuess what. We do not have a guaranteed freedom from feeling offended.\n\nTake a moment and imagine if everyone had a guaranteed, enforceable, Constitutionally-protected right to freedom from feeling offended. The world would come to a literal halt.\n\nDo you know why that can\u2019t possibly work?\n\nBecause guaranteeing one person\u2019s right to \u201cfreedom from feeling offended\u201d means you will absolutely, unequivocally curtail the rights of someone else.\n\nIf you tell John Doe that he\u2019s guaranteed to never feel offended, you\u2019d either have to ensure that every single person agrees 100 percent with John Doe\u2019s beliefs, or you\u2019re going to tell an awful lot of people to keep their mouths shut (thus\u2014curtailing their right to freedom from feeling offended).\n\nSee? It\u2019s a vicious circle.\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s a solution. But we\u2019ll get to that in a moment.\n\nLet\u2019s take this conversation to a couple of places: California, Arkansas, and Indiana, respectively.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIn 2010, five students were sent home for refusing to remove clothing that showed an American flag\u2014all because they were wearing it on Cinco de Mayo, and the school wanted to avoid possible conflict.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cmore than 100 students were spotted wearing the colors of the Mexican flag \u2014 red, white and green \u2014 as they left school, including some who had the flag painted on their faces or arms.\u201d\n\nDespite this obvious double standard, the Supreme Court recently ruled against the students\u2019 families\u2019 petition to have their right to their free speech in a public institution upheld.\n\nHad it been a privately owned school, then the argument is moot. And, not unlike my example of my gym\u2019s prohibition of guns, the owner of the private school should be allowed to do make whatever judgment calls he or she wants\u2014however outlandish they may or may not be\u2014so long as no one is being harmed and no laws are being broken.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s a public school makes it a totally different discussion. The parameters of their existence mean they don\u2019t get the luxury (like a private entity) of expressing a preference pertaining to, for example, politics or religion, within their walls\u2014even though they so often do. (And no, this isn\u2019t meant to be construed into meaning that we ignore or supress our nation\u2019s Judeo-Christian history)\n\nThis California school is a perfect example: it gave deference to the Mexican students in order that they could freely honor a Mexican holiday, yet forced non-Mexican students to hide their display of patriotism for the United States on that same day.\n\nIndiana and Arkansas\n\nIndiana (with Arkansas undoubtedly to follow suit with the passage of similar law) is in incredibly hot water, all because the state passed a law (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) that protects people from being forced to break with their faith.\n\nWhile its basis is rooted in the Hobby Lobby case (in which the chain took issue with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provision that would require them to violate their religious beliefs towards abortofacient contraceptives) the law would also extend to cases similar to those of the New Mexico photographer who declined to photograph a gay wedding and the Colorado bakers who for the same reasons declined to bake a wedding cake for a gay wedding, and so on.\n\nIn other words, it would allow a business owner to refuse certain parts of their services to people (no, not to put up a \u201cgays not welcome here sign\u201d) if those services would force the owner to violate their deeply-held religious beliefs.\n\nThe outrage holds that the law(s) discriminate against homosexuals specifically, and that the customer\u2019s desires trump the business owner\u2019s right to hold a religious belief.\n\nNote: while neither states\u2019 laws originally referenced the LGBTA community\u2014(it was implied given the context), Indiana has now amended the law to include language that \u201cprohibits a provider from using the new law to refuse services, facilities, goods, employment or housing to anyone based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d stating that the U.S. and State Constitutions still enshrine protections for matters of conscience. Arkansas similarly modified the language in their state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, after a firestorm of controversy ensued there as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s the answer?\n\nIn the case of California, the flag-wearing students\u2019 personal right to free speech was curtailed so that the Mexican students wouldn\u2019t be offended. In the cases of the business owners, their personal right to religious freedom was curtailed in order that the homosexual couples involved wouldn\u2019t be offended by the suggestion that there are people who don\u2019t condone their lifestyle.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal. In neither case was there, nor is there a call to prohibit their behavior in any way.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a demand that the Mexican students to stop celebrating Cinco de Mayo. Similarly, the business owners weren\u2019t demanding that the gay couples be banned from marrying.\n\nSo to those who opposed the students in California, and to those who oppose Indiana and Arkansas\u2014what\u2019s your alternative?\n\nWhat would you put into place to ensure that no one\u2019s rights are limited?\n\nYou see, the beauty of our Constitution is that it guarantees equality of certain basic freedoms, insomuch as exercising those freedoms does not interfere with the fundamental rights of others.\n\nFor example, someone\u2019s religious freedom isn\u2019t protected if they use it to harm others, as is the case of honor killings in Shariah Law.\n\nHaving a baker politely decline to paricipate in your wedding doesn\u2019t deny you a fundamental right\u2014even if it is offensive to you. We do not have the right to have everyone agree with us and cater to those beliefs\u2013 no matter what.\n\nAt the end of the day, the idea behind these laws is to afford everyone the very same protections.\n\nThe same law that would protect a Christian baker from having to participate in a gay wedding ceremony is the very same law that would protect a gay bakery owner from having to bake a cake for an anti-gay celebration put on by the Westboro Baptists.\n\nDid you ever stop to think about that?\n\nEquality as it pertains to our basic rights is vital.
