As the stalemate in Washington over Obamacare continues, Republicans in Congress, seeking to defund the Affordable Care Act, ought to look to Massachusetts where the state’s landmark health care reform law is doing just fine.



That’s because the commonwealth, the state’s major health insurers and health care policy leaders have all been working together to make the 2006 law work.



Seven years after the health-care reform bill was enacted – under then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican – health care spending in Massachusetts is growing at a slower rate than in the country overall.



The information was released on Tuesday during a two-day hearing on health care costs at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.



“I think it will highlight the enormous progress Massachusetts has made in covering virtually all its residents and beginning to tackle the national problem of controlling health care costs in a manner that improves the quality of care,” said Glen Shor, secretary of the Executive Office for Administration and Finance.



The positive data on health care cost controls doesn’t mean the Bay State is where it should or wants to be on making care affordable. Massachusetts residents are still spending more than the national average on their health care.



The fact that the health-care stakeholders in Massachusetts are still working together to improve health care and contain its costs – over the last half dozen years – should be an inspiration to the folks in Washington who don’t seem to grasp the notion that time and an open mind can heal all wounds.
