The combined hit on ACA-related business in 2014 and 2015 for the company could total $400 million and has prompted CEO Brad Wilson to consider pulling BCBSNC from the ACA market in 2017, The News and Observer reported.\n\nBig Loss of Service\n\nBCBSNC is the only qualified health plan insurer offering ACA plans in all 100 North Carolina counties. The company\u2019s losses brought on changes in its service and operations in 2016. In addition to hiking premiums 32.5 percent, company officials issued a statement on January 24, 2016, announcing sales agents could no longer earn commissions on plans with start dates of April through December of 2016.\n\nNorth Carolina Commissioner of Insurance Wayne Goodwin says the reduction of plan offerings could harm consumers.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s largest health insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, chose to reduce its plan offerings in several areas of the state for the 2016 plan year after experiencing a $123 million operating loss in 2014 and continued poor emerging experience in 2015,\u201d Goodwin wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Sylvia Burwell on February 2. \u201cThe insurer also eliminated the availability of its broadest network plans in those areas, relegating thousands of North Carolina consumers to narrow-network plans.\u201d\n\nStatewide Insurance Problems\n\nGoodwin wrote BCBSNC\u2019s troubles are representative of problems facing other health insurers in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cThe reduction in plan availability is not unique to our largest insurer or to the individual market,\u201d Goodwin wrote. \u201cFrom 2015 to 2016, the total number of plans available from insurers in the two markets went from approximately 1,700 plans to 683 plans. All three of North Carolina\u2019s qualified health plan insurers reduced the number and types of plans offered on the exchange, as well as the areas in which they are available, for 2016.\u201d\n\nGoodwin says he is \u201chighly concerned\u201d insurers might withdraw from North Carolina\u2019s individual health coverage market. Some North Carolinians seeking individual health coverage already have access to only one insurer.\n\n\u201cIf that insurer stops offering coverage in those counties, some North Carolinians will have no access to health insurance at all,\u201d Goodwin said.\n\nMedicaid Not the Answer\n\nNorth Carolina is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the ACA, a decision some critics blame for BCBSNC\u2019s financial shortfalls. Others blame market disruption caused by the ACA.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina exercised its freedom to not expand Medicaid,\u201d said Katherine Restrepo, health and human services policy analyst at the John Locke Foundation. \u201cMedicaid expansion is not the way to solve the health insurance market disruption imposed by the federal health law. A heavier caseload on Medicaid creates a cost-shifting phenomenon in which private coverage will be even more expensive.\u201d\n\n\u2018Eliminate the Mandates\u2019\n\nRestrepo says less regulation of insurance products is the way to increase access and lower premiums.\n\n\u201cThe way in which this can be remedied is to relax government price controls on health insurance premiums,\u201d Restrepo said. \u201cEliminate the mandates for coverage for individuals and employers, the 10 essential health benefits, and North Carolina\u2019s state health benefits mandates, and instead give the insurance companies the flexibility to offer products that tailor to individuals\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nDr. Chris Conover, a research scholar at Duke University\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research, agrees BCBSNC\u2019s hardships extend well beyond North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIn North Carolina, for the 2014 sign-up period, 28 percent of exchange enrollees were in the desirable \u2018young\u2019 age category of 18 to 34, versus 24 percent who were age 55 to 64,\u201d said Conover. \u201cThose figures are nearly identical to the national averages: 28 percent age 18 to 34 and 25 percent age 55 to 64. That tells us North Carolina\u2019s situation is far from unique.\u201d\n\nRestrepo says ultimately, \u201cit will take an act of Congress to fix the mess the ACA has created. A lot of that depends on who our nation\u2019s leader will be next year.\u201d\n\nMichael McGrady (mmcgrady@uccs.edu) writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nWayne Goodwin, \u201cLetter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell from North Carolina Insurance Commissioner,\u201d February 2, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/letter-hhs-secretary-sylvia-burwell-north-carolina-insurance-commissioner\n\nImage via Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Ramping up to the release of its 2015 financials report in March, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC) projected its second consecutive yearly loss.\nFinancial strain imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may force North Carolina\u2019s largest health insurer to quit the ACA market by 2017.\nBig Loss of ServiceBCBSNC is the only qualified health plan insurer offering ACA plans in all 100 North Carolina counties.\nInternet Info:Wayne Goodwin, \u201cLetter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell from North Carolina Insurance Commissioner,\u201d February 2, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/letter-hhs-secretary-sylvia-burwell-north-carolina-insurance-commissionerImage via Thinkstock\n\u201cMedicaid expansion is not the way to solve the health insurance market disruption imposed by the federal health law."}
