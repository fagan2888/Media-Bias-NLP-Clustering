However, the Supreme Court tends to take into account the American public\u2019s perception of policy issues in its rulings.\n\n\u201cPublic sentiment is everything,\u201d President Abraham Lincoln once said. \u201cWith it, nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces judicial decisions.\u201d\n\nGallup polling clearly indicates how the abortion issue has shifted in recent years. Americans increasingly identify as pro-life \u2014 with a large majority of 71% favoring at least some restrictions on abortion.\n\nFurthermore, leaders elected at the state level in recent years are following through on their promises to uphold and strengthen a culture of life. As Vox notes, \u201dStates enacted 205 abortion restrictions between 2010 and 2013, more than the total number passed in the prior decade.\u201d\n\nThese indicators of cultural shift partly explain what few have considered \u2014 the last five times the Supreme Court considered abortion policy, it ruled in favor of life:\n\n5. Gonzales v. Carhart\n\nDecided April 18, 2007\n\nFollowing the enactment of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, Dr. Leroy Carhart and other abortionists sued to continue to perform the procedure \u2014 defined in the law as \u201c[when] the entire baby\u2019s head is outside the body of the mother\u2026 [and a] person [knowingly] kills the partially delivered infant.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the law was Constitutional and not an \u201cundue burden\u201d as some claimed. Five years following the ruling, Alliance Defending Freedom used Guttmacher Institute\u2019s own numbers to estimate that over 10,000 pre-born babies may have been saved due to this policy shift.\n\nPhoto: Alexandre Duarte\n\n4. Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas v. Abbott\n\nCourt Order Given November 19, 2013\n\nWith support from a large bipartisan majority of Texas legislators, HB 2 (also known as Texas Senate Bill 5) was signed into law on July 18, 2013. By November, the question of the state law\u2019s constitutionality was elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia rejected the emergency appeal to halt the Texas law, finding Planned Parenthood did not \u201c[assert] that the law is even probably unconstitutional.\u201d Safety regulations in the Texas law \u2014 requiring abortion centers to follow surgical clinic standards, banning dangerous \u201ctelemed\u201d abortions, and ensuring abortion providers are properly licensed \u2014 have since been enacted in other states. Last fall, Bound4LIFE team members traveled to Texas in a targeted prayer effort that coincided with legal action on this case.\n\n3. Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius\n\nCourt Order Given January 24, 2014\n\nThis past January, Justice Sonia Sotomayor faced an emergency appeal from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Under Obamacare, would a group of Catholic nuns who perform charity work in a non-church capacity be forced to pay for contraceptives in their insurance plan? Justice Sotomayor decided in favor of Little Sisters of the Poor, granting them an injunction against the Obama Administration\u2019s mandate.\n\nFollowing the Hobby Lobby ruling (see below) pertaining to family-owned for-profit businesses, many court observers assumed the Dept. of Justice (DOJ) would drop its case against this non-profit charity group. Instead, they doubled down.\n\n\u201cMerely offering the Little Sisters a different way to violate their religion does not ease their conscience,\u201d said their counsel Adele Keim after reviewing DOJ\u2019s revised September 8 lawsuit against the nuns.\n\n\n\nLittle Sisters of the Poor in ministry (courtesy of The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty)\n\n2. McCullen v. Coakley\n\nDecided June 26, 2014\n\nIn this case brought against 77 year-old sidewalk counselor Eleanor McCullen, she won the right to speak up freely to women entering abortion centers in Massachusetts.\n\nOnly weeks after the ruling, however, Massachusetts passed a severe new law that reinstates \u201cbuffer zone\u201d requirements. Today, even a peaceful grandmother like McCullen who distributes literature within 25 feet of an abortion center\u2019s entrance could face steep penalties \u2014 fines that reach up to a whopping $50,000 and up to 5 years in jail.\n\n1. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n\nDecided June 30, 2014\n\nIn this much-discussed court case, Hobby Lobby \u2014 a national arts-and-crafts chain which employs over 16,000 Americans \u2014 successfully defended its policy of not covering in employee insurance plans four drugs and devices that can end the life of a pre-born baby.\n\nFollowing months of focused prayer at the Supreme Court, Bound4LIFE team members joined the crowds outside the court who hailed the decision as a victory for life and liberty. Legislation in Congress intended to reverse the decision was voted down in an initial vote of the U.S. Senate on July 16.\n\n\n\nCounsel Adele Keim and the Becket Fund Legal Team, Following Hobby Lobby Victory at the Supreme Court\n\nAs a new Supreme Court term begins on October 6, many speculate at least one case concerning abortion policy will be on the docket.\n\nLaw professor Stephen Wermiel, in a SCOTUS Blog analysis entitled \u201cAbortion\u2019s time is coming,\u201d recently stated: \u201cThe status and scope of the right to abortion may hang in the balance\u2026 it is only a matter of time before the Court confronts another major milestone in the fight over abortion.\u201d\n\nAdvancing a culture of life is a matter for prayer and action. Pray for the nine justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court, for their wisdom in choosing, deliberating and deciding court cases that reverberate in every city in America \u2014 and beyond.\n\nLifeNews Note: Josh M.
