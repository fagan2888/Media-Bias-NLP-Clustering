Written months before the primary season, the author looks at top-tier GOP contenders Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, the disappearing Jeb Bush and Rand Paul, flameout Bobby Jindal, and Paul Ryan, a man better suited to be Speaker of the House than President. The book reminds the reader that the candidates are avatars of the GOP\u2019s warring factions, while delving into who these presidential aspirants actually are.\n\nAlthough The Wilderness is easy on policy, Coppins catches his subjects and their inner circles saying the darndest things. The author\u2019s portraits are light-handed, but withering. Florida\u2019s Rubio comes across as boy with man-sized ambitions, and a tropism for other peoples\u2019 money. Coppins rehashes the senator\u2019s credit card problems, but also nails Marco pinching himself over his own good fortune. In the book\u2019s telling, Rubio exclaimed to a friend, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing \u2026 I can call up a lobbyist at four in the morning, and he\u2019ll meet me anywhere with a bag of forty thousand dollars in cash.\u201d Talk about candor.\n\nWith this kind of history, Rubio is a poster child for mandated candidate disclosure of a decade\u2019s worth of FICO scores. It\u2019s only fair that our would-be presidents answer whether or not they can get their credit swagger on. Heck, if they can\u2019t manage their own checkbooks, why should they be allowed to pick our pockets and pry into our tax returns\u2014without first giving We the People the opportunity to judge for ourselves? Fair is fair.\n\nThe author likewise sheds light on why Jeb has been unable to connect with the Republican base\u2014and it\u2019s not just about immigration. Rather, Coppins captures the unearned sense of entitlement that has come to pervade the latest iteration of Bushworld. The Wilderness accurately depicts Jeb as not understanding, let alone internalizing, that the Republican Party was not clamoring for a third Bush presidency, and that regime change was no longer the only option on the GOP\u2019s foreign policy menu. As for primogeniture, fuggetaboutit.\n\nTo drive the point home, Coppins records a blunt exchange between Jeb and W after the younger Bush kept tripping over the wisdom of the Iraq War. Apparently, Bush 43 laced into his brother, saying: \u201cStop with this [crap] \u2026 Say whatever you have to say.\u201d\n\nJeb has since taken his brother\u2019s advice, but from the looks of the polls not all that many folks are listening. Having started at the center of the Republican debate stage, Jeb has been steadily pushed toward the wings. At this rate, Jeb is on course for being the next John Connally\u2014the 1980 Republican hopeful, Nixon Treasury Secretary, and ex-Texas Governor\u2014who spent millions, but could barely snag a single convention delegate.\n\nCoppins can\u2019t be blamed for putting the Republicans under a microscope. The 2016 GOP field is interesting and entertaining, if nothing else. The Republicans possess none of the somnolence and certainty that mark Hillary Clinton\u2019s coronation quest. More to the point, neither the Republican base, nor the candidates themselves, seem to place much stock in deference to their so-called betters\u2014or to each other. Think of the GOP as a raucous Congregation of Dissenters, where Bible and the U.S. Constitution are the sacred texts, where authority rests with the laity, and just what constitutes the hierarchy is very much in doubt.\n\nIf Eric Cantor, the then-House Majority Leader, could lose his seat in a primary challenge as he did in 2014, then no national Republican is truly safe. As The Wilderness records, moments after Cantor was history, Brent Bozell, a movement conservative, founder of the Media Research Center and nephew of the late William Buckley, issued a press release that directly challenged the GOP\u2019s pooh-bahs and the status quo: \u201cEric Cantor\u2019s loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP establishment \u2026 The grass roots are in revolt and marching.\u201d\n\nWhen the apocalypse and politics get mentioned together in a press release, it is time to take notice, and Cruz and Trump did just that. Building upon his 2012 victory, and his failed effort in 2013 to repeal Obamacare by shutting down the government, Texas\u2019s freshman senator redoubled his efforts to win the hearts and votes of white evangelicals by pushing religious freedom laws.\n\nThen, for the added benefit of those Republicans determined to stick it to the Man and possibly less moved by the Deity, Cruz blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a liar\u2014on the Senate floor of all places. While Cruz\u2019s colleagues loathe him, he leads in Iowa, and is running second nationally among the party faithful.\n\nWhich brings us to Trump. Coppins gets it right in describing The Donald\u2019s efforts to reach out to Sarah Palin and her supporters, and Trump\u2019s penchant for first-person superlatives directed at himself. Looking back, Trump understood that Palin was about white identity politics long before anyone else. Palin\u2019s references to her husband and to herself\u2014\u201cHe\u2019s got the rifle, I\u2019ve got the rack\u201d\u2014said it all. No surprise, Trump \u201cgets\u201d and connects with working class and non-churchgoing Republicans.\n\nCoppins also shares his unpleasant experiences of having earned the wrath of Trump and his supporters after having published a less than flattering portrait of the billionaire who would become the GOP\u2019s frontrunner. Welcome to America in the here and now, where the political is the personal, bitterly divided by class, culture, and race, and where no one is immune from internet attack. Technology and diversity bring their own downsides. Little in life is unalloyed.\n\nLikely because of its early publication, The Wilderness fails to come right and say that the Republican fight in 2016 is just as much about the scrum for the nomination as it is a cage match for control of the GOP. Right now, three Republican power centers are competing, tugging, and jostling with each other\u2014the establishment as embodied by Rubio and Bush, the counter-establishment and their guy Cruz, and the Republican working class base.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing. The GOP doesn\u2019t seem all that interested in the worldly needs of working Americans. As portrayed by Coppins, Speaker Ryan has thrown his soul into the inner city\u2014but that\u2019s not where Republican voters live. Then, to top it off, the Speaker, like much of the GOP field, would \u201creform\u201d Social Security and Medicare, programs that middle class Americans have earned over a lifetime and rightfully rely upon.\n\nIf the Republicans are to exit the wilderness, and resume residency at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they will need a candidate who can both appeal to the party\u2019s ever-more vocal working and middle class base, and to voters who are turned-off by Clinton\u2019s disconnect from lunch bucket America and her disdain for the truth\u2014but who are still not buying what the Republicans are selling. Whether the GOP can pull it together remains to be seen. November is a long way away.\n\nLloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George H.W.
