UNDATED (WSAU) - It's now 2016, and it's time to start getting your 2015 taxes ready to file.

Christopher Miller from the Internal Revenue Service says you should be getting documents like your charitable donation receipts and health care information ready to file. "Paperwork like that is good to start getting in one place right now. Put it in a file so you have it together since tax is just around the corner." He says one important document you'll need is the 1095-A, B or C you'll have recieved if you're getting insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

Miller says that E-filing remains to best way to complete your taxes. "That insures that you're getting all the credits and deductions that you have coming to you, and it ensures that all the math is done correctly. So it's generally speaking a much more accurate return." You may also qualify for free help on your filing, either through e-filing or through local assistance. "You can do it online for free by going to our website, or you can go to a volunteer income tax assistance site. These are organizations that are in your community including AARP that does tax counselling for the elderly."

Filing officially opens January 19th, and thanks to a special holiday in Washington DC on April 15th, will complete on Monday April 18th. You can learn more about this year's returns and tax information online at http://www.irs.gov.
