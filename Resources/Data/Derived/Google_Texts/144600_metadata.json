Last week\u2019s announcement that the White House will focus on the challenges facing girls and women of color is an attempt to acknowledge this shared struggle across gender lines, a struggle that extends far beyond Ferguson. The move comes after months of criticism that My Brothers Keeper, the White House racial justice initiative announced in February, is fundamentally flawed because it singles out boys and men of color for support and turns a blind eye to the girls and women in those same families, classrooms and communities. The day the White House announced that it would form a working group to study this demographic it also released a report titled \u201cWomen and Girls of Color: Addressing Challenges and Expanding Opportunity.\u201d But instead of charting a course of action, it simply outlines everything the administration has already accomplished that may positively affect the lives of women and girls of color. Among these are passing the Affordable Care Act, establishing a campus sexual assault task force, and reforming sentencing for non-violent drug offenders. \u201cThe Administration supports numerous efforts to provide STEM opportunities to elementary and secondary school students, including many girls of color,\u201d reads one section of the report, and sentences like this appear throughout. The report is a helpful reminder of various federal initiatives embarked upon in the past six years, but its implicit message is that great strides have already been made for women and girls of color\u2014and that this group doesn\u2019t merit the direct, explicit focus that boys and men of color do. Joanne N. Smith, founder and director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity, has been among those voices calling for My Brother\u2019s Keeper to be reworked with a gender-inclusive lens. She gives last week\u2019s announcement mixed reviews. \u201cThe fact that the White House is discussing the needs of girls and women of color is something that we should celebrate,\u201d Smith told me, and went on to explain that her work calling for meaningful inclusion isn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near what MBK is, it\u2019s nowhere near what girls of color deserve and we have to charge them to do so much more.\u201d Without the $300 million that private foundations and corporations have pledged to support MBK, it\u2019s unclear what a parallel initiative for girls and women would be able to accomplish, which is one reason why gender justice advocates are calling for inclusion in the existing program. \u201cWe don\u2019t want separate but equal,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe can have separate, gender-specific programming. But as far as a call to action for the lives of our young people of color, that needs to happen collectively.\u201d Now is the time for the administration to act, as MBK programming is being planned at the local level through partnerships with city governments, said Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a legal scholar who directs the African American Policy Forum and has led much of the organized response to MBK. She said the local efforts should be amended to include women and girls and that President Obama should direct federal agencies to collect and report data on women and girls just as he did for men and boys. \u201cRecommend best practices that can be scaled up with private and public partnership,\u201d she suggested when we spoke this week. \u201cThat\u2019s a signal that this is not just window dressing.\u201d Please support our journalism.

The initiative\u2019s mission statement had changed to include the words, \u201cYMI also has a vested interest in fatherhood services, mentoring, LGBTQ inclusion, and issues that pertain to women of color.\u201d Smith said she\u2019s confident that the shift opens the door to real strategic changes as well, and perhaps a step toward meeting demands laid out in a sign-on letter calling on de Blasio to expand YMI.
