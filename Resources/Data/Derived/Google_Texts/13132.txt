Hillary Clinton, a graduate of Yale Law School, apparently doesn’t know the difference between the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

During another softball interview, this time with comedian Steve Harvey, Clinton pushed her gun-control agenda.

“We’ve got to say to the gun lobby, ‘you know what, there is a constitutional right for people to own guns,’” she told Harvey, before planting her foot firmly into her mouth.

“But there’s also a constitutional right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that enables us to have a safe country where we are able to protect our children and others from this senseless gun violence,” she added.

The phrase “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” appears nowhere in the Constitution — it’s in the Declaration of Independence.

Nonetheless, Harvey responded agreeably: “Absolutely.”

It could be he didn’t want to correct the former secretary of state, or maybe he just didn’t know the difference. After all, two months ago he announced the wrong Miss Universe at the pageant he was emceeing.

The Twitterverse was merciless. Real Clear Politics executive editor Tom Bevan got the ball rolling and set off a chain reaction of replies.

@TomBevanRCP @IAMMGraham maybe her version of the Declaration of Independence was wipes out with her e-mail server — Glenn Amurgis (@gamurgis) February 24, 2016

@TomBevanRCP She meant to say in the Affordable Care Act. — Terry Milan (@milan113) February 25, 2016
