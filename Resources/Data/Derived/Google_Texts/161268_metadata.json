Ted Cruz (R-TX) announced Monday that he plans to introduce an omnibus energy bill that will focus on scaling down regulation and scaling up production in the oil and gas industry.\n\nCruz, speaking at the Heritage Action for America\u2019s Conservative Policy Summit in D.C., said he was introducing the American Energy Renaissance Act to stop the federal government from preventing America\u2019s \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d \u2014 the ability to access underground natural gas and oil stores that Cruz said is \u201cprovidential blessing\u201d for the country. The announcement heralds a change of focus for Cruz, who has devoted much of his attention over the last few months to Obamacare and gun rights.\n\n\u201cThe energy revolution didn\u2019t come from the U.S. Department of Energy,\u201d Cruz said during his speech Monday. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come from a grant program picking, \u2018this is how were going to transform energy.\u2019 It came from entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Cruz said the American Energy Renaissance Act will do, if it\u2019s passed:\n\n1. Prevent the federal government from regulating fracking. Fracking is excluded from many federal environmental laws, leaving it up to the states to develop their own regulations on the practice. Cruz\u2019s bill would prevent the federal government from ever imposing regulations on fracking, which has been linked to earthquakes (including in Texas) and has been found to produce billions of gallons of toxic wastewater.\n\n2. Approve Keystone XL. Cruz said that Keystone XL should be a no-brainer for all of America, even the \u201cBirkenstock-wearing, tree-hugging Greenpeace activist,\u201d because it will reduce our dependency on oil shipped across the ocean and therefore reduce the threat of oil spills (Cruz didn\u2019t mention the risk of spills from Keystone XL, which won\u2019t come equipped with the latest spill-detecting technology). The southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline runs through Texas.\n\n3. Force Congress to vote on EPA regulations. Cruz said forcing Congress to vote on EPA regulations that \u201ckill jobs\u201d would help end President Obama\u2019s War on Coal. EPA regulators don\u2019t need to be held accountable to citizens when making these regulations, Cruz said; members of congress do, and they likely won\u2019t vote for environmental regulations if people in their home state are worried about those regulations killing jobs. In reality, the 30-year decline in coal jobs in Appalachia in particular is due more to increased automation of mining and competition from cheaper coal out West than to power plant regulations.\n\n4. Increase drilling on public lands and Native American lands, and allow states to lease energy development on federal lands. Cruz said that Native Americans are being kept in poverty because of federal regulations that make drilling permits on Native American land difficult to obtain. He also said states could \u201cdo a better job\u201d than the federal government at deciding how to use the oil and gas resources on federal land. A 2013 poll of Western states, however, found that Westerners opposed turning authority of federal public lands over to the states.\n\n5. Increase offshore exploration. Despite environmental concerns, offshore drilling may experience an increase even without Cruz\u2019s bill \u2014 the U.S. Department of Energy expects offshore oil production from the lower 48 states to grow 18 percent from its 2011 level by 2020.\n\n6. End the ban on crude oil exports and reduce regulatory barriers to exporting coal. The call to end the U.S.\u2019s crude oil export ban has been echoed by other lawmakers, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski, (R-AK), but most environmental activists oppose ending the ban, saying exported oil and gas will only increase carbon emissions and could even increase the price of gas.\n\nCruz, has said there \u201cremains considerable uncertainty\u201d about what is causing climate change, also told the Heritage audience Monday that he was surprised it was so cold in D.C. \u201cAl Gore told us this wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It involves approving Keystone XL and banning the federal government from regulating, even though his state is: suffering bizarre earthquakes tied to fracking, dealing with pipeline leaks and explosions, and struggling to reserve enough water.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It involves approving Keystone XL and banning the federal government from regulating, even though his state is: suffering bizarre earthquakes tied to fracking, dealing with pipeline leaks and explosions, and struggling to reserve enough water.", "title": "6 Ways Ted Cruz Wants To Increase Carbon Pollution, All In One Bill", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/02/10/3272871/ted-cruz-energy/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ted-cruz-e1377205108784.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It involves approving Keystone XL and banning the federal government from regulating, even though his state is: suffering bizarre earthquakes tied to fracking, dealing with pipeline leaks and explosions, and struggling to reserve enough water.", "creator": "@KatieRValentine", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ted-cruz-e1377205108784-320x213.jpg", "title": "6 Ways Ted Cruz Wants To Increase Carbon Pollution, All In One Bill", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ted-cruz-e1377205108784.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ted-cruz-e1377205108784.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-10T17:11:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katiervalentine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe energy revolution didn\u2019t come from the U.S. Department of Energy,\u201d Cruz said during his speech Monday.\nClimate 6 Ways Ted Cruz Wants To Increase Carbon Pollution, All In One Bill CREDIT:Sen.
