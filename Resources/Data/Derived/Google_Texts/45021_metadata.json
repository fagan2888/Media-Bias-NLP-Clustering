But Roy was not making excuses why the Avs\u2019 power play didn\u2019t capitalize at that point. Roy simply said: \u201cKind of took the focus off our power play. I saw a few punches.\u201d Let\u2019s leave it at that.\n\n\n\nAvs defenseman Erik Johnson and others on the ice also witnessed the fight \u2014 which began while the teams were skating in their end to warm-up for the third period \u2014 and I told EJ that one of the morons was donning one of his old No. 6 Blues sweaters. EJ, like the rest of us, thought he saw one of the guys spit in the other guy\u2019s face before the big retaliation punch put that guy down. Fact is, the fight captured the attention of virtually everyone within eyesight. Human nature. I thought Roy\u2019s quote about it was right on.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nPittsburgh superstar Sidney Crosby has been diagnosed with the mumps and might miss Thursday\u2019s game against the visiting Avalanche. Looks like they have it under control, but Crosby missed two weekend games while being tested and will not play Monday at home against Tampa Bay. The Penguins game after that is Thursday against the Avs, who don\u2019t play until then.\n\nAvalanche draftee Chris Bigras, the Canadian defenseman who had a great NHL training camp after he was selected 32nd overall in 2013, has been surprisingly cut from Canada\u2019s World Junior Championship team. It\u2019s surprising, almost shocking, because Bigras is healthy and played on the team last year. According to Yahoo, and from the above linked story, Bigras said Sunday: \u201cThe message I got was, \u2018Keep my head up, use it as motivation. Obviously, it\u2019s not the outcome I was looking for, but you can\u2019t dwell on it.\u201d\n\nThe Avs\u2019 second-line center, Nathan MacKinnon, is eligible to play for Canada but will not. It\u2019s hard to feel bad for MacKinnon, a multi-millionaire at age 19, but not getting a chance to represent his country at the WJC this year and last is unfortunate. He did, however, play at the WJC \u2014 barely, as the 12th or 13th forward \u2014 two years ago as a 17-year-old.\n\nIn another example of the Avs\u2019 lack of impact draft picks outside the first round recently: The University of Denver\u2019s Will Butcher of Team USA might be the Avalanche\u2019s only major player at the upcoming WJC in Montreal and Toronto, which begins Dec. 26. Butcher, a defenseman who also played in the WJC last year, is off to Boston for the USA training camp Tuesday through Thursday at Walter Brown Arena on the Boston University campus. The camp will culminate with a pre-tournament game against the BU Terriers on Friday.\n\nThe Americans in the upcoming WJC should be strong, with two guys on the team that are projected to be among the top two players picked in the 2015 and 2016 NHL drafts, in forwards Jack Eichel and Auston Matthews.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NHL,Penguins,Sidney Crosby", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Before getting to Sidney Crosby's mumps diagnosis and Chris Bigras being cut from Canada's WJC team, here's some links for Avalanche stories published Sunday:", "title": "Sidney Crosby might miss game Thursday vs. Avalanche", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/12/14/sidney-crosby-mumps-might-miss-game-thursday-vs-avalanche-canada-cuts-chris-bigras-world-junior-team/20350/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2013/10/avalanche-penguins.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Before getting to Sidney Crosby's mumps diagnosis and Chris Bigras being cut from Canada's WJC team, here's some links for Avalanche stories published Sunday:", "title": "Sidney Crosby might miss game Thursday vs. Avalanche", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/12/14/sidney-crosby-mumps-might-miss-game-thursday-vs-avalanche-canada-cuts-chris-bigras-world-junior-team/20350/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2013/10/avalanche-penguins.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Before getting to Sidney Crosby's mumps diagnosis and Chris Bigras being cut from Canada's WJC team, here's some links for Avalanche stories published Sunday:"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a24\"", "article_summary": "But Roy was not making excuses why the Avs\u2019 power play didn\u2019t capitalize at that point.\nMeanwhile:Pittsburgh superstar Sidney Crosby has been diagnosed with the mumps and might miss Thursday\u2019s game against the visiting Avalanche.\nRoy simply said: \u201cKind of took the focus off our power play.\nThe Penguins game after that is Thursday against the Avs, who don\u2019t play until then.\nHe did, however, play at the WJC \u2014 barely, as the 12th or 13th forward \u2014 two years ago as a 17-year-old."}
