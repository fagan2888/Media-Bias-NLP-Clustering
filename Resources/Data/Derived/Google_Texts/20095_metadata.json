This has to be a collective effort \u2013 of government, of business, of the nonprofit world, of individual citizens \u2013 because we do not do this alone.\u201d\n\nCostello is right. Legislation like that proposed in Massachusetts is unlikely to do much to eradicate earning differentials between men and women. After all, laws already exist outlawing businesses from paying men and women differently for performing the same work, as well as protecting workers who discuss their salaries from retaliation. The new legislation would expand the definition of equal work to include men and women who are in \u201csubstantially similarly\u201d positions, but even this may not end up being the hoped for boon to women. Businesses facing new red tape and the potential for lawsuits may seek to consolidate their workforces, lower compensation across the board, and standardize compensation practices, resulting in fewer job opportunities and a less flexible workplace.\n\nLaws against discrimination won\u2019t eradicate differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings, because most of those differences aren\u2019t caused by discrimination in the first place. Rather, they are the result of the different choices that men and women make when it comes to work life. Children play a big role in this, which leads children\u2019s advocates such as, Marie St. Fleur, to lament: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, because we all have the babies. So why is it that I have to pay a higher cost?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to complain that women\u2019s earnings tend to go down when they become mothers, but changing that reality requires understanding why this happens. The simple fact is men and women tend to make different decisions about work after having children, and these choices affect how much they earn. The Department of Labor\u2019s Time Use Survey shows that women with children under age 18 at home work fewer hours than women without children. Men go in the other direction: Men with children work longer hours than their childless male counterparts, as well as more hours than women.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that men who work longer hours also earn more money. Those interested only in someone\u2019s earnings see this as evidence that society\u2019s deck is stacked in men\u2019s favor, but this can also be seen as evidence of men making their own sacrifice for children. Many men give up their free time to earn more to help care for children.\n\nWomen\u2019s advocates imply that women are the losers in a scenario where dads work for more and moms work for less, since housework is nothing but drudgery. Yet this ignores that extra hours in the office or on the job aren\u2019t always a joy either. This is especially true for the disproportionate number of men who work in jobs with unpleasant attributes. Men suffer the vast majority of workplace injuries and deaths. They are more likely than women to work outdoors in the heat and cold, in sewers, on rooftops, hot construction sites, smelly fish boats and refineries, and guarding prisons. Men commute longer to and from their jobs. They are more likely to work overnight shifts.\n\nWhy do men take on these unpleasant tasks? A main reason is that they want to earn more money, often to provide for their families. Women, in contrast, generally pursue careers that offer more comfortable work environments, that are indoors, closer to home, with few physical risks, and allow for pleasant interaction with other people.\n\nWho\u2019s being short-changed in this scenario? That depends entirely on your perspective. Feminists can lament that women are being cajoled by society into caretaker roles with lower earnings, but disgruntled men could complain that they are being pushed to risk life and limb, because they are valued only as breadwinners.\n\nNature and nurture likely both contribute to men and women\u2019s different decisions. Biology surely plays a role, as does society, by sending messages about expectations for the sexes. Certainly we want to create a culture that encourages women and men to pursue their true interests, rather than conform to society\u2019s idea about gender roles. Yet in public policy discussions about ways to eradicate the wage gap, it\u2019s important to understand all that would have to change to make that happen: Women would have to commute longer, work more hours, take more physical risks and pursue very different careers than we do today.\n\nPerhaps women will move in that direction. But more likely many won\u2019t. Women are likely to continue to prioritize job attributes other than pay and allocate more of their time to their families. As long as women are freely making these decisions, then the \u201cwage gap\u201d isn\u2019t a problem that government can \u2014 or should \u2014 try to solve.\n\nCarrie Lukas is the managing director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.
