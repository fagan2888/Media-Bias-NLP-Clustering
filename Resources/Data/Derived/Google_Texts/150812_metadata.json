Why can\u2019t it be the Republicans just don\u2019t disagree with anything that\u2019s going on?\u201d And there is an element of that. For example, let me pose to you a hypothetical. But as part of the hypothetical, I want you to see if you can recall anything in reality that would help you answer the hypothetical. Okay? If the Republicans had the House as they do, and if the Republicans controlled the Senate, and if the Republicans had a president in the White House, would they repeal Obamacare?\n\n\n\nYou think so? Okay. You tell me, who?\n\n\n\nThis is what I don\u2019t see, Mr. Snerdley. I don\u2019t see any unity even on that in the Republican Party. I don\u2019t see anybody in the Republican even talking about it. Ted Cruz, if he were president, maybe. But look what happens when he talks about repealing Obamacare, look what his own party does to him. Forget the Democrats. Look what the consultants did to him, and look what the Republican donors did to him, and then when amnesty comes up, look what Republicans did to him on amnesty.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\nSo it would depend. So if we had elected Romney would we repeal? You think so? Okay. If Chris Christie somehow doesn\u2019t get the Democrat nomination and gets the Republican nomination, will we repeal Obamacare? Okay, we won\u2019t, right? You don\u2019t think Chris Christie would lead an effort to repeal and get rid of Obamacare? Well, but Chris Christie is going to have all the consultants behind him. He\u2019s gonna have all the big-time mainstream so-called Republican donors behind him. I can\u2019t even think of any Republican right now. I\u2019m drawing a blank. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there. I\u2019m sure that Cruz might, Mike Pence maybe. Governors, Scott Walker might. Palin might give it a go again, I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\nBut if you think of it in those terms, there\u2019s no consensus to repeal Obamacare. And yet we\u2019re sitting here demanding these guys do something on the budget? It ain\u2019t gonna happen. I was just watching Boehner at a press conference, and he got a question, I think it was a CNN infobabe, and the question, I\u2019m paraphrasing the question. \u201cAre you finally going to urge your members to be more cooperative, or are they gonna keep trying to advance the ideas of their supporters?\u201d Meaning the voters. Are your members actually gonna be more cooperative? With who? Obama, the Democrats? So are you finally gonna cooperate, Mr. Speaker, or your members gonna continue to follow their supporters, i.e., voters and oppose this?
