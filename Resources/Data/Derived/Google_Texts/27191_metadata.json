To me, that is a picture of corruption.\u201d\n\nPutin \u201csupposedly draws a state salary of something like $110,000 a year. That is not an accurate statement of the man\u2019s wealth, and he has long time training and practices in terms of how to mask his actual wealth,\u201d he added.\n\nLast year, Putin declared a 2014 income of 7.65 million rubles ($119,000) and ownership of two modest apartments and a share in a car parking garage, even though there are reports that he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals.\n\nA 2007 Central Intelligence Agency report that estimated Putin's wealth at $40 billion \u2013 a figure that has no doubt grown along with his outsized influence during his time in office.\n\nRelated: Has Putin Turned the Tide in Syria?\n\nThe point-blank accusation comes after roughly two years after Washington levied its first economic sanctions against Putin and his allies following the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. At the time, the U.S. hinted the Russian president had secret dealings in the country\u2019s energy sector but never made an outright accusation like Szubin did.\n\nThe point-blank charge will likely only worsen relations between the U.S. and Russia, who are at logger-heads at several points around the globe, especially in Syria, where the two Cold War enemies are carrying out separate bombing campaigns with very different targets in mind.\n\nThe Russian President\u2019s spokesperson told the BBC that the U.S. Treasury\u2019s claims were \u201cpure fiction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House has hinted at it for years, but an Obama administration official has f", "title": "The US Finally States the Obvious: Putin Is Corrupt", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/26/US-Finally-States-Obvious-Putin-Corrupt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04272012_Putin_19_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/26/US-Finally-States-Obvious-Putin-Corrupt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04272012_Putin_19_slideshow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The White House has hinted at it for years, but an Obama administration official has f", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The White House has hinted at it for years, but an Obama administration official has finally come out and said it: Russian President Vladimir Putin is corrupt.\nAt the time, the U.S. hinted the Russian president had secret dealings in the country\u2019s energy sector but never made an outright accusation like Szubin did.\nThe point-blank accusation comes after roughly two years after Washington levied its first economic sanctions against Putin and his allies following the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.\nTo me, that is a picture of corruption.\u201dPutin \u201csupposedly draws a state salary of something like $110,000 a year.\nThe Russian President\u2019s spokesperson told the BBC that the U.S. Treasury\u2019s claims were \u201cpure fiction.\u201d"}
