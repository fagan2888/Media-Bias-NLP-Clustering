Why, she asks, would the president think that presenting military action as an antidote to the evil of using poison gas would appear valid, if he consistently and vehemently supports the use of poison on American children every day?\n\nIn her words:\n\nObama called President Bashar Assad\u2019s use of poisonous gas against \u201ca thousand people \u2014 including hundreds of children\u201d a \u201ccrime against humanity.\u201d He argued that \u201cwhen, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer in the long run, I believe we should act. That\u2019s what makes America different.\u201d But, sadly, under this president\u2019s leadership, America is not different. And this credibility gap badly hurts our country\u2019s moral credibility at home and abroad. Earlier this year, Obama became the first sitting president to address Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in America. He concluded his remarks to that group the same way he concluded his address to the nation about Syria, saying, \u201cGod bless you.\u201d\n\nHow does a president who supposedly mourns the death of Syrian children pray for benediction upon \u2013 and handsomely fund \u2013 an organization that does the same thing to American children on a daily basis? Star demonstrated the legion of evidence that prevents the president from shirking her accusation that he is guilty of a double-standard regarding Syria. She continued:\n\nIf the use of chemicals to destroy children is what bothers this president, why does it not bother him that a growing percentage of abortions done in our nation are chemically induced using drugs? The most common is RU486, which became legal in 2000. In 2008, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, 32 percent of the early-term abortions performed in Planned Parenthood clinics, for which our president seeks God\u2019s blessing, were done using these abortion-inducing drugs. Abortion-inducing drugs are included along with contraception that employers are mandated to provide free to employees under \u201cObamacare,\u201d the health reform law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives \u2014 sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., with 184 co-sponsors \u2014 that would make abortion illegal after 20 weeks (five months). The legislation is called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The bill includes this language: \u201cBy 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.\u201d The Obama administration wasted no time in issuing a statement noting opposition to this legislation and indicating, \u201cIf the president were presented with this legislation, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto this bill.\u201d\n\nStar Parker accuses Obama of \u201ctrue moral callousness\u201d in denying the humanity of a fully-formed child in utero. Parker minces no words when she states that a country that does not protect its own children has no business pontificating about the immoral treatment of children in other countries. She said that this disregard for life \u2013 and the ensuing double-standard \u2013 are the \u201ccore problem\u201d from which modern-day America suffers.\n\nNote: Star Parker is an author and president of CURE, Center for Urban Renewal and Education, in Washington, D.C.
