So it was no coincidence that the Broncos opened free agency by re-signing Virgil Green and adding Owen Daniels. And they aren\u2019t done, Kubiak told The Post on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have (Jacob) Tamme back,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cThere\u2019s still conversations going on. We are trying to get better and be smart through the process, but in fact I will talk to him some point today.\u201d\n\nTamme has served as a reserve tight end and key special teams contributor. He is interested in returning to Denver, but is keeping an open mind.\n\nDaniels met the media on Wednesday and explained Kubiak\u2019s offense. Or at least from his position. The challenge, he said, is to make every play look the same to set up play action.\n\n\u201cThe offense isn\u2019t as simple as people think. We changed tempos, we ran some muddle no-huddle, did a lot of different things,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cAnd coach Kubiak expects you to execute it well. He holds himself accountable, and he holds us to the same standard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jacob Tamme,Owen Daniels,Virgil Green", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The Broncos continue to collect tight ends.
