Unlike past nominees for the slot, Murthy has had an active political past, openly campaigning for causes and candidates \u2014 many with connections to the man who nominated him.\n\nMurthy, a doctor at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a Harvard Medical School instructor, is best-known as the founder of Doctors for America, a physician advocacy organization that campaigned for the Affordable Care Act. However, that organization started in 2008 with a different name and mission, Doctors for Obama worked to elect the current president. The organization relaunched in 2009 in its current form.\n\nOn its website, Doctors for America describes itself as \u201cnot affiliated with any partisan group or with the administration\u201d and does not endorse or support any candidates or groups. According to its website, though, the organization is fiscally supported by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning nonprofit. In the 2012 election cycle, CAP\u2019s employees donated more than $58,000 to Democratic candidates, with the most \u2014 $26,950 \u2014 going to Obama. Another $6,250 went to Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and $5,250 found its way to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nMurthy has made just one donation at the federal level, however \u2014 to a candidate with connections to Obama. In 2011, Murthy contributed $500 to the congressional campaign of Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the state\u2019s former deputy treasurer and an adviser to Obama\u2019s 2004 and 2008 campaigns. Krishnamoorthi lost in the Democratic primary to Baldwin.\n\nDuring the hearing, Republican senators questioned Murthy about his political advocacy, with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) warning the doctor that if he uses his new position to primarily advocate for the Affordable Care Act, \u201cthat gets to be a problem.\u201d Despite the pushback, though, Murthy is expected to be confirmed.\n\nOver the past two decades, no surgeon general has been as active as Murthy in promoting specific candidates and legislation. Richard Carmona, who served in the position from 2002 to 2006, made a name for himself politically by running for (and ultimately losing) a congressional seat in 2012 to incumbent Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). But that was after Carmona was surgeon general, not before.\n\nOther surgeons general have also supported certain issues, but not candidates. Regina Benjamin, who held the post from 2009 to 2013, is pro-abortion rights, and Joycelyn Elders, who served as surgeon general under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1994, was criticized while in office for suggesting that legalizing drugs could reduce crime. But no surgeon general nominees in the recent past have openly campaigned for or against a particular candidate or party.\n\nFollow Robbie on Twitter at @robbiefeinberg", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "Vivek Murthy, nominee for the post of U.S. surgeon general, had his Senate confirmation hearing this week.
