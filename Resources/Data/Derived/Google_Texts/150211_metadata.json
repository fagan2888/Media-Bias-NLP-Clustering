There are those, alone in suffering who will now hear the sound of some approaching footsteps coming to help. There are those fearing the terrible darkness of despairing poverty--despite their long years of labor and expectation--who will now look up to see the light of hope and realization.\n\nThere just can be no satisfaction, nor any act of leadership, that gives greater satisfaction than this.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of Lyndon B. Johnson speaking in Independence, Missouri at the signing of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 that created Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMore than 50 years later, the state of Missouri, home to more than 253,000 uninsured Americans who could gain access to care, is one of the twenty four states that refuse to expand Medicaid. Over 5.4 million Americans could gain access to care in 2014, but won\u2019t because of choices made by their elected state officials. There are few clearer examples of how political gamesmanship has real life consequences for people.\n\nThe administration is ramping up efforts to raise awareness about the how people can gain access to affordable health care if their leaders act. Earlier this week, President Obama visited three states where over 1.5 million Americans could be helped but have been left behind by their governors. At an event in Texas, President Obama expressed concern for those Americans:\n\n\u201cAcross this state, you've got a million people -- because this is a big state -- a million people, citizens, who don\u2019t have health insurance that could get health insurance right away if the state of Texas decided to take advantage of it.\n\nSo one of the things that sometimes gets me a little frustrated, although I understand it because I\u2019m in politics, is folks who are complaining about how the website is not working, and why isn\u2019t Obama fixing this, and all these people are uninsured, and yet they're leaving a million people right now without health insurance that they could immediately fix. There\u2019s not a lot of logic to that.\u201d\n\nYesterday, the President called on Louisiana\u2019s leaders to work together to expand Medicaid \u2013 a move that would provide health insurance coverage to 265,000 uninsured residents in Louisiana by 2016:\n\n\u201cRepublican governors in states like Ohio and Nevada, Arizona, they're doing it, too. Oregon has already reduced the number of uninsured by about 10 percent. And some of these folks opposed Obamacare, but they did support helping their citizens who can\u2019t get coverage.\n\n\u201cSo we want to work with everybody -- mayor, governor, insurance -- whoever it is that wants to work with us here in Louisiana to make sure that even if you don't support the overall plan, let\u2019s at least go ahead and make sure that the folks who don't have health insurance right now can get it through an expanded Medicaid. Let\u2019s make sure we do that. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nThis decision not only adversely impacts the lives of those who are denied access and health security: it is having grave consequences for hospitals and communities. Some rural hospitals may be forced to close without the expansion. In today\u2019s New York Times, one Georgia hospital administrator explains her concerns:\n\n\u201cWe were so thrilled when the law passed, but it has backfired,\u201d said Lindsay Caulfield, senior vice president for planning and marketing at Grady Health in Atlanta, the largest safety-net hospital in Georgia.\n\nIf Georgia expanded Medicaid, about 500,000 residents could have access \u2013 and Medicaid payments to hospitals in Georgia could increase by nearly 30 percent over the next decade.\n\nTo provide state with the financial support for extending Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act directs the federal government to fully fund coverage in the first three years, and pay no less than 90 percent for coverage newly eligible individuals over time. This significant increase in federal funds is partly offset by lowering the special payments to hospitals for the uninsured, called disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. While there is a scheduled $500 million cut to Medicaid DSH for 2014, we proposed to delay these cuts in light of some states\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid \u2013 only to have Republicans in Congress refuse to pass legislation to delay these cuts. Hospitals that serve the most vulnerable are between a rock and a hard place \u2013 but only until their governors and state legislatures act in their best interest, along with the best of their residents, businesses, and economy.\n\nAfter President Johnson went to Independence, MO to sign into law Medicare and Medicaid, 26 states signed up in the first year \u2013 same as now \u2013 with all but two states signing up within the next four years.\n\nSince then, American families have counted on Medicaid in moments of need. For families who have a child born with Downs syndrome or working Americans who are waiting tables or bringing in crops but don\u2019t have jobs that provide health insurance \u2013 this program has had a huge impact on their lives and the health of our communities and country.\n\nYet, Medicaid has gaps that the Affordable Care Act can fill. There are still millions of Americans who are working day and night who lose sleep worrying what might happen if they get sick or hurt. They can\u2019t wait years for care.\n\nThat is why we are making our case across the country.\n\nAdministration officials will continue to team up with local officials to press for those Americans living in states that are neglecting to provide health coverage to their low-income citizens. On Friday, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan raised the issue at a health insurance outreach and enrollment event in Tampa, Florida where he urged the state to pass an expansion of Medicaid that would cover 848,000 Floridians by 2016. The Administration will continue to visit cities with high rates of uninsured Americans and push to make sure no American is left behind by their state.\n\nFind out more about your state here.\n\nHelp us spread the word.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"creator": "@WhiteHouse", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/09/heres-why-every-state-should-expand-medicaid-through-obamacare", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "width": 240, "height": 240}, "title": "Here's Why Every State Should Expand Medicaid Through Obamacare", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "title": "Here's Why Every State Should Expand Medicaid Through Obamacare", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/09/heres-why-every-state-should-expand-medicaid-through-obamacare", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2013-11-22T15:26:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T18:40:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-22T15:26:14-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec84\"", "article_summary": "Over 5.4 million Americans could gain access to care in 2014, but won\u2019t because of choices made by their elected state officials.\nMore than 50 years later, the state of Missouri, home to more than 253,000 uninsured Americans who could gain access to care, is one of the twenty four states that refuse to expand Medicaid.\nThe Administration will continue to visit cities with high rates of uninsured Americans and push to make sure no American is left behind by their state.\nIf Georgia expanded Medicaid, about 500,000 residents could have access \u2013 and Medicaid payments to hospitals in Georgia could increase by nearly 30 percent over the next decade.\nEarlier this week, President Obama visited three states where over 1.5 million Americans could be helped but have been left behind by their governors."}
