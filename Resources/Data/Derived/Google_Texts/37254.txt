The U.S. Better Business Bureau says they have received a number of calls about prescription discount cards being sent out.



The U.S. Prescription Discounts and Script Relief LLC are mailing the pharmacy cards.The card includes a letter that promises average discounts of 50 percent.



The BBB has determined that the cards are not a scam, but they can be misleading.



The cards have nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act, even though the marketing makes it appear that way.



BBB officials say customers should think of the cards as coupons without expiration dates.



But the BBB did confirm one misrepresentation: nationally, pharmacies say that discounts are generally far below the advertised 50 to 75 percent discounts.



BBB offers the following tips when using prescription discount cards:

• Start with Trust®. Check with the BBB before doing business. Remember that not all discount cards are legitimate.

• If you are considering using a discount prescription or pharmacy card, be aware that the card is not insurance. Consumers should compare prices of medications before using the discount cards.

• Although the savings may be real with the discount card, they may be based on prices other than the ones offered by local pharmacies. Comparing prices allows the consumer to get the best price for the medication.

• If a consumer is struggling to pay for medications, ask your pharmacist about patient assistance programs that could provide even greater discounts.
