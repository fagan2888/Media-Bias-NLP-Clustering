Left revokes Obama's liberal card\n\nNow many liberals feel sure: Barack Obama was not the one they\u2019d been waiting for.\n\nThe man who won the presidency in part due to his opposition to the Iraq War was suddenly leading a charge to use military force against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Republican refusal to go along was to be expected. The liberal backlash, though, was particularly intense.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat came on top of the fears that the president will, for all the current tough rhetoric, again go into the fall political fights about the budget and debt ceiling starting from a position of over-concession.\n\nThe White House says he\u2019s still a proud progressive. And, of course, he\u2019ll always be a socialist to the Republican base. To prominent liberals, though, Obama\u2019s center-left, sure. But he\u2019s no liberal.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThey applaud a lot of what Obama\u2019s done, which the White House says is clear proof of a man who has stayed true to progressive principles. The federal health care system that spent decades as a Democratic dream will be reality Oct. 1, and there\u2019s never been a president with anything close to Obama\u2019s record on gay and broader civil rights. He got the troops out of Iraq, and he rolled back some of the Bush tax cuts.\n\nBut even on these, liberals have long seen a president who has fallen short, cutting deals \u2014 like never pushing for single-payer health insurance. Or championing the more modest Dodd-Frank banking reforms instead of a renewed Glass-Steagall Act. They say those moves diluted what they\u2019re supposed to stand for, and what they used to think he stood for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone at this point would characterize the president as the progressive warrior that the progressive movement is anxious to see,\u201d said Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), who claimed victory after the new diplomatic efforts that started as he and other Hill liberals resisted the Syria authorization.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Democrats' secret weapon: David Vitter\u2019s vices)\n\nBlame Congress, economic reality and resistant Republicans for much of the disappointment.\n\n\u201cThe president was the embodiment of the dreams and aspirations of a better country and better future,\u201d said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), recalling the feeling in the crowd at Obama\u2019s inauguration. \u201cTo some extent the person that he\u2019s not is a person that he ultimately could never be.\u201d\n\nBut Syria, coming off of a summer of rolling National Security Agency snooping revelations, is all Obama.\n\nReliable liberal Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were among those who even now remain undecided on authorization. That\u2019s because, according to former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean \u2014 there\u2019s no sense in trying to apply 1960s labels to the situation facing the president in 2013.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: White House determined not to give ground on Obamacare)\n\nDean says the fact that Obama is consisdered a liberal leader is proof of just how far from the actual left the left has gotten.\n\nObama\u2019s a liberal \u201cnot by the old definitions, but by the new definition he is,\u201d said Dean, who supported the Syria strike under the sense that military intervention to stop chemical weapons attacks fits snugly within the larger liberal philosophy of fighting for the expansion of rights.\n\nFormer Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) said Obama\u2019s the one responsible for the confusion over what liberal politics means, arguing he\u2019s effectively poisoned the movement by seeming to support it, while actively betraying it.\n\n\u201cHouse Democratic leaders are content to let the president set the agenda on foreign policy, national security, privacy, the economy, health care, Social Security and workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Kucinich said. \u201cSince the administration has lacked coherency on such a wide range of policies, and since it has wrongly been perceived as liberal from its inception, it has successfully usurped any legitimate liberal agenda.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 5 questions about the unions\u2019 beef with Obamacare)\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said that any reasonable review of Obama\u2019s record shows a man who\u2019s clearly a progressive and has carried that through his entire presidency.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s record of accomplishment, which includes ending the war in Iraq, passing Obamacare, repealing Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, enacting Wall Street reform and eliminating the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans, demonstrates his commitment to the values on which he based his historic campaign for the presidency,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The White House says the president's a proud progressive.
