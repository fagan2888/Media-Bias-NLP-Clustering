But the process can\u2019t begin until the agreement is signed. That won\u2019t come until early 2016 at the earliest because the U.S. Congress has two months to study the arrangement, then vote on whether to reject the deal championed by the Obama administration. Sanctions probably won\u2019t be lifted until the end of the year if all goes according to plan.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Costs of the Iran Deal\n\nBoth houses of Congress, though, are controlled by opposition Republicans, most of whom already have declared their opposition. Already, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has said, \u201c[W]e\u2019ll do everything we can to stop it.\u201d\n\nEven if Congress votes to kill the deal, Obama says he\u2019ll trot out his veto, which could be overridden only by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), the Senate majority leader, also opposes the agreement and predicted that the president will \u201cwork hard to get the 34 votes that I know he knows he needs in order to sustain\u201d his veto.\n\nIran once was OPEC\u2019s second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, with output of 3.6 million barrels per day in 2011, an amount that\u2019s declined to about 2.8 million barrels per day because of the sanctions. Current exports are 1.1 million barrels per day, half of what they were before the sanctions.\n\nAnother delay can be attributed to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nation\u2019s global monitor of nuclear activity. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano says it won\u2019t issue its report on Iran\u2019s compliance with the agreement until Dec. 15. If it finds a gap in the compliance, Obama has promised that the entire agreement, including the lifting of sanctions, would be void.\n\nRelated: Timeline: The Troubled Story of Iran-US Relations\n\nSo perhaps Zanganeh is jumping the gun a bit about the speed of Iran\u2019s rebound in the global oil market. One independent oil analyst, Gary Ross, the executive chairman and head of global oil at the New York-based Pira Energy Group, said, \u201cIt should take a good year between the day they sign the agreement and when they add 500,000 barrels of production a day,\u201d he told The New York Times.\n\nYet, Ross concedes that no matter how quickly \u2013 or slowly \u2013 Iran restores its export potential, the global market should be able to absorb it without too much trouble. Today there are about 1 million more barrels of oil on the market than customers need, but he notes that the demand has been gradually rising, especially in Asia.\n\nAs a result, Ross says, Iran\u2019s goal of eventually adding 1 million barrels per day to the export market shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. \u201cWith each day, the market will be in a better position to accommodate the incremental Iranian oil.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nThe Biggest Energy Crooks\n\nIs This The Next Major Step In Offshore Drilling?\n\nDispute Between Baghdad and Kurdistan Holds Back Iraqi Oil Potential", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Don\u2019t expect a sudden surge in oil on the world market now that Iran and six world pow", "title": "Oil Markets Have Nothing to Fear from Iran", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/17/Oil-Markets-Have-Nothing-Fear-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-rouhani_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/17/Oil-Markets-Have-Nothing-Fear-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-rouhani_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Don\u2019t expect a sudden surge in oil on the world market now that Iran and six world pow", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda173\"", "article_summary": "Either way, that adds up to 1 million extra barrels a day to the oil market.\nRelated: Timeline: The Troubled Story of Iran-US RelationsSo perhaps Zanganeh is jumping the gun a bit about the speed of Iran\u2019s rebound in the global oil market.\nIran once was OPEC\u2019s second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, with output of 3.6 million barrels per day in 2011, an amount that\u2019s declined to about 2.8 million barrels per day because of the sanctions.\nCurrent exports are 1.1 million barrels per day, half of what they were before the sanctions.\nYet, Ross concedes that no matter how quickly \u2013 or slowly \u2013 Iran restores its export potential, the global market should be able to absorb it without too much trouble."}
