Bannon is a fascinating and brilliant man, and may be the most effective actor in the conservative media. When Bannon met Andrew Breitbart, it was an important moment in the history of American political media, and without the bonding that took place, Andrew\u2019s death might have led to the demise of his efforts. Instead, under Bannon\u2019s leadership (but with the help of others), an operation so effective that even David Brock is impressed has been built into a powerhouse that influences the media far beyond the conservative echo chamber.\n\nEven though it is written from a skeptical viewpoint, overall it is fair. And very informative. Take a few minutes and read it.
