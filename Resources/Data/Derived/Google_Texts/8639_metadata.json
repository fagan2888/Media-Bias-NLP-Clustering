The central government and government of the Tibet Autonomous Region fully respect the rights of citizens to freedom of belief. In Tibet, all religions and sects receive equal respect and protection, and normal religious activities and religious belief is protected by the law.\n\n\u201cAfter democratic reform, Tibet abolished the theocratic system and did away with things tarnished by the feudal system, restoring the true features of religious freedom, achieving real religious freedom of belief and religious tolerance between different religions and sects.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dorje Shugden\u2019 is a protecting deity who has been worshipped throughout history by several schools in Tibetan Buddhism, with special religious practices, forms of worship and s\u00e9ances passed on. Starting from the Fifth Dalai Lama, Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas throughout history have worshipped \u2018Dorje Shugden\u2019. Whether to believe or not in the protecting deity \u2018Dorje Shugden\u2019 is totally a free and private matter for religious followers.\n\n\u201cThe 14th Dalai Lama has in recent years used all sorts of means, including violent terror methods, to force certain people to abandon their religious belief, which has caused strong dissatisfaction in the Tibetan Buddhist community and among certain religious groups internationally. This kind of behavior, which violates the beliefs of religious followers and persecutes them, once more exposes the 14th Dalai Lama\u2019s hypocrisy and real face of the religious tyranny he practices.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "From the Chinese Foreign Ministry:", "title": "Chinese government response: The Dalai Lama's 'religious tyranny'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/21/Chinese-government-response-Dalai-Lamas-religious-tyranny", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-dalailama_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/21/Chinese-government-response-Dalai-Lamas-religious-tyranny", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-dalailama_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "From the Chinese Foreign Ministry:", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Starting from the Fifth Dalai Lama, Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas throughout history have worshipped \u2018Dorje Shugden\u2019.\nThis kind of behavior, which violates the beliefs of religious followers and persecutes them, once more exposes the 14th Dalai Lama\u2019s hypocrisy and real face of the religious tyranny he practices.\u201d\nIn Tibet, all religions and sects receive equal respect and protection, and normal religious activities and religious belief is protected by the law.\n\u201cAfter democratic reform, Tibet abolished the theocratic system and did away with things tarnished by the feudal system, restoring the true features of religious freedom, achieving real religious freedom of belief and religious tolerance between different religions and sects.\nFrom the Chinese Foreign Ministry:\u201cChina\u2019s constitution stipulates that citizens have freedom of belief."}
