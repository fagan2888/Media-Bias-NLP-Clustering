CHILLICOTHE – Adena Health System, working in conjunction with Partners for a Healthier Ross County, is urging Ross County residents to complete the 2016 Community Health Survey.

The survey is intended to help the Health System and local agencies identify the most prominent health needs of people living in Ross County. The anonymous survey is easy to complete and focuses on the respondent’s perception of the health issues facing our communities, as well as their own overall health and conditions. It should take no longer than five minutes to complete.

The survey is available online through June 5 at www.adena.org/chna.

Paper copies are available at Adena Health System, the Ross County Health District, the Hunger Coalition, and Scioto Paint Valley facilities. A link to the survey can also be found through many of these Partners for a Healthier Ross County’s social media outlets.

The Community Needs Assessment is conducted by all 501(c)(3) hospitals as required by the Affordable Care Act every three years.
