Anthem closed up 0.5%.\n\nIn a conference call discussing the outlook, Express Scripts said it was reviewing the pricing of its contract with Anthem, its largest client, and expected the companies to reach a \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d agreement, according to Reuters. But it was unclear when an agreement would be struck and what it would look like.\n\nGiven the absence of an agreement, the guidance issued Tuesday did not reflect any potential changes to Express\u2019 contract with Anthem. The terms of 10-year agreement, which began in 2009, allow the companies to re-evaluate pricing occasionally, Reuters said.\n\n\u201cQuestions regarding its long-term relationship with Anthem will continue to be a concern for investors,\u201d FBR said in a note.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the review presented \u201ca number of variables that prevent clarity on timing or financial ramifications.\u201d\n\nAnd contracts aside, BMO analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a note Tuesday that she did \u201cnot view the newly issued guidance as a game-changer to the story.\u201d\n\nExpress held to its EPS guidance this year of $5.51 to $5.55. Analysts expect $5.53. The company sees 2016 adjusted claims of 1.255 billion to 1.295 billion, roughly in line with guidance this year.\n\nStill, management during the call said it was happy with initial results from the selling season, Muken said.\n\n\u201cOur focused model of alignment has positioned us uniquely in the health care services landscape to improve health outcomes and lower costs for our clients and patients,\u201d CEO George Paz said in a statement.\n\nMost recently, Express Scripts this month said it would partner with Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (IMMY) to promote what it called a cheaper alternative to Daraprim, the toxoplasmosis drug that became some 5,000% more expensive this year after it was acquired by Martin Shkreli\u2019s Turing Pharmaceuticals.\n\nCVS Health (CVS), which bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007, finished up 2.4%.\n\nFollow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts on Tuesday issued 2016 earnings-per-share guidance of $6.08 to $6.28, solidly above views for $6.04, but analysts", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts on Tuesday issued 2016 earnings-per-share guidance of $6.08 to $6.28, solidly above views for $6.04, but analysts expressed concerns about the company&#8217\u2026", "title": "Express Scripts Gets Mixed Reviews After \u201916 Guidance", "url": "http://www.investors.com/news/express-scripts-guides-2016-eps-above-views/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-12-22 13:49:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-22T13:49:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Express Scripts shares settled 0.6% lower in the stock market today, after rising as much as 2% earlier.\nGiven the absence of an agreement, the guidance issued Tuesday did not reflect any potential changes to Express\u2019 contract with Anthem.\nPharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) on Tuesday issued 2016 earnings-per-share guidance of $6.08 to $6.28, solidly above views for $6.04, but analysts expressed concerns about the company\u2019s contract with health insurer Anthem (ANTM).\nThe company sees 2016 adjusted claims of 1.255 billion to 1.295 billion, roughly in line with guidance this year.\nIn a conference call discussing the outlook, Express Scripts said it was reviewing the pricing of its contract with Anthem, its largest client, and expected the companies to reach a \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d agreement, according to Reuters."}
