The payments covered salaries and benefits for PHH employees and served no other purpose other than to provide kickbacks.\n\nThe lawsuit said homeowners were charged excessive insurance premiums because they included the costs of PHH\u2019s unwarranted profits. Mortgage contracts only allow servicers to pass on actual costs of insurance provided.\n\nAssurant\u2019s expense payments attracted the scrutiny of New York state regulators in 2011. In a 2013 consent order with the New York Department of Financial Services, Assurant agreed to stop the payments and pay a $14 million penalty to resolve claims of conflicts of interest in its force-placed insurance business.\n\nAssurant settled without admitting or denying the charges.\n\nThe New Jersey lawsuit sought damages for breach of contract and violations of the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It accused PHH of using the mails and wires to mislead borrowers and defraud them into paying inflated insurance charges.\n\nIn a motion to dismiss filed in October 2015, lawyers for PHH claim that numerous courts are dismissing cases based on the filed-rate doctrine.\n\n\u201cIn a long line of cases, courts have found that consumers have no legal right to dispute rates that have been approved by a government agency,\u201d the lawyers said.\n\nJudge Hillman rejected that argument.\n\n\u201cWhile other circuits have accepted the filed-rate defense, courts in the 3rd Circuit have found it does not apply because plaintiffs are not challenging rates but rather the lenders alleged scheme of profiting from unjustified charges,\u201d Hillman said.\n\nThe case is Burroughs et al v. PHH Mortgage Corp, U.S. District Court, New Jersey District, No. 15-cv-6122.\n\nSource: Case against mortgage lender over excessive insurance fees moves\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "A Federal New Jersey Judge has ruled that, PHH Mortgage Corporation must face a proposed class action lawsuit accusing it of racketeering by charging excessive amounts for insurance homeowners were forced to buy.
