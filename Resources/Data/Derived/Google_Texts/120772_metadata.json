He\u2019s not a politician. He tells the truth.\u201d\n\nHave you ever seen the like with a political candidate? And who but Trump could boast that he could shoot someone in broad daylight in New York City and his followers would still follow him? Who but Trump would want to boast of such a thing?\n\nBy all fair accounts, Trump did not perform well in the South Carolina debate on Saturday night, but this didn\u2019t matter much to his followers, as evidenced by the Drudge Report poll which, as always, declared him the overwhelming winner.\n\nSo, when the crowd boos him for his vile behavior, that\u2019s just proof that the crowd has been stacked against him.\n\nWhen competing candidates rightly confront his vacillating positions, they\u2019re branded liars, corrupt politicians, and worse, all to the delight of his followers.\n\n\u201cWe need an Alpha male,\u201d they exclaim. \u201cTrump will get things done.\u201d\n\nAs to how, exactly, he will do it, no one seems to know.\n\nBut be assured that, despite four Trump bankruptcies (which surely affected many people, even if Trump was not personally affected) and the failures of Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Mortgage, Trump: The Game, The China Connection, Trump Casinos, Trump Steaks, Trump Magazine, and GoTrump.com, Donald Trump will get the job done.\n\nHe always does.\n\nHe only wins \u2013 as in wins, wins, wins.\n\nAnd when he doesn\u2019t win (as in Iowa)? Actually, second was really first, since, we\u2019re told, the winner cheated. And his followers cheer him on.\n\nBut this is nothing to laugh about. The future of our country is at stake, especially with the sudden death of Antonin Scalia, which makes the question of the appointing of new Supreme Court justices all the more urgent.\n\nLast August 26th \u2013 so, barely six months ago \u2013 Trump stated that his sister would make a \u201cphenomenal\u201d Supreme Court justice, despite her strong support for partial-birth abortion.\n\nNow, after being challenged about what kind of justices he would appoint if president, Trump says that he was only joking about his past comments about his sister: \u201cJust so you understand, I said it jokingly. My sister\u2019s a brilliant person, known as a brilliant person, but it\u2019s obviously a conflict.\u201d\n\nShades of Bob Arum.\n\n\u201cI was joking yesterday, but today I\u2019m being serious.\u201d\n\nDear followers of Donald Trump, are you sure this is your man?\n\nBut it gets worse.\n\nDuring the Saturday night debate in patriotic, pro-G. W. Bush South Carolina, Trump said that Bush lied about Iraq and claimed that he, Trump, was the only one to oppose the war in Iraq. In fact, at a debate last September he said, \u201cYou can check it out, check out \u2014 I\u2019ll give you 25 different stories.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for proof of this on Sunday, he responded, \u201cI wasn\u2019t a politician so people didn\u2019t write everything I said.\u201d\n\nReally? No proof of 25 different stories you told us to check out? No documentation of your very outspoken opposition to the war? You spoke loudly and clearly back then but no one noticed it because you weren\u2019t a politician?\n\nUnfortunately for Trump loyalists, Andrew Kaczynski has documented that \u201cin his 2000 book, The America We Deserve Trump noted Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction and targeted Iraq strikes had little impact on their overall capabilities. The Donald said the best course might be against Iraq to \u2018carry the mission to its conclusion.\u2019\u201d (Kaczynski provides the exact quote.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until August of 2004 that Trump expressed clear opposition to the war, long after it had started and long after the problems with our engagement there had emerged.\n\nThis revelation led to the clever tweet from New York Post columnist Robert A. George, \u201cTrump knew Iraq had WMDs before Bush lied abt Iraq having WMDs and followed Trump's advice to finish job in Iraq!\u201d\n\nIn response to all this, I posted on Facebook and Twitter, \u201cTrump could say tomorrow \u2018I've been lying about everything!\u2019 And his followers would say \u2018That\u2019s our man! He tells it like it is.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd how did some of his followers respond to my comment?\n\n\u201cSo explain to me who is better than Trump?\u201d\n\nAnd, \u201cNo he wouldn't. Nobody is ideal, but you have it in for Trump. He is better than all of the socialists and other deceptive liars running.\u201d\n\nAnd, \u201c[people would] much rather give Trump the benefit of the doubt because he does not answer to any special interest groups and because he proves that you can fight the leftwing media and their strongest weapon \u2018political correctness\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhat makes this all the more disturbing, not to mention downright scary, is that a substantial percentage of his supporters profess to be evangelical Christians, and it still appears that there is almost nothing he could say or do that would dampen their support for him.\n\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d they lamely repeat, \u201cwe\u2019re not electing a pastor, we\u2019re electing a president.\u201d\n\nAnd, if I might borrow a quote, \u201cYesterday he was lying, today he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n\nLet the voter beware.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the legendary boxing promoter Bob Arum was challenged about the veracity of one of his past statements, he famously replied, Yesterday I was lying, today I am telling the truth..05/26/2016 12:30:15PM EST.", "author": "Michael Brown", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "When the legendary boxing promoter Bob Arum was challenged about the veracity of one of his past statements, he famously replied, Yesterday I was lying, today I am telling the truth.", "title": "Michael Brown - Cognitive Dissonance and the Followers of Donald Trump", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2016/02/15/cognitive-dissonance-and-the-followers-of-donald-trump-n2119810", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/44/2016-02-13T111740Z_1_LYNXNPEC1C065_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "When the legendary boxing promoter Bob Arum was challenged about the veracity of one of his past statements, he famously replied, Yesterday I was lying, today I am telling the truth.", "title": "Michael Brown - Cognitive Dissonance and the Followers of Donald Trump", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2016/02/15/cognitive-dissonance-and-the-followers-of-donald-trump-n2119810", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/44/2016-02-13T111740Z_1_LYNXNPEC1C065_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cognitive Dissonance and the Followers of Donald Trump, Michael Brown, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20da\"", "article_summary": "But be assured that, despite four Trump bankruptcies (which surely affected many people, even if Trump was not personally affected) and the failures of Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Mortgage, Trump: The Game, The China Connection, Trump Casinos, Trump Steaks, Trump Magazine, and GoTrump.com, Donald Trump will get the job done.\nHe only wins \u2013 as in wins, wins, wins.\n\u201cI was joking yesterday, but today I\u2019m being serious.\u201dDear followers of Donald Trump, are you sure this is your man?\nAnd who but Trump could boast that he could shoot someone in broad daylight in New York City and his followers would still follow him?\nWhen competing candidates rightly confront his vacillating positions, they\u2019re branded liars, corrupt politicians, and worse, all to the delight of his followers."}
