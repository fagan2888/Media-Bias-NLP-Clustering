Chipotle, the fast-food joint whose unconventional advertising efforts include a viral YouTube video and its own section in the Huffington Post, has unveiled its latest attempt to sell you burritos without acting like it’s selling you burritos: an original Hulu series.

As with other efforts, [Chipotle Presents] Farmed and Dangerous imparts an indirect plug for the company — you’re unlikely to catch sight of a taco (and only the super clever will note that its main character is named Chip). Executives are referring to their strategy as “values integration,” the values being the company’s vaunted commitment to sustainable agriculture and humane treatment of animals. And if integrating the company’s values into audiences’ consciousness leads to people integrating more Chipotle into their diets, so be it.
