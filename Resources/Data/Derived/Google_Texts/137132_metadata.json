Personal debt is a key factor that banks and other lenders take into account both when making decisions about whether to offer credit to a consumer in the first place and when deciding what interest rate to charge.\n\n\u201cThe important part of it is that this debt can harm people\u2019s credit score,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cOutstanding debt can decrease access to credit and increase the cost. To the extent that it impacts people\u2019s access to well-priced credit it can affect whether they will be able to buy a home or get that loan to start a business.\u201d\n\nThe impact of widespread credit problems can also have an impact that goes beyond the opportunity to purchase a home or start a business.\n\nRelated: S&P \u2013 Income Inequality Threatens Long-Term Economic Growth\n\n\u201cBusinesses base hiring decisions on credit reports,\u201d she said, \u201cIt can impact whether people get an apartment.\u201d\n\nThe study found that 5.3 percent of adults are currently between 30 and 180 days past due on at least one debt, and that the average amount of money they would need to bring their account back to current status is $2,258.\n\nThe reason why the number of people currently past due is so much lower than the number of people with debt in collections is the way the credit reporting system is structured. In general, a debt is classified as past due after it is 30 days late, and until it is 180 days late. Afterward, the creditor typically writes off the debt and sells it to a collections agency. Once this happens, credit bureaus classify the debt as being in collections, and it can remain on an individual\u2019s credit report for seven years.\n\nRelated: Why High Debt Could Mean Financial Stability\n\nThat means it is possible for a consumer to have no \u201cpast due\u201d accounts at any given time, but simultaneously have multiple accounts in collections.\n\nRatcliffe and her colleagues were able to break down their data to the Census tract level, and what they found is that credit problems are the worst in the \u201cWest South Central\u201d states of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. On average, 7.5 percent of adults in that region are past due on at least one debt, and 43.6 percent have a debt in collections.\n\nLouisiana was, by far, the state with the most individuals with past due accounts. The report found 8.7 percent of Louisianans were between 30 and 180 days past due on a debt. The next worst state, Texas, had only 7.6 percent of consumers past due.\n\nRelated: Student Debt Relief Scams on the Rise\n\nHowever, neither Texas nor Louisiana was the worst when it came to debt in collections. On that score, Nevada led the pack with a remarkable 46.9 percent of consumers who had at least one debt sent to a collections agency. South Carolina ran second in that category at 46.2 percent.\n\nUtah had the smallest percentage of past due debts, at 3.4 percent of the population, and North Dakota had the smallest percentage of adults with debts in collection at 19.1 percent.\n\nRatcliffe offers one word of advice to consumers considering applying for credit: Check your credit report beforehand.\n\nWhile most of the delinquent debt reports are accurate, she said, some aren\u2019t. Many consumers don\u2019t even realize they have a debt in collections until they look at their credit file.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A disturbing new study from the Urban Institute reveals that one out of every 20 Ameri", "title": "Study Finds Americans Plagued by Outstanding Debt", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/13/Study-Finds-Americans-Plagued-Outstanding-Debt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08132014_Debt_Bills_Expenses_Vector.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/13/Study-Finds-Americans-Plagued-Outstanding-Debt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08132014_Debt_Bills_Expenses_Vector.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A disturbing new study from the Urban Institute reveals that one out of every 20 Ameri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3ce\"", "article_summary": "The report found 8.7 percent of Louisianans were between 30 and 180 days past due on a debt.\nIn general, a debt is classified as past due after it is 30 days late, and until it is 180 days late.\nRelated: Student Debt Relief Scams on the RiseHowever, neither Texas nor Louisiana was the worst when it came to debt in collections.\nMany consumers don\u2019t even realize they have a debt in collections until they look at their credit file.\nOn average, 7.5 percent of adults in that region are past due on at least one debt, and 43.6 percent have a debt in collections."}
