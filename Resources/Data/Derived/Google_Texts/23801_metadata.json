The seventh Christmas rematch of the previous season\u2019s NBA Finals features a full-strength Cleveland squad against a Warriors team that has captured the attention of the basketball world.\n\nGolden State won a record 24 straight games to start the season and brings a 27-1 mark into this game that is the best for a team at Christmas. The Warriors also have won 31 in a row at home in the regular season but none of those games has been as big as this one.\n\nSo what does it mean?\n\n\u201cWe either finish that game 28-1 or 27-2,\u201d Golden State forward Draymond Green said. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is downplaying the rematch. Cavs guard Iman Shumpert said he was still \u201csalty\u201d about losing the finals to the Warriors. Golden State center Andrew Bogut also acknowledged that this would be a big game.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s huge for them to come here,\u201d Bogut said. \u201cWe\u2019re undefeated at home, and with our record, they want to make a statement to us and we want to do the same. I anticipate it being one of the classics that we can all watch in 10 to 15 years.\u201d\n\nThis game will be very different from the series in June for reasons besides the lower stakes.\n\nThe Cavaliers, who were without power forward Kevin Love for the entire finals and point guard Kyrie Irving for the last five games, are completely healthy for the first time this season.\n\nDespite those key absences last spring, James almost single-handedly helped the Cavaliers win Games 2 and 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. Then came a lineup switch by coach Steve Kerr that sent center Andrew Bogut to the bench in place of small forward Andre Iguodala \u2014 the Warriors won the final three games by an average of 14 points.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a different team, we\u2019re a different team,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve grown. We\u2019re not going back to the Finals like, \u2018Look at this, this is what they did.\u2019 They\u2019ve got 26 games that we can look at from this year.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors will be the team that is short-handed this time. Starting forward Harrison Barnes is unlikely to play because of a sprained ankle and Kerr remains sidelined from complications from offseason back surgery.\n\nEven with those absences there will be plenty of star power led by James and MVP Stephen Curry.\n\n\u201cOur guys love these type of games,\u201d Warriors interim coach Luke Walton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an epic game. It\u2019s a regular-season game. It should be entertaining. Obviously, a finals rematch with two of the best teams in the NBA going at it at prime time on Christmas Day. That\u2019s enough to make it a very exciting game. But win or lose, it\u2019s just another game on the column.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press freelancers Steve Herrick and Michael Wagaman contributed to this report.\n\nJrue Holiday grew up watching Christmas games, with his hometown Los Angeles Lakers almost being an annual fixture in the NBA\u2019s holiday lineup.\n\nHe\u2019s never gotten to play on Christmas.\n\nThat is, until now.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. Several players will make their debut under the Christmas lights, including New Orleans star Anthony Davis \u2014 the reason the Pelicans are on the league\u2019s Christmas schedule. Then there are some of the top rookies, such as Miami\u2019s Justise Winslow and the Lakers\u2019 D\u2019Angelo Russell. And the wait may be over for veterans such as the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Josh Smith, Miami\u2019s Gerald Green, the Lakers\u2019 duo of Roy Hibbert and Lou Williams, all set to play on Christmas for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe got Christmas Day because of Anthony,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty cool to play on Christmas. Thank you, Anthony.\u201d\n\nAs many as 46 players could make their Christmas debuts Friday, when the league\u2019s holiday slate has New Orleans playing at Miami, Chicago at Oklahoma City, Cleveland at Golden State in an NBA Finals rematch, San Antonio at Houston and the Clippers and Lakers meeting at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nFor some, including longtime stars Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade, playing on Christmas is as much a holiday tradition as opening presents. Bryant will be in his 16th Christmas game \u2014 his Lakers haven\u2019t had Dec. 25 off since 1998. Wade will play in his 11th Christmas matchup for the Heat, which is looking for their seventh consecutive victory on the big day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy about it,\u201d Bryant said, \u201cand thankful for it.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "LeBron James, Cavaliers await Christmas rematch vs. Warriors", "title": "LeBron James, Cavaliers await Christmas rematch vs. Warriors", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/lebron-james-cavaliers-await-christmas-rematch-vs-warriors/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224_012735_lebron-james.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224_012735_lebron-james.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T13:26:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:31:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bryant will be in his 16th Christmas game \u2014 his Lakers haven\u2019t had Dec. 25 off since 1998.\nThe seventh Christmas rematch of the previous season\u2019s NBA Finals features a full-strength Cleveland squad against a Warriors team that has captured the attention of the basketball world.\nObviously, a finals rematch with two of the best teams in the NBA going at it at prime time on Christmas Day.\n\u201cOur guys love these type of games,\u201d Warriors interim coach Luke Walton said.\nJames also knows that winning the rematch on Christmas Day will do little to ease the sting of the finals loss."}
