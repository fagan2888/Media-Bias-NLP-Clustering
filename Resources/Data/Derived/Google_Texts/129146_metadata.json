A grocery store/restaurant in Minneapolis and a suburban school district are among the other customers that will look to this small plot of land for some of their food.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many young people starting up big crop farms,\u201d Nick Neaton said recently in the kitchen of the couple\u2019s farmhouse north of this village of 370 people. \u201cThese types of farms are really the only ones for young people to get into.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Nick had helped his father grow traditional crops like corn and soybeans on 1,000 acres of land near Watertown and Winsted. That kind of farm life wasn\u2019t for him \u2014 but, after living for several years in Minneapolis, he realized that some kind of life on the land was. He found a kindred spirit in his wife, who had grown up in the woods near Crosslake and also wanted to return to rural life after working in St. Paul and in California.\n\nThe Neatons\u2019 aspirations turned into Sweet Beet Farm, which has created some income and a sense of independence for the couple \u2014 if not yet a living (both have other jobs). While they plan to buy more land, they are committed to farming on a small and manageable scale.\n\nIn an era of creeping industrial farming, the Neatons are among a small group of young Minnesotans who are returning to the land even as demographics show Minnesota\u2019s farms getting larger and its farmers getting older.\n\nNick and Amelia Neaton moved to this 10-acre farm north of New Germany, Minn., in 2013. It offers independence, if not yet a living.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of Minnesota farms with 1,000 acres or more grew, at just over 1 percent, to 6,262 between 2007 and 2012. During the same period, the number of farms with 1 to 179 acres dropped by 7.3 percent, to 42,905. Meanwhile, the average age of farmers crept upward, from 55.3 years in 2007 to 56.6 years in 2012.\n\nThe numbers, drawn from census data, surprised some demographers who had seen trends heading in the other direction.\n\n\u201cThere was real optimism heading out of the \u201990s and into the 2000s regarding the viability of these (small) farms. It was a time when organics were taking off,\u201d said Ben Winchester, a research fellow for University of Minnesota Extension who has studied the demographics of rural life.\n\nKent Olson, an economist and dean at University of Minnesota Extension, said the factors driving the growth of industrial farming \u2014 such as high land prices and production costs \u2014 are likely to continue. Even so, he said, the number of people returning to areas where they grew up to farm, while not a huge number, \u201cis more common than we think.\u201d\n\nNear the banks of Big Stone Lake on the South Dakota border, 150 miles west of the Neatons\u2019 farm, Peter and Anne Schwagerl are preparing for another season of farming on 178 acres. Their crops and livestock \u2014 non-genetically modified corn and Natto soybeans, which are used in a traditional Japanese fermented dish, and heritage breed Berkshire hogs \u2014 suggest the organic, specialized nature of contemporary family farming.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to be a small-scale producer,\u201d Peter Schwagerl said, \u201cthe more specialized you have to be.\u201d\n\nGregg Aamot is a former reporter for the Associated Press and a journalism and English instructor at Ridgewater College and Normandale Community College.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "NEW GERMANY, MINN.", "title": "Young Minnesota farmers head back to the land", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/young-minnesota-farmers-head-back-to-the-land/293274851/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142455595131106.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142455595131106.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "NEW GERMANY, MINN.", "title": "Young Minnesota farmers head back to the land", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/young-minnesota-farmers-head-back-to-the-land/293274851/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142455595131106.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142455595131106.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "NEW GERMANY, MINN."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere was real optimism heading out of the \u201990s and into the 2000s regarding the viability of these (small) farms.\nWhile they plan to buy more land, they are committed to farming on a small and manageable scale.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of Minnesota farms with 1,000 acres or more grew, at just over 1 percent, to 6,262 between 2007 and 2012.\nIn an era of creeping industrial farming, the Neatons are among a small group of young Minnesotans who are returning to the land even as demographics show Minnesota\u2019s farms getting larger and its farmers getting older.\nDuring the same period, the number of farms with 1 to 179 acres dropped by 7.3 percent, to 42,905."}
