In an August 3rd poll, Grimes led incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell by 15 points among people who know both candidates. The conclusion was \u201cTo know Grimes is to like her.\u201d\n\nThat suggested that McConnell had a likeability problem, which he is solving Republican style; instead of being more likeable, he\u2019s smearing his opponent. It\u2019s a race of negatives with the GOP.\n\nWho can forget Grimes coming after McConnell at an August 3rd event:\n\nAlison Grimes began by talking about her long name and then said with your help Kentucky in January 2015 you can call me senator. Grimes said that she didn\u2019t have to apologize for having more government experience than Rand Paul. She took a shot at Paul by pointing out that he wasn\u2019t in Kentucky, he was spending his weekend with his loved ones, the tea party in Iowa. Grimes slammed McConnell for trying to gut Medicare. She said,\u201dIf the doctors told Sen. McConnell he had a kidney stone, he would refuse to pass it.\u201d She hammered McConnell for being the most unpopular senator among both Democrats and Republicans. Grimes said that McConnell is disliked by the voters in Kentucky and in the United States. She said McConnell is at the center of the DC dysfunction. The Democrat said after years of McConnell\u2019s leadership the GOP stands for Gridlock Obstruction and Partisanship. She told McConnell to stop. She called out his empty rhetoric on defending Kentucky coal. She called McConnell on his votes against the Violence Against Women Act, and the Fair Pay Act.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Grimes has dodged questions on the issues \u2014 especially the issues that Southern Democrats are warned to stay away from like ObamaCare (I\u2019m not agreeing with this, but this is the prevailing wisdom in the South due to entrenched Fox News talking points), but so has McConnell.\n\nMcConnell has made a living of dodging issues. McConnell is the person standing in front of the press on a daily basis and blaming Obama for pretty much everything in the world, including his own consistent obstructionism. Mitch McConnell is the babbler, really, if anyone in this scenario is a babbler. He rarely makes much sense, he opens his mouth and commences whinging in that annoying, smug way that certain Southern Republicans invented.\n\nBut even if Grimes hasn\u2019t answered the questions, it\u2019s not because she can\u2019t. She\u2019s a business attorney and the current Secretary of State. She\u2019s a smart woman, not that being smart is a requirement of serving in Congress (see the House of Representatives).\n\nRepublicans attacked Grimes as being stupid because that is what you do to powerful women. It\u2019s like labeling a black person angry. Women are babbling idiots in a dress who don\u2019t know anything.\n\nThis from the party who ran Sarah Palin as a Vice President and called asking her what she READ \u201csexist\u201d. Remember when Sarah Palin told the press she thought the First Amendment meant that they couldn\u2019t criticize her, as a Vice Presidential candidate?
