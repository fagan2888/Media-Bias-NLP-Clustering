That\u2019s right \u2014 and it\u2019s a much slower rate of growth than under President George W. Bush. In fact, employer-sponsored premiums have been growing at moderate rates for the past few years.\n\nThis is a prime example of what we call a \u201ctrue, but\u201d claim: an assertion that\u2019s technically correct, but changes in meaning or significance once it\u2019s put in context or fully explained.\n\nThe Republican National Committee took to Twitter before Obama gave his State of the Union address to spread this statistic: \u201cUnder Obama, Average Family Premiums Have Increased $4,154.\u201d Two days later, Rep. Barbara Comstock tweeted the same stat, and the RNC lists it, along with other premium numbers, in a State of the Union \u201cfact check.\u201d\n\nThe average employer-sponsored family premium has gone up by $4,154 under Obama, from 2008, before he took office, to 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual employer survey conducted with the Health Research & Educational Trust. The catch? That\u2019s relatively slow growth for premiums. The RNC may cast it as bad news, but it\u2019s an improvement compared with the growth in premiums before Obama took office.\n\nUnder Bush, the average family premiums (including both what employers and employees pay) went up $4,677 in his last six years in office, from 2002 to 2008, an increase of 58 percent. That $4,154 growth under Obama is a 33 percent increase. If we look at Bush\u2019s first six years, the discrepancy gets even bigger: From 2000, the year before Bush was first inaugurated, to 2006, the average family premium went up $5,042, or an increase of 78 percent. (See Exhibit 1.11 on page 31 of the KFF report for these numbers.)\n\nIn an online petition to repeal a tax on medical devices, the RNC goes so far as to claim average family premiums \u201chave skyrocketed\u201d under Obama. Skyrocketed? More like inched up. The RNC gives the stat after saying that \u201cObamacare has been a failure.\u201d That\u2019s the RNC\u2019s opinion, but it\u2019s not supported by this statistic, which includes premium growth before the law was even enacted.\n\nIf the RNC wanted to show what has happened to employer-sponsored premiums under the Affordable Care Act, it should have started the clock in 2010, the year the law was passed. But that makes Obama look better. The rate of growth in average premiums from 2010 to 2014 is 22 percent. Even then, the increase isn\u2019t completely attributable to the ACA. Premiums have been going up every year since the KFF survey started measuring them in 1999.\n\nMost of the major provisions of the law didn\u2019t go into effect until 2014, but the growth in the average family premium for that year was a mere 3 percent. That doesn\u2019t mean the ACA was responsible for the slowdown in growth, either.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s 2014 report on its survey explains how the recent growth is low compared with the early 2000s: \u201cFamily premiums have increased 69% since 2004 and have more than doubled since 2002. However, the average family premium has grown less quickly over the last five years than it did between 2004 and 2009 or between 1999 and 2004.\u201d Here\u2019s the KFF\u2019s graphical representation of the slowdown:\n\nThe Obama administration has, in fact, boasted many times of the recent slow growth in health care spending overall. From 2009 to 2013, total health care expenditures for the U.S. have been rising at rates around 4 percent per year (see Table 1). The journal Health Affairs noted that such rates are the lowest since the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services started compiling the National Health Expenditure Accounts data in 1960.\n\nIn November, Obama said the slow growth in health care spending \u201chas the effect of making premiums for families lower that they otherwise would have been,\u201d and implied the ACA was responsible. (The average premium growth for 2013 and 2014 has been under 4 percent.) But as we pointed out then, experts say the lower rates of growth are mainly due to the sluggish economy. A 2013 analysis by KFF said that \u201cmuch of the decline in health spending growth in recent years was fully expected given what was happening more broadly in the economy.\u201d And CMS\u2019 experts said in 2014 that the ACA had had a \u201cminimal impact.\u201d\n\nWhile premiums have been growing, so too has the percentage of plans with deductibles. KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said in a press release on the latest employer survey: \u201cThe relatively slow growth in premiums this year is good news for employers and workers, though many workers now pay more when they get sick as deductibles continue to rise and skin-in-the-game insurance gradually becomes the norm.\u201d In 2009, 63 percent of covered workers with single coverage had plans with annual deductibles; in 2014, 80 percent had such plans.\n\nThe RNC\u2019s \u201cfact check\u201d goes on to list more figures from the KFF survey, including the accurate statistic that the average premium for single coverage through employers has gone up 28 percent \u201cunder Obama\u201d That\u2019s right again, but much lower than the growth of individual premiums during Bush\u2019s first six years. That increase was 72 percent.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4ee\"", "article_summary": "(The average premium growth for 2013 and 2014 has been under 4 percent.)\nRepublicans say the average family health insurance premium has increased by $4,154 under President Obama.\nMost of the major provisions of the law didn\u2019t go into effect until 2014, but the growth in the average family premium for that year was a mere 3 percent.\nThe RNC may cast it as bad news, but it\u2019s an improvement compared with the growth in premiums before Obama took office.\nThe rate of growth in average premiums from 2010 to 2014 is 22 percent."}
