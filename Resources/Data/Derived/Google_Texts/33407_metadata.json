Tampa Bay\u2019s Gerald McCoy is next with 8\u00bd sacks.\n\nBackground: Dareus grew up in Birmingham, Ala., then attended the University of Alabama. He was a starter as a sophomore for the Crimson Tide\u2019s 14-0 national championship team in 2009. He was selected by the Bills with the No. 3 pick in the 2011 NFL draft \u2014 one slot behind where the Broncos acquired Von Miller and eight slots ahead of where Houston selected J.J. Watt.\n\nKlis\u2019 take: The 2011 draft was the first order of business for the Broncos\u2019 new football operations team led by John Elway, John Fox, Matt Russell and Brian Xanders. Most mock drafts had the Broncos picking Dareus, because they had a gaping need in the middle. Russell, though, pushed hard for Miller.\n\nThe night before the draft, the Broncos were 80 percent certain they were drafting Miller, because he was the more dynamic player. The other 20 percent was for Dareus, but cornerback Patrick Peterson was in the discussion. Watt would have been the best choice. But Miller and Dareus have been good players too. In some ways, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Miller is an edge pass rusher with 47 sacks in four seasons. Dareus is an inside player with 28\u00bd sacks.\n\nBecause the Bills have Mario Williams, Dareus was the correct pick for them. Because the Broncos have Terrance Knighton, Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe to push the middle, Miller was the correct pick for them.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bills,Broncos,NFL,spotlight", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Marcell Dareus leads NFL defensive tackles with 10 sacks, even though he's had none in his past three games.", "title": "Marcell Dareus: Spotlight on the Bills defensive tackle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/12/06/marcell-dareus-spotlight-bills-defensive-tackle/31331/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/12/marcell-dareus.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Marcell Dareus leads NFL defensive tackles with 10 sacks, even though he's had none in his past three games.", "title": "Marcell Dareus: Spotlight on the Bills defensive tackle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/12/06/marcell-dareus-spotlight-bills-defensive-tackle/31331/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/12/marcell-dareus.jpg", "creator": "@mikeklis", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Marcell Dareus leads NFL defensive tackles with 10 sacks, even though he's had none in his past three games."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e60\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on \u2026 Marcell Dareus, defensive tackle, BillsWhen: 2:05 p.m. Sunday, when the 7-5 Bills play the 9-3 Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\nWhat\u2019s up: The 6-foot-3, 331-pound Dareus leads NFL defensive tackles with 10 sacks, even though he\u2019s had none in his past three games.\nBecause the Bills have Mario Williams, Dareus was the correct pick for them.\nMost mock drafts had the Broncos picking Dareus, because they had a gaping need in the middle.\nBecause the Broncos have Terrance Knighton, Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe to push the middle, Miller was the correct pick for them."}
