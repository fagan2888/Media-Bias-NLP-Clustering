They're extremely complicated. It's going to take a little while. I don't know if you ever saw the picture I gave, but I gave you a picture with about 2 1/2 feet of tax returns standing in front of me as I was signing. They're having them done, and we'll do at the appropriate time,\u201d said Trump when asked when he will release his tax returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, reporters have been asking for months, and you keep saying the appropriate time. You know, you -- I\u2019m sure \u2013\u201d host Chris Wallace said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, mine is not a one-page \u2013\u201d Trump interjected.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou talk about your empire, I\u2019m sure you have a ton of lawyers and a ton of accountants. Don't voters deserve to get a look at your finances, sir?\u201d Wallace asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I think so. I\u2019ve already given my financial statements more than anybody's given, but I\u2019ve given --\u201d Trump said.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, but the tax return?\u201d Wallace asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tax returns at the appropriate time. There's no rush - at the appropriate time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopolous\u201d on Sunday that he won\u2019t release them before Super Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cFinally, Mr. Trump, you told me several months ago you'd be releasing your tax returns. And \u2018The Wall Street Journal\u2019 editorial page came out yesterday and said Mr. Trump should release his returns going back at least a decade before Super Tuesday on March 1st so Republican voters can know what they're voting for,\u201d Stephanopolous said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Trump's tax records are as very beautiful as he says, he should be eager to release them for public scrutiny. Will you release them by Super Tuesday? Don't Republican voters have a right to know?\u201d Stephanopolous asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, first, no, I won't. No, no, no, I won't. I'm working on it. We're working on, they're massive,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou saw pictures of me, but let me tell you about \u2018The Wall Street Journal.\u2019 I have no respect whatsoever for \u2018The Wall Street Journal.\u2019 I don't think they know what they're doing. They have taken me on so much it's so ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery day, editorials, bad editorials, and they had a poll come out, which was so wrong. I said they should fire their pollster, and they should fire their editorial staff, because I think these are people that don't know what they're doing. I don't even want to read it very much anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey're so wrong, but if you look at their polls that they came out with one day and two days, two polls before the election, they turned out to be so wrong that they should honestly, they should fire their pollster. So I don\u2019t care what \u2018The Wall Street Journal\u2019 says, what they say doesn\u2019t -- and, in fact, if anything, I would do the opposite because then it'll turn out to be more correct,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo no release before you're a nominee?\u201d Stephanopolous asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, at some point. Well, they'll talk about it. At some point we'll release. There's no rush. Why is there such a rush? I'm supposed to rush like crazy?\u201d Trump asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the way, I released my financial statements which are much more important. I released my financial statements, and everybody was amazed at how big and how great the company is, much bigger than they thought, and it's a great company - very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the best assets in the world,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I say that only because that's the kind of thinking the United States needs now because our country is in financial trouble and military trouble. We're in every kind of trouble you can have. Our country's a mess. We're going to strengthen the border. We're going to do all of the things that you and I have been talking about for a long time now, George, and it's going to be great,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he will release his tax returns \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d", "title": "Trump Says He Won\u2019t Release Tax Returns Yet", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/trump-says-he-wont-release-tax-returns-yet", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/trump_9.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-22T12:30:23-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-22T11:17:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T12:30:23-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he will release his tax returns \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d", "title": "Trump Says He Won\u2019t Release Tax Returns Yet", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/trump-says-he-wont-release-tax-returns-yet", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/trump_9.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he will release his tax returns \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They're having them done, and we'll do at the appropriate time,\u201d said Trump when asked when he will release his tax returns.\nGOP presidential candidate Donald Trump (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he will release his tax returns \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d\u201cWell, we're having them made.\n\u201cFinally, Mr. Trump, you told me several months ago you'd be releasing your tax returns.\n\u201cThe tax returns at the appropriate time.\nTrump told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopolous\u201d on Sunday that he won\u2019t release them before Super Tuesday."}
