The company said it reaches 245,000 health-care providers, representing more than half of the insured population in the United States.\n\nEnglewood, Colo.-based TriZetto is the latest U.S. health-care IT services provider to be acquired as payers and providers of health-care seek new ways to cut costs.\n\n\u201cHealth care is undergoing structural shifts due to reform, cost pressure and shifting responsibilities between payers and providers,\u201d Cognizant CEO Francisco D\u2019Souza said in a statement. \u201cThis creates a significant growth opportunity, which TriZetto will help us capture.\u201d\n\nThe company in August forecast its slowest full-year sales growth in its 20-year history.\n\nCognizant, whose rivals include Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, said it expected revenue synergies of $1.5 billion over the next five years from the deal.\n\nThe company said the deal would immediately add to adjusted profit on closing, expected in the quarter ending December.\n\nApax Partners, which acquired TriZetto in 2008, was exploring a sale of the company, sources told Reuters in August.\n\nTriZetto had 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than $190 million as of June 30, one of the sources had then said.\n\nCognizant said on Monday it would fund the deal through a combination of cash and debt and had secured $1 billion in financing.\n\nThe deal comes after private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and BC Partners sold health insurance claims processor MultiPlan for $4.4 billion in March to a consortium led by Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg\u2019s buyout firm Starr Investment Holdings.\n\nCredit Suisse, UBS Securities LLC and Centerview Partners advised Cognizant, while J.P.Morgan Securities and Goldman Sachs & Co advised TriZetto.\n\n(Reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Sriraj Kalluvila)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "TriZetto provides IT services, including care management and the administration of benefits.", "author": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Recode", "description": "TriZetto provides IT services, including care management and the administration of benefits.", "title": "Cognizant to Buy TriZetto to Boost Health-Care Business", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2014/9/15/11630898/cognizant-to-buy-trizetto-to-boost-health-care-business", "image": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UAabpOMYXtDRZWqwJzA8aD9lajg=/0x59:640x419/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49541493/cognizant-trizetto.0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TriZetto provides IT services, including care management and the administration of benefits.", "title": "Cognizant to Buy TriZetto to Boost Health-Care Business", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2014/9/15/11630898/cognizant-to-buy-trizetto-to-boost-health-care-business", "image": {"src": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UAabpOMYXtDRZWqwJzA8aD9lajg=/0x59:640x419/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49541493/cognizant-trizetto.0.jpg"}, "site": "Recode", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-15", "sailthru.title": "Cognizant to Buy TriZetto to Boost Health-Care Business", "fb": {"app_id": 186672874861631}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6397045/recode_favicon-144.0.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-15T17:29:02Z"}, "sailthru.tags": "general,recode", "google-site-verification": "hjxK0n4cwDZzIl6phvogE8im4UEcc5HKC14Tl5HI-Jk", "style-tools": "/style/544b8f43cb1469523be0f2c1310c5b15/tools.css", "sailthru.description": "TriZetto provides IT services, including care management and the administration of benefits.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b8f\"", "article_summary": "Cognizant Technology Solutions struck its biggest deal on Monday, acquiring health-care IT services provider TriZetto for $2.7 billion to beef up its slowing health-care business.\nThe company said it reaches 245,000 health-care providers, representing more than half of the insured population in the United States.\nCredit Suisse, UBS Securities LLC and Centerview Partners advised Cognizant, while J.P.Morgan Securities and Goldman Sachs & Co advised TriZetto.\nEnglewood, Colo.-based TriZetto is the latest U.S. health-care IT services provider to be acquired as payers and providers of health-care seek new ways to cut costs.\nCognizant\u2019s health-care business, which accounted for about 26 percent of total revenue in 2013, has declined in the last three quarters."}
