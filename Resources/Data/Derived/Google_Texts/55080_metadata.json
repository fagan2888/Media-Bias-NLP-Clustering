While the federal agency tried to protect their privacy by masking more than 65,000 such references to individuals, the newspaper said it found nearly 900 additional email addresses that could be strongly linked to U.S. citizens or residents.\n\nAt the same time, the intercepted messages contained material of considerable intelligence value, the Post reported, such as information about a secret overseas nuclear project, double-dealing by an ostensible ally, a military calamity that befell an unfriendly power, and the identities of aggressive intruders into U.S. computer networks.\n\nAs an example, the newspaper said the files showed that months of tracking communications across dozens of alias accounts led directly to the capture in 2011 of a Pakistan-based bomb builder suspected in a 2002 terrorist bombing in Bali. The Post said it was withholding other examples, at the request of the CIA, that would compromise ongoing investigations.\n\nThe material reviewed by the Post included roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts. It spanned President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, 2009 to 2012, and was provided to the Post by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intercepted emails tell \"stories of love and heartbreak, illicit sexual liaisons...\"", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Intercepted emails tell \"stories of love and heartbreak, illicit sexual liaisons...\"", "title": "Report: NSA collected intimate data on ordinary Americans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/report_nsa_collected_intimate_data_on_ordinary_americans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/pulitzer-prizes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Intercepted emails tell \"stories of love and heartbreak, illicit sexual liaisons...\"", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/pulitzer-prizes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Report: NSA collected intimate data on ordinary Americans", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Report: NSA collected intimate data on ordinary Americans", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Edward Snowden, internet surveillance, NSA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd835a\"", "article_summary": "It spanned President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, 2009 to 2012, and was provided to the Post by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden.\nThe material reviewed by the Post included roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.\nThe Post said it was withholding other examples, at the request of the CIA, that would compromise ongoing investigations.\nNearly half of those surveillance files contained names, email addresses or other details that the NSA marked as belonging to U.S. citizens or residents, the Post reported in a story posted on its website Saturday night.\nTopics: Edward Snowden, internet surveillance, NSA, Technology News, NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted the online accounts of legally targeted foreigners over a four-year period it also collected the conversations of nine times as many ordinary Internet users, both Americans and non-Americans, according to a probe by The Washington Post."}
