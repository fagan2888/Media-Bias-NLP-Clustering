Key and Peele revealed in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly that President Obama approached them to do a bit about his recently passed (but fairly unpopular) healthcare bill, nicknamed Obamacare. Key and Peele were unable to accept the offer because their schedules were so busy.\n\n\u201cWe had to turn [President Obama] down,\u201d Jordan Peele explained to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWe were making the season. We literally couldn\u2019t fit it in to our schedules\u2026 so we actually had to relieve the president of his duties. We couldn\u2019t help him out on that one particular time. But this is a country where we technically have status over our elected officials. So you gotta remember, Obama works for us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell whether or not Key and Peele were disappointed not to work with President Obama, particularly due to Peele\u2019s tone at the end of this statement in claiming that Obama works for the American people. After all, Peele does poke fun at President Obama quite a bit on his show, and Key & Peele doesn\u2019t need any more positive publicity\u2013while the Affordable Care Act definitely does.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Obama decided not to give up on the sketch idea, however, and instead turned to another popular comedian, Zach Galifianakis. The Hangover star agreed to a Between Two Ferns sketch with President Obama to spread the word about the Affordable Care Act. The short and awkward comedy clip featuring Obama himself chatting with Galifianakis provides laughs and information on how American citizens can sign up for health care using the newly implemented online marketplace. The goal of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is to provide as many Americans as possible with relatively affordable health care and shrink the number of uninsured people in the country.

Would you have preferred to see Obama in a Key & Peele sketch rather than on Between Two Ferns?", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama approached the comedy duo to do a sketch about the ACA, but was turned down.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "President Obama approached the comedy duo to do a sketch about the ACA, but was turned down.", "title": "Key & Peele Were Too Busy To Do A Sketch With President Obama", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1502447/key-peele-were-too-busy-to-do-a-sketch-with-president-obama/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/key-peele-obama-luther-s2.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T19:42:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T19:59:25+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/key-peele-obama-luther-s2.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-09-26T19:42:27+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "president obama,key & peele,aca,affordable care act,obamacare,key & peele,obamacare,barack obama,between two ferns,healthcare,key and peele,obama,zach galifianakis,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/key-peele-obama-luther-s2.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama approached the comedy duo to do a sketch about the ACA, but was turned down."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfe1\"", "article_summary": "Would you have preferred to see Obama in a Key & Peele sketch rather than on Between Two Ferns?\nPopular comedic duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele were so busy filming their sketch show Key & Peele that they turned down Barack Obama, the president of the United States, and his offer to make a comedy sketch together about the Affordable Care Act.\nAfter all, Peele does poke fun at President Obama quite a bit on his show, and Key & Peele doesn\u2019t need any more positive publicity\u2013while the Affordable Care Act definitely does.\n\u201cWe had to turn [President Obama] down,\u201d Jordan Peele explained to Entertainment Weekly.\nThe Hangover star agreed to a Between Two Ferns sketch with President Obama to spread the word about the Affordable Care Act."}
