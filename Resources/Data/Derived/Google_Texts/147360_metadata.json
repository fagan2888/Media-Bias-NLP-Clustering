Its findings are scheduled to be presented at the regular school board meeting Tuesday. The Report of the Independent Financial Review Panel also contains strong recommendations that involve cutting staff, curtailing health benefits and finding strategies to keep more children in school.\n\nIf the district wants to survive beyond 2020, the panel said \u201ca combination of difficult, substantial and immediate decisions will be required. Failure to do so could lead to the insolvency of the LAUSD, and the loss of local governance authority that comes from state takeover.\u201d\n\nThe panel concluded, \u201cThis outcome would represent a total failure of the educational system for the state and for our local community and is therefore unacceptable. Our recommendations are intended to prevent the district from moving closer to the brink.\u201d\n\nThis report represents a collaboration of professors, politicians, business leaders and education experts, appointed by district superintendent Ramon Cortines six months ago. The group confirmed a lot of what the district already knew: that LAUSD will face a budget deficit of $333 million in the 2017-2018 school year, $450 million the next year and $600 million in 2019-20 \u2014 all driven primarily by a declining enrollment and increases in pension and healthcare costs.\n\nThe report, obtained by LA School Report, said, \u201cThis expanding gap represents a serious challenge to the LAUSD\u2019s financial stability in the near term, one that insists upon immediate action today.\u201d\n\nSome of those actions describe how much money could be saved by taking specific actions:\n\nUpwards of $400 million by offering early retirement to senior level staff.\n\n$100 million by negotiating a cap on district health care.\n\n$57 million by shifting 10 percent of the cost of health care benefits to employees.\n\n$45 million by increasing attendance rates to the statewide average.\n\n$50 million eliminating general fund contributions for Food Services.\n\n$10 million by eliminating the Teacher Pool, where displaced teachers are used as substitutes and paid a higher rate.\n\nThe panel doesn\u2019t blame the district in any way and notes that Chief Financial Officer Megan Reilly reached similar conclusions. She said in a statement today that the findings \u201creflect the budget realities we face and the need to create long-term financial strategies. I am extremely proud of this work and the amazing leadership of our board and superintendent to have these important conversations boldly and in public.\u201d\n\nReilly added, \u201cLet me be very clear, I supported and continue to support access to more programs for our students, adequate funding for all students, including special-education programs and better wages for our employees\u201d\n\nThe panel also recommended that the district consider pushing for passage of a parcel tax. The membrs found that compared with other states, California has a portion of school funding provided by state income and sales tax that is much higher than other states but the role of local property tax is much lower.\n\nThe report finds that the per-student funding level for LAUSD, the second largest district in the nation, is about $12,691. The nation\u2019s largest school district, New York City Public Schools, provides nearly double, $23,690. In fact, LAUSD\u2019s revenues fall $1,659 per student below the average revenue amount for the top 10 districts in the country. If LAUSD received this funding, total funding would be about $800 million more per year, the panel said.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the effect of California\u2019s ranking near the bottom of the nation in per-student funding has taken its toll on LAUSD finances,\u201d the members wrote.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons that district is suffering financial losses is the decline of enrollment. In six years, LAUSD has lost almost 100,000 students and now serves about 550,000 students. About half of the loss of students is because of enrollments in charter schools, but about half of the students are simply because of low birth rates as well as students dropping out of school or transferring to other school districts. This, of course, is all before the start of a Broad Foundation plan to move half the district\u2019s students into charter schools within the next eight years.\n\nThe panel did find that even though the number of students went down, the district\u2019s employment rolls have increased, to 64,348 in the current year from 64,116 in 2013, and said that \u201cthese staffing levels need to be reexamined.\u201d\n\nAmong some of the specifics in the report, the panel found that if even the teaching staff had a better attendance rate, improving from the current 75 percent to a 90 percent, it could save the district $15 million a year in costs for substitutes.\n\nThe district could also save money by looking at using the Federal Affordable Care Act as the standard for retirees or consider going to a 90/10 contribution rate health benefit plan that could save $57 million.\n\nIn response to the panel\u2019s work, Cortines said in a statement, \u201cThe panel has provided a detailed report that outlines a framework to address the substantial long-term challenges we face as a district.\u201d\n\nHe said he wanted the district to \u201chold up a mirror and ask outside experts to come in and fully review our financial situation.\u201d Because Cortines plans to leave by the end of the year, he said, \u201cThis report comes at an important time, and I hope it will give the new superintendent a starting point for the important discussions that will take place in our district. If I were the incoming superintendent, this is exactly the type of report I would want to see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "budget deficit, financial crisis, lausd meetings & decisions, megan reilly, ramon cortines, the report of the independent financial review panel, education, news, school, lausd, unified, district", "og": {"site_name": "LA School Report", "description": "LA Unified is on the brink of a severe financial crisis and if officials don\u2019t act now, the whole district faces bankruptcy within a few years.", "title": "Outside panel says LAUSD needs to act quickly to remain solvent - LA School Report", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://laschoolreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-06-at-9.43.11-AM.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-06T17:36:05+00:00", "url": "http://laschoolreport.com/outside-panel-says-lausd-needs-to-act-quickly-to-remain-solvent/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LA Unified is on the brink of a severe financial crisis and if officials don\u2019t act now, the whole district faces bankruptcy within a few years.", "title": "Outside panel says LAUSD needs to act quickly to remain solvent - LA School Report", "image": "http://laschoolreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-06-at-9.43.11-AM.png", "creator": "@LASchoolReport", "site": "@LASchoolReport", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/LASchoolReport", "section": "NEWS", "tag": "The Report of the Independent Financial Review Panel", "published_time": "2015-11-06T13:11:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T17:36:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "LA Unified is on the brink of a severe financial crisis and if officials don\u2019t act now, the whole district faces bankruptcy within a few years."}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the overall conclusion of a report by an outside panel asked to look at the financial situation of LAUSD.\nThe nation\u2019s largest school district, New York City Public Schools, provides nearly double, $23,690.\nIf LAUSD received this funding, total funding would be about $800 million more per year, the panel said.\nThe report finds that the per-student funding level for LAUSD, the second largest district in the nation, is about $12,691.\nThe panel doesn\u2019t blame the district in any way and notes that Chief Financial Officer Megan Reilly reached similar conclusions."}
