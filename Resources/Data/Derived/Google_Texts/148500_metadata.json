To wit, lower-educated white folks aged 45 to 54 have been dying off at sharply higher rates; those who aren\u2019t dying in their middle years are experiencing chronic pain at unprecedented rates.\n\nThe Princeton study finds that the 25% rise in death rates among middle-aged whites has been triggered not so much by rises in diabetes or heart disease as by big jumps in suicides and substance abuse. The only comparable spike in U.S. death rates occurred during the horrific early phase of the AIDS pandemic.\n\nFortunately, at least for those within the chattering classes, life expectancy\u2013and good health expectancy\u2013continue to rise among well-educated white people.\n\nMost c-class commentators, including the New York Times editorial board, are taking a sharp breath over this despairing news but are not rushing to conclusions about what must be done.\n\nNot so the fearless fusilladiers at First Things: boss editor R.R. Reno plunged right in to declare that the grim reaper mowing down white folks is, in fact, moral turpititude.\n\nHere is Reno mansplaining to us what\u2019s going on:\n\nI don\u2019t find myself baffled. For the last few decades, cultural leaders have been waging a war on the weak. Their goal is to dismantle traditional norms and rules for family life. They push to dismantle gender roles and other foundational categories that ordinary people use to orient themselves and make sense out of their lives. They advocate for drug legalization and doctor-assisted suicide as well. The upshot: reliable guides toward a normal life are removed, and potentially destructive behaviors that rich people either avoid or discretely manage are normalized. The most vulnerable pay the cost.\n\n\u200bI say that Reno \u201cmansplains\u201d because he is really, really concerned, to the point of obsession, with the breakdown of gender roles\u200b: \u201cHaving a sense of oneself as a man or a woman gives us a place to stand in the world,\u201d whereas the \u201cblatant denial of gender differences adds to the disorientation of American\u2019s working class.\u201d\n\nAh, so that\u2019s what\u2019s got working America gasping for breath! It\u2019s not that good-paying jobs in the manufacturing sector of the economy have pretty much evaporated; it\u2019s not that a majority of the Americans who work now make less than $30,000 per year for their trouble; it\u2019s not that service sector employers have created a wretched temp economy in which wage workers can\u2019t plan and can\u2019t enjoy a normal personal life because their work schedules are constantly shifting; it\u2019s not that involuntary part-time work is at an all-time high; it\u2019s not that the earning prospects for many jobs are so pitiful that unprecedented numbers of workers have simply stopped looking; it\u2019s not that inflation-adjusted income for households headed by someone with only a high-school education have fallen by almost 20% since 2008; it\u2019s not that low-income people are still often shut out of needed preventive health care services, even under Obamacare; and it\u2019s not that people within America\u2019s lumpenproletariat are constantly being harassed by predatory lenders and debt collectors.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not those stressors. It\u2019s morality.\n\nReno allows that the \u201charsh economic realities of our globalized economy\u201d may have something to do with the spectre of sickness and death stalking the majority America\u2019s white people (yes, a majority of America\u2019s whites have to do real work \u2013 and over a third of same earn less than $15/hour). But Reno still insists that at the heart of the \u201cwar on the weak\u201d is a \u201ca sustained and ongoing ideological assault on the basic norms for family and community.\u201d White folks\u2019 health is going from bad to worse because kids from working class backgrounds aren\u2019t being given a \u201cfunctional language to talk about what it means to be a man or woman.\u201d\n\nThis line of argument might work for camp followers of the moralizing approach going back to Bill Bennett (a compulsive gambler, it turns out), Charles Murray, and Thomas Sowell. But Reno opens a huge hole in his argument by analogizing the 15-year spike in death rates for middle-aged U.S. whites to similar sharp spikes in mortality in post-World War II Europe and in post-1989 Russia. Quite obviously, the widespread failure-to-thrive in bombed-out postwar societies and again following the \u201cfree market\u201d shock treatment administered to the Russians in the wake of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse was all about basic economic stress. It had nothing to do with men not knowing how to be men or women not knowing how to be women.\n\nIn view of the powerful and interrelated economic and psychic shocks experienced by America\u2019s working people over the past 35 years, it\u2019s simply preposterous to argue that the afflictions facing today\u2019s white working-class Americans are of an essentially different nature from those suffered by post-war Europeans or by the vast majority of Russians in the years after 1989. Of course, hard-pressed Black people have been subjected to the moralizing treatment for a long, long time. Now, apparently, it\u2019s white people\u2019s turn.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Religion Dispatches", "description": "The chattering classes are all agog to learn from\u00a0\u200btwo Princeton economists that white working-class America has been having an\u00a0even harder time of it\u00a0than was suspected.
