Carson, now retired at 63, said he explained to the woman the alternatives to abortion.\n\n\u201cThe baby was born,\u201d he said during Right to Life of Southwest Indiana\u2019s spring banquet at the Old National Events Plaza. \u201cAt 33 weeks, the baby could\u2019ve been born then and been OK,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some in the country would have the baby aborted, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of mentality that exists in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can anybody claim that\u2019s a meaningless mass of cells?\u201d\n\nCarson was the keynote speaker for the annual event, which serves a fundraiser for the anti-abortion organization. According to the group, it\u2019s the largest Right to Life gathering in the nation.\n\nCarson said education is key in battling abortion.\n\n\u201cThey tell them (young women) their lives are ruined and that abortion is their only option. There are alternatives that are positive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe more we begin to educate people the more people will understand pro-life,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Carson, who wrote a popular op-ed piece for the Washington Times voicing his stance against abortion, focused little on abortion issues during his 45-minute speech Tuesday.\n\nCarson, who was the first surgeon to successfully separate conjoined twins at the head while still in the womb, talked mostly of his life story \u2014 tales of growing up in poverty and facing adversity.\n\nConsidered to be a prospective presidential candidate for the Republican Party, Carson\u2019s speech included references to ISIS, the Founding Fathers, Indiana\u2019s religious freedom law and his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCarson told the audience it was up to the people to change the course of the country.\n\n\u201cCourage is what we really need in our nation at this juncture. We\u2019re at a precipice in terms of what kind of nation we\u2019re going to be,\u201d he said.\n\nLeading up to his speech, Right to Life officials toted supposed successes within the last year, including the shuttering of three Planned Parenthoods in Indiana and the reduction in open hours at the Evansville location.\n\nMary Ellen Van Dyke, the executive director of the local organization, said 80 percent of money raised by Right to Life goes toward education.\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s most recent nonprofit tax filing, it raised $290,000 in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Ben Carson talks abortion, life story at Right to Life banquet", "og": {"url": "http://www.courierpress.com/news/local/ben-carson-talks-abortion-life-story-at-right-to-life-banquet-ep-1026931154-325493311.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/righttolife2_16345233_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 462}, "type": "article", "description": "Famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson told an audience of 2,600 Tuesday night in Downtown Evansville about a mother who was 33 weeks pregnant and considering an abortion at the advice of her doctor.", "title": "Ben Carson talks abortion, life story at Right to Life banquet"}, "twitter": {"site": "@courierpress", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/righttolife2_16345233_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson told an audience of 2,600 Tuesday night in Downtown Evansville about a mother who was 33 weeks pregnant and considering an abortion at the advice of her doctor.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ben Carson talks abortion, life story at Right to Life banquet"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-cp-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd683e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe baby was born,\u201d he said during Right to Life of Southwest Indiana\u2019s spring banquet at the Old National Events Plaza.\nCarson told the audience it was up to the people to change the course of the country.\nMary Ellen Van Dyke, the executive director of the local organization, said 80 percent of money raised by Right to Life goes toward education.\nLeading up to his speech, Right to Life officials toted supposed successes within the last year, including the shuttering of three Planned Parenthoods in Indiana and the reduction in open hours at the Evansville location.\nCarson, now retired at 63, said he explained to the woman the alternatives to abortion."}
