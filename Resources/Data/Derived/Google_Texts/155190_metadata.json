Worth Star-Telegram apologizes for Obamacare story\n\nThe Ft. Worth Star-Telegram's executive editor apologized to readers this week for a story it published in November about the trouble people were having getting affordable insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn a column teased on Monday's front page, Jim Witt said the reporter and editor of the story did not do their due diligence to discover the background of the people profiled in the story, some of whom turned out to have tea party connections and were actually able to obtain more affordable coverage through Obamacare.\n\n\"Knowing the background of the person quoted can give readers important clues about someone\u2019s motives, but you didn\u2019t learn that from reading our story, because we neglected to investigate the background of the people we quoted. That\u2019s something you learn to do in Journalism 101. I remember my old professor saying, 'If your mother says she loves you \u2026 check it out,'\" Witt wrote.\n\nThe apology came after healthinsurance.org blogger Maggie Mahar wrote a two-part post criticizing the Star-Telegram for doing what she considered a poor job of fact-checking the story before publication.\n\nThough Witt said he disagrees with Mahar's claim that the article was meant to make it \"appear that we were part of a conspiracy to paint the Affordable Care Act in a negative light,\" he conceded that \"we did not do our job completely and therefore let our readers down.\"\n\nWitt also cites the myriad of negative stories about Obamacare in the media as a reason to why the story did not seem out of the ordinary.\n\n\"When the story ran, the media were full of stories detailing the myriad problems with the website being used to sign up, so this story didn\u2019t strike the reporter\u2019s editor, Steve Kaskovich, as out of the ordinary,\" Witt said. \"We didn\u2019t have our radar turned on strong enough to spot the hole.\"\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at Politico.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>The Texas newspaper apologizes for not fully checking on their sources' background.&nbsp;</p>", "title": "Ft.
