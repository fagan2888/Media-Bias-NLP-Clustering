They need to engage in a kind of big-picture creative thinking that we haven\u2019t seen since the days of Ronald Reagan. The one really big agenda item that the President and the Republican leaders have both mentioned in the days after the election is reforming the tax code \u2013 although those mentions have been vague indeed. I want to suggest an even larger, yet simpler, legislative agenda item: sunset the entire tax code on January 1, 2020.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhy should we scrap the existing tax code? First, it is ridiculously complex. The reference \u201cbible\u201d used by many practitioners to understand the code and its application is the version from legal publisher Commerce Clearing House. It\u2019s 73,954 pages in all. The pure code itself in small print from the Government Printing Office is a \u201cmere\u201d 2,652 pages. No one can really understand all of it.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s wide public support. A stunning 93% of the respondents in a 2012 Gallup survey of national priorities consider it \u201cimportant\u201d to \u201csimplify the tax code to lower rates and eliminate deductions and loopholes.\u201d Several other polls have also shown wide support for tax reform.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s politically viable: another survey this year revealed that over 76 percent of voters will be more likely to favor a candidate who supports comprehensive tax reform.\n\nOne effort in the overall direction of tax reform that has caught fire recently is the movement to abolish the IRS. There are more than 20 variations of \u201cAbolish the IRS\u201d bumper stickers available online. That simple theme obviously resonates with the public, but it cannot be described as a serious policy proposal.\n\nYet as wide as the support for abolishing the agency is, the support for what system of taxation should replace the current tax code is bitterly divided between flat tax and consumption tax proponents. The special interest lobbies will defend their own turfs like cornered rats, so in the absence of consensus, any effort towards true tax simplification is bound to bog down and most likely result in a series of minor tweaks that could actually result in making the whole code even more complex at the end of the \u201creform\u201d process.\n\nSo here\u2019s an alternative proposal: Simply \u201csunset\u201d (or legislatively terminate) the tax code itself, in full, at some date certain, far enough in the future to permit the creation of its replacement in a thoughtful manner. Public and political support for this interim proposal should be huge. Setting such a date will create an urgency to get it done on time, but not a crisis. When? Why not January 1, 2020? It\u2019s far enough into the future to quell any arguments that terminating the tax code would create immediate chaos, and it has the added symbolic value of being \u201cvisionary,\u201d \u201cclear sighted\u201d and \u201cfocused\u201d because it plays on the pun of 20/20 vision.\n\nPolitically, it should unite conservatives and libertarians, and even some progressives, while putting defenders of the current system in the unenviable position of trying to speak in favor of a system that not even its most experienced practitioners truly understands. In short, I contend that this proposal can advance the tax reform agenda faster than anything else yet presented. Sunsetting the tax code is the necessary precondition to meaningful tax reform.\n\nColin Hanna is President of Let Freedom Ring USA, Inc., a non-profit public policy organization committed to promoting Constitutional government, free enterprise and traditional values.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sunset the U.S. Tax Code", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sunset the U.S. Tax Code", "title": "Sunset the U.S. Tax Code - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Taxes/treasury-photo-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/11/12/sunset-the-us-tax-code/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sunset the U.S. Tax Code", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Taxes/treasury-photo-ap.jpg", "title": "Sunset the U.S. Tax Code - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Harry Reid, Ronald Reagan, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-11-12T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I want to suggest an even larger, yet simpler, legislative agenda item: sunset the entire tax code on January 1, 2020.\nSunsetting the tax code is the necessary precondition to meaningful tax reform.\nYet as wide as the support for abolishing the agency is, the support for what system of taxation should replace the current tax code is bitterly divided between flat tax and consumption tax proponents.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhy should we scrap the existing tax code?\nA stunning 93% of the respondents in a 2012 Gallup survey of national priorities consider it \u201cimportant\u201d to \u201csimplify the tax code to lower rates and eliminate deductions and loopholes.\u201d Several other polls have also shown wide support for tax reform."}
