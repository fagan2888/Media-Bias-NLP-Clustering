The current occupant \u2014 Robert Duffy, a former mayor of Rochester \u2014 was handpicked by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2010 and spent the last four years promoting the governor\u2019s agenda around the state. In May, Mr. Duffy decided he had had enough of traveling in the governor\u2019s shadow, and is not seeking re-election.\n\nOn Sept. 9, Democratic primary voters can choose between Governor Cuomo\u2019s new choice for lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a former congresswoman, and Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is running as an independent-minded Democrat.\n\nMr. Wu, a political newcomer, offers a fresh perspective and a new voice to counter Albany\u2019s entrenched players. Ms. Hochul does not, and she has a deeply troubling record on health reform, gun control and environmental deregulation. For these reasons, we recommend Mr. Wu in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn an editorial on Wednesday, we did not endorse Zephyr Teachout for governor in the Democratic primary, citing her lack of experience. Mr. Wu, who is her running mate, also lacks political experience, but he is seeking a very different job, with far less responsibility for running a big and diverse state.\n\nMr. Wu recognizes this difference, and he says he wants to use the lieutenant governor\u2019s job as a pulpit, to become the state\u2019s de facto public advocate, particularly in support of consumer issues, Internet access and economic development zones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cuomo chose Ms. Hochul this spring to balance his ticket with a conservative woman from upstate. Ms. Hochul now supports his gun control bill, but when she ran unsuccessfully for re-election to Congress in 2012, her campaign featured the endorsement from the National Rifle Association. The N.R.A. said at the time that she had \u201ca proven record of defending the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nShe also boasted repeatedly that she had voted many times against \u201cObamacare.\u201d She strongly opposed allowing undocumented immigrants to have drivers\u2019 licenses. And during her short time in Congress, environmentalists criticized many of her votes, including those to repeal emission standards for cement manufacturers and to allow fewer controls on open pit mines and other polluting industries.\n\nShe undoubtedly embraced those views to try to win re-election in a district that had become a stronghold for Republicans. But her willingness to shift politically does not suggest she would offer any kind of independent judgment. Nor does her record give any real clue about what would happen if she took over as governor. In the meantime, she has promised to \u201csupport the administration.\u201d\n\nAlthough he lacks time in politics, Mr. Wu has an impressive record in the legal field, particularly in Internet law and policy. Widely known for coining the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d he has been an adviser to the Federal Trade Commission as part of his efforts on behalf of consumers to keep the Internet from \u201cbecoming too corporatized.\u201d\n\nAs lieutenant governor, he wants to speak out on complicated issues that are too often ignored in Albany like immigrant rights and broadband access needed by more than a million New Yorkers. Those would be worthy pursuits, but he will also have to learn quickly how to navigate Albany\u2019s difficult politics to make his views heard.\n\nMs. Hochul, who has been a banker in the Buffalo area, has worked to develop jobs upstate. A former county clerk before her stint in Congress, she has helped veterans in her area and supported Mr. Cuomo\u2019s push for economic development in western New York.\n\nWhoever wins in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor will run as part of the governor\u2019s Democratic ticket in November against the Republican slate. Albany needs an independent voice, someone who can bring fresh ideas to a very stale and often corrupt political culture. Timothy Wu is the one who best fits that bill.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140827211118, "twitter": {"description": "The Times recommends Mr. Wu in the Democratic primary because he can bring fresh ideas to Albany\u2019s stale and often corrupt political culture.", "title": "Timothy Wu for Lieutenant Governor", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/opinion/timothy-wu-for-lieutenant-governor.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003078856"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/opinion/timothy-wu-for-lieutenant-governor.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003078856", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/opinion/timothy-wu-for-lieutenant-governor.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Timothy Wu for Lieutenant Governor", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 27, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-08-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Net Neutrality", "published": "2014-08-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Wu  Timothy,New York State,Endorsements,Hochul  Kathleen C,Editorials,Cuomo  Andrew M,Teachout  Zephyr,Democratic Party,Midterm Elections (2014),Elections  Governors,Net Neutrality", "description": "The Times recommends Mr. Wu in the Democratic primary because he can bring fresh ideas to Albany\u2019s stale and often corrupt political culture.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Teachout, Zephyr", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Times recommends Mr. Wu in the Democratic primary because he can bring fresh ideas to Albany\u2019s stale and often corrupt political culture.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "news_keywords": "Political endorsement,Editorial", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "org": "Democratic Party", "geo": "New York State", "slug": "28thu3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140828130928, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/opinion/timothy-wu-for-lieutenant-governor.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Times recommends Mr. Wu in the Democratic primary because he can bring fresh ideas to Albany\u2019s stale and often corrupt political culture.", "title": "Timothy Wu for Lieutenant Governor"}, "pdate": 20140827, "des": "Net Neutrality", "articleid": 100000003078856, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Timothy Wu for Lieutenant Governor", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9009\"", "article_summary": "On Sept. 9, Democratic primary voters can choose between Governor Cuomo\u2019s new choice for lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a former congresswoman, and Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is running as an independent-minded Democrat.\nWhoever wins in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor will run as part of the governor\u2019s Democratic ticket in November against the Republican slate.\nThe office of lieutenant governor in New York is a feeble one.\nMr. Wu, a political newcomer, offers a fresh perspective and a new voice to counter Albany\u2019s entrenched players.\nFor these reasons, we recommend Mr. Wu in the Democratic primary."}
