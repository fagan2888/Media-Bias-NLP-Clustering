And that\u2019s created a potent 2016 campaign issue\u2014one that top candidates can\u2019t afford to ignore.\n\nIn the past decade, the state government reports, the number of people admitted to state-funded treatment programs rose by 90 percent for heroin and 500 percent for prescription opiate abuse.\n\n\u201cWe have in New Hampshire some of the highest per capita rates of addiction in the United States,\u201d Tym Rourke, chairman of the New Hampshire governor\u2019s commission on drug abuse, told The Daily Beast. \u201cSo we are very, very much at ground zero for addiction\u2026 Right now, we are having an overdose death every day.\u201d\n\nIf a presidential candidate hopes to have sway over the state\u2019s voters, Governor Maggie Hassan told The Daily Beast, they\u2019re going to need to read up on heroin addiction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really important that all presidential candidates visiting New Hampshire be prepared on this issue, to understand how it\u2019s wreaking havoc in our state,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot go into a room in New Hampshire, of more than a couple of people, and not have them raise the issue of how substance abuse is impacting our state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the candidates have come to New Hampshire surprised that in many of their first stops, substance abuse was a major issue for voters,\u201d Rourke said.\n\nTed Gatsas is the mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire, a town of just over 110,000 people where 50 have died from heroin overdoses since January. Because of the state\u2019s role in picking presidents, he has far greater sway than almost any other mayor of a comparably-sized town, and he\u2019s using it to talk about the addiction issue.\n\nIn this cycle alone, he says, he has met with Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Donald Trump, John Kasich, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, and Bobby Jindal. And to each of them he has stressed that they need to be paying attention to the nationwide problem of heroin addiction more broadly, and specifically its effects on the Granite State.\n\n\u201cWhen they come into my office, that\u2019s what I talk to them about,\u201d Gatsas said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the entire country should be drawing attention to, because people are dying.\u201d\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich name-checked the mayor last week during a presidential forum.\n\n\u201cWe have the mayor of Manchester, who\u2019s fighting a tsunami here,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that with economic growth comes responsibility and ability to help people who live in the shadows, whether they\u2019re mentally ill or drug-addicted.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been reaching out to local leaders in addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cI really commend Hillary Clinton, who just as she started her campaign\u2026 really began to bring the public focus on this issue,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cI would encourage all of the other candidates for president to follow her lead and focus on how they\u2019ll address the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe issue has already made its way into Republican presidential forums, debates, and town halls.\n\n\u201cThe first question I was asked in my first town hall meeting was about the heroin epidemic,\u201d former Florida Governor Jeb Bush told the New Hampshire Union Leader editorial board.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

One of the stories that has not been as reported nationally, is the fact that many of the people who today are dependent on heroin, is because they became dependent on prescription opiates,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio said, in an answer about why he doesn\u2019t support legalizing marijuana, at a forum in New Hampshire last week.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie recently visited a local treatment center. \u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s got its issues, but so does New Jersey and so does Iowa, and places I\u2019ve been visiting have all been experiencing the same thing. This is an epidemic in our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn my own state as governor, it is a drug that you don\u2019t take. It takes you,\u201d Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker recently told WMUR, a New Hampshire news network. \u201cThis has become a major concern particularly in rural and in less densely populated areas. It's not just a drug problem in the big cities. That is all the more reason why we need to take major portions of our resources and send them from the federal government\u2014from Washington\u2014back to our states and local communities.\u201d\n\nMore than 8,200 people died of heroin-related overdoses nationwide in 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. And use of the drug has more than doubled among adults age 18-25 over the past 10 years.\n\nHeroin is an opioid, the same general kind of drug used in many prescription painkillers, which are among the most commonly abused drugs in the country, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. If taken in amounts or ways other than prescribed, opioid pain medications like Oxycontin and Vicodin can have heroin-like effects: an initial euphoria, followed by a period of alternating between drowsiness and wakefulness.\n\nThe CDC notes that people who are addicted to prescription opioid painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. Efforts to clamp down on prescription opioid painkiller abuse have partly\u2014unintentionally\u2014fueled the demand for heroin. Heroin is cheaper, and can often be obtained more easily, although illegally, than prescription drugs.\n\nWhen New Hampshire clamped down on prescription drug abuse, local addicts turned to heroin, Rourke said. \u201cThis heroin epidemic has been a tsunami in health-care disasters 30 years in the making.\u201d\n\nBut candidates have not yet gotten specific about how to deal with drug abuse. One potential reason for this is that treatment methods can be quite controversial, especially publicly-funded needle exchanges or more access to methadone, a drug used to help wean individuals off addiction.\n\n\u201cWhile Republican candidates brought this up during the debate, on the federal level the Republican Congress has moved to cut funding for substance abuse, and they also all are running against the continuation of the Affordable Care Act, which includes Medicaid expansion coverage for substance abuse and behavioral health,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nRepublican candidates could turn to the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, a piece of legislation co-sponsored by New Hampshire Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte and a number of other senators from both parties. Of the senators who are running for president, only Lindsey Graham has signed on. The bill would authorize the federal government to award grants to address the opioid and heroin use epidemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a public health crisis in our state. We\u2019ve had a dramatic increase in heroin and opioid deaths,\u201d Ayotte told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is a very big issue, and that\u2019s why I think you see the presidential candidates who are campaigning in New Hampshire mentioning it, on both sides of the aisle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "timkmak"}, "keywords": "drug abuse, primary, Google, u.s. poli, New Hampshire,United States, heroin addiction", "publicationDate": 201508100510, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "New Hampshire\u2019s drug problem is so dire, candidates stumping in the state have been forced to address the issue, whether they\u2019re ready to or not.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "First in Heroin, First in the Nation to Vote", "tags": "entity:medicalcondition/drug_abuse,entity:politicalevent/primary,syndication:syndication-google,topic:politics,entity:provinceorstate/new_hampshire_united_states,entity:medicalcondition/heroin_addiction", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"First in Heroin, First in the Nation to Vote\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/10/the-2016-heroin-primary.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/10/the-2016-heroin-primary/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47973758.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/10/the-2016-heroin-primary\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-10T05:10:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Tim Mak\",\"tags\":[\"drug_abuse\",\"primary\",\"syndication-google\",\"politics\",\"new_hampshire_united_states\",\"heroin_addiction\"]}", "news_keywords": "drug abuse, primary, Google, US Politics, New Hampshire United States, heroin addiction", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Tim Mak", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-08-10T05:10:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/tim-makhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/10/the-2016-heroin-primary", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "New Hampshire\u2019s drug problem is so dire, candidates stumping in the state have been forced to address the issue, whether they\u2019re ready to or not.", "title": "First in Heroin, First in the Nation to Vote", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/10/the-2016-heroin-primary.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/10/the-2016-heroin-primary/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1439212740599.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/t/tim-mak", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "When New Hampshire clamped down on prescription drug abuse, local addicts turned to heroin, Rourke said.\nThe CDC notes that people who are addicted to prescription opioid painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\nEfforts to clamp down on prescription opioid painkiller abuse have partly\u2014unintentionally\u2014fueled the demand for heroin.\nThe bill would authorize the federal government to award grants to address the opioid and heroin use epidemic.\nWe\u2019ve had a dramatic increase in heroin and opioid deaths,\u201d Ayotte told The Daily Beast."}
