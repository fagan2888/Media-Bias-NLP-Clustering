He said they had overstepped their authority in connection with a contract for the extension of Elmore Avenue to the future Rhythm City Casino site.\n\nMayor Gluba has since changed his mind and is now only calling for Malin's resignation.\n\n\"The decision to spend somewhere between $1.6 and $5 million was made my Mr. Malin without our consent, and he's only allowed to spend $50,000 with our approval,\" Mayor Gluba said. \"I'll let Warner off the hook, [but] Malin knew exactly what he did and failed to tell us. As far as I'm concerned, he's got to go.\"\n\nAfter signing off on the statement criticizing the mayor's actions, Ambrose said he hopes the weekend gave everyone a chance to cool off.\n\n\"A lot of stress going around between the Mayor and the aldermen but it has to do with eight years of hard work,\" said Ambrose. \"Hastily made decisions are never good.\"\n\n\"We've got to have a thorough discussion and personnel issues should [not] be done not in public,\" said Ambrose.\n\nThere will be a press conference on the matter at Davenport City Hall at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The six aldermen who did not show up to a special Davenport City Council meeting called on Friday released a statement on Sunday explaining their reasons.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "The six aldermen who did not show up to a special Davenport City Council meeting called on Friday released a statement on Sunday explaining their reasons.
