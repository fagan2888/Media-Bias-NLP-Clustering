The man was barefoot, and was not wearing any pants.\n\nThe man had already left the scene when officers arrived. Police said they found the suspect, 22-year-old Austin Anderson, walking in and out of the eastbound lanes of NW Expressway, and took him into custody.\n\nAccording to police, Anderson threw a brick through the gym door window to gain entry into the school.
