While that may seem relatively modest, it\u2019s actually the biggest wage hike that employers have given out since 2008, according to a report by business consultant Aon Hewitt, which surveyed 1,147 U.S. employers on their pay practices for next year.\n\nNot all compensation budgets will be divvied up equally. Employers are continuing a trend to motivate and reward their best workers. So if you\u2019re considered a high performer \u2013 you didn\u2019t just meet expectations, you far exceeded them \u2013 you might expect a 4.7 percent salary increase. If you often exceeded expectations, you might get a 3.6 percent hike.\n\nIn 2013, top performers saw salary bumps of 4.7 percent while average workers who met expectations received a 2.6 percent raise, the report noted.\n\nRelated: Best Employers for Workers Over 50\n\nSalary increases have slowly inched up since 2009, when the recession pummeled businesses and workers\u2019 raises hit an all-time low of 1.8 percent. In 2008, it was a different story. Wage increases reached 3.7 percent for salaried exempt employees.\n\nAlthough the economy continues to improve and the jobs market shows steady gains, companies are still holding the line on fixed costs, says Ken Abosch, a compensation, strategy and market development leader at Aon Hewitt.\n\n\u201cCompanies aren\u2019t feeling tremendous pressures to increase base pay to attract top talent,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cInstead, they are executing on a pay-for-performance vision that rewards employees based on a mix of business and individual results.\u201d\n\nToday, as many as 90 percent of employers say they\u2019re using pay programs or performance-based compensation to reward their best and brightest. A decade ago, 78 percent of companies offered these kinds of incentives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a dramatic shift in the mix of compensation over the past decade, with variable [merit] pay assuming the largest component of compensation growth,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cRegardless of economic conditions, variable pay programs will continue to be the primary way employers differentiate rewards in the future.\u201d\n\nWhere you live might also affect your bottom line. According to the report, workers in New York and Boston will see lower-than-average wage increases in 2014 (2.8 percent in each), despite the high cost of living there. Want a heftier raise? Move to Kansas City or Denver, where employees can expect a 3.2 percent bump, the report said.\n\nRaises will be better than average for workers in the energy, oil and gas industries \u2013 employers will pay out an average 3.9 percent hike next year. Employees in construction and engineering can expect a 3.5 percent bump; mining will pay out 3.3 percent, the report said.\n\nRaises are stingier for teachers and others in the education field: salary increases are projected to be 2.6 percent in 2014 and 2.5 percent in the health care and medical services area.\n\nIn any case, putting that salary bump to work for you by contributing more to your retirement plan is the way to go.
