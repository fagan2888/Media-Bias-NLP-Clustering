The girl was found with no vital signs at the scene and both victims were reported to have sustained head injuries.\n\nAccording to Deputy Chief Joel Smith of the Halton Paramedic Services, one female sustained life-threatening injuries while the other had non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"The young girl was rushed to Milton District Hospital, but has sadly succumbed to her injuries sustained in the collision,\" said Det. Constable Chris Heffernen of the Halton Regional Police Collision Reconstruction Unit.\n\nThe woman was treated at hospital for minor injuries.\n\n\"Blowing snow covered Esquesing Line at the area of the collision, and appears to be a contributing factor to the collision. The occupants in the vehicle were both wearing their appropriate safety restraints,\" said Heffernen.\n\nAt the request of the family, police will not be releasing the girl's or her mother's names.\n\nThe Collision Reconstruction Unit is leading the investigation and Esquesing Line was closed for approximately four hours during the investigation. Union Gas responded to repair a gas line that was damaged during the collision.\n\nAny witnesses are asked to call Heffernen or Oliver Caves of the Collision Reconstruction Unit at 905-825-4747, ext. 5065.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "A 3-year-old girl is dead after the car she was in ran off the road and crashed in Milton Saturday afternoon.", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
