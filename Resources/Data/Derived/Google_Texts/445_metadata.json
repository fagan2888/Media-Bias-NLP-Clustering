Shortly afterward, Congress passed legislation even more explicitly barring the commission from having any authority over guns.\n\nDingell felt obliged to quit the NRA's board in 1994, when he voted for President Clinton's omnibus crime bill despite the fact that it included a ban on assault weapons that Dingell and the NRA strongly opposed. But he was back in line with the organization in 1999, when it appeared that the uproar over the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado might finally provide the momentum to close the \u201cgun-show loophole,\u201d which exempts unlicensed dealers at gun shows from having to perform background checks on gun buyers. The Senate voted to close the loophole, with Vice President Al Gore providing the tie-breaking vote. But before the House had the chance to follow suit, Dingell, the chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, intervened with an alternative proposal supported by the NRA. It would close the loophole for unlicensed dealers\u2013but weaken the background check, by reducing the amount of time authorities would have to perform it from 72 to 24 hours, while also limiting the definition of events considered actual \u201cgun shows.\u201d\n\nIt was a brilliant gambit. The alternate proposal divided supporters of expanded background checks, with some arguing for accepting the weakened checks and others arguing they had been rendered all but meaningless\u201424 hours was inadequate given how hard it was for the authorities to track down paper records, not to mention that many gun shows are on weekends. Meanwhile, Dingell\u2019s proposal gave cover to members who were reluctant to oppose the NRA, allowing them to say they had voted \u201cfor expanded background checks.\u201d Dingell\u2019s amendment passed on a 218 to 211 vote, while the measure that had passed the Senate failed by a 235 to 193 vote. The water sufficiently muddied and gun control supporters divided over how to proceed, the push to close the loophole faltered.\n\nThen, in 2007, after yet another classroom massacre\u2014at Virginia Tech\u2014Dingell once again intervened on the NRA\u2019s behalf to bend in its direction even the exceedingly moderate legislation being considered at the time, to encourage states to do a better job of including records of those deemed dangerously mentally unfit in the database for gun background checks. (The Virginia Tech shooter\u2019s mental health adjudication had not been reported to the database.) At Dingell\u2019s behest, the law\u2019s funding to help states improve their records was dependent on their allowing those barred from owning firearms, including convicted felons, to petition for restoration of their gun rights. The resulting provision was so poorly worded that some states have refused to accept the funding to improve their records, while in some of those that have\u2014including Virginia!\u2014restoration of gun rights has been disconcertingly loosely supervised.\n\nMore recently, there have been signs of daylight between Dingell and the NRA\u2014in 2012, he opposed an NRA-backed vote holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun-walking operation, which was linked to the Arizona shooting death of a border control agent from Dingell\u2019s district; Dingell deemed it \u201cclearly not a Second Amendment issue\u201d despite the NRA\u2019s agitation over the issue. And after the Newtown, Conn. massacre in 2012, gun control advocates saw hopeful signs that Dingell wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of sensible reform. But Dingell never had the chance to vote on expanded background checks, which this time around never made it out of the Senate\u2014as they had back in 1999 when his connivance managed to undermine them.\n\nIt is often said in defense of congressmen\u2019s more eyebrow-raising stances that they were simply a reflection of district imperatives. In Dingell\u2019s case, one can see how that rationalization would apply to, say, his resistance to stricter fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles. It is less easy to see how it applies to firearms, given that the city that his district borders to the north and east has one of the worst rates of gun homicides in the world: right up there with El Salvador.\n\nSo, yes, by all means wish well a lawmaker of remarkable longevity as he heads out the door after having decided, after nearly six decades, that serving in the House is \u201cobnoxious.\u201d But let\u2019s not whitewash one of the most enduring legacies of that service.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In 1972, a Congress still in the activist posture of the Great Society era was on the verge of creating a new government body with sweeping powers to regulate the safety of consumer products.
