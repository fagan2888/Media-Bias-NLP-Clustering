The Blue System is the nation's largest health insurer, covering more than 106 million people, and also is the nation\u2019s largest single processor of Medicare claims.\n\n[Poll: What topics will define HIMSS16?]\n\nThe BCBSA healthcare database is massive, combining cost information from 2.3 billion medical procedures, provider information, and patient reviews. The data provides BCBSA actionable insight on cost and quality trends, enabling it to advance care delivery, empower informed decision-making and improve the health of Americans.\n\n\u201cAt Blue Cross Blue Shield, we are committed to a data-driven healthcare system,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe have already made great strides to harness the power of healthcare data by building a comprehensive dataset and mining it for important insights and trends. Building on those assets and efforts will continue to drive the changes we need to ensure our healthcare system is sustainable.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s session will delve into a data analytics approach that brings value to both employers and employees, investigate solutions that enable consumers to make evidence-based decisions and show how aggregating cost data can help providers contain costs while better managing care.\n\n[Like Healthcare IT News on Facebook]\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting time in healthcare, and we have tremendous opportunities ahead,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cMoving forward, we have more work to do to pull even greater insights and intelligence from healthcare data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Power of Data to Transform Healthcare\u201d will be held on Tuesday, March 1 from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. PST at the Sands Expo Convention Center, Palazzo E.\n\nTwitter: @SullyHIT\n\nThis story is part of our ongoing coverage of the HIMSS16 conference.
