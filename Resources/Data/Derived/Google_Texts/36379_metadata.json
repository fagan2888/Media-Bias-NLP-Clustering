This means that nearly 53,000 enrollees in that particular program will be forced to look for new insurance coverage come fall of this year.\n\nThe move comes after Blue Cross Blue Shield announced that it had lost nearly $40 million over the last few years on its managed care programs.\n\nWhile Blue Cross Blue Shield did not say whether Obamacare played a role in its decision to drop Medicaid coverage, some believe that the state\u2019s planned addition of 300,000 New Yorkers to the Medicaid rolls under the ACA could be one reason for the dropped plans.\n\n\"Blue Cross Blue Shield now has a lot more clients on Medicaid because of Obamacare, so they would lose a lot more money,\u201d said State. Rep. Chris Collins, (R-Clarence) \u201cI don\u2019t see how they could say that this doesn't have a connection to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBecause those who are dropped from the program remain eligible for Medicaid, Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s decision means that other insurers will have to take on their former clients. With some of these insurers also facing losses in their own managed care programs, this could cause even patients to lose their coverage in the future.\n\nIndependent Health, the largest insurer in the region has admitted that they have recently faced \u201csimilar losses in its Medicaid program.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "A major insurer in New York announced that it will be dropping thousands from their rolls due to unaffordable Medicaid expenses.", "title": "53,000 New Yorkers to Be Dropped From Health Care Plans", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/dan-joseph/53000-new-yorkers-be-dropped-health-care-plans", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/images/Capture20.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-18T12:45:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T12:32:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-18T12:45:45-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A major insurer in New York announced that it will be dropping thousands from their rolls due to unaffordable Medicaid expenses.", "title": "53,000 New Yorkers to Be Dropped From Health Care Plans", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/dan-joseph/53000-new-yorkers-be-dropped-health-care-plans", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/images/Capture20.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A major insurer in New York announced that it will be dropping thousands from their rolls due to unaffordable Medicaid expenses.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc154\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York announced on Friday afternoon that they will be withdrawing from the state\u2019s Medicaid managed care program.\nIndependent Health, the largest insurer in the region has admitted that they have recently faced \u201csimilar losses in its Medicaid program.\"\nThe move comes after Blue Cross Blue Shield announced that it had lost nearly $40 million over the last few years on its managed care programs.\n\"Blue Cross Blue Shield now has a lot more clients on Medicaid because of Obamacare, so they would lose a lot more money,\u201d said State.\nWith some of these insurers also facing losses in their own managed care programs, this could cause even patients to lose their coverage in the future."}
