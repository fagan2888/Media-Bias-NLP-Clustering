It was an asthma attack, more often than not, another child fighting to breathe because the family ran out of medicine when they lost their insurance.\n\nThose were the nights that pushed me, and many advocates like me, into asking for change through the All Kids Covered Coalition. We fought for better insurance coverage for children living in poverty in Colorado. And our political leaders listened. Our state emerged as a leader in ensuring access to medical care for our poorest residents.\n\nIn 2005, 15 percent of children in the state were uninsured. Since then, the number has dropped to 2.5 percent. The percentage of children among our growing immigrant population enrolled in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program grew from 70 percent in 2008 to 84 percent in 2013.\n\nSadly, child poverty continues to spread \u2014 in our cities, in isolated rural pockets and, increasingly, in suburbs. And poverty is toxic. In Denver County, 22 percent of children live below the federal poverty line.\n\nEvery day, physicians see kids hacking with asthma in emergency rooms, kids with mouthfuls of cavities in too much pain to do well in school, babies failing to gain weight because of inadequate nutrition. We understand the sad truth: Poor kids on average get sicker than other kids. This week, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a report detailing the effects of poverty on children\u2019s health, and the overwhelming evidence that, unless they are given tools to mitigate their poverty \u2014 like government-provided health care \u2014 many of them will likely be sick for the rest of their lives.\n\nThat is why we must finish what we started in Colorado. Getting all kids insured \u2014 and keeping them insured \u2014 is one of the most important first steps we can take to keep them healthy. Once a parent knows they can get to a clinic without fear of financial disaster, they receive dental care, regular checkups, and vaccines. Additionally, we can get them other supports we know improve health, like affordable preschool, better housing, mental health services, and family counseling. The key is to get them in the door.\n\nThere are several ways to ensure those doors remain open for all of Colorado\u2019s children. First, we need to address fears among immigrants that enrolling in these programs could expose them to deportation. Second, we need to standardize the maze of forms and requirements across the state\u2019s 64 counties to enroll in Medicaid.\n\nLawmakers should continue state funding, due to expire at the end of this fiscal year, that keeps Medicaid reimbursements for primary care providers aligned with Medicare rates. The Affordable Care Act raised Medicaid reimbursements, greatly enhancing the likelihood that children could receive services, including vaccines and annual well-child checks, according to the Urban Institute. Colorado lawmakers did the right thing by approving state funding to sustain that payment for primary care services, after the federal funds ran out. If those fair payments disappear, the ability of physicians to serve low-income families will be significantly impacted.\n\nAdditionally, Colorado lawmakers can help families by moving the Hospital Provider Fee from under the TABOR cap to a constitutionally allowable enterprise fund. This would allow for all the programs that help children and families rise out of poverty to grow and expand while protecting and reimbursing all health care facilities for their uncompensated care.\n\nIf we continue to work together to cement the gains we have made in Colorado in combating child poverty, we will see fewer children in our emergency rooms and many more growing up healthy at home.\n\nSteve Federico is a pediatrician in Denver and a past president of the Colorado chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Getting all Colorado kids insured \u2014 and healthy", "title": "Getting all Colorado kids insured \u2014 and healthy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/11/getting-all-colorado-kids-insured-and-healthy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160311__DP_NGPS_Export20160313_Z00_OP13G_FEDERICOp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160311__DP_NGPS_Export20160313_Z00_OP13G_FEDERICOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-11T13:42:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:41:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Getting all kids insured \u2014 and keeping them insured \u2014 is one of the most important first steps we can take to keep them healthy.\nAdditionally, we can get them other supports we know improve health, like affordable preschool, better housing, mental health services, and family counseling.\nSteve Federico is a pediatrician in Denver and a past president of the Colorado chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nColorado lawmakers did the right thing by approving state funding to sustain that payment for primary care services, after the federal funds ran out.\nWe fought for better insurance coverage for children living in poverty in Colorado."}
