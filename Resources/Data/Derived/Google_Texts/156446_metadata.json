Within the realm of the law, temporary staffing agents have struggled with ambiguous definitions and methods of determining minimum coverage through past temporary employment history.\n\n\u201cWhen Washington was writing these rules, they were not thinking about staffing agencies,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSome people may just work and get two paychecks, others may get 42 paychecks.\u201d\n\nAs a side note in talking about the various levels of health-care plans, Lee said the bronze plan is turning out to cost more than the government expected and a \u201ccopper\u201d plan could be rolled out. He also said the \u201cCadillac\u201d platinum plan could see a change in 2018 that would likely force people into less exclusive plans.\n\n\u201cIf the premium cost exceeds a certain dollar number, it will cost a 40 percent tax on top of your premium,\u201d Lee said. \u201cCan you imagine if your family coverage was costing $20,000 and you had to pay an additional $8,000 in taxes just because your plan is too rich?\u201d\n\nDuring the hourlong presentation, Lee also recommended employers contact their attorney if they were near the 50-employee threshold, which requires them to provide health-care plans because they may also be required to include temporary and/or leased employees even though they are not statutory employees.\n\n\u201cIf the government perceives you to be an employer that crosses that 50-employee threshold, you\u2019ll need to offer your employees coverage as well,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLocal businessman Bill Engles said the Affordable Care Act has \u201cruined health insurance because people can\u2019t afford it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "To pay for Affordable Care Act health-care plans, the potential increase in cost for clients of labor staffing agencies has been estimated to be about 10 cents an hour.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/staffing-agency-estimates-health-insurance-cost", "site_name": "Times Record", "type": "article", "description": "To pay for Affordable Care Act health-care plans, the potential increase in cost for clients of labor staffing agencies has been estimated to be about 10 cents an hour.", "title": "Staffing Agency Estimates Health Insurance Cost"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/staffing-agency-estimates-health-insurance-cost", "title": "Staffing Agency Estimates Health Insurance Cost", "description": "To pay for Affordable Care Act health-care plans, the potential increase in cost for clients of labor staffing agencies has been estimated to be about 10 cents an hour.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1156209", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1156209", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Business,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-22T04:05:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Within the realm of the law, temporary staffing agents have struggled with ambiguous definitions and methods of determining minimum coverage through past temporary employment history.\nTo pay for Affordable Care Act health-care plans, the potential increase in cost for clients of labor staffing agencies has been estimated to be about 10 cents an hour.\nLocal businessman Bill Engles said the Affordable Care Act has \u201cruined health insurance because people can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\u201cIf the premium cost exceeds a certain dollar number, it will cost a 40 percent tax on top of your premium,\u201d Lee said.\n\u201cIf the government perceives you to be an employer that crosses that 50-employee threshold, you\u2019ll need to offer your employees coverage as well,\u201d Lee said."}
