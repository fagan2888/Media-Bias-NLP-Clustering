But people are becoming more aware of this disease, because families are reporting different behaviors.\"\n\nOne strikingly different behavior is that those with Lewy body dementia \u2014 Lewy bodies are protein deposits that lodge in nerve cells of the brain \u2014 can experience horrific hallucinations. They can shift from a normal conversation to an argument with someone who does not exist, or is no longer alive.\n\nBecause the institute teamed with national caregiving educator Teepa Snow to produce a training video on Lewy body dementia, Westbrook was contacted by a British director who is working on a film to raise awareness and create a \"Living Well with Dementia\" fund.\n\nThe 15-minute dramatic short \u2014 called \"Where Did You Go?\" \u2014 portrays the inner life of a woman experiencing the physical deterioration and psychological turmoil of Lewy body dementia. Even the brief trailer on the project's website is fairly harrowing.\n\nWestbrook sees the film as a compelling way to expand knowledge, and agreed to help with its Kickstarter campaign. For those who pledge a certain amount, the institute will donate online versions of some of its coping-with-dementia videos that feature Snow.\n\nWider awareness is essential, Westbrook says, because some drugs used to treat other dementias are dangerous and even fatal for someone with Lewy body. And an accurate prognosis is necessary for families to get the support they need.\n\n\"You can imagine families of those who are living at home, struggling through this without any medical background,\" she says. \"I think it's hard for the docs too. We're in trouble with this disease; we know it seems to be expanding, and the research is in the primitive stages.\"\n\nFor families who suspect Lewy body, Westbrook says, Snow has advice that might help them communicate with their physician.\n\n\"Lewy body changes throughout the day, so people can be perfectly functional in the morning, and at lunchtime they can't eat their own meal,\" Westbrook explains. \"Teepa says: Take your phone and film them when they are having an episode; bring it into the doctor and say, 'This is what I'm dealing with.'\"\n\nLIFE BEGINS AT ...\n\n\"Four Keys to a Healthy and Fulfilling Life after 50\" is the title of a free four-part series of seminars offered by the Area Agency on Aging of Southwest Florida, the Sarasota County Library System and the Friendship Centers.\n\nThe talks will be from 2-4 p.m. on Fridays beginning this week at Fruitville Library.
