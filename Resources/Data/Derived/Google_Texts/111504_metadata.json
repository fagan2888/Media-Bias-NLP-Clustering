He announced the change during Wednesday\u2019s convocation.\n\n\u201cAs the president of this university community of nearly 15,000 students and 7,000 faculty and staff, I take very seriously my responsibility to keep you safe in an increasingly dangerous world,\u201d Falwell said.\n\nThe revision is consistent with Falwell\u2019s remarks during the university\u2019s previous convocation, on Dec. 4, in which he encouraged students 21 and older to carry guns for self-defense in light of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and around the world.\n\n\u201cI just want to take this opportunity to encourage all of you to get your permit,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cWe offer a free course [in firearms safety]. Let\u2019s teach them a lesson if they ever show up here.\u201d\n\nThose remarks sparked some controversy in the media, and the university issued a statement of clarification supporting Falwell\u2019s comments and the reasoning behind them:\n\nHis remarks were a call to arms for self-defense and a criticism of political leaders who see the answer to such tragedies as more gun control. More gun control leads to more places and circumstances where innocents are unarmed and unable to defend themselves.\n\nThe statement also explains the reason for the university\u2019s initial change in weapons policy in 2011, which allowed for concealed carry on campus with the exception of residence halls:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I take very seriously my responsibility to keep you safe in an increasingly dangerous world,\" Liberty President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students,", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"I take very seriously my responsibility to keep you safe in an increasingly dangerous world,\" Liberty President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students,", "title": "Liberty University Allows Concealed Carry in Student Dorms", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151210_LibertyUniversityGuns.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-15T15:02:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NJhLgF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"I take very seriously my responsibility to keep you safe in an increasingly dangerous world,\" Liberty President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students,", "title": "Liberty University Allows Concealed Carry in Student Dorms", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151210_LibertyUniversityGuns.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "firearms", "published_time": "2015-12-14T13:01:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T15:02:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Security, Gun Rights, second amendment, Liberty University, concealed carry, Jerry Falwell"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6199\"", "article_summary": "A revision to Liberty University\u2019s weapons policy will allow concealed carrying of firearms in dorms\u2014the only area on campus where concealed carry wasn\u2019t already permitted.\nLiberty President Jerry Falwell Jr. said students of the Christian university in Lynchburg, Va., will be required to have a concealed carry permit and obtain approval from the university\u2019s police department.\nThe statement also explains the reason for the university\u2019s initial change in weapons policy in 2011, which allowed for concealed carry on campus with the exception of residence halls:\n\u201cI just want to take this opportunity to encourage all of you to get your permit,\u201d Falwell said.\nMore gun control leads to more places and circumstances where innocents are unarmed and unable to defend themselves."}
