Great! Now here\u2019s your audit.\n\nposted at 5:01 pm on January 4, 2015 by Jazz Shaw\n\nSince you\u2019re enjoying your Obamacare health insurance policy so much, you might not be all that put off by a few extra pieces of mail showing up at your door. There\u2019s all those forms to fill out and medical providers to screen, complicated prescription plans and all the rest. But now that the new year is upon us and tax time is approaching, you may want to prepare for an extra surprise from the mailman. It\u2019s coming from the IRS for many of you and it\u2019s not a birthday card.\n\nMoe Lane of Red State kicks the tires of this soon to be entrenched cycle.\n\n\u201cAs many as 3.4 million people who received Obamacare subsidies may owe refunds to the federal government, according to an estimate by a tax preparation firm\u2026 H&R Block is estimating that as many as half of the 6.8 million people who received insurance premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act benefited from subsidies that were too large, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\u201d Although it\u2019s definitely going to be a problem: \u2018several million people suddenly discovering that they now owe back taxes to the government over Obamacare\u2019 is not exactly a good scenario, especially if you belong to the political party that set that scenario up in the first place. But it\u2019s still not the worst thing for Democrats. No, the problem for Democrats here is that this is going to happen every year. The system is more or less designed to assume that people would twiddle with their coverage on a regular basis: as plans changed, improved, or degraded the consumer would be obligated to follow suit, in order to keep the subsidy. This sounds perfectly reasonable\u2026 if you\u2019re not the one doing it. But out in the real world?\n\nMoe points out that this is likely more of a feature than a bug, and it\u2019s not going to change any time soon. As long as you are unable to predict what your medical requirements will be and the rules keep changing from year to year, there will be no effective way to plan for precisely what your costs will be and how the reimbursements will affect you come tax time. As the author notes, it might be better if the law was even worse, as long as it was consistently worse.\n\nIn any event, if you know anyone who is enrolled in Obamacare, you might do them a favor and tell them to set aside a few extra dollars from their paychecks between now and the middle of April. Apparently they\u2019ll need it when the tax man cometh.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The postman always rings twice\u2026 at least.", "title": "Got Obamacare?
