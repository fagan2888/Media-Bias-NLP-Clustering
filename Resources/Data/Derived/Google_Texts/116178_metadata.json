The question for modern history lovers is, why?\n\nIt was April 1, 1875, and a group of men were headed back to Roseville on horseback, returning from a race at a ranch several miles beyond the city limits. Among the group was William H. Shaw and David Turley. Several newspapers reported both men, who worked in Roseville as Sheepshearers, were intoxicated when they started to quarrel nearby the 12 Mile House, once located at South Cirby and Old Auburn Road. Other newspapers claimed the incident took place on Old Marysville Road, 12 miles from Roseville. Today, it is hard to be certain of the exact location.\n\nWhat words were exchanged still remains a mystery. Some accounts even suggested that it was an April Fools\u2019 joke gone wrong. Whatever was said, it prompted Turley to challenge Shaw to a duel \u2014 a threat designed to make the other take back whatever negative remark was said. Shaw refused to duel Turley and tried to get away from him. Turley pulled his pistol out and fired two shots in Shaw\u2019s direction, hitting and killing him.\n\nThe trial was held in Sacramento and became highly publicized, making headlines in papers all the way to Los Angeles. One of the witnesses, Creed Haymond, stated for the defense that Turley was too intoxicated to have known what he was doing, therefore he believed it wasn\u2019t his fault. The other four witnesses together confirmed that Turley did in fact shoot Shaw as he was attempting to leave.\n\nTurley insisted that his actions were caused by an inherited mental illness. He also claimed that this inherited psychosis contributed to many deaths in his family; however, Judge Ramage did not allow this information in the trial.\n\nWhen all was said and done the jury found Turley guilty of murdering Shaw. The defendant eventually took his appeal to the Supreme Court, alleging errors were made during his trial. The Supreme Court came back unanimously on November 16, 1875, deciding that the initial court ruling was correct, and that Turley\u2019s conviction would remain the same.\n\nSo was the story Turley claimed about his family true, or just a desperate attempt to spare his own life?\n\nExtensive research into the matter reveals that David Turley\u2019s tragic family background was stranger than most would imagine. His father, Jesse Turley, was a wealthy and well respected farmer. According to Missouri historian Rhonda Chalfant, Jesse Turley was the first landowner in the Pettis County to free his slaves due to his support for the Union during the Civil War, prompting his own neighbors to engage in two attempts to murder him. Both times he was shot and survived. Sadly though, Jesse Turley\u2019s life ended at his own hand, after his own gun discharged by accident while he was mounting his horse during a stint in the Missouri State Militia. He was hit in the abdomen and died shortly thereafter.\n\nDavid Turley\u2019s mother, Lucy, was also killed by an accident bullet \u2014 shot by one of her other sons, William, while he was sleepwalking with his gun. Like David Turley, William Turley was also in the state militia, and was never the same after killing their mother. William was later done in during a raid in the Civil War involving Confederate General Joseph Shelby.\n\nOne of David Turley\u2019s sisters had a stroke, rendering her brain damaged for life, while his other sister couldn\u2019t handle the bizarre death of their mother, and literally went insane. She also died in a relatively short period. A third brother, John Turley, was killed in Kansas around 1875, while a fourth brother, Thomas, and was shot in Texas the same year.\n\nDavid Turley had left Missouri to California in 1857 after getting into some sort of \u201ctrouble.\u201d Following his father\u2019s death, he inherited a large amount of money and so he moved back to Missouri. He opened a saloon in Georgetown and moved in with a well-known woman of ill-repute. David\u2019s surviving brother, James, had tried to convince a doctor to have him committed to an asylum at Fulton due to erratic behavior. The Sedalia Bazoo Newspaper stated that besides being his own best customer at his saloon, David Turley was known to get into fights at the drop of a hat and quick to draw his blade or his gun \u2014 often times shooting at people for \u201cimaginary offenses.\u201d\n\nIt was after getting into too much trouble in Georgetown that David decided to head back to California.\n\nJames Turley, a.k.a. \u201cSedalia Jim,\u201d was a former policeman who ultimately spent his entire savings, an estimated $2000, to help with David\u2019s defense for killing Shaw. James tried to prove that his brother was mentally ill. It was James who wrote Colonel John F. Phillips, asking him to help gather affidavits to prove David was insane, a danger to himself or others, and that he needed to be committed rather than executed.\n\nEven after a petition was sent to California Governor William Irwin with numerous signatures begging for a reprieve, nothing was done to explore if David Turley suffered from mental illness. By 8 a.m. on Feb. 25, 1876, David Turley was given notice that Irwin was not going to grant him clemency.\n\nThe Daily Alta California newspaper chronicled the last hours of David Turley\u2019s life in detail, including his request to meet with Father Patrick Scanlon to be baptized as a Christian and be read his last rites. It was noted that people were lined up outside the building in hopes of catching sight of the hanging. At 2 p.m. Turley was marched up to the scaffold, a large shroud was placed over his clothes and a hood over his head. After a short prayer, it was documented that Turley shouted, \u201cMother, mother I am coming!\u201d as the rope dropped.\n\nAlthough his neck was broken instantly, his pulse continued for another fifteen minutes until the doctor pronounced him dead.\n\nIn the end, although Turley was not given a chance to prove his mental state to the courts, we now know that he obviously suffered from something that made him very violent. Whether the Turley family as a whole suffered from inherited bad tempers, some sort of psychosis or chemical imbalances, they all seemed to have been affected by it. Most of David\u2019s brothers were shot in the same way that Turley shot Shaw: Death didn\u2019t just follow the Turley Family, it seems to have chased after them with a vengeance. Yet, by the lifestyles that they chose, the male members of the Turleys died the very way in which they lived. As the saying goes, \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword,\u201d so all men are responsible to face the consequences of their own actions, just as David Turley did on that day in 1876.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
