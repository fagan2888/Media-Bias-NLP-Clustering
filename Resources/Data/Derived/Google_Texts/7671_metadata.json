That\u2019s awesome!\u2019\u201d Nick Robinson told NPR. But the happy news also came with a new set of worries. \u201cWhat are we going to do? How are we going to pay for this? This is intense.\u201d\n\nWhen the option of the Affordable Care Act became available, the Robinsons believed it was the answer to what they were looking for. Nick\u2019s company didn\u2019t offer health benefits and neither did Rachel\u2019s position as a wedding photographer.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s the answer! This is simple!\u2019\u201d he told NPR. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a cheaper insurance plan, there\u2019s no pre-existing condition stuff.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the Robinsons soon learned the HMO Blue Cross Blue Shield plan they pay about $375 each month for wasn\u2019t quite what they expected.\n\nFor example, when it came to finding an obstetrician in Texas for their upcoming baby earlier this year, Rachel said she called all 28 practices listed as acceptable options for their plan, but could find none to take her as a patient.\n\n\u201cSome would just come right out and say, \u2018We don\u2019t take Obamacare,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201dOr the best one was, \u2018The doctor takes it here at the actual practice, but whatever hospital you use \u2026 does not take that insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\nNPR noted that there were practices that accepted HMO plans, but the doctors rotated and Rachel wanted a relationship with only one physician.\n\n\u201cIt was mind-numbing, because I was just sitting there thinking, \u2018I\u2019m paying close to $400 a month just for me to have insurance that doesn\u2019t even work. So what am I paying for?\u2019\u201d she told NPR.\n\nThe Robinson family is not the only one to have reported problems finding doctors who will accept their plans, even though they\u2019re listed on the insurance websites. A former Marine in California recently shared a similar frustration.\n\nThe Robinsons were told by Blue Cross that the doctors listed should accept the plan they purchased.\n\nGiven their frustrations with finding a doctor who would accept Obamacare insurance, the Robinsons dropped their plan and decided to pay $4,000 for a midwife and a home delivery instead, an option they previously rejected. NPR reported that the Robinsons paid for the birth of their child in April out of pocket, but filed for reimbursement afterward through a Christian-based cost-sharing plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy with where we are now, but this is not OK. And I\u2019m extremely confident that, that\u2019s not what the architects of this plan had in mind,\u201d Nick told NPR.\n\nRachel gave birth to a healthy baby boy on April 28.\n\nListen to the Robinson\u2019s experience with the Affordable Care Act in NPR\u2019s report online.\n\n\u2013\n\nFront page image via txking/Shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 58, "twitter": {"description": "Nick and Rachel Robinson were excited about the possibilities that Obamacare offered them when they found out they were expecting a third child.    \"It's one of those times where you hear the news and there's this immediate sense of joy and excitement like, 'Yay, a new...", "title": "This Family Thought Obamacare Was \u2018the Answer\u2019\u2026 Until They Found Out Their Plan \u2018Doesn\u2019t Even Work\u2019", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/05/27/this-family-thought-obamacare-was-the-answer-until-they-found-out-their-plan-doesnt-even-work/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_166155479-620x413.jpg", "creator": "@lizklimas", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "nick, rachel, robinson, drops, obamacare, plan, after, they, cant, find, doctor, accepts, plan", "sailthru.tags": "health, obamacare, author-liz-klimas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 8088, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "obamacare,health", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 216, "description": "Nick and Rachel Robinson were excited about the possibilities that Obamacare offered them when they found out they were expecting a third child.    \"It's one of those times where you hear the news and there's this immediate sense of joy and excitement like, 'Yay, a new...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/814899", "linkedin-count": 5, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Nick and Rachel Robinson were excited about the possibilities that Obamacare offered them when they found out they were expecting a third child.    \"It's one of those times where you hear the news and there's this immediate sense of joy and excitement like, 'Yay, a new...", "title": "This Family Thought Obamacare Was \u2018the Answer\u2019\u2026 Until They Found Out Their Plan \u2018Doesn\u2019t Even Work\u2019", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/05/27/this-family-thought-obamacare-was-the-answer-until-they-found-out-their-plan-doesnt-even-work/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_166155479-620x413.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 413}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-05-27T09:33:06+00:00", "twitter-count": 453}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99bd\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s awesome!\u2019\u201d Nick Robinson told NPR.\nNick and Rachel Robinson were excited about the possibilities that Obamacare offered them when they found out they were expecting a third child.\nSo what am I paying for?\u2019\u201d she told NPR.\nThis is simple!\u2019\u201d he told NPR.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy with where we are now, but this is not OK.
