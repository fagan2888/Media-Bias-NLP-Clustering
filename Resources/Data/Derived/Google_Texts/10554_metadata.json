Barrasso pointed to the 13 Senate seats, 11 governorships and 69 House seats Republicans have gained since the passage of the ACA as evidence that the law's shortcomings are helping conservatives foster support, according to the report.\n\nMr. Trump, who faces significant opposition from within his own party, was able to find common ground with Republicans over the ACA at last week's meeting, according to the report. At the meeting, he predicted the government may try to postpone enrollment until after the election to hide premium increases on the ACA exchanges, according to the report.\n\nExperts told The Hill they believe Mr. Trump's predictions are unlikely since many insurers have already publicized premium hikes and postponing enrollment would require additional rule-making.
