I would hire 50 people if I could, if they were qualified,\u201d said Bethany Schenk, president and COO of Web Benefits Design. Over three years, the company hopes to fill the building and up to 300 people, she said.\n\nThe company is one of several new stars in benefits administration technology, including PlanSource, which is based in the formerly vacant Exchange Building in Church Street in downtown Orlando.\n\nWeb Benefits Design bought this building on Sand Lake Road Web Benefits Design Web Benefits Design\n\nMayor Buddy Dyer is set to speak at the company headquarters during an opening ceremony at 3 p.m. Tuesday.
