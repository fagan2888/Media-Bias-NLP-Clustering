There has been a debate on genetically modified organisms for some time now — groups arguing whether GMOs should or shouldn’t be allowed in our foods.

In a video posted on YouTube, Healthcare Triage — a health care series run by Dr. Aaron Carroll, a professor of pediatrics and assistant dean for Research Mentoring at Indiana University School of Medicine — presents both sides. Carroll begins by saying: “For the last 12,000 years or so, scientists have changed plants or animals by breeding them carefully to get the traits they wanted.”

While this is true, the GMO debate goes far beyond the gene-altering argument. Many food advocates believe there should be government standard labeling required by food companies that sell GMO ingredients. Furthermore, a recent study published in the International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability found conventional methods of corn breeding and soy had higher yields as compared to the genetic modification process.

However, according to the authors, there has not been enough scientific evidence to prove GMO crops are, in fact, harmful. And Carroll also sheds light on the topic, mentioning the “Institute of Medicine and National Research Council concluded that there was no evidence that GMO food posed any greater danger to people than conventional grown crops.”

One thing Carroll fails to mention is the fact GMOs do not only refer to crops, but other modified ingredients such as additives, preservatives, and hydrogenated oils.
