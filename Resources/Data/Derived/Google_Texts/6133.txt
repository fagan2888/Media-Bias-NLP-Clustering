Ambulatory surgery center operator Nobilis Health Corp. will acquire the Victory Healthcare Houston Hospital for $2.4 million, the company announced on Monday.

The deal gives Nobilis control over the 25-bed surgical hospital, which had been run by Victory Healthcare. Nobilis said the acquisition helps the firm to add an in-network hospital for its patients and providers. Nobilis manages several ambulatory centers in Texas and Arizona.

"With Nobilis' nationwide and international reach through its marketing programs, having an in network hospital will allow us to capture revenues from in-network leads generated from our marketing programs,” CEO Chris Lloyd said in a statement. “The hospital's location, size and capabilities means the hospital can accommodate patients not only in the Houston area but from all over the country."
