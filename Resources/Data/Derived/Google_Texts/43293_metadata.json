Blue Cross reported an operating loss of $119 million, up from a $17 million loss the year before. The insurer, however, ended 2014 with a net gains of $8 million, thanks to income from investments. Blue Cross controls 40 percent of the state\u2019s commercial market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur taxes and fees went up by $109 million from one year to the next,\u201d said Allen Maltz, chief financial officer at Blue Cross. \u201cThis is part of the revenue that they\u2019re taking to cover the cost of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHarvard Pilgrim Health Care of Wellesley, the second-biggest insurer in Massachusetts, also cited the Affordable Care Act costs in reporting an operating loss of $18 million, reversing a profit of $1 million in 2013. Fallon Health\u2019s operating loss increased to nearly $12 million in 2014, from a loss of less than $3 million the year before, the Worcester insurer reported.\n\nWatertown-based Tufts Health Plan was the sole large Massachusetts insurer to report an operating profit. Tufts said it earned $7 million, up from $4 million the year before, but said the gain came from business that was phased out and no longer exists\n\nLike Blue Cross, the other major health plans ended 2014 with net gains because of income from investments or other sources.\n\nIn addition to new taxes and fees, the insurers said they faced unanticipated costs because of problems with Massachusetts\u2019 online health insurance exchange, the Health Connector. The connector website was broken for many months, forcing state officials and insurers to scramble to place people in appropriate plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, smaller health plans that manage care for patients on Medicaid, the government program for people with low incomes, struggled with losses because of what they said was inadequate state funding.\n\nAnother factor contributing to operating losses were pricey drugs \u2014 namely, Sovaldi, a breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C that costs $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 for a full regimen. Another hepatitis C treatment, Harvoni, is priced at $94,500 per treatment.\n\nIndustry specialists said they expect more costly medicines to hit the market in the years ahead.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1846756504", "eomportal-id": 124228, "description": "Massachusetts\u2019 largest nonprofit health plans lost millions of dollars on operations last year as they covered expensive new drugs and paid to roll out the federal Affordable Care Act.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Massachusetts\u2019 largest nonprofit health plans lost millions of dollars on operations last year as they covered expensive new drugs and paid to roll out the federal Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obamacare, drug costs drive operating losses for Mass. health insurers - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/02/27/obamacare-drug-costs-drive-operating-losses-for-mass-health-insurers/GOi2SXKKwhQ3AZ3g1wuxDM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.38243740000001", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.4072107", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "health insurance,losses,obamacare,affordable care act,specialty drugs,sovaldi,blue cross blue shield of massachusetts,tufts health plan,harvard pilgrim health care,fallon health", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 04:40:36 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "health insurance,losses,obamacare,affordable care act,specialty drugs,sovaldi,blue cross blue shield of massachusetts,tufts health plan,harvard pilgrim health care,fallon health,Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "096f9582-beca-11e4-9296-ffff437823b8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb5f\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross reported an operating loss of $119 million, up from a $17 million loss the year before.\nThe biggest loss came at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state\u2019s largest commercial insurer, based in Boston.\nIn addition to new taxes and fees, the insurers said they faced unanticipated costs because of problems with Massachusetts\u2019 online health insurance exchange, the Health Connector.\nWatertown-based Tufts Health Plan was the sole large Massachusetts insurer to report an operating profit.\nBlue Cross controls 40 percent of the state\u2019s commercial market."}
