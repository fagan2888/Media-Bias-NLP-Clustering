It might be fatigue, lack of exercise \u2013 or maybe COPD.\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a group name for lung diseases like chronic bronchitis and emphysema that block airflow and make breathing difficult. It\u2019s also a condition the Affordable Care Act\u2019s keeping closer tabs on beginning next month.\n\nIn this edition of Vital Signs, Tom Kallstrom, CEO of the American Association for Respiratory Care, explains more about COPD.\n\nThe KERA Interview\n\nFrom Tom Kallstrom\u2019s interview\u2026\n\nWhat is COPD? It\u2019s a respiratory component that often times, unless it\u2019s discovered and diagnosed, it continues to deteriorate and cause more problems for the patient. About 24 million people in this country with COPD. Half of them have not been diagnosed\u2026because it happens over time. It\u2019s a slow disease. So, we try to make sure patients are diagnosed early, and if you\u2019re treated, you should be able to expect to have a better quality of life.\n\nWho\u2019s usually diagnosed with COPD, mostly older people? Generally speaking, the age of 35 is the cut-off mark. It used to be that we\u2019d look at 45 or 50, but over the last few years, they brought it down to about 35. The thing that\u2019s interesting about this as well is. There\u2019s more women than men with COPD. That kind of flip-flopped about ten years ago. There is a genetic component of COPD that, if you smoked or not, you could have the symptoms of COPD as well, but you\u2019re treated differently with different meds because of that. People who are involved in work or industry that have a lot of fumes and dust, that can often translate to patient with COPD later in life, as well.\n\nHow do you treat COPD? Number one is did the patient smoke? Are they still smoking? If that\u2019s the case, we need to get them some smoking cessation counseling. Pulmonary Rehab. We work wth respiratory therapist who will train you to do some exercise that will help build up your capacity of better breathing. Medications are also important for patients. And then finally, patients may be on oxygen.\n\nCan you cure COPD? You can certainly recognize the diagnosis, and then treat the disease. You cannot cure it.\n\nFor more information:\n\nNational Heart, Blood & Lung Institute\n\nCOPD: Life Expectancy, Symptoms and Treatment\n\nHospital Readmissions Program", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health/Science", "description": "You\u2019re short of breath after a flight of stairs or other daily activities.
