(AP) - The first three songs Scott Dorscheimer ever learned on guitar were Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cRedemption Song,\u201d Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cLayla\u201d and The Allman Brothers\u2019 \u201cSweet Melissa.\u201d\n\nHe started when he was 18 when, watching a friend play guitar, he was struck by a desire to pick it up himself.\n\nHe took a couple of lessons and learned a few chords, self-teaching himself after that.\n\nDorscheimer\u2019s father was an electrical engineer who built cabins in his spare time with Scott growing up helping him saw, cut and nail them together.\n\nOnce he got into guitar playing, Scott\u2018 mind returned to all that woodwork and he started wondering how hard it would be to build a guitar from scratch, piece by piece.\n\nOn a visit in Bozeman, Mont., a chance conversation about guitars at a pub in Big Sky introduced Dorscheimer to the manager of Gibson Guitars in Bozeman.\n\nTwo weeks later, he hooked a U-Haul up to his truck and moved to Montana, going to work for Gibson.\n\n\u201cGibson builds all their acoustic guitars out there. The weather is really conducive for the wood out there because of the humidity. It\u2019s a dry air.\u201d\n\nHe ended up staying there for a year, long enough to learn a few things about guitars, and long enough to discover that what he was seeking wasn\u2019t something you could find in a factory, not even one that created guitars.\n\nHe met the guys at Gibson who did custom work by hand and started talking with them. Two of them had gone to a luthier, or guitar building, school in Phoenix, Ariz., and Dorscheimer decided that was where he\u2019d head. He even wrote a check to the school, a check he still holds onto today. But, like the oft-quoted line from John Lennon, life is what happens when you\u2019re making other plans.\n\nA conversation with two professional luthiers convinced him that guitar building was a long, hard road to make a living.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pay your dues. There\u2019s no other way around it.\u201d\n\nDorscheimer ended up moving back to Atlanta and going to college, majoring in political science and business administration, but he didn\u2019t give up on guitars. He kept working at it, at first ordering guitar making kits that came with half of the steps done. He\u2019d take baby steps with each one, learning a little more each time, slowly working backwards to get to the point where he was starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cThe only way to do this is to get in there.\u201d\n\nHe ended up going into insurance, something that his stepfather did, sticking with it for 15 years, building guitars on the side.\n\n\u201cThere would be times when I could build more and other times when I wasn\u2019t able to build too much because of circumstances: money, machinery and time.\u201d\n\nInsurance brought Dorscheimer and his family to down to Hahira, but he slowly started feeling burned out.\n\nWhen his father died - the father who showed him how to work wood, showed him how to take dissimilar parts and build something accordant out of them - he started thinking about his life, about the years, about his love and hate, tug-of-war relationship between his desire to build guitars and the circumstances of life.\n\n\u201cIt made me take a step back\u2026It was a kind of a wake-up call.\u201d\n\nSo, here\u2019s a question: you live in Hahira and you want to pursue your passion of crafting acoustic guitars from scratch. Where do you go to develop your craft?\n\nIf you said the local barbershop, you\u2019re right.\n\nDorscheimer mentioned to his barber, Jimmy, one day that he built guitars and Jimmy sent him to see his cousin, Mike Daugherty, who\u2019s been making violins since the 1980s.\n\nDorscheimer and Daugherty started hanging out, talking with each other about projects they were working on.\n\nEventually, Dorscheimer ended up making a guitar in Daugherty\u2019s shop as a kind of joint project.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s helped me learn to hear the right tones in the wood before I build it, making sure the tones match.\u201d\n\nNow, Dorscheimer splits his guitar building between Daugherty\u2019s and at home in a side room of the house outfitted with saws and clamps, soaking the wood in his bathtub to make it more pliable.\n\nHe also works with wood in other ways, building chairs, belt buckles and rustic d\u00e9cor.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road for Dorscheimer to finally arrive at focusing on guitars, but he has no regrets about it. If anything, it\u2019s taught him patience.\n\n\u201cIf I can just sit back and let things happen, it\u2019s amazing how thing truly fall into place.\u201d\n\nLast year, he got up the courage to take his guitars to the Naturally Acoustic Guitar Show at Lake Oconee. There, he was able to meet his peers, his fellow luthiers, and compare techniques. Dorscheimer was nervous, but everyone was encouraging, offering feedback and advice, which he sums up in four short lines, four short lines that sketch out his past and his future in the same way you might sketch out the design of a guitar\u2019s peg head, or the layout of a cabin.\n\nGood work. Rough at some spots. Great at some things. Keep going.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Valdosta Daily Times, http://valdostadailytimes.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first three songs Scott Dorscheimer ever learned on guitar were Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song,\" Eric Clapton's \"Layla\" and The Allman Brothers' \"Sweet Melissa.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/26/georgia-luthier-finds-his-calling-in-guitar-work/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The first three songs Scott Dorscheimer ever learned on guitar were Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cRedemption Song,\u201d Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cLayla\u201d and The Allman Brothers\u2019 \u201cSweet Melissa.\u201d", "title": "Georgia luthier finds his calling in guitar work"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The first three songs Scott Dorscheimer ever learned on guitar were Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song,\" Eric Clapton's \"Layla\" and The Allman Brothers' \"Sweet Melissa.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Georgia luthier finds his calling in guitar work"}, "Author": "KRISTIN FINNEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Scott Dorscheimer, Eric Clapton"}, "article_summary": "He kept working at it, at first ordering guitar making kits that came with half of the steps done.\nTwo of them had gone to a luthier, or guitar building, school in Phoenix, Ariz., and Dorscheimer decided that was where he\u2019d head.\nA conversation with two professional luthiers convinced him that guitar building was a long, hard road to make a living.\nTwo weeks later, he hooked a U-Haul up to his truck and moved to Montana, going to work for Gibson.\nEventually, Dorscheimer ended up making a guitar in Daugherty\u2019s shop as a kind of joint project."}
