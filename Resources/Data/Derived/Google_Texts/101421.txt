COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Bicycle manufacturer Kent International is building a new plant in Clarendon County.

The company said it will invest nearly $4.5 million in a facility that is expected to create 175 jobs.

The company announced Thursday that the plant will supply Walmart with its first US-made bicycles.

Domestic production of the bikes will allow Kent to deliver them to Walmart stores 90 percent assembled, saving assembly time in the stores.

Kent is also a major supplier to Toys R Us, Amazon and Academy Sporting Goods.
