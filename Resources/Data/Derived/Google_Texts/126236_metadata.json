But it\u2019s not so simple. A national database will inevitably lead to sweeping national regulations that will make local departments beholden to the feds.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s one step closer to a federal takeover of local policing. A national database will help ever-so-trustworthy and \u201ccompetent\u201d experts at the national level use ginned-up civil-rights crises and manipulated data, which don\u2019t take into account particular, unique situations on the ground, to build uniform standards they\u2019ll impose from the top down.\n\nTwo Democratic senators have proposed a bill that will require states to report to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) all shootings involving a police officer or any other use of force that results in death. Currently, local police departments are not required to report these data to the feds, so the Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive database on what\u2019s going on in the more than 18,000 police agencies across the nation. Senators Barbara Boxer and Cory Booker want to end that by creating a national database on every shooting\u2014fatal or nonfatal\u2014including age, gender, race, and whether the person was armed.\n\n\u201cToo many members of the public and police officers are being killed, and we don\u2019t have reliable statistics to track these tragic incidents,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cThis bill will ensure that we know the full extent of the problem so we can save lives on all sides.\u201d\n\nHow Could Collecting Data Hurt Anyone? The \u201cwe\u201d Boxer is referring to, of course, is the federal government. It\u2019s not enough that local departments and states carry out their own investigations when shootings happen; according to Boxer and activists who are compiling their own databases, the federal government needs the information so they can have more oversight of local authorities and bring about reform.\n\nHow will they interpret the data, and what are they going to do with it? It sounds quite reasonable to gather data\u2014what\u2019s the harm in collecting information?\u2014but any time the federal government does so, we need to pause and ask, \u201cHow will they interpret the data, and what are they going to do with it?\u201d The obvious answer is to bring about one-size-fits-all national reforms, something I recently discussed with supporters of the bill on KCRW\u2019s \u201cTo the Point.\u201d\n\nJim Bueermann, former chief of the police department in Redlands, California, and president of the Police Foundation, said he is for a national database because shootings are grossly under-reported, and it will promote accountability and transparency of policing in the United States.\n\nJon Swaine of The Guardian has been working to build an independent database with \u201cThe Counted\u201d and says they\u2019ve found that the number of minorities, particularly blacks, killed by police is much higher than reported.\n\nLocal Control Means Better Accountability While Bueermann and reporters at The Guardian are well-intentioned in wanting to protect innocent lives by holding police accountable, top-down reforms aren\u2019t the way to do it. Local policing is a matter for the states, and the federal government needs to stay out of it unless federal laws have been violated. If activists want reform, they need to go about the difficult task of doing it on the state level instead of looking to the feds to impose their will on local authorities.\n\nIf activists want reform, they need to go about the difficult task of doing it on the state level instead of looking to the feds to impose their will on local authorities. We have a very diverse nation, and police departments are local because we want officers to be invested in the community, to know the people they are policing. Every situation is different, and every department is unique, with varied needs and budgets. Charlotte, North Carolina, for example, doesn\u2019t need or want the same regulations or \u201cbest practices\u201d that Chicago has. Certainly, Dade County in Florida is very different from Montgomery County in Maryland\u2014a county that is well-known for its transparency and has a lot of money to make that happen effectively.\n\nThe call for national reform, however, is based on a false meme that local police can\u2019t be trusted, that they\u2019re out of control, and white cops are killing blacks every chance they get. This simply isn\u2019t true\u201453 percent of Americans are very confident in cops, while only 16 percent have little or no confidence in them. Most cops are faithful at doing their job, and maligning them only encourages civil unrest, which leads to federal intrusion.\n\nWhen a police shooting happens, local authorities investigate the incident. The state gets involved if the department doesn\u2019t do its job. Detectives, state and district attorneys, forensic specialists\u2014people on the ground and familiar with the local situation\u2014are involved in holding the officer accountable and bringing charges. If reforms are needed, they need to happen at the state and local level. Even now, state legislatures and police departments are engaged in developing improved measures, including more training. Others have established \u201cshooting teams\u201d that can thoroughly investigate each incident.\n\nDispersing Power Protects Innocent People It would violate our constitutional system for the federal government to impose intrusive and uniform alterations. This is the reality of federalism and our system of government with its separation of powers. We\u2019re not like the United Kingdom, with a national police force. We\u2019re 50 states with separate, autonomous powers. That\u2019s a good thing, because diversity and dispersion of power protect Americans from abuse of centralized power.\n\nFederalism protects us from abuse that will inevitably come when police power is in the hands of a few. While federalism is complex and doesn\u2019t lend itself to easy solutions, it\u2019s necessary to protect citizens from the federal government. The abuse of power by police officers that are spread over thousands of agencies can be a valid concern, but people need to be more concerned with abuse of power by a single centralized authority. Federalism protects us from abuse that will inevitably come when police power is in the hands of a few.\n\nThe protective shield of federalism, however, is being shredded in the name of civil rights as the federal government is getting more involved in local policing. After the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, President Obama called for national reforms to \u201cend discriminatory policing,\u201d although the shooting wasn\u2019t a civil-rights violation, but a case of self-defense by the police officer.\n\nUsing Racism as a Pretense Still, groups like \u201cColor of Change\u201d (among others) have answered Obama\u2019s call for national reform by demanding mandatory reporting, stirring up racial conflicts, and calling for more investigations into presumed civil-rights violations. Color of Change has turned up in Texas to demand that the Justice Department investigate the police officer who has resigned over an incident at a pool party in McKinney. In highly charged language, the group is stoking the fires of racial tensions.\n\nIn highly charged language, the group is stoking the fires of racial tensions. \u201cThere are few words to describe the inhumanity of McKinney law enforcement and Officer Casebolt\u2019s brutal, unprofessional and discriminatory violence this past weekend,\u201d said Color Of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson. \u201cOur hearts go out to all the teens who experienced the terror and pain of unjust treatment at the hands of police, a trauma all too familiar to Black people across the country. . . . In America, pools have long been a place where the boundaries of racial segregation are enforced and what happened in McKinney is no different. The fact that white residents thought the teens, who had guest passes, \u2018didn\u2019t have permission to be there\u2019 highlights the racism that kicked off the ensuing police violence. Dehumanizing racial stereotypes about Black girls and boys as \u2018inherently wrong\u2019 and \u2018out of place\u2019 in white spaces continues to rule the daily lives of Black people. McKinney, Texas, is no different.\u201d\n\nColor of Change hopes gathering data on local police and forming a national database will help stop such discrimination. If they can prove \u201cfrom the numbers\u201d that there is indeed police abuse on a widespread scale, they think it will justify increasingly involving the federal government in local policing.\n\nThe Problem With Data The problem with data-collecting is that people can make massive amounts of data say anything if they don\u2019t analyze them in context and consider all the associated complexities. William Sousa, a data collection specialist from the University of Nevada, made this point on the \u201cTo the Point\u201d interview. Numbers could show that police shootings are on the rise, but if they are only happening in one area of the country, for example, then one can\u2019t say the nation has a problem. People need to look at the numbers in context\u2014which is very difficult to do.\n\nBuerrmann said he has confidence that numbers can be beneficial because we\u2019ll be using data specialists to interpret the information, not politicians. I wish that would be the case, but the fact is politicians will be the ones using the numbers to implement laws, and politicians have agendas. The agenda of the current administration and of the Democratic Party is clear: more federal control over local policing.\n\nThe Feds Already Oversee the Police A point being lost in this debate is that local departments already have federal oversight. Since the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 after the Rodney King incident, the DOJ has been authorized to step in when there\u2019s misconduct in local police departments. They write letters, initiate legal action, and put monitors in place. They did this to such an extent in Louisiana that it led to a federal takeover, in essence, of the police department.\n\nJust because there\u2019s a problem in Cleveland or Ferguson doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a problem everywhere. If this system isn\u2019t working (and some say it isn\u2019t, because the policy was driven more by public sentiment than facts), then maybe that needs to be revisited instead of creating a new law which will lead to even more federal infringements of state autonomy.\n\nMore importantly, we need to put the \u201cproblem\u201d of police shootings in perspective. Even the Washington Post, which has done a lot of reporting on the need for a national database, has stated that shooting deaths by police officers are rare\u2014and most are justified. Only about 300 agencies have each reported one death this year\u2014that\u2019s out of thousands of agencies.\n\nThe fact is the vast majority of police departments in the country don\u2019t have a problem. Local communities, by and large, are satisfied with their police departments. Already in 25 states, local departments are required by state law to report all shooting deaths to the state. When a police shooting happens, it\u2019s reported and investigated. Officers are held accountable. That\u2019s the norm. Why bring uniform and expensive federal reforms to all states when a small percentage has a problem?", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 06:43:43 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Why a new national police shootings database won\u2019t prevent future Fergusons or Baltimores.", "title": "Activists Use Charges Of Police Racism To Justify A Huge Power Grab", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_131453660.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-15T13:47:39+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/06/12/activists-use-charges-of-police-racism-to-justify-a-huge-power-grab/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Why a new national police shootings database won\u2019t prevent future Fergusons or Baltimores.", "title": "Activists Use Charges Of Police Racism To Justify A Huge Power Grab", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_131453660.jpg"}, "creator": "@McAllisterDen", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Infrastructure", "tag": "Baltimore,Baltimore Police Department,data collection,Ferguson Missouri,Ferguson Police Department,local police,police,separation of powers,U.S. Department of Justice", "published_time": "2015-06-12T06:43:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T13:47:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Why a new national police shootings database won\u2019t prevent future Fergusons or Baltimores."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d25\"", "article_summary": "A national database will inevitably lead to sweeping national regulations that will make local departments beholden to the feds.\nAlready in 25 states, local departments are required by state law to report all shooting deaths to the state.\nThe Feds Already Oversee the Police A point being lost in this debate is that local departments already have federal oversight.\nSenators Barbara Boxer and Cory Booker want to end that by creating a national database on every shooting\u2014fatal or nonfatal\u2014including age, gender, race, and whether the person was armed.\nMcKinney, Texas, is no different.\u201dColor of Change hopes gathering data on local police and forming a national database will help stop such discrimination."}
