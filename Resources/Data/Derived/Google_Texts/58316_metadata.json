Aquila urged the 1,500 people crowded around the state Capitol on Saturday afternoon to be unafraid of spreading the message of life in a political and door-to-door campaign.\n\n\u201cFear is always the work of the emissaries of death, \u2026 of the evil one,\u201d Aquila told a cheering crowd waving pro-life posters.\n\nThe demonstration began with a morning Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception on East Colfax Avenue. Following the service, more than 1,300 people \u2014 including dozens of priests from New Mexico, Utah and Colorado \u2014 marched to the west side of the Capitol to hear speeches.\n\nThe growing crowd of marchers then circled Civic Center park.\n\nParticipants waved signs over their heads, including one that simply said, \u201cLife,\u201d with two tiny feet forming the dot over the I. Another said, \u201cYo soy la Generation Pro-Vida,\u201d or \u201cI am the Pro-Life Generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for standing up for life and the dignity of the humanity,\u201d Aquila told the crowd.\n\nHe asked the crowd to become politically active, to knock on doors of neighbors and stand up for the right to life.\n\n\u201cThe cause of life deserves excellence,\u201d the archbishop said.\n\nRon Rooney and his wife, Trish, both 56, of Littleton, attended the Mass and participated in the march and rally.\n\n\u201cI think people\u2019s voices are getting lost in America and people aren\u2019t speaking out,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThat\u2019s why America is going into the toilet.\u201d\n\nHe said he hopes that his four children will never be pressured by the government to consider abortion.\n\nPastor Biff Gore, the president of Colorado Right to Life, asked attendees to \u201chelp a brother out\u201d and put money in buckets passed around the crowd, promising that every dollar would be used to fight abortion in Colorado.\n\n\u201cIn Denver, the abortion industry covers nearly an entire block,\u201d said Gore,\n\nreferring to a Planned Parenthood building in the Park Hill neighborhood.\n\n\u201cToday, we mourn 42 years of abortion since the Roe vs. Wade decision in the Supreme Court,\u201d Gore said. \u201cSince then, they\u2019ve been killing children in Colorado.\u201d\n\nGore said battling slavery and the Holocaust were causes past generations fought.\n\n\u201cProtecting life is the fight of our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Archbishop leads 1,500 in pro-life march and rally", "title": "Archbishop leads 1,500 in pro-life march and rally", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/17/archbishop-leads-1500-in-pro-life-march-and-rally/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__CD18RIGHTTOLIFE_KO17693p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__CD18RIGHTTOLIFE_KO17693p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T15:07:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:30:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcaf2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFear is always the work of the emissaries of death, \u2026 of the evil one,\u201d Aquila told a cheering crowd waving pro-life posters.\nRon Rooney and his wife, Trish, both 56, of Littleton, attended the Mass and participated in the march and rally.\nAnother said, \u201cYo soy la Generation Pro-Vida,\u201d or \u201cI am the Pro-Life Generation.\u201d\u201cThank you for standing up for life and the dignity of the humanity,\u201d Aquila told the crowd.\nThe demonstration began with a morning Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception on East Colfax Avenue.\nDenver Catholic Archbishop Samuel J.
