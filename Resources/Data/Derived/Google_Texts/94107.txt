The grass fire that burned more than 12,500 acres on Friday near Kersey was contained Friday night.

The fire originated at U.S. 34 and County Road 61, said Platte Valley Fire Authority spokeswoman Stephanie Cook.

Interstate 76 was closed for a while earlier Friday at U.S. 34 due to the blaze, the Colorado Department of Transportation said.

No injuries were reported, the fire district said, and no structures were reported destroyed, Cook said.

At least six other departments responded to the fire.

Those in the area were cautioned to be aware of smoke in the area.

Two air tankers made drops Friday to help firefighters protect structures threatened by the fast-moving fire.

The last reported size of the fire was 12,669 acres at 6:45 p.m. on Friday.
