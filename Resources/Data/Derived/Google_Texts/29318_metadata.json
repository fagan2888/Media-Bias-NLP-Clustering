The same can\u2019t be said about the resistance of some Catholic colleges and universities to the efforts of their adjunct faculty to unionize.\n\nAs a rule, non-union adjunct faculty make poverty-level wages and receive no health care or other benefits. In recent years their numbers have burgeoned to half of all faculty in higher education. Paying them a living wage with benefits increases the cost of doing business for colleges and universities. Ergo, the resistance.\n\nWhat makes whited sepulchers of the anti-union Catholic colleges and universities is their pious claim that what they\u2019re really doing is defending religious freedom. Here, for example, is Loyola University of Chicago, which is fighting its adjunct union tooth and nail: \u201cWhile we agree that employee unionization is both valuable and just, the issue at stake here is about the freedom of religious institutions from government interference with regard to their religious mission, especially with respect to employees who play a critical role in carrying out that mission.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s like saying: \u201cWhile we agree that sexual abuse of minors is bad, the issue at stake here is about the freedom of religious institutions from the interference of the criminal justice system because, you know, we have to make sure that the faithful aren\u2019t scandalized by revelations with respect to the behavior of employees who are carrying out our religious mission, especially when they\u2019re priests.\u201d\n\nAs anyone who saw Spotlight knows, that\u2019s pretty much the position adopted by the Catholic Church for many years. It didn\u2019t work out so well.\n\nThe alleged perpetrator of government interference in the present case is the National Labor Relations Board, which two years ago set new criteria by which a religiously affiliated institution can obtain an exemption from its jurisdiction. Specifically, such an institution has to show that it provides \u201ca religious educational environment\u201d and, if so, that \u201cit holds out the petitioned-for faculty members themselves as creating or maintaining the college or university\u2019s religious educational environment, as demonstrated by its representations to current or potential students and faculty members and the community at large.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that most of the adjunct faculty at most of the institutions in question do nothing to create or maintain the religious environment. They are hired to teach English, math, history, or whatever without regard to their religious beliefs or commitments. And as Gerald pointed out in the National Catholic Reporter last month, if religious liberty were really the concern of the colleges and universities, they could avoid NLRB interference simply by letting the adjuncts organize without opposition, and negotiating a contract with them.\n\nSince Pope Leo XIII issued his encyclical Rerum novarum 125 years ago this month, the Catholic Church has stood foursquare in favor of unions. But what Loyola, Seattle University, et al. are doing isn\u2019t merely at odds with Catholic social teaching. It also drags into disrepute the Church\u2019s current campaign on behalf of religious liberty.\n\nSignificantly, the Bishops\u2019 Ad Hoc Committee on Religious Liberty and the Becket Fund, which are leading the campaign, have declined to take up cudgels on behalf of the institutions fighting adjuncts\u2019 unions. It\u2019s also telling that, in a speech to the Chicago Federation of Labor last September, Archbishop Blaise Cupich allowed as how \u201cnot every claim of religious freedom is valid and the law has to protect the basic rights of all.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Catholic colleges and universities are putting their money where their social teaching is. Leading the way is Georgetown University, which in 2005 adopted a Just Employment Policy that acknowledged the rights of employees to freely associate and organize. In October of 2014, after a collaborative two-year process with Local 500 of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), its adjunct professors ratified a contract with the university.\n\nSince then, SEIU contracts have been signed at Dominican University in California and St. Michael\u2019s College in Vermont. On Monday, adjunct professors at St. Louis University joined their peers at 9 other Catholic schools in establishing a union with SEIU.\n\nThe unionization movement among adjuncts is still in its infancy, but it\u2019s not going away. At this point, Catholic colleges and universities provide examples of both best practices and worst.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Institutions, Opinion, adjunct faculty, catholic colleges, unionization", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "It's contrary to Catholic social teaching and undermines the Church's religious liberty campaign.", "title": "Catholic colleges\u2019 hypocritical opposition to unions", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/05/25/catholic-colleges-hypocritical-opposition-to-unions/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEIU.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@directorsilk"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/05/25/catholic-colleges-hypocritical-opposition-to-unions/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/05/25/catholic-colleges-hypocritical-opposition-to-unions/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "It's contrary to Catholic social teaching and undermines the Church's religious liberty campaign."}, "article_summary": "The same can\u2019t be said about the resistance of some Catholic colleges and universities to the efforts of their adjunct faculty to unionize.\nAt this point, Catholic colleges and universities provide examples of both best practices and worst.\nWhat makes whited sepulchers of the anti-union Catholic colleges and universities is their pious claim that what they\u2019re really doing is defending religious freedom.\nAs a rule, non-union adjunct faculty make poverty-level wages and receive no health care or other benefits.\nPaying them a living wage with benefits increases the cost of doing business for colleges and universities."}
