Martin O'Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders planned to attend a public sit-down interview with journalist Jose Antonio Vargas in front of a left-leaning crowd here at the annual Netroots Nation conference, a gathering of progressives, when the tone of the program shifted just a few minutes into the event.\n\nO'Malley was answering questions from Vargas on stage when dozens of boisterous conference attendees flooded through a side door and shouted down the White House contender.\n\n\"What side are you on my people?\" they sang in unison as they approached.\n\nTia Oso of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, who represented the demonstrators, climbed onto the stage, secured a microphone, and delivered a speech while O'Malley looked on.\n\n\"We are going to hold this space. We are going to acknowledge the names of black women who have died in police custody. And Governor O'Malley, we do have questions for you ... As the leader of this nation, will you advance a racial justice agenda that will dismantle -- not reform, not make progress -- but will begin to dismantle structural racism in the United States?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" O'Malley replied, but before he could say more, the demonstrators in front of the stage shouted over him by reciting names of black women who have died in police custody. While they shouted, O'Malley stood in silence. At one point he turned to Oso on stage: \"My people came here as immigrants from Ireland.\"\n\nBelow, dozens shouted several chants in unison.\n\n\"Black lives matter! Black lives matter!\" they shouted toward O'Malley, and began a call-and-repeat rallying cry that activists have been using in the wake of the death of 28-year-old Sandra Bland, who died in police custody last week . \"If I die in police in custody!\" one of the chants went, \"Burn everything down! That's the only way mother******* like you listen!\"\n\nConference organizers begged them to allow O'Malley to respond.\n\nJUST WATCHED Meet the progressives who want Hillary to 'feel the Bern' Replay More Videos ...

He vowed to release a wide-ranging plan on criminal justice reform.\n\nThe demonstrators started shouting and booing again when O'Malley said: \"Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\"\n\nO'Malley later apologized for the remark s, telling This Week in Blackness, a digital news site, that he \"meant no disrespect\" to the black community.\n\n\"That was a mistake on my part and I meant no disrespect,\" O'Malley told the outlet. \"I did not understand the tremendous passion, commitment and feeling and depth of feeling that all of us should be attaching to this issue.\"\n\nAnd when he stepped off stage, he chanted, \"Black lives matter! Black lives matter!\"\n\nWhen Sanders approached the stage a moment later, the demonstrators continued. The candidate, a favorite of Netroots Nation, threatened to leave if they continued to interrupt him.\n\n\"Black lives, of course, matter. I spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity,\" he said. \"But if you don't want me to be here, that's OK. I don't want to outscream people.\"\n\nSanders proceeded to deliver his usual presidential stump speech over sporadic shouting from below.\n\nAfter talking over one another, Sanders eventually ditched pre-planned remarks and tried to address questions from demonstrators.\n\n\"Black people are dying in this country because we have a criminal justice system which is out of control, a system in which over 50% of young African-American kids are unemployed,\" Sanders said. \"It is estimated that a black baby born today has a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.\"\n\n16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests 16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests Demonstrators chant during a rally in downtown Manhattan on December 13.

Sanders, who is running as a more liberal alternative to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was one of the most highly anticipated speakers at the gathering. Hours before the event, excited supporters lined up to hear him speak, and some ran to secure seats close to the stage when organizers opened the doors.\n\nAttendees who were not part of the rally said they supported the protesters' message, but debated how it was carried out.\n\nConference organizers issued a statement following the townhall.\n\n\"Our aim was to give presidential candidates a chance to respond to the issues facing the many diverse communities represented here,\" Netroots Nation spokeswoman Mary Rickles said. \"Although we wish the candidates had more time to respond to the issues, what happened today is reflective of an urgent moment that America is facing today.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A town hall featuring Democratic presidential candidates was interrupted by dozens of demonstrators who shouted down the contenders.", "pubdate": "2015-07-18T23:22:04Z", "author": "Chris Moody, CNN Senior Digital Correspondent; Video by Jeremy Moorhead", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "A town hall featuring Democratic presidential candidates was interrupted by dozens of demonstrators who shouted down the contenders.", "pubdate": "2015-07-18T23:22:04Z", "title": "Demonstrators take over Dem candidate forum", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/bernie-sanders-netroots-nation-black-lives-matter/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150718185559-netroots-nation-martin-omalley-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150718185559-netroots-nation-martin-omalley-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-being-moody,art-vid-vls-col,col-being-moody", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/bernie-sanders-netroots-nation-black-lives-matter/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Demonstrators take over Dem candidate forum  - CNNPolitics.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/chrismoodycnn"}, "lastmod": "2015-07-19T18:11:07Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbea0\"", "article_summary": "16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests 16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests Demonstrators chant during a rally in downtown Manhattan on December 13.\nHide Caption 1 of 16 16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests Police arrest a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester on Saturday, December 20, in Bloomington, Minnesota.\n\"Black lives matter!\nHide Caption 8 of 16 16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests Demonstrators face off with police during a march in Chicago on December 13.\nBlack lives matter!\""}
