US Inc., said financing for medical projects has rarely been this strong.\n\n\u201cI would say there\u2019s just an unprecedented amount of capital chasing the sector right now,\u201d Effler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different financing available, whether it\u2019s banks, private equity or privately or publicly traded REITS, in the market. We\u2019ve done a lot of our projects with private capital and traditional bank lending sources.\u201d\n\nDevelopers or the health care institutions are often investing in properties, too. Ryan is building a 115,000-square-foot, $48 million specialty clinic for Park Nicollet at 15800 95th Ave. N. in Maple Grove. Park Nicollet will own the building and occupy much of it, he said.\n\nRyan is also among the investors, along with Bremer Bank, in a new 41,000-square-foot multitenant medical office building at 9360 Grove Circle N. in Maple Grove, Effler noted. The Grove Health West building, which is near the Maple Grove Hospital, will have Golden Valley-based Twin Cities Orthopedics as a tenant on the second floor and other providers on the first floor. \u201cLeasing is very positive and we expect to have tenants announced soon,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the big banks financing deals in this market are Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank; San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which has a long history in the region, and Charlotte, North Carolina-basedBank of America, said Chris Jacobson, an associate at Bloomington-based CBRE specializing in medical office development.\n\n\u201cIt really runs the gamut, from local lenders to insurance companies to national lenders who go after this kind of building,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good stable, long-term investment that\u2019s part of many lenders\u2019 platform.\u201d\n\nAn attractive market\n\nSo what do investors like about the medical office sector? Stephen Brown, executive director of the Healthcare Advisory Group for Bloomington-based Cushman & Wakefield/NorthMarq, points to health care reform. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is rewarding health care providers for better results and is encouraging consolidation, he said.\n\nKeeping people out of hospitals is expected to result in less expensive care delivered in attractive clinic environments that are more comfortable for doctors and patients. New clinics are also part of a plan to have patients receive all their health care at one clinic rather than several, potentially boosting per-patient revenue while locking them into a care system for all their needs.\n\n\u201cThis is the integrated care model, with everything under one roof,\u201d Brown said.\n\nColliers International\u2019s Medical Office Trends and 2014 Outlook report published earlier this year echoes the sense that the sector\u2019s shining light is far from dimming. The $2.47 billion spent on medical office transactions in the fourth quarter of last year was the \u201chighest since Q4 2006,\u201d according to the report. \u201c2014 should be a strong year, given scarcity of properties, availability of capital, and opportunities in secondary/tertiary markets.\u201d\n\nGene Cross, executive vice president of Minnesota Bank & Trust in Edina, has served as a lender on a number of medical office projects in the region, including a few refinancing projects. From a banker\u2019s perspective, he said, the market \u201cis very competitive\u201d with many lenders vying to finance medical office loans.\n\n\u201cIn this market, medical office is strong in part because it\u2019s not like other markets that have cyclicality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is great stability of cash flow and the reality is people are always needing medical care. It\u2019s definitely a growth area.\u201d\n\nDeveloper Mark Davis says he has a strong relationship with Wells Fargo, which has financed eight of his group\u2019s medical office projects, totaling 375,000 square feet, in the past four years.\n\n\u201cWe have a great relationship with them,\u201d said Davis, whose company owns or manages 1.1 million square feet of medical office space. \u201cInterest rates have been favorable. The only obstacle we\u2019ve seen is rising construction costs of 10 to 12 percent, which has offset a bit that lower interest rate.\u201d\n\nDevelopers see gold in the local market, too. Effler points out that he recently joined Ryan after working for an Ohio real estate investment trust because Ryan has begun to aggressively pursue the health care market. Ryan also hired Steve Stecker, formerly of Welsh Cos., to serve as division manager for health care.\n\nA closer look At deals\n\nTypically, medical office projects have a lead tenant that takes as much as 65 percent to 70 percent of the space, said Effler. It\u2019s rare to see a spec medical office building, he said, if only because finding an anchor tenant in today\u2019s market isn\u2019t hard.\n\nSometimes the lead tenant ends up taking all the space. The Davis Group\u2019s initial plan for the Minnetonka Medical Center called for the Robbinsdale-based North Memorial Health Care to lease 35,000 square feet. Then North Memorial asked for 42,000 square feet before simply taking the entire 63,000-square-foot building at 15400 Highway 7, Davis said.\n\nAlthough North Memorial isn\u2019t new to Minnetonka, it is new to that area of the city. Dr. J. Kevin Croston, chief medical officer for North Memorial, said his organization\u2019s thinking about the building evolved over time. North Memorial ultimately decided to lease all the space to offer a one-stop shop that will create strong clinic-patient relationships, he said.\n\nInvestors like the medical market not only because absorption for new buildings is relatively easy but also because tenants sign long-term leases of 10 to 15 years with renewable options equally as long, said Jacobson. In contrast a commercial office lease may run from three to seven years, on average.\n\nThe reason is the space is built to suit, and moving every five to seven years would be cost- prohibitive, Effler said. Tenant improvement allowances for medical offices tend to be high, so practices have to stay long enough to recoup their investments in that infrastructure, he said.\n\nThe lease rates also are slightly higher than office rents, although with some caveats. The C&W/NorthMarq Compass Report placed medical office rates in the region at $18 to the low $20s per square foot compared with $16 to $20 for Class A commercial space.\n\nStill, the construction costs of medical office projects are higher. Commercial spaces have open floor plans, while medical offices have many rooms and expensive heating, plumbing, cooling and electrical equipment, said Effler. Tenant improvement allowances are substantially more than a traditional office, he said, and the health care providers might pay only 25 percent to 50 percent of that cost in cash or financing.\n\nThat leaves the developer with the weight of tenant improvements that must be recaptured in higher lease rates, Effler said. So a medical office deal that might require $50 per square foot in tenant improvements results in a landlord paying half or more, he noted.\n\n\u201cI would not say medical office is more favorable because you can get higher rents than other spaces,\u201d he said. \u201cConstruction costs are higher.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The medical office market is exceptionally strong as health care systems consolidate and federal health care reform brings in new patients and begins to transform the way care is delivered.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Frank Jossi", "og": {"site_name": "Finance & Commerce", "description": "The medical office market is exceptionally strong as health care systems consolidate and federal health care reform brings in new patients and begins to transform the way care is delivered.", "title": "Lenders like strong pulse of medical office sector", "url": "http://finance-commerce.com/2014/10/lenders-like-strong-pulse-of-medical-office-sector/", "image": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2014/10/Minnetonka3x.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Lenders like strong pulse of medical office sectorFinance & Commerce", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "keywords": "affordable care act,bank of america,bremer bank,cbre,colliers international,compass report,cushman & wakefield/northmarq,davis group,lake elmo,minnesota bank & trust,minnetonka,minnetonka medical center,north memorial health care,park nicollet,reit,ryan cos. us inc.,twin cities orthopedics,u.s. bank,wells fargo,welsh cos.", "google-site-verification": "fsxlPNyjZwLPAj0KJhrcPjWL_3CXdi71oKBTOnATRU8", "thumbnail": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2014/10/Minnetonka3x-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb886\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn this market, medical office is strong in part because it\u2019s not like other markets that have cyclicality,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good stable, long-term investment that\u2019s part of many lenders\u2019 platform.\u201dAn attractive marketSo what do investors like about the medical office sector?\n\u201cI would not say medical office is more favorable because you can get higher rents than other spaces,\u201d he said.\nFrom a banker\u2019s perspective, he said, the market \u201cis very competitive\u201d with many lenders vying to finance medical office loans.\nStill, the construction costs of medical office projects are higher."}
