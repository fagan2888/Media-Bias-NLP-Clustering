But according to a paper by the Workers Compensation Research Institute, doctors in California and Illinois have found a new way to dispense drugs from their offices at two to three times the price charged by pharmacies.\n\nAs the Sacramento Bee reports, the mechanism involves ordering drugs in dosages different from those listed on federal schedules for limited reimbursement and then shifting patients to the new dosages with much higher markups.\n\nThe study focuses on three commonly used pain relievers that had been previously been dispensed in 5-miligram and 10-milligram dosages at low cost.\n\nAfter a 7-5-milligram dosage of the drug cyclobenzaprine was introduced in 2012, it was almost all dispensed by physicians at an average price of $3.79 per pill in Illinois. That compares to average prices for 5-miligram and 10-milligram cyclobenzaprine ranging from 99 cents to $1.74 per pill. (A common brand name for the drug is Flexeril.)\n\nIn California, physicians have been dispensing 7.5-milligram dosage cyclobenzaprine at a similar markup, according to the study, and it has become the most commonly dispensed strength of the drug.\n\n\u201cWhen prices are reduced by regulation, the regulated parties\u2015in this case physician-dispensers\u2015sometimes find new ways to retain the higher revenues they had prior to the reforms,\u201d Dr. Richard Victor, WCRI\u2019s executive director, said in a news release. \u201cAlthough this study uses data from two large states, it raises questions for all states where physician-dispensing prices are regulated.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2019s authors believe the shift in dosage was likely to be motivated by financial incentives rather than new evidence about superior medical practices.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some workers' comp octors have found a new way to dispense drugs from their offices at two to three times the price charged by pharmacies.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New Rules on Drugs Not Curbing Workers' Comp Costs\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-care\\/2015\\/01\\/new-rules-drugs-not-curbing-workers-comp-costs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-16 10:10:03\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-27 09:48:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":333473,\"author_id\":\"583\",\"author_name\":\"Matthew Heller\",\"author_display_name\":\"Matthew Heller\",\"tags\":[\"cyclobenzaprine\",\"Workers Compensation Research Institute\",\"Workers' compensation\"],\"categories\":[\"Corporate Finance\",\"Cost Management\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Health Care\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/01\\/Cyclobenzaprine10mg.png\"}", "author": "Matthew Heller", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Some workers' comp octors have found a new way to dispense drugs from their offices at two to three times the price charged by pharmacies.", "title": "New Rules on Drugs Not Curbing Workers' Comp Costs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/01/Cyclobenzaprine10mg.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-27T09:48:25+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-care/2015/01/new-rules-drugs-not-curbing-workers-comp-costs/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Some workers' comp octors have found a new way to dispense drugs from their offices at two to three times the price charged by pharmacies.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "New Rules on Drugs Not Curbing Workers' Comp Costs", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Care", "headline": "New Rules on Drugs Not Curbing Workers' Comp Costs", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20150116, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Supply Chain", "tag": "Workers' compensation", "published_time": "2015-01-16T10:10:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T09:48:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cyclobenzaprine, workers compensation research institute, workers' compensation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bb7\"", "article_summary": "Some workers' comp doctors have found a new way to dispense drugs from their offices at two to three times the price charged by pharmacies.\nEighteen states have adopted rules to reduce the costs of physician-dispensed drugs.\nIn a trend that may perplex self-insured companies trying to rein in workers\u2019 compensation costs, doctors who prescribe drugs from their offices are exploiting a loophole in new regulations designed to limit what they can charge for prescriptions, according to a new study.\nThat compares to average prices for 5-miligram and 10-milligram cyclobenzaprine ranging from 99 cents to $1.74 per pill.\nThe study focuses on three commonly used pain relievers that had been previously been dispensed in 5-miligram and 10-milligram dosages at low cost."}
