IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified that without additional funding the agency will struggle to assist taxpayers ahead of the tax filing deadline \u2013especially while adding what agency officials call the \u201cthe largest expansion of IRS responsibilities in recent history\u201d through Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned about the ability of the IRS to continue to fulfill its mission if the agency lacks adequate funding. Our current level of funding is clearly less than what the agency needs, especially to provide the level of taxpayer services the public has a right to expect,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nBeginning this year, the IRS will play a major role in carrying out Obamacare, including enforcing penalties on Americans who do not have health insurance after the March 31 deadline. In addition, the agency is charged with verifying whether people who were approved for subsidies actually qualify and then helping to distribute those billions of subsidy dollars to people who purchased coverage on the state and federal exchanges.\n\nThe agency\u2019s budget was cut for the fourth year in a row in the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed by President Obama. The agency was allocated $11.2 billion \u2013down from $12 billion for the 2013 fiscal year--a significant decline from the IRS\u2019s request Koskinen said the agency needs in order to collect tax revenue, prevent fraud and implement Obamacare.\n\nHowever, skeptical lawmakers pointed out that the IRS, which frequently says it is underfunded, doled out employee bonuses while the agency was the center of a scandal for allegedly targeting certain tax exempt groups.\n\n\u201cWhat I find unacceptable is that in this $11.3 billion appropriation that the IRS received this year, that you can't find the money to answer more than half the phone calls and yet you can find the money to pay $63 million in bonuses,\" Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.), the chairman of the subcommittee, said. \"It seems to be that might be a slap in the face to the taxpayers.\"\n\nThe IRS also spent $60 million over 3 years on employee conferences, and an additional $2.2 million on training videos in 2012.\n\nRelated: Confused IRS Tax Rules Threaten Obamacare Rollout\n\nKoskinen stressed that the agency is already experiencing challenges to assist taxpayers, including long call and wait times at the hundreds of tax centers scattered around the country.\n\nWithout additional funding, he said the IRS is likely to miss 18 million taxpayer calls and billions of dollars in revenues through audits and enforcement actions\u2014especially the new revenue needed for Obamacare\u2019s implementation.\n\nObamacare advocates worry that if the public hears that the IRS isn't prepared to enforce new provisions like the individual mandate, some may risk opting out of coverage if they believe the threat of receiving a penalty is not serious. That could be problematic for the White House, which is counting on young and healthy people to sign up for coverage in order to offset the cost of care for older, sicker individuals.\n\n\u201cI now think there is little hope we are going to get enough younger healthy people to sign up, and that means that this law is in grave danger of financial collapse,\u201d Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe concern over the IRS is nothing new. Last March, J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, warned in March that the IRS was already overwhelmed by the new responsibilities.\n\nAt the time, George predicted the agency would experience a massive surge in demand for assistance, especially with regard to confusion over the new law\u2019s mandates, at already busy call and walk-in tax help centers.\n\n\u201cUnless the IRS receives additional resources in order to implement the ACA (Affordable Care Act), they truly -- it's a zero-sum game,\u201d George told a House Appropriations subcommittee. \u201cThey're going to have to make very difficult choices in terms of customer service, in terms of enforcement, in order to take on this huge responsibility that they have been presented with,\" George said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The cash-strapped Internal Revenue Service \u2013hugely crucial to Obamacare\u2019s implementati", "title": "Why the Cash-Strapped IRS Isn\u2019t Ready for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/03/Why-Cash-Strapped-IRS-Isn-t-Ready-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/03/Why-Cash-Strapped-IRS-Isn-t-Ready-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The cash-strapped Internal Revenue Service \u2013hugely crucial to Obamacare\u2019s implementati", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2963\"", "article_summary": "The IRS also spent $60 million over 3 years on employee conferences, and an additional $2.2 million on training videos in 2012.\n\u201cI am deeply concerned about the ability of the IRS to continue to fulfill its mission if the agency lacks adequate funding.\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified that without additional funding the agency will struggle to assist taxpayers ahead of the tax filing deadline \u2013especially while adding what agency officials call the \u201cthe largest expansion of IRS responsibilities in recent history\u201d through Obamacare.\nRelated: Confused IRS Tax Rules Threaten Obamacare RolloutKoskinen stressed that the agency is already experiencing challenges to assist taxpayers, including long call and wait times at the hundreds of tax centers scattered around the country.\nRelated: Is the Embattled IRS the Next Obamacare Nightmare?"}
