That's something to be proud of. If you're looking for some ways to show your Native pride -- and share your Native culture -- here are 10 ideas that might help.\n\n1. Learn Your Language\n\nNothing quite connects you to your heritage like speaking the way your ancestors did. The English language, after all, is an imposition of colonialism and (we can admit) necessary to get along in this world -- we need it to buy groceries, pay our taxes, tell the doctor where it hurts. But that, in a way, makes Native language all the more special: Feeling it on the tongue, letting it loose in conversation, writing it on the page -- it's an act and an activity that is a pure transaction with something so many people are content to let go.\n\n2. Make a Statement\n\nThere's something completely superficial to a t-shirt -- and yet there is an art to the sloganeering. Think of today's Native t-shirt artists as Native Mad Men: They're bringing a message to the masses that needs to make its impact in seconds. It may be ironic, it may be humorous, it may be in-your-face, but it has to be clear. Deejay NDN of A Tribe Called Red caused controversy with his \"Caucasians\" t-shirt -- he also caused some people to think again about the Cleveland Indians mascot. (He also gave the t-shirt-makers more business than they could handle.)
