A weekend-long convention dedicated to all things erotic winds down Sunday evening with the Fetish Foot Party, one last walk down the Kinky Red Carpet and the annual Fetish Ball and Bash.

Fetish Con, a trade show dedicated to burlesque, bondage and BDSM, was held again this year beneath the sparkling lights of the main ballroom at the downtown Hilton hotel.

Hundreds of people — many of them dressed for the risque occasion — perused the booths, attended lectures and workshops, experienced the private dungeon play space and went for a dip at the “Pervy Pool Party.” Vendors sold everything from corsets and kilts to studded collars and whips and paddles.

“Everybody is here to have a great time,” said Lee Garvin, who runs an Atlanta-based corset design company called Marvelous Mayhem. He takes his business to about 20 different fetish conventions across the country every year, and said Tampa’s is one of the friendliest.

People come to buy and play, he said.

“Tampa is one of our better shows,” Garvin said.
