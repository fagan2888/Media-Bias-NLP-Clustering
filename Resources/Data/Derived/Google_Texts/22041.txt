Child care costs up under Liberals: Ellis

Labor frontbencher Kate Ellis says families have every right to be angry about the rising cost of child care when the federal government went to the last election promising to make it more affordable.

She was responding to a News Corp report that a family on an income of $155,000 a year is paying an extra $7400 for child care for two children since the coalition came to power in 2013.

"This government is set to go a full term without doing a single thing to help families with the cost of child care, and this simply isn’t good enough," Ms Ellis said on Sunday.

But Education Minister Simon Birmingham says it is the opposition that is standing in the way of child care reforms that will benefit around one million families.

He said Labor is not only standing in the way of savings that will pay for the additional $3 billion investment in child care but is opposing a policy that will address the mistakes it made in government that just tinkered around the edges.

He said Labor’s 2008 increase in the child care rebate from 30 to 50 per cent, without a check on what centres could charge, led to rapid increases in prices for both families and taxpayers.

"Labor’s failed policy continues to slug Australian families with increased costs of child care even while they oppose the Turnbull government’s essential reforms," Senator Birmingham said in a statement.
