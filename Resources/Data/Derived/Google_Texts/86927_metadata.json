The case was brought by a California teacher who argues forcing her to pay dues that could be used for political purposes violates her First Amendment rights.\n\nIf you thought the court had made a final decision last year when it allowed for-profit companies to opt out of Obamacare requirements based on religious reasons -- think again. Now, several religious affiliated institutions say the law's process for opting out of a requirement to pay for contraception violates their religious beliefs.\n\nThe Supreme Court could also take up a case that requires abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospitals.\n\nWidener University Commonwealth Law School Professor Michael Dimino appears on Tuesday's Smart Talk to preview the fall session.", "article_metadata": {"date": "Oct 13, 2015", "description": "Tuesday's Smart Talk previews the fall session on the U.S. Supreme Court.", "copyright": "WITF,Inc.", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2015/10/smart-talk-previewing-supreme-court-session.php", "twitter": {"description": "Tuesday's Smart Talk previews the fall session on the U.S. Supreme Court.", "title": "Smart Talk: Previewing Supreme Court session", "image": {"src": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2015/10/U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20600%20x%20340-thumb-600x340-21855.jpg"}, "creator": "@witfnews", "site": "@witfnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "a0ab0edf38b22322d1aeb144003b161c"}, "keywords": "abortion, affirmative action, michael dimino, widener university commonwealth law school", "article": {"section": "Smart Talk", "published_time": "2015-10-13T09:20:00-5:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T10:35:17-5:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "witf.org", "description": "Tuesday's Smart Talk previews the fall session on the U.S. Supreme Court.", "title": "Smart Talk: Previewing Supreme Court session", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2015/10/smart-talk-previewing-supreme-court-session.php", "image": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2015/10/U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20600%20x%20340-thumb-600x340-21855.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "abortion, affirmative action, michael dimino, widener university commonwealth law school"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court could also take up a case that requires abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospitals.\nWidener University Commonwealth Law School Professor Michael Dimino appears on Tuesday's Smart Talk to preview the fall session.\nSmart Talk airs live every week day at 9 a.m. on WITF\u2019s 89.5 and 93.3.\nListen to Smart Talk live online from 9-10 a.m. weekdays and at 7 p.m. (Repeat of 9 a.m. program) Host: Scott LaMarWhat to look for on Smart Talk Tuesday, October 13, 2015:The words \"deeply-divided\" seem to precede any mention of the U.S. Supreme Court in media reports in the last few years.\nAmong the cases the court will consider is whether states can compel public employees to pay union dues."}
