Sam Brownback \u2013 the supply side Republican who made his reputation by slashing income taxes in hopes of boosting his state\u2019s economy -- now finds himself on the wrong side of the tax issue.\n\nWith his state facing large deficits because of a chronic deficiency in tax revenues brought on by the governor\u2019s zealous tax cuts shortly after taking office, Brownback reluctantly asked the state legislature to raise sales and cigarette taxes to help close a yawning budget deficit. Without it, he warned, the state would have to make deep and dangerous cuts to schools, prison and other programs.\n\nRelated: Their \u2018No-New-Taxes\u2019 Vow is Now Haunting the GOP\n\nBrownback and senior aides met with Republican legislators Thursday afternoon and laid out a grim scenario unless the state figured out a way to balance the budget by Monday, one that included a likely downgrade of the state\u2019s bond ratings.\n\n\u201cYou've just got to act,\" Brownback said. \"I'm pleading with you, really, to just one more time, just get in the saddle.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled House responded by voting 95 to 20 against the governor\u2019s tax increase -- an extraordinary repudiation of Brownback. But by the early hours of Friday morning, those lawmakers had second thoughts, and finally voted to accept the tax increase plan.\n\nWith the concurrence of the state Senate, the legislature approved $384 million in new revenue for the coming fiscal year, including an increase of the sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent and an increase in the cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack to $1.29.\n\nRelated: States Keep Using Gimmicks to \u2018Balance\u2019 Their Budgets\n\nIt would be easy to say that Brownback got his comeuppance after years of experimentation with tax policy that for many defied logic and did little to improve the economy or create new jobs.\n\nBrownback, a former U.S. senator, rose to power promising to slash taxes, downsize government and spur economic growth. A handful of conservative governors, including Brownback and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, have for years promoted supply-side tax cuts as an elixir for the economy -- one that can actually increase revenues.\n\nBrimming with confidence that he could provide \u201ca shot of adrenaline\u201d to his state\u2019s economy, Brownback pushed through a major state tax overhaul in 2012 and 2013. It included a 25 percent reduction in the top income tax rates and tax cuts on various types of income.\n\nBut there were numerous warning signs that state revenues were running far behind projections, and that a fiscal crisis was on the horizon. In the months leading up to his reelection last fall, Brownback repeatedly dismissed or downplayed state reports and analyses showing that his tax cut strategy was cutting into the flow of state tax revenues and driving up the deficit.\n\nRelated: Brownback Feeling Big Political Backlash to Tax Cuts in Kansas\n\nIn late January, however, a seemingly chastened Brownback proposed a slowdown in income tax cuts \u2014 plus major tax increases on tobacco and liquor \u2014 as part of fixing a budget shortfall projected at $648 million for the next fiscal year. The proposal was similar to one from his Democratic opponent last fall.\n\nYet even after a humiliating few days of having to beg the legislature to go along with a huge increase in tax revenues, Brownback appears to be unfazed. He argues that Kansas will still have \"pro-growth\" economic policies if it preserves most of the income tax cuts he helped pass, even with increases in the sales and cigarette taxes.\n\n\"Nationally, Kansas is not the model any state is looking to follow right now,\" Joseph Henchman, a vice president at the Washington-based Tax Foundation, told the AP. \"What have you gained if you've cut taxes and the state becomes insolvent?\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kansas Gov.", "title": "Brownback Finds Himself on Wrong Side of a Tax Hike", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/14/Brownback-Finds-Himself-Wrong-Side-Tax-Hike", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR4CVCP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/14/Brownback-Finds-Himself-Wrong-Side-Tax-Hike", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR4CVCP.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kansas Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe217a\"", "article_summary": "It included a 25 percent reduction in the top income tax rates and tax cuts on various types of income.\nThe Republican-controlled House responded by voting 95 to 20 against the governor\u2019s tax increase -- an extraordinary repudiation of Brownback.\nBut by the early hours of Friday morning, those lawmakers had second thoughts, and finally voted to accept the tax increase plan.\nSam Brownback \u2013 the supply side Republican who made his reputation by slashing income taxes in hopes of boosting his state\u2019s economy -- now finds himself on the wrong side of the tax issue.\nYet even after a humiliating few days of having to beg the legislature to go along with a huge increase in tax revenues, Brownback appears to be unfazed."}
