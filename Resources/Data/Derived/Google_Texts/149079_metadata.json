I\u2019m still scratching my head over sticker #1:\n\nBut can Obama\u2019s team not be aware that the phrase came from a vulgar Saturday Night Live parody starring Seth Rogen (120 million hits on YouTube)? The list of activities of the boss in the song is unbelievably gross \u2013 not exactly presidential. One of the least offensive lines is about bombing the Russians. Maybe the Obama team thought it would make Putin realize how tough Obama is.\n\nFurthermore, unless you\u2019re a government employee, Obama is a public servant, not a boss. We the people are the boss; dictators and tyrants are bosses of their citizens.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, how many people like their boss? The word has pejorative connotations for most working stiffs, which would be less of an issue for the 92 million Americans out of the workforce. These are synonyms in my thesaurus for the verb \u201cto boss\u201d:\n\nOrder around, dictate to, lord it over, bully, push around, domineer, dominate, pressurize, browbeat; call the shots for, lay down the law on, bulldoze, walk all over, railroad.\n\nMaybe he\u2019s like a Mafia boss? A union boss? Boss Tweed?\n\nAnd doesn\u2019t Obama look peevish in the photo? He must be angry at those people over in the government who keep causing all these inexcusable scandals.\n\nSurely this must be the work of a conservative who infiltrated democrats.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/05/like_a_boss.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Like a Boss?"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Furthermore, unless you\u2019re a government employee, Obama is a public servant, not a boss.\nThe list of activities of the boss in the song is unbelievably gross \u2013 not exactly presidential.\nWe the people are the boss; dictators and tyrants are bosses of their citizens.\nBoss Tweed?\nWhat\u2019s more, how many people like their boss?"}
