It wasn’t enough Friday night, but Colorado wide receiver Nelson Spruce was again keen on carving up Colorado State’s defense — and the hearts of Rams fans.

A year after catching eight passes for 99 yards against CSU, Spruce produced two splendid touchdowns to account for the Buffaloes’ only touchdowns in their 31-17 loss to Colorado State.

Spruce beat CSU defensive back DeAndre Elliott both times. The first was a 54-yard reception on a deep flag route — the second longest of his career — for a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. The other was a 12-yard, one-handed catch in the corner of the end zone that gave CU a 17-7 lead in the third quarter.

That lead crumbled, as CSU took over with its ground game. CSU’s defense stiffened from that point and harassed CU quarterback Sefo Liufau into several poor throws.

Spruce had 81 yards on five catches after three quarters.

Spruce had combined for 99 receptions the previous two years against CSU while serving as a complementary receiver to Paul Richardson, now with the Seattle Seahawks. Spruce is now CU’s go-to receiver, and he played the part to near perfection in the latest Rocky Mountain Showdown.

Trouble is, he had little help on offense as the Buffs could not maintain a ground game, and CSU’s coverage blanketed other receivers.

Spruce also plays a big role in punt returns and was outstanding in that role, too.
