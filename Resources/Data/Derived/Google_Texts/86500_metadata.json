He hasn\u2019t thrown in nine days, but is pleased with how his shoulder feels following rest and stretching exercises.\n\n\u201cIt feels really good. I threw a little medicine ball, a small one, and it felt fine today,\u201d Chacin said. \u201cI am going to be OK. It\u2019s definitely getting better.\u201d\n\nChacin admitted that the true barometer will be when he throws hard from a distance and, with no setbacks, off the mound. However, he\u2019s noticed an important difference over the past week.\n\n\u201cBefore even when I was just home, my biceps felt tight and stiff,\u201d Chacin said. \u201cIt feels really loose now (as he swung his arm to illustrate it). It\u2019s a lot better. It\u2019s good. Everything is really good so far.\u201d\n\nChacin hopes to be ready for opening day, though that\u2019s a longshot given the ground he has to make up. He is roughly three weeks behind the other starters, so it\u2019s more likely that he will be ready in mid-April after he builds up arm strength. The Rockies are taking a conservative approach, as manager Walt Weiss explained, looking at \u201cthe big picture, not opening day.\u201d\n\nFootnotes\n\nReliever Adam Ottavino added a tattoo this winter. He has the number 0 inked on the left side of his left wrist. It is barely an inch in size and purposely difficult to see. \u2026 Left-hander Brett Anderson can\u2019t escape the American League West. The former Oakland pitcher will make his Rockies debut Monday against the Seattle Mariners.
