This weekend's Historic Midtown Tour was ransacked by thieves.

Wichita police are looking for the event's utility cart and dozens of signs that were inside. Organizers say it was stolen just hours before the home showcase on Saturday morning.

For the past 42 years, the Historic Midtown Tour has showcased homes built at the turn of the 20th century. From distinguished railings to elegant living rooms -- the goal is to preserve Wichita's most coveted neighborhoods.

"The Midtown Tour is something that fundraises for our community," said event organizer Makayla Welch. "We do a scholarship every year, we reinvest the funds into the neighborhood."

This year those funds will likely have to go toward replacing a cart and dozens of signs stolen from in front of North High School, together worth thousands of dollars.

"We were really disappointed in the neighborhood that this could happen because we really want to show people a different side of this area of town," said Welch.

Police don't have any suspects, but earlier that morning, nearby resident Mike Safarik says his surveillance cameras captured an attempted break-in.

"I just so happened to look up at the camera just to have a couple of guys come up to my car, tried the car door and kept on walking down the street," said Safarik.

He believes the two could be connected and notified police right away.

"Obviously there were people running around the neighborhood looking for something to steal," said Safarik.

While officers investigate and the tour wraps up, for event organizers it's not just about catching the bad guys, it's about getting their items back that help them celebrate the history behind the homes.

"Park it some place and no harm no foul, we don't need to ask any questions."

Organizers say the utility cart is yellow without a top and has a storage area in the back that was holding the signs. If you know of its whereabouts, you're asked to call 911.
