Renee Reopell, a healthcare navigator, presented information about the Affordable Care Act and the exchange in New York at the Community Board 6 meeting in Kew Gardens last Wednesday. Her aim was to explain the system and how to sign up for health insurance through the website.\n\nShe stressed that the New York Health Benefit Exchange or marketplace is different than the federal website.\n\n\u201cFortunately you do not have to sign up on the federal site,\u201d she said.\n\nIf a person is already insured through their employer, that person does not need to use the New York Health Exchange, unless the benefits do not meet the minimum requirement.\n\nAlso, if a person uses Social Security, that individual should continue to use Social Security, rather than the NY Health Benefit Exchange.\n\nFor those who should use the NY Health Benefit Exchange, the enrollment period opened on Oct. 1, 2013 and will remain open until March 31, 2014. After that a person will receive a financial penalty.\n\n\u201cThe online marketplace is a one-stop shop to see what subsidizes you are eligible for,\u201d Reopell said.\n\nA person can enroll in individual/family healthcare, Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the small business coverage.\n\nIn order to be a health plan offered on the website it must be a \u201cqualified health plan,\u201d meaning it must cover all essential health benefits assigned by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPlans that do not meet these standards can exist for another 11 months.\n\nWhen choosing between each plan, there are four \u201cmetal levels\u201d to choose from: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. As premiums increase, out-of-pocket costs decrease.\n\n\u201cPlatinum plan you play more each month, but your insurance company picks more of the bill,\u201d Reopell said.\n\nThe decision between metal levels is up to the patron.\n\nApplicants can choose which provider they will use and then the level.\n\nPlans will be available for side-by-side comparison, where applicants can compare up to three plans at a time.\n\nFinancial assistance is in available in two forms. Advanced premium tax credit will reduce the cost of premiums for those earning less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $45,960 a year for an individual and $94,200 a year for a family of four. A tax credit may be used toward the premium, or individuals could receive a cash refund.\n\nThe cost-sharing reductions will lower co-payments and deductibles for those earning less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level for individuals \u2013 $28,725 a year for individuals and $ 58,875 a year for a family of four.\n\nWhen applicants submit information about income on the website they can see which subsidies they will.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act, they only look at your income, instead of other factors such as owning a car, owning a home, 401k, savings and more said Reopell.\n\nThere is a non-discrimination policy when it comes to charging. This means a plan cannot charge more based on a preexisting condition or a person\u2019s sex, according to the marketplace website.\n\nPrior to this, the argument was \u201cwomen tend to use their health insurance more so they are being charged more. That is now illegal,\u201d said Reopell.\n\nReopell also said, \u201cYou need a Social Security number to get insurance.\u201d Those who are \u201cundocumented are excluded from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompanies on the Marketplace can vary costs based on your age, where you live in the state, and your tobacco use,\u201d according to WebMD.\n\nFor more information, go to https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov.\n\nBy Kerry Goleski", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabbe\"", "article_summary": "In order to be a health plan offered on the website it must be a \u201cqualified health plan,\u201d meaning it must cover all essential health benefits assigned by the Affordable Care Act.\nShe stressed that the New York Health Benefit Exchange or marketplace is different than the federal website.\nThe New York online Health Benefit Exchange has been a point of confusion for many.\nFor those who should use the NY Health Benefit Exchange, the enrollment period opened on Oct. 1, 2013 and will remain open until March 31, 2014.\nIf a person is already insured through their employer, that person does not need to use the New York Health Exchange, unless the benefits do not meet the minimum requirement."}
