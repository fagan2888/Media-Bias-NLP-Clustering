Courtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film & Television Limited 2014 for Masterpiece\n\nThis week\u2019s episode of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d featured Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) attending a London dress show in which she got to gaze upon dazzling, of-the-moment beaded gowns. And to quote Lady Mary, that scene was the sole \u201cyummy\u201d moment of the entire hour \u2013 because the rest of the episode was quite depressing, to say the least.\n\nTrue, there was a proposal, and Violet, the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith), revealed the depth of her relationship with Prince Kuragin (Rade Sherbedgia), but otherwise, this episode was beset with friction between loved ones.\n\nLove, Downton Style\n\nEven in the cases of happy news, like Lord Merton\u2019s (Douglas Reith) romance-tinged proposal to Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton), the reality of the situation still casts a gloomy pall over the proceedings. Since Isobel never expected Lord Merton to bring love into it, she\u2019s now exhibiting doubts over her already-planned refusal. My advice? See how you two feel calling each other \u201cDickie\u201d and \u201cIsobel\u201d first before making any rash decisions.\n\nMichelle Dockery as Lady Mary and Samantha Bond as Aunt Rosamund. Courtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film & Television Limited 2014 for Materpiece\n\nIsobel\u2019s BFF Violet is dealing with her own maelstrom of emotions this episode \u2013 feelings she\u2019s kept bottled up for 50 years. Following a visit to the dreary York church basement where Prince Kuragin and his fellow refugees spend their days, Violet confides her borderline inappropriate past to Isobel: Back in 1874, he had asked Violet to run away with him. But, in a crisis of conscience right out of \u201cPeggy Sue Got Married,\u201d Violet opted to stay with her husband when he presented her with a Faberg\u00e9 frame with photos of her children as a not-so-subtle reminder of her familial obligations. She seems to have made peace with her decision, but there\u2019s a sadness that envelops Violet throughout the episode. Even when she tries to use her imperious tone to persuade Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) to let both Michael Gregson and little Marigold go, giving the excuse that what is in Edith\u2019s best interest is also in the family\u2019s best interest, Edith summarily shoots her down. So since Violet can\u2019t change the past, but obviously still harbors strong feelings for her lost prince, she decides the most honorable thing to do is to assist Kuragin in locating his missing wife, the Princess Irina.\n\nTom Cullen as Lord Gillingham and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary. ourtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film & Television Limited 2014 for Masterpiece\n\nMake Up, Break Up, Everything Is Shake Up\n\nMary\u2019s stylish sojourn in London this episode was a procrastination of the inevitable: She was in town to break things off with Lord Gillingham (Tom Cullen), but ended up reconnecting with her other suitor, Charles Blake (Julian Ovenden), at the aforementioned dress show. The Cleopatra headdresses and boyish fashions (Mary upon viewing a grey and black suit complete with men\u2019s necktie: \u201cGolly! That\u2019d be useful!\u201d) only serve to distract Mary for a handful of minutes before Charles introduces his companion, Mabel Lane Fox (Catherine Steadman), a.k.a. Tony Gillingham\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e. Mabel\u2019s catty remarks (\u201cIt\u2019s not often you meet the woman you were jilted for\u201d) don\u2019t do much for Mary\u2019s confidence, but after an ego-boosting dinner with Charles that evening, Mary gets up the courage to tell Tony the next morning that she won\u2019t marry him.\n\nWell, so much for Mary\u2019s revolutionary behavior of the past couple of weeks, because it\u2019s still 1924, she\u2019s still an aristocrat, and Tony isn\u2019t taking no for an answer. Channeling the Dowager Countess, Tony refuses to believe that a \u201clady\u201d such as Mary \u201ccould give herself to a man without first being certain that he was the one.\u201d What\u2019s worse, the more Mary speaks the truth to their relationship, the more Tony wants to ignore the facts and continue on with the fa\u00e7ade that they are perfectly happy. You\u2019d think that upon hearing, \u201cI feel I\u2019ve sort of woken up out of a dream\u201d would be emasculating enough for Tony to hitch up what little pride he had left and walk away. But, no, now he plans to drag this out for as long as it takes. \u201cThis is something we have to get through \u2013 together,\u201d he tells a disillusioned Mary. Because remember, there\u2019s no sleeping around on \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d without consequences!\n\nRichard E. Grant as Simon Bricker and Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, Countess of Grantham Courtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film & Television Limited 2014 for Masterpiece\n\nGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner?\n\nAll three of this week\u2019s Downton Abbey house and dinner guests are instrumental in the ongoing tension throughout the household, but at the same time, they each embody the changing spirit of the times. So one has to wonder if Cora, Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), is deliberately trying to drag her antediluvian husband kicking and screaming into the 20th century by bringing in a steady stream of visitors who are certain to make him blow his perfectly starched collar off. The first guest is Lady Rose MacClare\u2019s (Lily James) father, Lord \u201cShrimpy\u201d Flintshire (Peter Egan), who has returned to England to announce his impending divorce from his shrew of a wife, Susan. Robert, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), of course, is none too keen on Shrimpy bringing the stigma of divorce into the family, but Shrimpy reminds his cousin-in-law that life cannot thrive on loyalty and duty, and that sometimes just living apart isn\u2019t an option: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever been as unhappy as I am, you\u2019d know why not.\u201d Come on, Robert, even Violet knows how awful Rose\u2019s mother is: \u201cSusan has been in a rage since she was playing with her dolls.\u201d\n\nLady Grantham is certainly playing with fire with her second guest, Simon Bricker (Richard E. Grant), but at the same time, as we discovered last week, she\u2019s getting a little sick of her husband\u2019s dismissive behavior and is need of some attention. When she asks Lord Grantham to school her on the impending real estate offer he and Mary and Tom Branson (Allen Leech) are mulling over, Robert flat out ignores her. Who cares if Simon winds up being the guest that wouldn\u2019t leave? At least he\u2019s giving Cora the opportunity for intellectual conversation, even if their art discussions are dotted with flirtatious compliments about Lady Grantham\u2019s beauty. I can\u2019t blame Cora for keeping Simon around \u2013 watching Lord Grantham seethe with jealousy is almost as entertaining as Lady Mary\u2019s London dress show.\n\nBut it\u2019s the third Downton guest who is responsible for this week\u2019s climactic scene, as well as making Lord Grantham finally crack under the pressure of the changing times. Sarah Bunting (Daisy Lewis) somehow manages to wrangle another invitation to dinner, and despite a heart-to-heart talk with Tom beforehand, in which he implores her to play it cool, she still ends up causing a major scene and promptly gets herself banned from Downton Abbey. Again, Sarah is on the right side of history here (\u201cI can\u2019t bear to see you waste your life propping up a system that\u2019s dying,\u201d she tells Tom), but her behavior at dinner is downright obnoxious. She goads Lord Grantham into an argument about her tutoring sessions with Daisy Mason (Sophie McShera), giving him a hard time about not knowing Daisy\u2019s name (which, to be fair, he didn\u2019t) and suggesting that Lord Grantham thinks Daisy\u2019s studies are a waste of time. Eventually, Daisy is summoned to the dining room, where she sings Sarah\u2019s praises to Lord Grantham, happy that her newfound education provides her with \u201cchoices\u201d now.\n\nSarah\u2019s failing here, however, is even when she\u2019s \u201cwon\u201d an argument, she can\u2019t let it rest. Once Daisy is back downstairs and Lord Grantham has stated for the record that he is \u201cpleased\u201d his assistant cook is enjoying her studies, Sarah pushes her host\u2019s patience even further by asking, \u201cAre you [pleased]?\u201d Even Mary\u2019s demand that Sarah \u201clet it go\u201d doesn\u2019t do anything to deter Sarah from driving a bulldozer at full speed into whatever relationship she and Tom might have at this point. \u201cAll I\u2019ve proved is that Lord Grantham would like us serfs to stay in our allotted place from cradle to grave.\u201d Robert\u2019s subsequent temper tantrum and decree that Sarah never set foot inside Downton again are understandable \u2013 albeit short-lived, with Lord Grantham apologizing for his outburst to Tom later on \u2013 but what\u2019s more important is why Tom chooses to keep Sarah around. \u201cSince Sybil died,\u201d he tells Mary and Lord Grantham, \u201cI\u2019d forgotten what it\u2019s like to be with someone who feels about things as I do. That\u2019s why, or, that\u2019s been why.\u201d From that statement, I\u2019d say Tom\u2019s rebound has served her purpose.\n\nStray Observations\n\n\u2013 Edith, who spends the episode stalking Marigold and the Drewe family, looks like she may have some closure regarding Michael Gregson in an upcoming episode. Gregson\u2019s office informed her that the \u201cleader\u201d of the \u201cbrown shirts\u201d gang responsible for beating up her baby daddy will be going on trial in Munich. \u201cLeader\u201d=Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u2013 Things aren\u2019t looking too good for Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt). After she delivered a letter to Lord Gillingham from Lady Mary, Anna strolled over to Piccadilly Circus \u2013 where she just happened to stop at the exact spot where Gillingham\u2019s valet, Alex Green, was murdered. It appears innocent enough, but what she didn\u2019t know was that she was followed by a plainclothes police officer who patrols the area around Lord Gillingham\u2019s residence. And now Sgt. Willis\u2019s (Howard Ward) interest in the Bates couple is piqued even further.\n\n\u2013 Whether it\u2019s intentional or not, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d continues its self-parody streak this week, with two scenes clearly influenced by the \u201cLate Night With Jimmy Fallon\u201d satire, \u201cDownton Sixbey.\n\n\u2013 Lord Grantham\u2019s episode-closing speech about how \u201cWe will build, we\u2019ll even make money for the estate. But we won\u2019t destroy what people love about this place\u201d is weirdly reminiscent of Fallon\u2019s recurring \u201cSixbey\u201d line, \u201cHave I ever told you how much I love this place? I hope I die hee-aaahh.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The scene between the sickly, sunken-eyed Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier) and Phyllis Baxter (Raquel Cassidy), in which she deduces his recent trip to London wasn\u2019t to visit his sick father, but instead to obtain a treatment to cure his homosexuality. Just the way the scene is shot, with Baxter at the servants\u2019 table, her pained face turned away from Barrow, and the under-butler hanging in the doorway puffing on his cigarette \u2013 it\u2019s so overly dramatic that any credibility it had as a serious scene is destroyed.\n\n\u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 airs on \u2018Masterpiece\u2019 on PBS, Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.
