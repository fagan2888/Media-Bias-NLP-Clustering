This Friday on Match Day \u2014 when all physicians-to-be learn where they'll spend a minimum of the next three years in training \u2014 Erie can afford only six medical residents instead of its usual eight.\n\n\"The doctor shortage is real,\" said Dr. Diane Wayne, vice dean for education at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. What's happening at Erie is an example of the erosion of support for graduate medical education overall, she said. \"While they may be the first affected, they certainly won't be the last.\"\n\nThe nation could face a shortage of 46,000 to 90,000 physicians by 2025, according to a report released this month by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Aging baby boomers, a larger pool of insured Americans because of the Affordable Care Act and almost a third of all physicians reaching retirement age in the next decade all contribute to a rapidly rising need.\n\nThe federal government provides $15 billion annually \u2014 mostly through Medicare \u2014 to help fund residencies, crucial on-the-job training for doctors. Despite an increase in demand for doctors, the number of Medicare-supported residencies has not increased since 1997, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nCity looking to turn empty convent into home for homeless mothers City looking to turn empty convent into home for homeless mothers.

Without an extension, the money is set to run out in October.\n\nThe loss of two residents at Erie translates to 3,600 fewer patient visits over the course of their training period, said Dr. Deborah Edberg, director of Erie's family medicine residency program, a partnership with Feinberg School of Medicine and Norwegian American Hospital.\n\n\"The situation is extremely dire,\" Edberg said. \"We're just waiting for something to save us.\"\n\nErie is one of 60 Teaching Health Center programs across the country and the only such site in Illinois, according to HHS. The clinic treats mostly the working poor, many of whom have not seen a doctor in years. Patients struggle with a constellation of chronic conditions, such as hypertension, asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Although there are other health providers in the city for low-income people, Erie offers patients a wide range of preventive care with their own doctors, so diseases can be managed before they become crises.\n\nIf the clinic didn't exist, patients could end up in emergency rooms, where their problems would be more acute and the tab far more expensive, said Dr. Fitz Mullan, professor of public health policy and pediatrics at George Washington University.\n\n\"It's been demonstrated over and over that good community care not only gets better outcomes, but makes good use of taxpayers' money,\" he said.\n\nThe Teaching Health Center program also is an investment in the future, advocates say. More than 90 percent of physicians in the program nationwide are likely to practice in underserved areas when they graduate, compared with less than 25 percent from traditional residency programs, according to a new report co-authored by Mullan.\n\nEven with precarious funding, 80-hour weeks, hefty school loans and more modest earning potential for primary-care doctors compared with specialists, about 980 medical students from around the world applied to Erie's residency program this year. Of that pool, almost 80 candidates came to Chicago for interviews before the list was pared to a mere six, Edberg said. Without a residency, newly minted graduates are unable to practice medicine.\n\n\"It was just heartbreaking to make these decisions. We just agonized over who we could keep,\" Edberg said. It takes about $150,000 a year to train a resident, which goes for a variety of expenses, from salaries to examining rooms.\n\n\"Here we've come up with a solution for workforce issues. We have a successful program that virtually guarantees physicians will go into and stay in primary care, working in the most vulnerable areas in the country ... and we're going to allow it to be dismantled.\"\n\nThe Teaching Health Center program in Fresno, Calif., for example, is ending this year, which Mullan called \"a mind-bending catastrophe.\"\n\n\"Three years ago we were boldly ramping up, and now we're ramping down,\" he said. \"This is exactly the kind of grooming you want residents to have. But without financial support, these programs will dwindle and die.\"\n\nWhen the smaller class of new residents starts at Erie on July 1, it will join the previous residents already in training, including Kaiyti Duffy and Ben Preyss, who earned his MBA while also getting his M.D. at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nPreyss has been drawn to serving those on society's margins, where he feels he can make the most difference, he said.\n\n\"Our patients have some of the highest rates of diabetes and high blood pressure,\" the third-year resident said. \"They have such complex needs and such a poor quality of life ... and now we don't even know if the program will exist.\"\n\nDuffy, too, graduated from the U. of I. College of Medicine in Chicago. A former public health nurse, she didn't enter medical school until age 31, almost a decade later than most of her peers.\n\nIn between, she had two children and worked at a community clinic in New York City, training health educators and developing programming for Hispanic and African-American patients. The experience helped shape her path, which may be \"financially irresponsible\" but offers a richer life, the first-year resident said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Funding crunch puts doctor pipeline in jeopardy", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Weary mothers with toddlers, weathered laborers and elderly folks hunched over walkers all jostled for position, filling almost every available seat in the nondescript waiting room at the Erie Family Health Center in West Town.", "title": "Funding crunch puts doctor pipeline in jeopardy", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-doctor-shortage-chicago-clinic-met-20150319-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-550bfa41/turbine/ct-doctor-shortage-chicago-clinic-met-20150319", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Teaching Health Center, Erie Family Center, primary care shortage, American Association of Medical", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/83102944", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-20", "Description": "Doctor shortages are looming and already disrupting treatment at one Chicago clinic.
