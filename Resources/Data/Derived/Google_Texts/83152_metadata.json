Here are five reasons why that won\u2019t happen.\n\nHe\u2019s Not Very Popular With Them\n\nMarco Rubio actually trails Jeb Bush by three points among Latinos. I guess it makes sense, though, when you consider that Jeb Bush miraculously became \u201cHispanic\u201d when he declared himself one on his voter registration application in 2009.\n\nHe Flip-Flopped on Immigration\n\nImmigration is a big deal to Latino voters. 81 percent think comprehensive immigration reform should be a priority for Congress next year. Rubio once had aspirations of fixing immigration, but has since fallen in line with more rightwing Republicans, whose support he needs in 2016.\n\nHe Doesn\u2019t Believe in Climate Change\n\nA whopping 86 percent of Latinos believe we are harming the planet for future generations, but Marco Rubio is on record saying he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s science to justify that belief. This is an issue Latinos want to see addressed, but Rubio clearly doesn\u2019t want to make it a major part of his platform.\n\nHe Wants to Repeal the Affordable Care Act\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Florida currently has the highest number of people buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which Rubio voted to repeal. Only 25 percent of Latinos agreed with that move, and 61 percent want to keep it.\n\nHe\u2019s Marco Rubio\n\nThe GOP is still struggling with the concept that Latinos won\u2019t vote for someone just because they are of Latin descent. These polls demonstrate that Latinos care about the issues, and they feel strongly about having them addressed.\n\nMarco Rubio is not up to that task.\n\nH/T: Marist Poll, Latino Decisions, (1), (2), (3), (4), American Bridge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives are expecting Marco Rubio, who is Cuban-American, to bring in the Latino votes.
