WASHINGTON (CBSDC) — Vice President Joe Biden took a shot at one of his most famous political gaffes, noting that the best way to avoid such public mistakes is to “assume every microphone is on.”

Biden’s advice was given to a Monday crowd for the kickoff for the Road 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge – featuring 200 cyclists that included injured veterans – who rode 325 miles from Washington to Virginia Beach, CNN reports. The vice president compared the event to his 2010 Affordable Care Act signing, in which he could be heard leaning into President Barack Obama’s ear behind the podium to say, “This is a big f—— deal.”

While being introduced, the event speaker said of Biden:

“For those of you who don’t know, Joe is famous for some of his one-liners,” the speaker told the crowd. “There was a bill signing at the White House…and he said it was a big f-ing deal. And that was a quote…If I may say, sir, Ride to Recovery is a big f-ing deal.”

Biden responded that the famous utterance was not intentional and that one of the reporters present could actually “read lips.”

The speaker also said that Biden is “going to run for president again,” to which Biden responded with the sign of the cross, CNN reports.

“I just want you to know, I didn’t intentionally say that,” said Biden. “I actually turned and I said, ‘Mr. President,’ and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips – not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips. Thank God my mother was gone or I’d have been one dead vice president.”

Biden did offer any aspiring public officials a bit of knowledge from experience: “Piece of advice about that BFD stuff – assume every microphone is on.”
