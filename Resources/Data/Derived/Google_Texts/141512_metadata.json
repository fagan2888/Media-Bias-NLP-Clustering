Governor Markell had asked roughly 120,000 current and retired state employees to pay about $1,000 per year more in deductibles, and pay more for specialist visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs, while eliminating solid gold oldies like erectile dysfunction pills, which were costing taxpayers $2.7 million per year.\n\nAs expected, many current and retired state employees were unhappy at having their healthcare premiums go up, especially when many are not receiving wage increases. They voiced their displeasure very, very loudly, and the lawmakers backed off. In fact, not only did they back off, but according to news reports, they are expected to increase the state budget by $21 million to cover the rising healthcare costs for state workers.\n\nIf you were wondering how the state will pay for these extra costs, welcome to the club. The state is expecting to grapple with a budget deficit of about $70 million for this upcoming fiscal year, as expected tax revenues have declined for the second straight year. Meanwhile lawmakers are trying to figure out how to get money to pay for infrastructure spending, and school districts are going one after the other asking local residents for property tax hikes. Yet there is no real plan to deal with the budget deficit, which will only get worse when the federal government cuts back on Medicaid expansion spending and education spending continues its unsustainable growth. State employee and retiree health care costs have been rising exponentially and are unsustainable. The claims have jumped 20 percent over the past three fiscal years and the latest Pew Trusts analysis estimates that the State of Delaware has unfunded long-term health care liabilities of $5.6 billion.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, The average state employee in Delaware earned $53,450 in 2013, a little higher than the $51,647 the private sector worker received that same year. The State covered roughly 91 percent of state employee healthcare premiums, higher than the nationwide average of 87 percent for state and local government employees and the 79 percent the typical private sector worker receives.\n\nWhen the Caesar Rodney Institute\u2019s president John Stapleford wrote an op-ed column praising the Governor for making the right, even if unpleasant, move to spare taxpayers from one extra cost, the result was a surge in negative comments, letters, and e-mails from state employees who support us, including one anonymous note with $5 and a statement saying, \u201cAs a State of Delaware employee, I work hard for my paycheck. I do not have a flashy job and am not in a position where I will ever receive accolades for my wondrous feats\u2026it would be nice if you would put a few good plugs for all the employees who knock themselves out to be pleasant and provide good services to the residents of this fine state\u2026I am a fan of your organization, but would love to see some positive support for the hardworking State Employee.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being upset about our support for Governor Markell\u2019s request, this state employee also took umbrage at us for requesting state employee pension data, which by law they don\u2019t have to give us. We can only surmise why this is.\n\nWhen we polled our e-mail newsletter recipients in March asking whether taxpayers or state employees should contribute more for their premiums, 35 percent (mainly state employees) said taxpayers should pay more. We also had a slight uptick in Facebook unliking, Twitter unfollowing, and e-mail unsubscribing. Yet we ask state employees exactly how much their fellow Delawareans should be expected to pay to offset the rising cost of state employee healthcare, especially when far too many private and nonprofit sector workers didn\u2019t get much in the way of pay increases or healthcare coverage increases either.\n\nTo his credit, Governor Markell continued to push for the employee contribution increase until the end.\n\nThe harsh reality is, all state and most local governments spend too much, promise too much, and borrow too much. State and local employees should not be excused from paying more for themselves just because what they do isn\u2019t glamorous. If lawmakers are concerned about finding more money, they should try creating policies which encourage economic growth for a change.\n\nState employees did, however, agree to pay for their own erectile dysfunction pills. Sadly, this is considered progress in Delaware.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Gov.
