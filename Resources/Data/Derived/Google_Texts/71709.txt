You can tour three newly-opened model homes today in a scenic community in Castle Rock that’s wrapped in parks and open space – but don’t expect to be the first in the door. Since the first of the year, new home sales have literally exploded at Terrain, the master-planned community by Starwood Land Ventures, off Founders Parkway three miles east of I-25.

“This is the quieter side of Castle Rock,” says Cary Garner, who with Gary Frederics will show you the grand opening of the Prelude Collection by TRI Pointe Homes at Terrain – single-family models priced from just $293,400. But there’s nothing quiet about reaction to this new series, with some walkout sites available that back to Terrain’s showplace Wrangler Park. Between Prelude and a larger Debut Collection that you can see nearby, TRI Pointe sold 17 at Terrain in January alone – five of them last Saturday.

Meanwhile, you really can be one of the first to get a preview tour of Century Communities’ two new models – still a month from a grand opening, but at pre-model pricing from as low as $324,950. And Century can show you some of the best home sites Terrain has released, including walkouts that back to part of the hundreds of acres of open space. Both Century and TRI Pointe have a few homes that are on track to deliver soon, including a Residence 4015 by Century, with three bedrooms, 2½ bath, around 2,302 square feet, priced at $375,165; and a Residence 2 by TRI Pointe, 3-bedroom, 2½ bath, at $353,449.

With Terrain’s amenities (it won the Home Builders’ Association’s Community of the Year for the entire Denver-Boulder area last year) builders are moving quickly through their sites here. That leaves only three chances to buy from Lennar Homes – including a 3-bedroom design a party-sized covered deck, scheduled for March delivery at $424,900; or you can opt for Lennar’s Woodbridge ranch-style designer model home, including a ‘NextGen’ separate living suite, being sold with its landscaping and decorator touches, at $474,900.

All of these are close to Terrain’s Sage Canyon Elementary School, set beside Wrangler Park, close to the open space and attractive community swim club. And you can see how close the King Soopers shopping is, and how accessible Castle Rock’s restaurants are.

“You know about the franchise places nearby, but the secret is to go downtown,” TRI Pointe’s Garner tells his buyers, pointing up the one-of-a-kind dining to be had in Castle Rock’s historic downtown. The town south of Denver Tech Center, he notes, is ranked by Money Magazine as the fourth ‘Best Place to Live’ in the entire nation this year.

To reach Terrain, head south on I-25 to Meadows/Founders Parkway, then east three miles to either Rising Sun or Copper Cloud Street and follow the signs to all three builders.
