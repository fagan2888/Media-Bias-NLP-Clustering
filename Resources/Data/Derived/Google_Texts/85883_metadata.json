Elizabeth Warren \u2014 who worry that the trade pact will result in American job losses by making it easier for companies to outsource jobs and suppress wages. They also worry about whether presidents should be able to ask Congress for an up-or-down vote on such sweeping trade agreements.\n\nThose opponents, Obama said of Warren and others, are \"wrong on this.\"\n\n\"I've spent the last six and a half years yanking this economy out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Every single think I've done from the Affordable Care Act to pushing to raise the minimum wage to making sure that young people are able to go to college and get good job training to what we're pushing now in terms of sick pay leave,\" Obama told Matthews. \"Everything I do has been focused on 'how do we make sure the middle class is getting a fair deal.' Now I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class.\n\n\"And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts they are wrong.\"\n\nStill, Obama's efforts will likely face stiff opposition.\n\nSome Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who could next possibly serve as Senate Minority Leader, and Warren, worry about how the broader trade pact will affect American workers.\n\nTrade agreements of this scope deserve Congressional scrutiny, they say.\n\n\"They're not good for the American people, they're not good for working men and women, it puts us at a disadvantage, so the answer is not only 'no,' but 'hell no',\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Reid Says 'Hell No' to Supporting Trade Agreement 0:35 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nLast week, after tense negotiation, leaders of tax committees in both congressional chambers agreed to legislation that gives Congress the right to vote on the trade deal \u2014 but blocks lawmakers from adding amendments that could slow the pact's progress. To woo reluctant committee Democrats, an agreement was struck that would allow Congress to determine whether the accord meets human rights and environmental and worker protections. If the measure doesn't meet those standards lawmakers could offer amendments.\n\nFor her part, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who recently announced her presidential candidacy, has been cautious in how she speaks about the trade pact. President Bill Clinton helped get NAFTA through Congress back in 1994.\n\n\"Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\" she told reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday. \"And we need to do our part to make sure we have the capacity and the skills to be competitive.\"\n\n\u2014 Halimah Abdullah", "article_metadata": {"description": "Appearing on MSNBC, President Barack Obama renewed his call Tuesday for so-called \"fast-track\" authority to negotiate a broad, multi-country trade deal.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Appearing on MSNBC, President Barack Obama renewed his call Tuesday for so-called \"fast-track\" authority to negotiate a broad, multi-country trade deal.", "title": "Obama on Pacific Trade Deal: Opponents Are 'Wrong on This'", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-trade-deal-opponents-wrong-n345736", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_16/979251/obamalive_150415_ef38c5db631cf33fb6c1d74f6d789832.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Appearing on MSNBC, President Barack Obama renewed his call Tuesday for so-called \"fast-track\" authority to negotiate a broad, multi-country trade deal.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_16/979251/obamalive_150415_ef38c5db631cf33fb6c1d74f6d789832.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Obama on Pacific Trade Deal: Opponents Are 'Wrong on This' - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-21", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-trade-deal-opponents-wrong-n345736", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,U.S. news,U.S. news,Business News,Congress,Elections,White House"}, "article_summary": "The trade accord would further shore up America's economy by boosting competition and easing trade, Obama told MSNBC's Chris Matthews during an interview Tuesday at the Fairfax Chamber of Commerce in Virginia.\n\"And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts they are wrong.\"\nNow I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class.\n\"Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\" she told reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday.\nFor her part, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who recently announced her presidential candidacy, has been cautious in how she speaks about the trade pact."}
