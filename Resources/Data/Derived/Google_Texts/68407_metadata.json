Next up in our \"heat index,\" it turns out that limes can cause skin burns. Doctors putting out a warning. These girls were hospitalized with burns with all over their bodies. Abc's abbie boudreau has the story. The size of a baseball. I have a big lister right there. Reporter: Look at the second-degree burns and severe blisters. It hurt really bad. It felt like ten-times worse than a sunburn. Reporter: These 7-year-olds to 11-year-olds were playing in this fresno backyard, when they decided to pick limes from their neighbor's tree. After adding a little lime juice to their soda, it became a game. We were dashing each other to drink the lime juice. That's how it got all over our face. Reporter: But the next day, the girls were in excruciating pain. It was like 100 needles going into one spot. It was probably the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. Reporter: So painful, the parents rushed them to the hospital. A parents' worst nightmare is watching your kids scream and cry and begging you to stop the pain. Reporter: It turns out the girls had sufficiented second-degree burns with the acid in the limes, combined with sunlight. Dr. Richard besser says their scarring can take 6 to 12 months to heal. These crashes are more common than people know. They can be anywhere from a mild rash, to something quite severe. The only advice around this, is if you've been handling limes, wash your hands if you go out in the sun. The girls are back in school and say they've learned their lesson. I'm done with limes and lemonade. I'm not touching it. Reporter: For \"good morning america,\" abbie boudreau, abc news, los angeles. Wow. Right? I mean, in california, lime trees in so many backyards. This is a common thing. Glad we were able to shine a light on that.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Video: Lime Burns Put 5 Girls in the Hospital", "description": "Doctors warn that the fruit's juice can make skin hypersensitive to ultraviolet light.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Doctors warn that the fruit's juice can make skin hypersensitive to ultraviolet light.", "title": "Video: Lime Burns Put 5 Girls in the Hospital", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/health-alert-lime-burns-put-girls-hospital-degree-20163505", "image": {"identifier": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/GMA/abc_gma_limes_130905_wg.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "video": {"width": 470, "secure_url": "https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/AkamaiPremierPlayer.swf?settings_url=https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/amp.premier.flashonly.xml?sec=1&params=%7B%22playerId%22%3A%22facebookHTTPS%22%7D&data_feed_url=http://abcnews.go.com/video/itemfeed?id=20163505&auto_play=true&ad_control_enabled=false", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "identifier": "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/AkamaiPremierPlayer.swf?settings_url=http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/amp.premier.flashonly.xml?sec=1&params=%7B%22playerId%22%3A%22facebookHTTP%22%7D&data_feed_url=http://abcnews.go.com/video/itemfeed?id=20163505&auto_play=true&ad_control_enabled=false", "height": 265}, "type": "video"}, "twitter": {"player": {"identifier": "https://abcnews.go.com/video/twittercard?id=20163505", "stream": {"identifier": "http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/98330877-5095-4ac9-9a8c-7cdcd3944274/15a750c8-e7be-4371-b5c3-dd911c0d8bb0/gma-20163505/content.once", "content_type": "video/mp4"}}, "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/GMA/abc_gma_limes_130905_wg.jpg", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/video,20163505", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/video,20163505"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638}}, "card": "player", "site": "@ABC"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/video,20163505", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/video,20163505", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "video": {"duration": 142}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "lime juice, lime juice burns, lime burns, ultraviolet light, skin sensitivity, burns from lime juice, GMA, health, good morning america, morning news, robin roberts, lara spencer, josh eliott, sam champion, gma"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedcd\"", "article_summary": "Transcript for Lime Burns Put 5 Girls in the HospitalCan't wait for the season.\nReporter: It turns out the girls had sufficiented second-degree burns with the acid in the limes, combined with sunlight.\nIt was probably the worst pain I've ever felt in my life.\nReporter: Look at the second-degree burns and severe blisters.\nNext up in our \"heat index,\" it turns out that limes can cause skin burns."}
