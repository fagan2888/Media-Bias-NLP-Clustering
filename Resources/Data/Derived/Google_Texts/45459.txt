More people believe the moon landing was a hoax than believe Obamacare will lower healthcare costs, according to a recent survey. In fact, a Public Policy Poll from earlier this year that found that Americans are more likely to buy into a number of conspiracy theories and folklore than to believe many of the benefits touted by Obamacare supporters.

Seven percent of respondents, for example, believe the moon landing was faked, while just 5 percent of people believe their own health-care costs will decrease as a result of Obamacare, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll. Likewise, more Americans believe in Bigfoot (14 percent); that the government is hiding a UFO that crash-landed in Roswell, N.M. (21 percent); and that aliens exist (29 percent) than believe the Affordable Care Act will lower their healthcare costs.

The WaPo/ABC poll found similarly low confidence in the healthcare law on other matters. Only 8 percent believe their coverage is improving as a result of the law, and just 11 percent think it is decreasing overall costs.
