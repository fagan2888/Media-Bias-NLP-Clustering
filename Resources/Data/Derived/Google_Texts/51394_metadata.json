Tom Cotton (R-AR) thanks the moderators after one of two debates in the tight Arkansas Senate race.\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS\u2014Tom Cotton, the Republican candidate for Arkansas\u2019 U.S. Senate seat, has repeatedly denounced the Affordable Care Act as a failure and vowed to help repeal it if elected. But in his second and final debate Tuesday night against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor, he went further, claiming the high-risk insurance pools that many states ran before Obamacare\u2019s passage were better for people with pre-existing conditions than the current exchanges.\n\n\u201cMany people were happy with their coverage under the high-risk pool, before it was eliminated,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cThey should have been allowed to keep that choice.\u201d\n\nPryor shot back, saying his personal experience proved otherwise. \u201cI am a cancer survivor,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been in the high-risk pool. I have lived there. It is no place for any Arkansan to be. If we go back to the high-risk pool, it\u2019s like throwing sick people to the wolves.\u201d\n\nMany of the high risk pools Cotton praised were known for their sky-high costs, exclusion of many applicants, and strict limits on what care is covered. In Arkansas, out of pocket costs for patients in such pools could be as high as $20,000 and those with pre-existing conditions had an average 6 month waiting period for care.\n\nAmericans who could not afford or qualify for the program and lacked an offer of employer-based coverage, were forced to turn to the individual health care market, where they were routinely denied coverage. Common disqualifications included diabetes, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, quadriplegia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and AIDS/HIV or even relatively mild health issues like acne.\n\nAs Pryor noted in the debate, before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, \u201cpeople in Arkansas with pre-existing conditions were routinely denied access to coverage. They were one medical emergency away from bankruptcy. The insurance companies had all the power. I think that it would be a mistake to go back to those days.\u201d He then accused Cotton of having \u201cno answer\u201d for what would happen to such people were the nation to \u201cstart over\u201d on health care reform\u2014as Cotton has repeatedly advocated.\n\nDuring the debate at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, the back-and-forth on health care all stemmed from a question about Walmart\u2014the most powerful employer in the state and, arguably, the world\u2014cutting the health insurance of tens of thousands of its part-time workers.\n\nCotton began by brushing off his opponent\u2019s point that the workers now have the subsidized exchange market to turn to when they lose their employer insurance, an option that did not exist before the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThose people at Walmart or other companies do not want an option. They want their health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are feeling the pain and stress of losing their insurance and trying to find a better option when they have an exact plan that suited their needs.\u201d\n\nBut whether the Walmart plan ever suited the needs of its workers is up for debate. Most plans available to part-time workers at the company were prohibitively expensive and came with high deductibles that would make it difficult to pay for a major illness or surgery. And according to a study by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers earlier this year, the workers will likely be able to find more comprehensive and cheaper plans on the private exchange market. The low wages Walmart pays would almost certainly qualify them for a federal subsidy or Medicaid coverage.\n\nPryor did say he would make some changes to the Affordable Care Act, such as scrapping its medical device tax. But in a race where he has struggled to counter a barrage of ads tying him to President Obama, Pryor defended the president\u2019s signature law and his vote in its favor.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Many people were happy with their coverage under the high risk pool, before it was eliminated,\" Tom Cotton said.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Many people were happy with their coverage under the high risk pool, before it was eliminated,\" Tom Cotton said.", "title": "Senate Candidate Claims People With Pre-Existing Conditions Were Better Off Before Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/10/15/3579849/cotton-preexisting-happy-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CottonDebate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Many people were happy with their coverage under the high risk pool, before it was eliminated,\" Tom Cotton said.", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CottonDebate-321x214.jpg", "title": "Senate Candidate Claims People With Pre-Existing Conditions Were Better Off Before Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CottonDebate.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CottonDebate.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-15T09:00:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Politics Senate Candidate Claims People With Pre-Existing Conditions Were Better Off Before Obamacare CREDIT: Alice Ollstein Rep.
