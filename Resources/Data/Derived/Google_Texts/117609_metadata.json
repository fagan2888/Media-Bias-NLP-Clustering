As the world population surges, the World Health Organization recommends an even longer term of two years as the standard waiting period between childbirths.\n\nLead investigator Heike Thiel de Bocanegra says the time between pregnancies \u201ccannot be explained only by the mother\u2019s preferences,\u201d given so many other factors in play. In the study, she and her colleagues analyzed Medicare and state-based data from more than 117,000 mothers in California who\u2019d borne at least two children. Of that group, nearly two-thirds waited 18 months or longer between pregnancies while one-third gave birth sooner.\n\nIn comparing pregnancy data to information about access to birth control, the research team found things to be a bit more complex than previously thought. Anitra Beasley, an expert on family planning at Baylor College of Medicine, commented on the study. \"We assumed that access to contraception\u2026 would improve birth spacing,\" she told Reuters Sunday. \u201cThis study actually examines this assumption.\u201d\n\nSurprising to some was the revelation that access to birth control alone was insufficient to adequate family planning. Women who used only \u201cbarrier\u201d contraceptives, such as condoms or spermicide, were least likely to experience an 18-month break between pregnancies. In the study, more than half of women used long-term contraceptives when resuming a birth control regimen -- and they were twice as likely as others to maintain the recommended spacing between pregnancies.\n\nMoreover, the numbers held firm when investigators looked at possibly confounding factors such as race, education, age, and national origin. However, a mother\u2019s level of income made a big difference in whether she received birth control in any follow-up visits for care after childbirth, according to Thiel. \"Low-income women are sometimes seen only once after giving birth,\u201d she said. \u201cSome women receive contraception -- some do not,\" she said.\n\nThe investigators recommend that pediatricians inquire about a mother\u2019s chosen type of birth control.\n\nSource: De Bocanegra, Heike Thiel, Chang, Richard, Howell, Mike, Darney, Philip.
