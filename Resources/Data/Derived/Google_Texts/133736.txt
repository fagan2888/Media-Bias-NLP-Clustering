The Iowa Hawkeye men’s basketball team will not be in action against Indiana Tuesday night as expected.

A piece of metal fell from the ceiling of Assembly Hall Tuesday. The school released the following statement:

“Indiana University Vice President and Director of Athletics Fred Glass has announced that tonight's Big Ten men's basketball game between Iowa and Indiana will be postponed as a result of a piece of metal falling from the ceiling into seats in the lower bowl.

Roughly 6 1/2 hours before gametime, a metal facing (roughly eight feet long by 14 inches wide), fell and damaged seats in the lower part of Section F, which is located in the northwest corner of the building.

"Safety is our No.1 priority," noted Glass. Our University engineers have advised us to postpone events in Assembly Hall until it can be determined what caused the facing to fall and ensure the safety of everyone attending an event in the facility."

The rescheduling of the Iowa contest and the status of tomorrow night's women's game with Michigan will be determined as soon as possible.
