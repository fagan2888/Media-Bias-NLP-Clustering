It has literally stopped working.\"\n\nOriginally from Evansville, Ind., Mathis moved with his family to Alabama in 2006. Today he works as a surgeon at the Alabama Bone and Joint Clinic.\n\nLast month, Rep. Spencer Bachus announced his plans to retire at the end of this term. Since then, several current elected officials, including state Senators Cam Ward and Slade Blackwell, have said they would not run for the open seat.\n\nMathis is a newcomer to politics, having neither held nor pursued public office before. On Tuesday, he cast himself as a Washington outsider and decried what he called the Republican Party farm system for grooming candidates for public office.\n\n\"Insider career politicians, seeking only to better themselves and looking out for themselves, have forgotten about the people they represent,\" he said. \"It's time to send someone different to Washington. It's time to stop sending the same Republicans from the same farm system up to D.C. accountable to the same party bosses.\"\n\nMathis has worked on one campaign -- that of Sen. Ted Cruz, the outspoken conservative opponent of Pres. Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, and a central political figure in the ongoing federal shutdown.\n\nEchoing Cruz and quoting Ronald Reagan, Mathis said that he wants to kill Obamacare and make government smaller.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mathis said that no one wants the federal government shutdown, but he did not give any specifics when asked what he would do if he were serving in the U.S. Congress today.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Mathis first in race to replace Bachus in sixth congressional district", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mathis first in race to replace Bachus in sixth congressional district\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/10/mathis_first_in_race_to_replac.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/22/275353185001/201310/802/275353185001_2730691003001_vs-52548246e4b06aa01e08f0f1-672293882001.jpg?pubId=275353185001\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11393553\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-08T22:38:31Z\", \"author\": \"Kyle Whitmire | kwhitmire@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-birmingham\",\"@river-state\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/22/275353185001/201310/802/275353185001_2730691003001_vs-52548246e4b06aa01e08f0f1-672293882001.jpg?pubId=275353185001", "creator": "@WarOnDumb", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Originally from Evansville, Ind., Mathis moved with his family to Alabama in 2006.
