Rusty Fleming, a spokesman for the Hudspeth County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Texas, is on the front lines of the border battle and said the U.S. side is losing. \u201cThese cartels are so sophisticated. They\u2019re getting affluent white teenagers to help them encrypt their software; they do digital money-laundering, can hack into government databases and actively recruit our agents to keep one step ahead. The rest of America is just now getting a taste of what we\u2019ve been dealing with for years,\u201d Mr. Fleming said. He estimates that cartels have infiltrated more than 3,000 U.S. cities and are recruiting local gangs, former prisoners and teenagers to do their dirty work. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt they\u2019re spreading themselves very rapidly and very deep into our U.S. interior,\u201d said Mr. Fleming, who directed the documentary \u201cDrug Wars\u201d and has testified before Congress about the drug trade.\n\nSheriff Chuck Jenkins of Frederick County, Maryland believes the battle to fight illegal immigration and the infiltration of drug cartels cannot be fought by the federal government alone. \u201cEvery state and law enforcement officer needs to be able to enforce immigration laws to be effective,\" he says.\n\nSince entering into an agreement with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in early 2008, the Frederick County Sheriff\u2019s Office has detained 1,250 illegal immigrants, 50 of whom have had connections to Mexican drug cartels and organized crime, Sheriff Jenkins said. \u201cThe success of the program is not in the numbers; it\u2019s who is actually getting arrested,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cDo I want Mexican gang members on the streets of Frederick County? Hell no.\u201d He noted that the county recently deported to Colombia a convicted pedophile who was in the U.S. illegally. \u201cThis program works, but there\u2019s such a political fallout from using it, many county sheriffs won\u2019t,\u201d Sheriff Jenkins said.\n\nFleming believes tougher measures need are needed going forward, however. \u201cWe have a saying on the border,\u201d he says, \u201cIf it gets by us today, it\u2019s going to be your problem tomorrow.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is Obama listening yet?.05/24/2016 12:26:07PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Is Obama listening yet?", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Sheriffs: Violent Mexican Drug Cartels Have Infiltrated More Than 3,000 U.S. Cities", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/04/12/sheriffs-warn-of-violence-from-mexican-cartels-deep-into-interior-of-us-n1823602", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/309/fae075f3-61a6-41d0-88db-e44783c0b652.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Is Obama listening yet?", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Sheriffs: Violent Mexican Drug Cartels Have Infiltrated More Than 3,000 U.S. Cities", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/04/12/sheriffs-warn-of-violence-from-mexican-cartels-deep-into-interior-of-us-n1823602", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/309/fae075f3-61a6-41d0-88db-e44783c0b652.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Sheriffs: Violent Mexican Drug Cartels Have Infiltrated More Than 3,000 U.S. Cities , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc109\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis program works, but there\u2019s such a political fallout from using it, many county sheriffs won\u2019t,\u201d Sheriff Jenkins said.\n\u201cIf we fail to secure our borders, then every sheriff in America will become a border sheriff,\u201d said Sam Page, sheriff of Rockingham County, N.C., reports the Washington Times.\nHe estimates that cartels have infiltrated more than 3,000 U.S. cities and are recruiting local gangs, former prisoners and teenagers to do their dirty work.\nSince entering into an agreement with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in early 2008, the Frederick County Sheriff\u2019s Office has detained 1,250 illegal immigrants, 50 of whom have had connections to Mexican drug cartels and organized crime, Sheriff Jenkins said.\nSheriff Chuck Jenkins of Frederick County, Maryland believes the battle to fight illegal immigration and the infiltration of drug cartels cannot be fought by the federal government alone."}
