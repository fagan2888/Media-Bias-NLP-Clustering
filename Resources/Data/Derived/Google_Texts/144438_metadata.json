The company temporarily stopped selling the device because of a defect in its \u201cwave\u201d feature, which allowed people to silence the alarm with a wave of the hand. With the feature turned on, such activity could inadvertently prevent the alarm from immediately sounding during a fire, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced a recall for the device in May.\n\nThe CPSC officially issued the recall at the same time Nest said it would put the device back on the market in a few weeks. The recall disclosed that Nest had sold some 440,000 of the detectors since its October launch. Nest at the time said customers could continue to use the device, which sends mobile notifications, works with apps and uses a speaking voice, even with the wave feature disabled.\n\nNest hasn\u2019t solved the wave defect yet, though it can re-enable it remotely on the Internet-connected devices once it finds a fix.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Nest Labs smoke and carbon-dioxide alarm is going back on sale today at a lower price and minus a feature that caused the company to pull the product two months ago.", "title": "Nest Protect Is Back on Sale at a Lower Price, Minus the \u2018Wave\u2019 Feature", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/17/nest-protect-is-back-on-sale-at-a-lower-price-minus-the-wave-feature/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CX045_NestPr_G_20140521180338.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "Nest Protect Is Back on Sale at a Lower Price, Minus the \u2018Wave\u2019 Feature", "description": "The Nest Labs smoke and carbon-dioxide alarm is going back on sale today at a lower price and minus a feature that caused the company to pull the product two months ago.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Brian R.
