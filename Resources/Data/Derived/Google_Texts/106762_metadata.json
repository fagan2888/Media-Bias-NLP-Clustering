The annual march marks the anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision by the court that made abortion legal in the United States. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n4543915\n\nFor the first time in 23 years, a congressional committee voted to overturn a law passed in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe law would prevent employers in D.C. from discriminating against employees and potential employees based on their reproductive health decisions, including abortions or the use of birth control.\n\nIn January, the D.C. Council passed the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014, a bill that could force employers in the district to hire individuals who advocate for abortion and could require those employers, even those who advocate pro-life causes, to cover elective abortions in their healthcare plans.\n\nTuesday night, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee passed a resolution disapproving the law, with those members who introduced the disapproval measure calling it anti-religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThis resolution is about protecting Americans\u2019 sacred right to exercise their freedom of conscience,\u201d Republican Rep. Bill Flores said in a statement. \u201cThe District of Columbia\u2019s law not only ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s clear ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, it violates the religious freedom enshrined in the First Amendment of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nFlores was referring to the Hobby Lobby decision, which ruled that family-owned businesses don\u2019t need to offer their employees contraceptive coverage under Obamacare if in doing so it would conflict with the business owner\u2019s religious beliefs.\n\nD.C. Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, said in a statement the congressmen looking to block the legislation were misinformed about the intentions of the bill.\n\n\u201cD.C.\u2019s bill in no respect infringes the philosophical or political beliefs or practices of the employer,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployers can still ask candidates if they agree to implement the policies and mission of the organization. But employers cannot hire and fire employees based on private, personal heath choices that are unrelated to employees\u2019 duties and responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe disapproval resolution passed the committee vote along strict party lines, with a 20-16 vote, though it is unlikely to actually block the law from taking effect.\n\nFor the disapproval resolution to succeed the measure needs to pass a full vote within the House and the Senate, and President Obama would need to sign it into law. And all of this needs to happen within the next two weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s because in order for D.C. Council legislation to become law it is required to be sent before both houses of Congress for 30 legislative days before taking effect.\n\nThe bill was transmitted to House Speaker John Boehner in March, and the deadline for congress to take action before it becomes law is May 2.\n\nFollow Josh on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
