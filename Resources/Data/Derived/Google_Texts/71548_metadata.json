If the commissioner, Chester A. McPherson, finds that they are, he is empowered under city law to force the insurer to come up with a plan to spend the excess funds for the public benefit.\n\nThe new review is the latest round in a fight that has been led by the D.C. Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. The nonprofit group has argued that CareFirst has improperly hoarded policyholders\u2019 premiums, building financial reserves well beyond those necessary to protect against even the most unlikely losses.\n\nAccording to a recent regulatory filing, CareFirst reported a surplus of $865 million as of March 31 for the subsidiary in question. The company reported serving about 772,000 members in the District, Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nAppleseed successfully lobbied city lawmakers to require periodic reviews of CareFirst\u2019s surplus and won a series of rulings from the District\u2019s highest court in 2012. The organization now hopes that regulators will take money from the insurer\u2019s coffers \u2014 funds that could be used to build community clinics, pay for public wellness programs or otherwise improve health-care access.\n\n\u201cWe are in the end game,\u201d said Walter Smith, Appleseed\u2019s executive director. \u201cThese are public assets. . . . This is money beyond their reserves that they\u2019d like to have in addition to their reserves.\u201d\n\nCareFirst has been specifically targeted because, unlike for-profit insurers, its subsidiary operating in the District \u2014 known as Group Hospitalization and Medical Services Inc., or GHMSI \u2014 is a not-for-profit entity chartered by Congress in 1939 as a \u201ccharitable and benevolent institution.\u201d\n\nAppleseed and its allies have argued that an excessive surplus conflicts with that mission, and the D.C. Council passed a law at the group\u2019s behest in 2009 requiring regular examinations. The excess, the law says, must be used for \u201ccommunity health reinvestment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is how to strike the balance, and in our view they have not struck the balance appropriately,\u201d Smith said.\n\nCareFirst chief executive Chet Burrell told insurance regulators in a 2009 proceeding that the surplus is \u201can essential requirement that represents amounts held for the protection of subscribers to assure that, come what may, their claims will be paid.\u201d The company has noted that its surplus might seem large, but dwindles against the amount of claims it pays \u2014 well over $3 billion in 2013.\n\nA CareFirst spokeswoman declined to comment on the most recent attempt to force the company to spend down its surplus. But in its filing this week, it renewed long-standing defenses, saying the holdings are justified, given the risks the company must manage.\n\nThe company, according to the filing, \u201cworks to strike the right balance with its surplus, holding only a prudent amount that accounts for all of the risks faced by the Company.\u201d Under a policy adopted by the firm\u2019s board of trustees, it continued, it \u201cstrives to hold surplus in an optimal range and increases or decreases premium rates as needed to keep surplus in that range.\u201d\n\nCareFirst has also defended its level of corporate giving. In its filings this week, it reported spending $22.5 million on community benefits and paying another $15.4 million in District taxes in 2013.\n\nIn considering the pre-hearing filings and testimony set to be delivered June 25, McPherson will have to sort through competing claims as to what level of surplus is adequate.\n\nAppleseed argues in its filings that no more than about $530 million, and perhaps as little as $385 million, is necessary to keep CareFirst in sound financial condition. But CareFirst argues that it should carry surplus equal to 10 to 13 times its \u201cauthorized control level\u201d \u2014 a reserve minimum below which regulators can take control of the company. That calculation would permit a surplus of more than $1.4 billion.\n\nInsurance regulators commissioned their own analysis of the CareFirst surplus last year, which concluded that the company should target a surplus level of $925 million. Appleseed has aggressively questioned that study, noting that the firm that did the analysis \u2014 Rector & Associates \u2014 concluded in 2009 that CareFirst\u2019s adequate surplus was more than $400 million less.\n\nHanging over the analysis is the Affordable Care Act. CareFirst argues that the federal health-care law has significantly increased its business risks in the past five years, creating \u201cdramatic market changes . . . which will act to drive surplus down and prevent rebuilding of surplus once lost.\u201d The company notes that its surplus has declined in recent years \u2014 due, it says, to the costs of implementing the law.\n\nSmith said that CareFirst has inflated the risks posted by health-care reform and that the assumptions made by both Rector and the company are unjustifiably conservative. \u201cThey have conceived remote, improbable, extreme adverse events all happening at once,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is unclear how quickly after the June 25 hearing McPherson might rule. Kathryn Hartig, a spokeswoman for the D.C. insurance department, said there is no set timeline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Regulators will ask: Should region\u2019s largest insurer be forced to spend $500 million on public health needs?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Regulators will ask: Should region\u2019s largest insurer be forced to spend $500 million on public health needs?", "title": "CareFirst\u2019s $865 million surplus goes back under D.C. regulators\u2019 microscope", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/carefirsts-865-million-surplus-goes-back-under-dc-regulators-microscope/2014/06/13/e48a463e-f1b2-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, CareFirst, DC Appleseed, CareFirst surplus, CareFirst reserves, DC DISB, Chester A McPherson, DC insurance commissioner, DC insurance, DC Department of Insurance Securities and Banking, CareFirst surplus review", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, CareFirst, DC Appleseed, CareFirst surplus, CareFirst reserves, DC DISB, Chester A McPherson, DC insurance commissioner, DC insurance, DC Department of Insurance Securities and Banking, CareFirst surplus review", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "e48a463e-f1b2-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb17\"", "article_summary": "Insurance regulators commissioned their own analysis of the CareFirst surplus last year, which concluded that the company should target a surplus level of $925 million.\nAccording to a recent regulatory filing, CareFirst reported a surplus of $865 million as of March 31 for the subsidiary in question.\nIn its filings this week, it reported spending $22.5 million on community benefits and paying another $15.4 million in District taxes in 2013.\nA CareFirst spokeswoman declined to comment on the most recent attempt to force the company to spend down its surplus.\nThe new review is the latest round in a fight that has been led by the D.C.
