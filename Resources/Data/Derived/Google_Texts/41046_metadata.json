But where is this god forsaken place? None other than Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nWatch as Wilemon, befuddled by the facts that Mandvi presents him with about the inadequate American health care system, fumbles and fails to explain how this could possibly be the best. Oh, and of course he adds useful tidbits like saying the poor have to just stop being poor, since clearly they\u2019re to blame for the gross inequality plaguing the nation. Maybe if they just stopped being so poor, they could afford some of that \u201cbest health care in the world\u201d and we wouldn\u2019t have to change the system.\n\n\u2014Posted by Natasha Hakimi Zapata", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "aasif mandvi, aca, affordable care act, conservatives, daily show, fox, fox business, health care, obamacare, remote area medical, stan brock, todd wilemon", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "According to \u201cFox Business\u201d commentator Todd Wilemon, the U.S. will slowly slip into Third World status thanks to the Affordable Care Act, so \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent Aasif Mandvi set out to see what will happen to the \u201cbest health care system in the world.\u201d \n - 2014/03/08", "title": "\u2018If You\u2019re Poor, Stop Being Poor,\u2019 Fox Commentator Says to \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Correspondent", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/if_youre_poor_stop_being_poor_says_fox_commentator_to_daily_show_20140308", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/todwilemon_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to \u201cFox Business\u201d commentator Todd Wilemon, the U.S. will slowly slip into Third World status thanks to the Affordable Care Act, so \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent Aasif Mandvi set out to see what will happen to the \u201cbest health care system in the world.\u201d", "title": "\u2018If You\u2019re Poor, Stop Being Poor,\u2019 Fox Commentator Says to \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Correspondent | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/if_youre_poor_stop_being_poor_says_fox_commentator_to_daily_show_20140308/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/todwilemon_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, \u2018If You\u2019re Poor, Stop Being Poor,\u2019 Fox Commentator Says to \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Correspondent, aasif mandvi, aca, affordable care act, conservatives, daily show, fox, fox business, health care, obamacare, remote area medical, stan brock, todd wilemon", "article": {"tag": "aasif mandvi, aca, affordable care act, conservatives, daily show, fox, fox business, health care, obamacare, remote area medical, stan brock, todd wilemon", "published_time": "2014-03-08T10:43:52-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-08T11:45:53-08:00"}, "description": "According to \u201cFox Business\u201d commentator Todd Wilemon, the U.S. will slowly slip into Third World status thanks to the Affordable Care Act, so \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent Aasif Mandvi set out to see what will happen to the \u201cbest health care system in the world.\u201d \n - 2014/03/08"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc818\"", "article_summary": "Maybe if they just stopped being so poor, they could afford some of that \u201cbest health care in the world\u201d and we wouldn\u2019t have to change the system.\nOh, and of course he adds useful tidbits like saying the poor have to just stop being poor, since clearly they\u2019re to blame for the gross inequality plaguing the nation.\nNone other than Knoxville, Tenn.Watch as Wilemon, befuddled by the facts that Mandvi presents him with about the inadequate American health care system, fumbles and fails to explain how this could possibly be the best.\nBut where is this god forsaken place?\n\u2014Posted by Natasha Hakimi Zapata"}
