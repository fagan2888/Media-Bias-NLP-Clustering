Each dog and handler go through special training before they're allowed in the courtroom.

Dogs are now working in courtrooms in Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties.

The therapy dogs will help comfort crime victims at meetings and when they testify.

Each dog wears a specially-designed super hero cape that includes a special badge from the District Attorney of district 12, Matt Ballard.

The dogs are a special comfort to children who have to testify in front of a room full of strangers.

"So far the reaction has been great, the kids have loved the dogs, there's been a very positive reaction," said Holly Webb with Barnes Children's Advocacy Center.
