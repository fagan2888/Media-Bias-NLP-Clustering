Full understanding of these factors renders it clear that the Medicare cost problem (and the broader federal budget challenge) has not been solved:\n\n#1: That current Medicare spending is lower than projected in 2006 is not significant in and of itself; virtually every relevant economic variable is also lower. Measured in dollars, current Medicare spending is indeed smaller than the 2006 projections. But so is almost everything else pertinent, including cumulative general price inflation, tax revenue, and indeed our whole economy.\n\nTo see this, let us look at total Medicare spending as a percentage of GDP. (I will use Medicare trustees\u2019 projections rather than CBO\u2019s as the Times did, because CBO made some earlier mistakes in their health spending analyses that were not corrected until current CBO director Doug Elmendorf came on board in 2009).\n\nThe reality shown in this graph is quite different from the impression formed by The Times piece. Yes, in 2006 we thought Medicare spending would be a lot higher than it is now. But we also thought our economy as a whole would be bigger and that Medicare would receive more revenue.\n\nRelated: How Medicare Data Could Revolutionize Health Care\n\nAs a share of the economy, current Medicare spending is only slightly smaller than expected in 2006. The graph also reveals two other key pieces of the story:\n\na) Medicare spending jumped as a percentage of GDP in 2009 because GDP itself shrank with the recession. The more recent leveling on this graph reflects GDP resuming growth since then.\n\nb) Lower spending in year 2006 itself accounts for most of the subsequent drop relative to 2006 projections, indeed more than the combined effects of all annual changes since then. The 2007 Medicare trustees\u2019 report attributes the 2006 drop to a one-time \u201cabrupt decline in the number of inpatient hospital readmissions.\u201d That obviously has nothing to do with the ACA, enacted in 2010.\n\nMany of the same factors that reduced Medicare spending have reduced Medicare payroll tax revenue by even more. As a result the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is actually in weaker condition than projected in 2006, not stronger. This next graph shows how despite starting from a stronger position, the HI fund has been depleting faster than then projected. Thus whatever factors have slowed Medicare HI spending are outweighed to date by the factors that have reduced HI tax revenues.\n\nClearly it is not telling the whole story to proclaim that slower Medicare spending growth is solving the program\u2019s financial problems. As but one additional example, consider that at the start of this year the HI fund had $205 billion in assets. In 2006 the trustees thought that number would be $270 billion.\n\n#2: Health cost inflation is not and never was the biggest problem projected for Medicare; population aging was, and that problem remains. It is helpful to slow excess health cost growth but Medicare\u2019s biggest source of financial strain is the sheer number of people coming onto its rolls.\n\nRelated: Medicare Gets a 4-Year Reprieve from Bankruptcy\n\nCBO estimates that only 33 percent of the growth in all major federal health program spending projected through 2039 is due to excess cost growth, population aging being a bigger factor. This is especially true for Medicare specifically because it serves the senior population.\n\n#3: The ACA\u2019s cuts in future Medicare spending do not translate into lower federal health spending overall, because the ACA spends those savings on expanding Medicaid and subsidizing coverage under new health insurance exchanges. Analysts (including CBO) widely agree that the ACA will cut the growth of Medicare spending; they also agree that the ACA significantly increases total federal health spending. Instead of solving the problem of federal health spending driving budget deficits, the ACA shifts health spending from one program to another and does more of it.\n\nThis year the Medicare trustees (I am one, as are four members of the Obama administration cabinet) lowered our projections for future Medicare spending growth relative to last year\u2019s report.\n\nBut the factors cited above are among the reasons why we also wrote that \u201cnotwithstanding recent favorable developments\u2026 Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation.\u201d And my fellow public trustee Robert Reischauer and I wrote in the same report, on the question of whether \u201ca recent slowdown in national health expenditure growth may indicate less urgency in legislating Medicare financing corrections,\u201d the answer is, \u201cunfortunately, this is not the case.\u201d\n\nDespite public statements to the contrary, the financial problems caused by rising Medicare spending are far from solved.\n\nCharles Blahous is a senior research fellow for the Mercatus Center, a research fellow for the Hoover Institution, a public trustee for Social Security and Medicare, and a contributor to e21, where this article originally appeared.\n\n\n\nRead more at e21:\n\nWhat Washington Can Learn From Apple\n\nThe Case for the Gold Standard\n\nFast Food Worker Strikes Aren\u2019t What They Appear To Be\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On August 28 The New York Times\u00a0published a provocative article entitled \u201c", "title": "Why the Medicare Cost Problem Is Still Unsolved", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/18/Why-Medicare-Cost-Problem-Still-Unsolved", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062010_money_counter_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/18/Why-Medicare-Cost-Problem-Still-Unsolved", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062010_money_counter_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "On August 28 The New York Times\u00a0published a provocative article entitled \u201c", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9bf\"", "article_summary": "Related: Medicare by the NumbersThese articles exhibit substantial confusion about the significance of recent changes in Medicare projections.\nInstead of solving the problem of federal health spending driving budget deficits, the ACA shifts health spending from one program to another and does more of it.\n#2: Health cost inflation is not and never was the biggest problem projected for Medicare; population aging was, and that problem remains.\nClearly it is not telling the whole story to proclaim that slower Medicare spending growth is solving the program\u2019s financial problems.\nMany of the same factors that reduced Medicare spending have reduced Medicare payroll tax revenue by even more."}
