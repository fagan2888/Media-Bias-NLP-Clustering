Reporter Laraine Weschler sat down recently with four students at Watertown High School and asked them questions on a range of topics.\n\n\n\nQ: What will you miss most about high school?\n\n\n\nAnnie Wu: Probably my teachers and all the close relationships I've come to create throughout high school. I've really become close to a lot of great people here.\n\n\n\nHarun Malik: Seeing all my friends every day, all the opportunities that I have at the high school.\n\n\n\nKathleen Abbott: I'm going to miss my teachers and then I'm mostly going to miss my friends. I'll just miss the environment that's been here in Watertown because people are so caring.\n\n\n\nSean Chilson: I really found a sense of community here and it didn't just feel like I was going to school, you know. It felt like I was going to meet with people and talk to people, whether it be teachers or other students, and it really felt like a comfortable place to be and that's something I'm going to miss.\n\n\n\nAnnie: Yeah, I feel like in high school we really found our niche, so being in that safe place that we've been in for the past four years, it's really going to be kind of scary starting over next year in college, but I think we're ready.\n\n\n\nQ: What was the most exciting thing you did or learned your senior year?\n\n\n\nHarun: Probably getting into college. There's a lot of doubt, like what if I don't get into college, what am I going to do? But then you get accepted and you have all these choices to pick.\n\n\n\nKathleen: Getting that first acceptance letter is definitely one of the most exciting things. And all the events senior year, like the senior picnic and senior prom. It's like the one last bonding moment. You get to bond with your entire class.\n\n\n\nSean: I'd have to say it would be graduation. Even though it hasn't happened yet, it's just, you've been working on this for four years and now it's all about to pay off. That's really the starting point for the rest of our lives.\n\n\n\nAnnie: It's the last moments when all the seniors feel like we're really a community. We've been going to school with each other for almost 12 years. These are kind of our last moments with each other. And also graduation. The last 12 years of our life have kind of come up to this one thing and in two weeks we'll be out in the real world by ourselves. It's a bit terrifying, but also really exciting.\n\n\n\nQ: Do you think you'll keep in touch with your friends?\n\n\n\nAnnie: I hope I keep in touch with my friends after high school. I've gotten close with so many people over the years and I'm seeing them every single day in school. Not being able to talk to them, talk to my friends, next year every single day, seeing them in the hall, it's going to be weird. I hope I do. I really can't imagine, you know, going the next few years without talking to them or seeing them.\n\n\n\nQ: Are you going to be going to college with any of your friends?\n\n\n\nAnnie: I am, but she's not going to be staying on campus for the first semester, so for the first semester, I'm really going to be out on my own. I know it's going to be kind of scary, but I'm also ready to make new friends.\n\n\n\nHarun: I definitely will be keeping in touch with my friends after high school because the friends I've made, they're not vacation friends where you see them sometimes. The bonds I've created are very strong. I definitely will keep in touch with them after. I want to see what they do, their lives.\n\n\n\nKathleen: I definitely think I'm going to be in touch with my friends because it's just one of the best experiences. You keep your friends for life. Sure, some of them may move away, but that doesn't mean that they're not your friend anymore. Like, you don't have to talk every day just because you're friends and that's a special bond you have.\n\n\n\nSean: I had a couple of my friends that I was really close with that graduated last year and we've already been staying in touch a little bit with Skype or texting or whatever. So it's still keeping in contact with them and now, after we're graduating, it's going to be probably a little easier on the schedule because everyone's on that college lifestyle rather than high school where you're up early in the mornings \u2026 I'm definitely going to stay in touch with them.\n\n\n\nQ: What are your summer plans?\n\n\n\nAnnie: This summer, I'm going to be home mostly, but for two weeks in July I'm going to be in China. I haven't been back there since the summer before seventh grade. So I'm going to be back visiting family, going around the country.\n\n\n\nHarun: I'm going to Macedonia and Turkey to see family.\n\n\n\nKathleen: After graduation I'm going on a cruise to Canada for four days and it's going to be fun. I also plan on getting my license this summer so I can drive.\n\n\n\nSean: I will spend most of my summer working and trying to get enough money saved up for college so I won't have too many expenses going in.\n\n\n\nQ: What is your next step? College and major? Career?\n\n\n\nAnnie: I'm going to Northeastern University in Boston next fall. I'm going to be majoring in business administration with a concentration in marketing. Hopefully I can use that toward the fashion industry. The cool thing about going to Northeastern is I can start working sophomore year. So for six months, I will have a paid internship somewhere, anywhere in the world actually, so I'm really excited to start working. Don't get me wrong, I love going to classes and learning new things.\n\n\n\nHarun: I'm going to the University of Connecticut in Storrs. I'm going for engineering and pre-dental for my undergrad. Hopefully after I graduate with my bachelor's, I can apply to dental school and get in because my long-term goal is to be dentist.\n\n\n\nKathleen: I'm planning to go to Mount St. Mary College in Newburgh, N.Y. I'm to become a nurse because I like helping people and I believe that you can heal people with science. I love science and I know that nursing has a scientific part and it also has a part where I can care for people, so that combines my two loves together.\n\n\n\nSean: I'm going to the University of Connecticut for chemical engineering.\n\n\n\nQ: How do you see the job market once you graduate?\n\n\n\nAnnie: Well, for Northeastern I'm not too worried about getting a job right after college. About 95 percent of kids that graduate from the university end up getting one or two job offers by the time they graduate.\n\n\n\nHarun: My mom always told me to have a plan B, which is why I'm doing my biomedical engineering for my undergrad, so if I don't get into dental school, I can try to find a job being a biomedical engineer. If I get into dental school and I'm able to accomplish that goal, I can work as a dentist. People are always going to have teeth.\n\n\n\nKathleen: I'm not too worried about finding a job because the baby boomer generation is getting older, so they're going to need more nurses in the field, and I know that people will be retiring soon and hopefully I can find a job.\n\n\n\nSean: I'm not worried. UConn has a really fantastic chemical engineering program. It's one of the top in the country, but also they have a really big alumni network, too, because it's such a big school. So I feel like all those together, I'm not going to have any trouble finding a job.\n\n\n\nQ: How much were career prospects a factor in deciding what you want to major in?\n\n\n\nAnnie: My older sister is also a business major and she told me you can get hired for pretty much any concentration. So that was part of my decision to major in business. But also, I really like math, so that was another decision.\n\n\n\nHarun: I've always wanted to be a dentist since I was like 10 years old, so it was reassuring knowing that what I wanted to do and what I had a passion for paid well and the job market was kind of booming. I would be able to get a job, I would be able to start my own practice after working and getting the experience.\n\n\n\nKathleen: Initially, I wanted to become an accountant, but I had the opportunity of taking the accounting class here and I decided that it's not for me; that office life isn't really for me because I really wanted to be around people.\n\n\n\nSean: For the longest time, really up until senior year, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I always really like sciences. I really liked chemistry in particular and I like math, so I thought that engineering would be a good fit, too. I know a couple people that are chemical engineers and they all said that it's really booming right now in the industry and they're always looking for people. I know a couple people that are hiring people right out of college, which is hopefully what will happen with me. They're making really good money, too, which is nice, so I won't have to worry about paying my loans too much later on in life as long as I can get a good, solid job out of college.\n\n\n\nQ: Are you worried about the cost of college?\n\n\n\nAnnie: My parents always told me, even when I first started applying to colleges in October or early fall, don't worry about the cost. That's not something you need to worry about. They always told me what I need to worry about is, you know, staying on top of school and getting my grades up to get to college. We want you to have the best college experience you can have.\n\n\n\nHarun: My parents said they same thing. They told me to focus more on finding something I had a passion for and that paid good money. Because loans you can always pay off. As long as you go to school and you get a job afterward, you have your degree that's relevant.\n\n\n\nKathleen: Tuition cost was a big thing for me because my mom is unemployed and I don't have a father anymore, so I had to find a school where I could get a degree for not too much money. And I also plan on taking out loans, but I want to pay them off after college if I find a job. I'm still worried, but I know there's hope. And I'll never stop applying for scholarships because, who knows, one day might be your lucky day.\n\n\n\nSean: I'm happy I got some scholarship money, but I still have to take out some loans. But again, with chemical engineering you can make really decent money right out of graduation, so I'm hoping I can just find a good job when I graduate and then get my loans paid off as early as I can.\n\n\n\nQ: How is the job market going to change over the next few years?\n\n\n\nAnnie: I definitely think that jobs will probably open up because the world's always changing, in my opinion. There's always going to be something new out there. But I feel like our generation, we can really help and kind of be a catalyst for all this new technology, and like medicine and all this stuff. I really think that the job market will increase by the time we get out of college.\n\n\n\nHarun: There's always a way to do something faster and solve that one problem that everybody deals with. Definitely making new things, like the iPhone, we're that generation that was there when the first iPhone was created, the first touch screen phone and there's going to be more advances like that.\n\n\n\nKathleen: I really hope the job market increases and I think it will, especially in the medical fields since they implemented ObamaCare. There's going to be more nurses and more doctors and more people to help with the ObamaCare. And, as I said, as the baby boomers are getting older, so more jobs will open up. Also, as long as there's innovation in technology, there will always be people working those jobs, so I have hope for a job.\n\n\n\nSean: I'm really hopeful because with bio fuels and green energy and things like that, there's a lot of heavy chemical engineering involvement there. So if that does take off, I can, you know, just go with them and work in a job in that industry.\n\n\n\nQ: How well do you feel your high school experience has prepared you for your future careers?\n\n\n\nAnnie: I think high school has definitely helped me prepare for my future career, but there's definitely still a lot more room for improvement, which I think is where college is going to come in with a lot more growth that could be needed in some of the areas.\n\n\n\nHarun: High school has really done its job for me. I've taken a lot of leadership roles. I know the steps I need to take, what I need to do. Being on sports teams and being in clubs kind of taught me how to be a team player, how to work with others to accomplish a certain goal. Definitely in the future for any job that I take, I know I personally would want to be a leader and be that one person to be in charge. But I also would be that team player. I'm not just going to become the boss without working with others; other people's opinions kind of accomplish a goal that all of us can agree on.\n\n\n\nKathleen: High school has prepared me enough, but some of the preparations that you need to do in the real world have to be done personally and high school can sort of help you do that \u2014 by creating relationships where you sort of have to struggle, and with struggle, you can grow. I've learned some of the basic skills that I need to survive in high school, but I feel like most of the preparation for the real world is done at home.\n\n\n\nSean: High school taught me that I really like working on something even if it's a difficult problem. I learned not to give up and continue persevering. So I feel taking that as a basis, I can build on that in college, learning a lot of the more particular skills and a lot of the other things you know that high school just can't replicate.\n\n\n\nQ: What's the biggest challenge our nation will face in the next 10 years and how will your generation overcome it?\n\n\n\nHarun: I would say the hardest thing our generation is going to face in the next 10 years is to realize that the world is not a perfect place. All these hopes and dreams that certain people have right now might not always come true in the future. ... People just have to kind of learn how to accept how times are and they can try to create a change if they don't like the way it is.\n\n\n\nKathleen: As Uncle Ben said in \"Spiderman,\" with more power comes greater responsibility. Like, one of the challenges we'll have to face is abuse of technology. And sometimes these days teenagers and kids don't want to talk to their parents because they're too busy playing with their phone or their Nintendo or whatever devices and technology. We need to realize that, yes, technology is helping us, but we don't need to abuse it. Like we still need to create relationships with people and still have face to face contact because a phone can only do so much. It can't create a relationship. You have to do that yourself.\n\n\n\nHarun: I'd like to branch off that. Parenting is definitely going to be a big feat for certain people to accomplish because even now every kid has an iPad. So in 10 years, our generation, I just feel like they're going to \u2026 kind of like rely on iPads and use different things to teach their kids and they're not going to have that bond like I have with my parents or like the older generations have with their parents because there's no connection between parent and child. They're going to have that one barrier between them and that's technology, so definitely try to overcome and try to create that bond with your child.\n\n\n\nKathleen: Everything in moderation.\n\n\n\nSean: Yeah, so I think we definitely have our work cut out for us now. I think the biggest thing we're going to need to do and focus on is really setting ourselves up for the future and everyone that's going to come after us. Now we have a huge chunk of the population, the baby boomers, who are reaching retirement age. It's going to be up to us to figure out how to take care of all of them because I don't think the way, you know, everything is now, it's not going to be what it was 30 to 40 years ago. ... I think it's really going to be up to us to fix what we see as the problems now so that way in the future, it's going to be a lot better, especially following that whole 2008 financial collapse, too. It is a lot like how it was after the Great Depression. I think people really have to put new systems in place now and get everything set so that way we can provide for the generations of the future. And I don't think that's going to be easy, but I feel like it's something we're going to have to do like everyone else before us in history has done.\n\n\n\nQ: What was senior prom like? Did it match up with your expectations?\n\n\n\nAnnie: Events like prom, they never can really meet your expectations. You get all this hype for two to three months and you see all the movies and TV shows and you finally get there, and you're not disappointed, but it's not always what you expect. I definitely had fun with my friends at senior prom. There's definitely a sense of nostalgia because it was our last prom and it was the last time we'll all be out on the dance floor together just enjoying ourselves. But I definitely enjoyed senior prom.\n\n\n\nHarun: I think senior prom was really fun. Prom itself could have been better. There was a time when the entire dance floor was empty. The DJ tried his best, but I'd say the entire before prom, after prom, the entire weekend, all the events, like being with everybody, all your friends, that was fun.\n\n\n\nQ: Was there any drinking during prom?\n\n\n\nHarun: No. I don't think anybody did. Because usually when people do, it's broadcast to everyone else.\n\n\n\nKathleen: I think it was just around a stressful time. So, I mean, timing could've probably been better because AP exams had just started. So I didn't really a have enough time to really focus and get ready for prom. I mean, I still had fun, but timing could've been a little better.\n\n\n\nQ: What advice would you give to an eighth-grader who might be fretting about going to high school in September?\n\n\n\nAnnie: So, to eighth-graders who are coming in, I would definitely say join a lot of extracurricular activities because that's where you meet your closest friends in school. And also, don't take your time for granted because the past four years have really flown by. ... Get close with your teachers, make a lot of memories with your fiends, but also work hard in your classes because it really will pay off your senior year when your applying for college.\n\n\n\nHarun: I think, definitely, if you have a goal and you want to achieve it, you have to start freshman year. Don't wait because then you can take the right steps and you have all that time. You can look into different programs. Get knowledge so that senior year isn't that stressful. Really focus more on your classes. Focus on the classes themselves that, if you want to do something that involves math, focus on those math classes. Take the APs. If you can double up on the algebra 2 and geometry freshman year, do it so you can take calculus your senior year. Take the right steps and start as soon as possible. Don't wait.\n\n\n\nKathleen: My advice would be to study hard but also have fun. I spent too much time studying and not really having fun. Try to take everything in moderation, and try to balance your studies and your friendships. Try to make as many friends as possible. Join as many extracurricular activities as you can.\n\n\n\nSean: Like everyone else said, definitely get involved early on freshman year. I know when I started swimming, my friend wanted someone else to go to the meeting with. I had no intention of joining. I went to the meeting, I ended up liking it and I fell in love with it. So I feel like, really just getting involved and getting out there, you might discover something that you never would've thought about before or even considered, but by just putting yourself out there and trying, you might find something you really like and you're really passionate about. And then, like, school wise, I know I really had no idea until senior year what I wanted to do. ... You're always going to have people who know what they want to do since the day they're born. And then you're going to have the people that don't know what they're doing tomorrow. So for those people, really just strengthen your core classes.\n\n\n\nKathleen: Really don't be afraid to change your mind. Everyone's always like, \"I've already decided and I can't change my mind,\" but just don't be afraid.\n\nFollow Us", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Sunday Republican today continues \"Teen Table,\" a roundtable discussion in which we find out what's on the minds of the next generation of leaders, workers and parents.
