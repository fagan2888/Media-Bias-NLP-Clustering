The parent company of Florida Blue is teaming with a major Latin American health business to open three primary-care clinics in Miami-Dade County next year, the Miami Herald reports.

The GuideWell and Organizacion Sanitas Internacional clinics will operate in Doral, Hialeah, and West Kendall and will focus on new Latin American immigrants. In addition to primary medicine, the clinics will also offer walk-in care, lab, diagnostics, pharmacy and some specialty services, according to the Herald.
