She said Arizona and the country can do better, and linked this back to the prison system issue rarely talked about through the election cycle.\n\n\u201cIt is way past time for states to stop building prisons and start investing in higher education,\" she said.\n\nClinton also touched on the hostility found within this year's campaign. She said the incitement of violence is disheartening, subtly referring to what has been seen at numerous Donald Trump campaign rallies across the country.\n\nOutside the line of Clinton supporters waiting to enter the rally were Donald Trump supporters with signs that said everything from \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d to \u201cHillary Would Eat Her Young To Get Back Into The White House.\u201d\n\nDonald trump supporter Boomer Nida protests at the Hillary Clinton rally held in Phoenix, Arizona on Monday, March 21, 2016. #hillaryclinton #donaldtrump #phoenix #arizona #election #statepress #statepressphoto #politics A photo posted by Jacob Goldstein (@_jacobgoldstein) on Mar 21, 2016 at 6:11pm PDT\n\nGabrielle Giffords and her husband, Commander Mark Kelly, were among the speakers who introduced Clinton before her speech.
