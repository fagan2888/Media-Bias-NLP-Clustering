This Tuesday, January 26th, with the chants of hundreds of thousands of pro-life marchers still ringing in their ears, members of the U.S. House of Representatives will cast a key vote for the future of the unborn.

They will vote on whether to override President Obama’s January 8th veto of H.R. 3762, the “pro-life budget reconciliation bill.” This bill contains a provision that would cut off most federal funds to Planned Parenthood for one year — about $400 million. In addition, the bill would repeal many major parts of the Obamacare law, including the program that provides taxpayer subsidies to about 1,000 health plans that pay for elective abortions.

Many of the hundreds of thousands who walk in the annual March for Life in Washington D.C. on Friday will be also visiting their representatives to encourage them to vote to override Obama’s veto. But we still very much need your voice to add to the cry to cut Planned Parenthood’s funding and to repeal anti-life provisions of Obamacare.
