And she appeared just hours after House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a subpoena and posted a letter calling OPM \u201cuncooperative\u201d in producing documents relating to how the data breach was uncovered\u2014through OPM\u2019s protections or through a private firm called CyTech Services.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, convened the hearing by stressing how \u201ccooperative she and her staff have been with the committee\u2019s oversight efforts.\u201d\n\nEven so, he said, \u201cCongress should not have to tell agency heads that they are responsible for protecting Americans\u2019 most sensitive data. That responsibility should be obvious. Unfortunately, that has not been the case,\u201d Johnson said in citing the steady criticisms of OPM data security from watchdog McFarland. Johnson also nudged the Obama administration to quickly nominate McFarland\u2019s replacement.\n\nA \u2018Toxic\u2019 Agency\n\nJohnson was joined by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who said the view of OPM on the House side is \u201ctoxic.\u201d Lankford complained that many of OPM\u2019s document releases to Congress contain \u201cthousands of unrelated documents, or 10 that are already on a website.\u201d He recommended that OPM negotiate if the agency feels congressional requests are too broad.\n\nCobert said she had not yet read the letter but noted \u201cwe are working actively to respond.\u201d She added that OPM had shown the documents in question to lawmakers in an \u201cin camera\u201d private setting and that discussion is ongoing. \u201cWe are committed to a good relationship and dialogue,\u201d she said.\n\nRanking member Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., reeled off a summary of the thousands of pages of documents, testimony and briefings OPM has already produced since the June data breach.\n\nJohnson pressed Cobert to address the national security risks of the breach, citing the vulnerability of intelligence community employees to blackmail. He mentioned new restrictions on employee use of Facebook and personal email at work due to cyber risks.\n\nCobert said follow-up to the data breach is a \u201ccritical priority\u201d that needs to be done carefully, taking all input, especially from the National Counterterrorism Center. She said she met with IG McFarland on her first day and continued biweekly meetings. \u201cWe all need to change the way we work,\u201d Cobert added. \u201cI cannot access my personal Gmail account from my work computer. These simple actions make an enormous difference.\u201d\n\nShe praised the Homeland Security Department\u2019s cybersecurity programs, particularly U.S. CERT. \u201cI\u2019m impressed with the incredible interagency effort to help us respond,\u201d giving us help on how to prioritize and take advantage of the tools in the software called Einstein. \u201cWe also are bringing cyber talent into the government, with the flexibility Congress created,\u201d she said, to which Carper replied, \u201cThat is music to my ears.\u201d\n\nOngoing Management Problems\n\nOPM\u2019s processing of retirement claims, Lankford said, is too slow. Cobert responded that progress has been made in recent months by raising to 25 percent the portion of actions (changing an address or a bank account number) that retirees can perform for themselves online. She said the goal is to process 90 percent of retirement claims within 60 days.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., questioned why major IT cybersecurity contracts weren\u2019t being rebid and criticized the security clearance process, recounting the tale of a young constituent who landed a job in climate change at the State Department, but who may lose it due to a holdup in his background check.\n\nCobert reminded her that the State Department runs its own background checks. But OPM is being selective in addressing the backlog of \u201cdumped\u201d or incomplete background checks it received from a now-fired contractor, \u201cusing a balance between contractors and employees.\u201d\n\nAsked about the Obama administration\u2019s recently announced decision to move oversight of background checks to a new organization run by the Defense Department, Cobert said, \u201cit\u2019s a shared process,\u201d with the National Background Investigations Bureau being housed at OPM but directed by Pentagon security experts.\n\nThe issue of whether to continue trimming the number of employees who need security clearances is a decision for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, she said.\n\nAsked about reducing the federal workforce\u2019s skill gaps, Cobert said, \u201cBringing in great talent has been a rich part of my career.\u201d She said she recognizes that professional development impacts public service, and that \u201cthe incredible scale and complexity of issues is challenging but also rewarding, in creating opportunities.\u201d\n\nOn the controversial issue of overuse of administrative leave, she said OPM is seeking to train managers to use it as a \u201cis tool of last resort.\u201d They should understand the different types of leave track them better, she added.\n\nThe USAJobs website, which Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, criticized as offputting for its key word requirements and job descriptions geared more to insiders, is undergoing improvements, Cobert said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not where we want it to be.\u201d\n\nChairman Johnson had no success getting Cobert\u2014who\u2019s been at OPM only six months\u2014to opine on an earlier agency decision to use \u201cmental gymnastics\u201d to interpret the Affordable Care Act. He introduced for the record a letter from Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has held up nominees in protest of OPM\u2019s move to allow 1,600 congressional staffers to avoid using the District of Columbia Obamacare exchanges and receive employer health care through their employers, like agency staff do.\n\nThat brought a rebuttal from Carper, who defended the practice on equity grounds, but Cobert said the issue predated her tenure.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
