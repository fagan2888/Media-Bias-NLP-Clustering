Andrew Taylor/G20 Australia via Getty Images\n\nHappy Monday, the 321st day of 2014 and, according to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s estimate, just 57 more days until Hillary Clinton decides whether to end her political fan dance and officially announce she\u2019s running for president. A nation breathlessly awaits. With that, here\u2019s today\u2019s Three Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in less time than it takes to poach an egg:\n\nWhere\u2019s My Pen: Ending what arguably was his most successful foreign tour to date, President Barack Obama returns to Washington from the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, with a couple of nice souvenirs, including a climate change deal with China and memories of superstar mob scenes like the ones that used to happen here when he was still popular. Expect Obama to use a bit of his rediscovered swagger to make good on a vow to change immigration policy - and call Republicans\u2019 bluff to fight him - as early as this week. Why now? Why not, according to Politico\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Carrie Budoff Brown:\n\nDemocrats no longer have to worry that the Senate runoff in Louisiana will tip the balance of power. The West Wing assumes Republicans will use immigration to gum up the government funding bill no matter when Obama announces the executive actions. And the pressure to move quickly only intensified this week as details of the plan leaked, giving Republicans free rein to bloody it.\n\n\u201cPure Evil\u201d: Obama returns home to the release of another disturbing, gruesome videotape showing the beheading of Peter Kaessig, an American aid worker and former Army Ranger who had been held captive in Syria, an act the president condemned. The new tape - the fifth such execution of a Western hostage since summer - will prompt a lot of questions about the president\u2019s \u201cno boots on the ground\u201d strategy in Iraq and Syria.\n\n[READ: House Passes Keystone Bill]\n\nKey to Keystone: Also on the horizon for the White House - a possible Senate vote on the Keystone XL pipeline, a deal to which the president gave a severe frowning while overseas. Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said senators are scrounging for the last of 60 votes they\u2019ll need to approve the Canada-to-Louisiana oil conduit, but Durbin said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that Obama is probably going to veto this one.\n\nWhat About Mary?: The pipeline\u2019s a lifeline to Sen. Mary Landrieu of, a Louisiana, the aforementioned Democratic senator who\u2019s in a tight runoff election set for next month. While Landrieueau can trumpet her Keystone vote in her oil-rich state to constituents to convince them she\u2019s on the move, not a whole lot of people think it\u2019s actually going to work: Landrieu is trailing Republican challenger Bill Cassidy by double digits.\n\nICYMI Brisbane: Following up on his China climate change deal in Beijing, the president worked on the Aussies while he was in Brisbane, urging them to to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and got some backup from other G20 nations in his beef with Russian President Vladimir Putin (see below). And Obama got some quality time with a koala bear. No word on whether the bear was a disillusioned Obama voter who went Republican in the 2014 midterms.\n\nSidebar - Putin on the Fritz: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised his nation he\u2019d \u201cshirtfront\u201d (Australian for \u201csmackdown\u201d) Putin over the Ukraine war (27 Aussies died in the Malaysian Airlines flight shot down last summer) but Twitter smacked Abbott for posing with the Russian president and a couple koalas at the G20 instead. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper then showed Abbott how it\u2019s done: \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll shake your hand,\u201d he tersely told Vlad the Invader at a meet-and-greet, \u201cbut I have only one thing to say: you need to get out of Ukraine.\u201d He also blurred one line between parody and reality.\n\n[OPINION: We're in a Cold War With Vladimir Putin, Not Russia]\n\nTalk Soup: Plenty to talk about on the Sunday shows - Islamic State group, immigration, Obama\u2019s trip, the never-ending 2014 midterms - but the top quote this weekend belongs to Sen Al Franken. The Minnesota Democrat took his colleague, Sen. Ted Cruz, to task for Cruz\u2019s statement that Obama\u2019 declaration on net neutrality was like \u201cObamacare for the Internet\u201d: \u201c[Cruz] has it completely wrong, and he just doesn\u2019t understand what the issue is.\u201d More from the talkies here, courtesy of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nChuck Todd, Call Your Office: Speaking of talkies, about a month after a highly-publicized shake-up in which NBC sent host David Gregory packing, some preliminary numbers show Meet The Press is still languishing on Sunday morning, finishing way behind CBS\u2019 Face the Nation and ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\nTweet of the Weekend: David Axelrod served up a backhand to Jonathan Gruber, an Obamacare architect who\u2019s on video suggesting the \u201cstupidity\u201d of American voters let the White House to pass the Affordable Care Act. \u201cAs one who worked hard to make the ACA and its benefits clear,\u201d tweets Ax, \u201clet me say: if you looked up stupid in dictionary, you\u2019d find Gruber\u2019s picture.\u201d\n\nStat of the Day: Number of people killed by police in the United States so far this year: 408.
