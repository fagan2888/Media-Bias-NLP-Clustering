What do you get?\n\nIn California\u2019s case, a $179 million computer modernization project that has to be junked.\n\nThe project, which went to bid in 2007 and still is far from completion, was to process claims for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health-payment program for low-income residents.\n\nIt finally was put to rest this week when the state Department of Health Care Services announced a legal settlement with Xerox Corp., the project contractor, under which Xerox will pay the state approximately $120 million. (The state had paid Xerox $9 million so far, $8.1 of it with federal funds.)\n\nThat means Medi-Cal\u2019s existing computer system \u2014 creaky, patched-together and, decades old \u2014 will continue to operate for however long it takes the state to contract out and build a replacement.\n\nAccording to the settlement, Xerox will continue to run the existing system until 2019.\n\nThe health care services department is putting a bright face on the project\u2019s demise calling it an \u201copportunity\u201d to reevaluate current needs, it in a press release issued Monday. A fresh start, it went on, will ensure \u201cmodern, robust and sustainable system.\u201d\n\nThe department noted California\u2019s not the only state with such problems: \u201cMany other states \u2026 have adjusted their strategies\u201d toward their Medicaid computer systems, the release said. Medi-Cal is California\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\nIndeed, Xerox\u2019s problems with its Medicaid systems in Texas, Alaska and other states have been widely publicized.\n\nThe DHCS declined to comment beyond the press release. The settlement requires the department and Xerox both approve in advance any public statement for the next 30 days.\n\nIn its statement, Xerox said the settlement agreement finalizes the announcement it made last fall \u201cthat it did not expect to complete implementation of the Health Enterprise Platform in California.\u201d Xerox further said that it is \u201cpleased to work with DHCS to continue processing Medi-Cal claims through September 2019.\u201d\n\nThe existing computer system, more than 30 years old, handles millions of transactions a day for Medi-Cal, everything from approving medical procedures and paying doctors to determining patient eligibility for the program.\n\nPersistent problems came to a head two years ago when a backlog of nearly a million Medi-Cal applications caused untold numbers of patients to put off seeing their doctors until the problems were resolved.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s drawn-out competition for the replacement project began in 2007. Xerox won the contract in 2010. By 2012, the project was already in trouble. Delays caused the state to impose on Xerox a \u201ccorrective action plan. \u201d\n\nOriginally scheduled for completion by the end of this year, the project isn\u2019t close to done, the settlement indicates.\n\nIts not uncommon for government computer systems to fall behind schedule, in part because of red tape. In this case, the massive Medi-Cal replacement contract with Xerox was inked just five days before President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. As new regulations under the law worked their way through the health care system, requirements for the Medi-Cal project continued to change.\n\nCompounding matters, Xerox itself fell into deep trouble. Its stock has lagged far behind the market in general. The company is under pressure from investor activist Carl Icahn. Late last year, Xerox said it would wind down its Medicaid computer systems business in California and Montana, take a $385 million charge against earnings, and \u201cfocus on profitable market segments.\u201d That meant the end of the California project.\n\nSeveral companies compete in the Medicaid system market. As of February, Xerox was the number-two provider, covering 11 states. The leader, HP Enterprise Systems, covers 18.\n\nXerox will pay California about $103 million in cash, provide computer hardware and software worth $15 million, and abandon requests for payment worth roughly $5 million more.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Combine years of delay, ever-changing rules and requirements, state and federal red tape\u00a0and a once-mighty company now in deep financial trouble.
