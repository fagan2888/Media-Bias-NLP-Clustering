Think back to the 2012 presidential campaign when an opposition researcher unearthed the now-viral video of Republican candidate Mitt Romney delivering his infamous 47 percent comment.\n\nRelated: Think Negative Campaign Ads Work? Think Again\n\n\u201cYou want to find information that will cause media attention\u2014something that will force the opponent off message. The more they\u2019re off message, the less likely they are able to be successful in their campaign,\u201d Larry Zilliox, founder and chief executive officer of Investigative Research Specialists LLC, said.\n\nZilliox should know. He wrote the book on it.\n\nSeriously, Zilliox is the author of the \"Opposition Researcher Handbook.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only opposition research handbook out there!\u201d he said.\n\nZilliox came to Washington, D.C. in the early 1990s to do private investigative work but found that the market was saturated with private investigators\u2014\u201clots of retired agents and federal guys doing a lot of work for little money.\u201d\n\nHe decided he had to specialize in something, so he turned to campaigns. Since then, he\u2019s dug up dirt on everyone from local candidates running for city auditor to gubernatorial and congressional candidates across the country.\n\n\u201cNothing surprises me anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nNow he\u2019s basically the oppo research guru. He has his own research firm, he\u2019s penned four editions of the \"Opposition Research Handbook\" and he instructs an opposition research boot camp, where he grooms classes of oppo- researcher-wannabees several times a year.\n\nRelated: Key Dem Donors Turned Off by PAC Tactics\n\nThe first thing he tells his class\u2014which is usually made up of private investigators, campaign staffers and \u201cpolitical types\u201d clamoring to get their hands on the next big juicy nugget that could bring down a campaign, is to \u201cnever do something you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable disclosing to a reporter on the evening news.\u201d\n\nBarring illegal activity, Zilliox said very few things are off limits, but of course, there are standards.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s illegal just don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re not there to cause a scene. You just want the opponent to come off message,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not a spy. You\u2019re a researcher.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s on assignment, Zilliox said one of the first things he does is research his own client to anticipate what the opposing campaigns might uncover.\n\n\u201cIn politics the surprised look is often confused with the guilty look, Zilliox said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for a candidate to have opposition on themselves so they know how the opponent will treat that information.\u201d\n\nHow Growing Partisanship Is Splitting the U.S. in Two\n\nPolitical strategist Brian Gottlieb of Purple Insights agrees and says finding out about your opponent is only half the job.\n\n\u201cIt is important to know what the other side can find out about you so that your campaign can plan against potential attacks,\u201d Gottlieb said. Without oppo research, \u201ccampaigns are left flying blind.\u201d\n\nZilliox and other oppo researchers use all kinds of resources for their work, from the basics like court records and voting history to social media like Facebook and Twitter. \u201cPeople post things online showing things they\u2019ve done years ago\u2014like using drugs or earning money as exotic dancers. It\u2019s all out there,\u201d Zilliox said. He added that the problem now is that there\u2019s so much data and information online that it can sometimes be difficult to sort through the noise.\n\n\u201cYou can spend a lot of time looking for things on the Internet...of course one way or another you always end up at a cat video,\u201d he joked.\n\nRelated: Obama Is Funding the Kochs\u2019 War on Democrats\n\nThough Zilliox frames himself solely as a researcher that simply provides information to campaigns, and ultimately, the public, his entire industry is typically thought of as part of the dark side of politics. After all, most of the content used in attack ads would never surface without opposition researchers.\n\nPolls suggest that the public thinks negative ads hurt the country. At the height of the 2012 presidential election season, 74 percent of Americans said they believed campaigns have become more and more negative over time. And 64 percent of Americans said this negativity causes \"a great deal\" or \"a significant amount\" of harm to the country's political process, according to a Knights of Columbus-Marist survey.\n\nWhen asked if he has ever been concerned that what he does is, indeed, harmful to the political process, Zilliox quickly said \u201cno,\u201d adding that campaigns believe it\u2019s essential work.\n\n\u201cTheir metrics that measure return on investment show them that it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Zilliox said. He also made clear that campaigns ultimately decide what goes public. \u201cI just do the research.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The campaign season is heating up and lurking quietly behind the scenes are teams of o", "title": "Meet the Guy Who Can Dig Up the Next Political Scandal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/Meet-Guy-Who-Can-Dig-Next-Political-Scandal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01132014_ClintonLewinski.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/Meet-Guy-Who-Can-Dig-Next-Political-Scandal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01132014_ClintonLewinski.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The campaign season is heating up and lurking quietly behind the scenes are teams of o", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s the only opposition research handbook out there!\u201d he said.\nNow he\u2019s basically the oppo research guru.\nHe has his own research firm, he\u2019s penned four editions of the \"Opposition Research Handbook\" and he instructs an opposition research boot camp, where he grooms classes of oppo- researcher-wannabees several times a year.\n\u201cPeople post things online showing things they\u2019ve done years ago\u2014like using drugs or earning money as exotic dancers.\nThink Again\u201cYou want to find information that will cause media attention\u2014something that will force the opponent off message."}
