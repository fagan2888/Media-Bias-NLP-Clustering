The Defense Department pays the Canadian company $254 million, the EPA $58 million and the Justice Department $36 million. In comparison, in 2008, under President George W. Bush, CGI contracts totaled only $16.5 million for all federal departments and agencies.\n\nThe interesting question is why Obama dumped 1.4 billion in taxpayer money on a company this incompetent and ignored all the warnings.\n\nIt's one more thing that ought to be investigated.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Why did Obama dump 1.4 billion in taxpayer money on a company this incompetent?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Why did Obama dump 1.4 billion in taxpayer money on a company this incompetent?", "title": "$634 Million ObamaCare Website Company was Fired by Canada", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/207177/634-million-obamacare-website-company-was-fired-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:49:17-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/207177/634-million-obamacare-website-company-was-fired-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Why did Obama dump 1.4 billion in taxpayer money on a company this incompetent?", "card": "summary", "title": "$634 Million ObamaCare Website Company was Fired by Canada"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-12T17:14:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:49:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Defense Department pays the Canadian company $254 million, the EPA $58 million and the Justice Department $36 million.\nSo Obama took a Canadian company that Canadian officials fired for screwing up their health care website and gave it a much bigger job.\nCanadian provincial health officials last year fired the parent company of CGI Federal, the prime contractor for the problem-plagued Obamacare health exchange websites, the Washington Examiner has learned.\nIn comparison, in 2008, under President George W.
