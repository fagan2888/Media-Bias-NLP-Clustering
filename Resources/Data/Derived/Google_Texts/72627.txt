Leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee asked Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to collect, analyze and publish more data about the mental health of Medicare beneficiaries.

In a letter to Slavitt, Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) and Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) pushed for the agency to make the data more accessible so that providers can more easily help patients and Congress can better understand the issues beneficiaries face.

CMS has made significant progress making some Medicare data more accessible, the letter reads, but the lawmakers said the data related to mental health should be “more granular.”

“Medicare needs to continue to ensure treatment of the mental and behavioral health issues that our seniors face, including partial hospitalizations and traditional outpatient and inpatient visits to behavioral health providers,” they write. “CMS has not yet published data to the same extent as with other health conditions; such data would be beneficial for policy makers. Federal restrictions and regulations that prevent the accessibility of this data needs to be reformed and brought into the 21st century.”
