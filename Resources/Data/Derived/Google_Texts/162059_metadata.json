We\u2019re also working with Facebook, who tells us that since the first Republican debate, more than 58 million people have joined the political conversation online.\n\nMore than 9 million are talking specifically about the economy.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThe candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls. Those standings determining their position on the stage. And here they are. At center stage, businessman Donald Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nNeurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nBusinesswoman Carly Fiorina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nAnd Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nTonight\u2019s rules are simple. Up to 90 second for each answer. One minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you\u2019ll here this.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nIt sounds like a game show but it\u2019s not.\n\nNow I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room, and I\u2019m not talking about your party\u2019s fine symbol. I\u2019m talking about the purpose of tonight\u2019s debate.\n\nThe economy and what each of you would do to improve it. No more, no less. We are focused on those issues, and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words. That is the agenda tonight. How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow.\n\nAnd so we begin. Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well. They\u2019re demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Just a few hours ago, near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.\n\nMr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nI can\u2019t be Neil. And the and the reason I can\u2019t be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I\u2019ve come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It\u2019s going to be a tremendous plan. I think it\u2019ll make our country and our economy very dynamic.\n\nBut, taxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can\u2019t do it.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSo do not raise the minimum wage?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nI would not do it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nDr. Carson, you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery. And this Facebook map show Americans share your concern. The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation, especially here in the state of Wisconsin.\n\nYou suggested one minimum wage does not fit all, and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people. Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less. Where are you?\n\nCARSON:\n\nWell, first of all, delighted to be here. My family\u2019s here, and my little granddaughter, who\u2019s three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate. So this is very cool.\n\nAs far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly a problem in the black community. Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. You know, that \u2014 and that\u2019s because of those high wages. If you lower those wages, that comes down.\n\nYou know, I can remember, as a youngster \u2014 you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs. But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.\n\nBut what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual. And that\u2019s what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.\n\nThat\u2019s what we need to be thinking about. How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSo, sir, just to be clear, you would not raise it?\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nI would not raise it. I would not raise it, specifically because I\u2019m interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSenator Rubio, you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways, including free health care, free college and a host of other government-paid benefits. Since you aren\u2019t a fan of all they\u2019re giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nWell, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they\u2019re related.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times before, my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren\u2019t well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves.\n\nRUBIO:\n\nWe call that the American dream, but in fact, it\u2019s a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people.\n\nWhat makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.\n\nThe problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn\u2019t. In the 20th century, it\u2019s a disaster.\n\nIf you raise the minimum wage, you\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that\u2019s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.\n\nHere\u2019s the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIf we do that \u2014 and if we do this \u2014 if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nThank you, Senator Rubio.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nWe\u2019ve asked people on Facebook to submit their questions for the candidates. Seth Bell wrote, \u201cWe are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?\u201d Governor Kasich, you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton. Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably. Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years. Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency. With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that, in the state of Ohio \u2014 and I\u2019m the only acting executive on \u2014 on this stage today \u2014 we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage. And I got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. He died of black lung. He was losing his eyesight. My mother\u2019s mother lived with us. She could barely speak English. I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work. An economic theory is fine, but you know what? People need help.\n\nNow, I have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt. I have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan \u2014 the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.\n\nAnd, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them. Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We\u2019ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.\n\nYes, lower taxes, lower spending. My website, JohnKasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect, and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason. When you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work.\n\nAnd our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their God-given potential. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important.\n\nAnd for those at the bottom, we\u2019ve got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. But to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges, and we\u2019ve gotten it done in our state, and I will do it for America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nDid you want to name any specific steps, sir?\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nSure. We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth. And I have a whole series of ways to do that. In Ohio, we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn\u2019t cut one benefit or didn\u2019t take anybody off the rolls. Why? Because we\u2019re innovators. I\u2019ve been an innovator my entire career.\n\nAnd I really don\u2019t care what special interests or lobbyists have to say. I have a job to do when I take over a public office. Now, we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years. We also put an increase in defense spending. Our tax cuts balance out. And at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget.\n\nAnd I want everybody here to know, when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington, I stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth. And as governor of Ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nI\u2019ll do it in Washington. I\u2019ve done it twice; I\u2019ll do it thrice for the United States of America.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nSenator Cruz, the International Monetary Fund recently cut its expectations for economic growth. Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing. The next president will have to deal with it. You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion. You\u2019re calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax. What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs?\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nWell, Maria, it\u2019s great to be with you. It\u2019s great to be here in Milwaukee. You know, the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have \u2014 face, which is, how do we get the economy growing? How do we bring back economic growth?\n\nBecause economic growth, it\u2019s foundational to every other challenge we have. As you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. The Obama economy is a disaster, and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal. It doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nIf you look at the history of America, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. The first is tax reform. And as you noted, I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.\n\nThe second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.\n\nAnd the third element is sound money. Every time we\u2019ve pursued all three of those \u2014 whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan \u2014 the result has been incredible economic growth. We have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nExcuse me.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nGovernor Bush\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nYeah, I would like to make a comment.\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nYou\u2019ve already made two comments, John. It\u2019s my turn.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nWe have more questions for you, Governor Kasich, coming up. We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich.\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nI got about four minutes in the last debate. I\u2019m going to get my question right now.\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nI appreciate it, Jeb. I\u2019m all of you. But I want at some point to talk about a value-added tax and $11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point. So I would like to talk about it at some point, because that\u2019s what leadership is.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nWe will \u2014 we will certainly get to that. Governor Bush?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nAlmost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking. Many have given up. That\u2019s what the participation rate tells us. You\u2019ve said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth, which we haven\u2019t seen since the year 2000. What specific regulations would you change? And how will that lead to jobs and growth?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nFirst of all, we could get to 4 percent growth. The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don\u2019t have makes \u2014 makes the deficit grow.\n\nA 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. And the proposal that I\u2019ve laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. We cut the \u2014 we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above \u2014 below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing. It would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higher-wage jobs, and so that\u2019s part of it.\n\nOn the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd start over. For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.\n\nThe clean power act, we ought to repeal that and \u2014 and start over on that. The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that. We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit.\n\nBUSH:\n\nAnd if we\u2019re serious about being serious about high growth, then we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than \u2014 than are \u2014 than are being set up.\n\nHillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama\u2019s policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now aren\u2019t working or have given up altogether, as you said. That\u2019s not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. That\u2019s not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it\u2019s not the best America can do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nMs. Fiorina, while you\u2019ve all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president\u2019s jobs performance.\n\nNow, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month. Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month. Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month. If you win the nomination, you\u2019ll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\nWell, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day. I would guess she was 40 years old. She had several children. And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my children\u2019s future. And that really struck me. This is America. A mother is going to bed afraid for her children\u2019s future.\n\nAnd the reason she\u2019s afraid for her children\u2019s future is because we\u2019ve had problems for a long time. Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats. But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. This isn\u2019t about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now. It\u2019s about actually challenging the status quo of big government.\n\nBig government has created a big business called politics. And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics.\n\nSpecifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again. We need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe need to actually reform the tax code. Go to a three-page tax code. Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages. In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books. That hasn\u2019t been done in 50 years. We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one. We\u2019ve become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.\n\nAnd finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance. All this has to be done, and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done. We must take our government back.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you. Thank you. Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States. Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers. Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker. Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nAbsolutely. And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst. It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nStates run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats. So the thing is, let\u2019s look for root causes.\n\nBut I would also say \u2014 lay some blame at the \u2014 the feet of the Federal Reserve. I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse. By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. They\u2019re actually talking now about negative interest.\n\nThe money as it\u2019s created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York. And because we\u2019re now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. So what we\u2019re finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.\n\nWe also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you\u2019re finding is that, if you\u2019re poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you\u2019re trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.\n\nSo really we need to reexamine whether we not \u2014 we want a Federal Reserve that\u2019s involved so much in determining interest rates. We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.\n\nBut the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nAll right. We\u2019re only just getting started. Coming up, your taxes. Stick around. You\u2019re watching FOX Business\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nWelcome back to the Milwaukee Theater and the Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s get right back to our questions.\n\nDr. Carson, to you. You recently railed against the double- standard in the media, sir, that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to then-Senator Barack Obama\u2019s. Still, as a candidate whose brand has always been trust, are you worried your campaign \u2014 which you\u2019ve always said, sir, is bigger than you \u2014 is now being hurt by you?\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nWell, first of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nI\u2019ll just forget that follow-up there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nThe fact of the matter is, you know, what \u2014 we should vet all candidates.\n\nCARSON:\n\nI have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I don\u2019t even mind that so much, if they do it about \u2014 with everybody, like people on the other side. But, you know, when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video.\n\nWhere I came from, they call that a lie. And\u2026\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nI think that\u2019s very different from, you know, somebody misinterpreting, when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point, that is the words that they used. But, I\u2019ve had many people come and say the same thing to me.\n\nThat is what people do in those situations. We have to start treating people the same, and finding out what people really think and what they\u2019re made of. People who know me know that I\u2019m an honest person.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nThank you, Dr. Carson.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nMr. Trump, a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration\u2019s plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally. The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nAt the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy, what will you do about it?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nI was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down. That was an unbelievable decision.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we don\u2019t have enough of those decisions coming down. He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders.\n\nThat was a great day. And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration. It\u2019s hurting us economically. It\u2019s hurting us from every standpoint. It\u2019s causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.\n\nAnd it really is \u2014 was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1 decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened.\n\nAnd I will tell you, we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be successful. And if you think walls don\u2019t work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nCan we just send 5 million people back with no effect on economy?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nYou are going to have to bring people \u2014 you are going to have to send people out. Look, we\u2019re a country\u2026\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nSo what will you do?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nMaria, we\u2019re a country of laws. We either have a country or we don\u2019t have a country. We are a country of laws. Going to have to go out and they will come back but they are going to have to go out and hopefully they get back.\n\nBut we have no choice if we\u2019re going to run our country properly and if we\u2019re going to be a country.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nMaria, can we comment on that?\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nSenator Rubio\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nCan we comment on that?\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nYes, one quick comment, yes.\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nWell, look, in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here, if they were law-abiding, could stay. But, what didn\u2019t happen is we didn\u2019t build the walls effectively and we didn\u2019t control the border. We need to. We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.\n\nBut if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico \u2014 to Mexico, think about the families. Think about the children.\n\nSo, you know what the answer really is? If they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty. They get to stay. We protect the wall. Anybody else comes over, they go back.\n\nBut for the 11 million people, come on, folks. We all know you can\u2019t pick them up and ship them across, back across the border. It\u2019s a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nAll I can say is, you\u2019re lucky in Ohio that you struck oil. That is for one thing.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. \u201cI like Ike,\u201d right? The expression. \u201cI like Ike.\u201d Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back.\n\nTRUMP:\n\nMoved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn\u2019t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDwight Eisenhower. You don\u2019t get nicer. You don\u2019t get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nGovernor Bush\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nJerry, Gerald, it was an attack.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN)\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to have my back, I\u2019m going to have my back.\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN)\n\nA couple things here. First of all\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nGovernor \u2014 Governor, you\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nYou should let Jeb speak.\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN)\n\nWe have grown \u2014 we have grown\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nNo, it\u2019s unfair.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nIn the state of Ohio, the state of Ohio, we have grown 347,000 jobs. Our unemployment is half of what it was. Our fracking industry, energy industry may have contributed 20,000, but if Mr. Trump understood that the real jobs come in the downstream, not in the upstream, but in the downstream. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get our jobs.\n\nBut Ohio is diversified. And little false little things, sir, they don\u2019t really work when it comes to the truth. So the fact is, all I\u2019m suggesting, we can\u2019t ship 11 million people out of this country. Children would be terrified, and it will not work.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026 built an unbelievable company worth billions and billions of dollars. I don\u2019t have to hear from this man, believe me. I don\u2019t have to hear from him.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nMr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you yourself \u2014 you yourself said let Governor Bush speak. Governor Bush?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nThank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate. That\u2019s really nice of you. Really appreciate that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat a generous man you are. Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not \u2014 not possible. And it\u2019s not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we\u2019re not the kind of country that I know America is.\n\nAnd even having this conversation sends a powerful signal \u2014 they\u2019re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That\u2019s the problem with this. We have to win the presidency. And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there. What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status where they pay a fine, where they work, where they don\u2019t commit crimes, where they learn English, and over an extended period of time, they earn legal status. That\u2019s the path \u2014 a proper path\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nSenator Rubio? Senator\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nWe have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country. Very, very unfair to the people that want to come into our country legally. They\u2019ve gone through the process. They\u2019re on line. They\u2019re waiting. Very, very unfair to them. That I can tell you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nSenator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me \u2014 let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country. The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology. Americans are anxious that the new economy isn\u2019t producing higher-paying jobs. Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away. How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nWell, you know, that\u2019s an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn. We are living through a massive economic transformation. I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just a different economy. It\u2019s changing faster than ever. You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that. There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we\u2019re not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.\n\nOur higher education system is completely outdated. It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn\u2019t teach 21st century skills. If we do what needs to be done \u2014 tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. And we won\u2019t just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And then truly this new century can be a new American century.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you. Senator Cruz \u2014 Senator Cruz, entitlements. You\u2019ve argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group\u2026\n\n(AUDIO GAP)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be different this time?\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nWell, my Mom is here, so I don\u2019t think we should be pushing any grannies off cliffs.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd, you miss-stated what I\u2019ve said on entitlement reform. What I\u2019ve said is for seniors we should make no changes whatsoever, for younger workers we should gradually raise the retirement age, we should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026I said for future retirees was your statement\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nI want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because, you know, what was said was right. The democrats are laughing \u2014 because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd, you know, I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn\u2019t often see it as an economic issue. But, I can tell you for millions \u2014 of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And, I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande.\n\n(AUDIENCE REACTION)\n\nOr if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press.\n\n(AUDIENCE REACTION)\n\n(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\n\nThen, we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And, I will say for those of us who believe people \u2018ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we\u2019re tired of being told it\u2019s anti-immigrant. It\u2019s offensive.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\u2026to seek the American dream. And, we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law \u2014 and I would note, try going illegally to another country. Try going to China, or Japan. Try going to Mexico. See what they do. Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we\u2019re not going to enforce the laws\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\u2026And we\u2019re going to drive down the wages for millions of hardworking men and women. That is abandoning the working\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nWe go back to Facebook. Dewayne Wesley Cato asks on Facebook, how do we get rid of regulations choking our businesses? Ms. Fiorina?\n\nSpecifically, under the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance, or be fined. Many are opting to pay the fine. Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether. What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business?\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\nWell, first Obamacare has to be repealed because it\u2019s failing\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2026it\u2019s failing the very people it was intended to help, but, also, it is croney-capitalism at its worst. Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government. See, that\u2019s what happens. As government gets bigger, and bigger \u2014 and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike \u2014 and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.\n\nSo, we have to repeal it. It\u2019s tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests. Then, we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool. We need to try the one thing in health insurance we\u2019ve never tried. Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies.\n\nWe need to try the free market. The free market. Where people actually have to compete.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd, we \u2018ought to have the government ensure that you must \u2014 and I don\u2019t use that term often, that government \u2018ought to do something, but every healthcare provider \u2018ought to publish its costs, its prices, its outcomes, because as patients we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re buying.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, let me just say \u2014 let me just say, I know more about innovation and entrepreneurship than anyone on this panel because I have led innovative businesses in the most highly competitive industry in the world for decades. The truth is the secret sauce of America is innovation, and entrepreneurship, it is why we must cut our government down to size, and hold it accountable. It\u2019s why we have to take our government back, because innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73,000 page tax code. It is crushed\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\u2026by regulatory thicket that is so vast we don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in it anymore. It is crushed as well by government bureaucrats who don\u2019t do their jobs very well, and who are not held accountable, which is why I\u2019ve said we got to take our government back, and to do that, we have to know where every dollar being spent, and be able to move any dollar. We have to hack through this regulatory thicket, repeal so much, but, also, know what\u2019s in that regulatory thicket \u2014 we don\u2019t even know what regulations have been passed.\n\nThird, we need to build a meritocracy \u2014 Scott Walker, by the way, is trying now to do in Wisconsin\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\u2026Finally, we need to get to a three page tax code, and, yes, that plan exists.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nJust to be clear, you want to repeal Obamacare\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\n\u2026but, what\u2019s the alternative?\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\nSorry, I can\u2019t hear you.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nJust to be clear, you say you would repeal Obamacare\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026Absolutely\u2026\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\n\u2026But, what is the alternative\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026You need to give\u2026\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\n\u2026and how does that help small business\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\nThe alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help. Look, I\u2019m a cancer survivor, OK? I understand that you cannot have someone who\u2019s battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn\u2019t helping anyone.\n\nWe\u2019re throwing more, and more people into Medicaid, and fewer, and fewer doctors are taking those payments.\n\nFIORINA:\n\nThe point is Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we\u2019ve never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers\u2026\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\n\u2026Thank you\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026that we have information to shop wisely for our health care.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nAlright, thank you. We\u2019re going to take a break here. Coming up, a big issue many Americans are facing, taxes. The Republican Presidential Debate continues now, live, from Milwaukee.\n\n(MUSIC)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nWelcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee. Let\u2019s get back to the questions. And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year, taxes. And this will go to several of you.\n\nOne of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes. Facebook data certainly backs that up. Once again the green on this map that we\u2019re going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation, especially here in Wisconsin.\n\nFirst off, Dr. Carson, to you. You say you are in favor of a tax system, I guess akin to tithing, sir, with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said, if everybody pays this, I think God is a pretty fair guy, so tithing is a pretty fair process.\n\nBut Donald Trump says that is not fair. That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it\u2019s a fair thing to do. So whose plan would God endorse then, Doctor?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYours or Mr. Trump\u2019s?\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nWell, you know, when I say tithing, I\u2019m talking about the concept of proportionality.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nRight.\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nEverybody should pay the same proportion of what they make. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. You get same rights and privileges.\n\nI don\u2019t see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that. But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another. And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.\n\nNow I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction. But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.\n\nAnd they say there will be no more charitable giving. We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that. The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in people\u2019s pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous. And it\u2019s\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2026 the money that they earned.\n\nAnd, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people. And in the system that we\u2019re putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level. But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.\n\nThis is the land of dreams. And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSenator Paul, you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an across-the-board 14.5 percent fair and flat tax. You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that\u2019s the idea. You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.\n\nBut don\u2019t you risk, sir, creating a near-term budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nWell, it\u2019s a great question, Neil, and thanks for including me in the tax debate.\n\nI think what\u2019s important about the tax debate is, is that we have to ask the question, where is money best spent, in the private sector or in the government sector? I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it. So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nMy tax plan, however, is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan. I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five-year period.\n\nEach of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut. The question came up earlier, where would you cut? Nobody likes to say where they would cut. I\u2019ve put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.\n\nI\u2019m also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we\u2019d just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years. So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget.\n\nPAUL:\n\nWhat is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax. Democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000.\n\nThat\u2019s proportionality, as Ben is trying to explain to folks. But the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut. And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nThere are no deductions on your \u2014 under your plan?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nOurs is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals. No payroll tax for the employee. The business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions \u2014 home mortgage and charity.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nThank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nSenator Cruz, there isn\u2019t anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes. Most people just want a fair shake, and they don\u2019t want their money to be wasted.\n\nBut explain how your plan works. How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits?\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nWell, sure, you put your finger on what the problem is. The current system isn\u2019t fair. Washington is fundamentally corrupt. There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible \u2014 and \u2014 and not a one of them is as good.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nEvery one of them reflects a carve-out or a subsidy, and it\u2019s all about empowering the Washington cartel. My simple Flat Tax says that, for a family of four, for the first $36,000 you earn, you pay no taxes whatsoever. No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.\n\nAbove that, every American pays 10 percent across the board \u2014 a flat, fair tax. Which means that no longer do you have hedge-fund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.\n\nOn the business side, I\u2019ve got a business flat tax of 16 percent \u2014 again, that applies across the board. Right now, with our corporate income tax, giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.\n\nThis is fair and across-the-board. Now, you ask, how do the numbers add up? I would encourage folks, if you go to our website, tedcruz.org, we have the specific numbers on the website.\n\nThis plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, eliminates the corporate income tax, and it abolishes the IRS.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the effect of that is incredible economic growth. It means every income group will see double-digit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a single mom, if you\u2019re making $40,000 a year, what that means is an extra about $5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids, to make ends meet. It has a powerful, powerful effect.\n\nAnd there\u2019s one other really powerful feature of my plan, which is that it\u2019s border-adjustable. Which means, if you\u2019re an exporter \u2014 if you\u2019re a farmer, if you\u2019re a rancher, if you\u2019re a manufacturer, you don\u2019t pay the businesses flat tax.\n\nExports are free of that tax, but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax, which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom, and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nBut you haven\u2019t told us how to pay for it.\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nWell, the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which \u2014 which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion.\n\nIt is less than a trillion. It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it\u2019s one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS.\n\nBut on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan. $500 billion in specific cuts \u2014 five major agencies that I would eliminate. The IRS, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and HUD \u2014 and then 25 specific programs.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s on our website at tedcruz.org. You want to look at specificity? It\u2019s easy for everyone to say, \u201ccut spending\u201d. It\u2019s much harder and riskier to put out, chapter and verse, specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, Senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGovernor Bush, Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration. But, Governor Bush, how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda? Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency?\n\nBUSH:\n\nI\u2019m gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country. Of course it\u2019s the highest priority.\n\nIf we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re stuck with the \u201cnew normal\u201d of 2 percent growth. Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it. Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.\n\nIt means \u2014 it means more demands on government \u2014 growing the economy is the first job, if we\u2019re going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. And more importantly, people are really struggling right now.\n\nIn this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks. So yeah, we\u2019ve created jobs, your \u2014 argue (ph) \u2014 brought that up early, and it was a good question. Jobs are being created, but they\u2019re lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.\n\nAnd the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy. I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph), who are supporters of mine. Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard, he is \u2014 he\u2019s in Oklahoma.\n\nReagan Love \u2014 by the way, pretty great name, I think \u2014 is a teacher. When \u2014 if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket \u2014 they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.\n\nImagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite. We would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things \u2014 make things better.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nSenator Rubio. Can I just come to Senator Rubio? We\u2019re coming to you, Mr. Trump, in one second. I \u2014 I promise.\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nSenator Rubio, your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for low-income parents. A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nIsn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t there a risk you\u2019re just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget?\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nThe most important job I\u2019m ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent. Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.\n\nThe most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic), because the most important institution in society is the family. If the family breaks down, society breaks down.\n\nYou can\u2019t have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.\n\nAnd so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.\n\nIt is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more. In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.\n\nThere are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I\u2019m talking about. They don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to make that payment every month, and if they can\u2019t make it, they can\u2019t work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. They don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to save for their kids\u2019 future, to go to college.\n\nAnd so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I\u2019m proud of it. I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the \u2014 in the country, the family.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nNeil, there\u2019s a point I\u2019d like to make here\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2026.Neil, a point that I\u2019d like to make about the tax credits.\n\nWe have to decide what is conservative and what isn\u2019t conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We\u2019re not talking about giving people back their tax money. He\u2019s talking about giving people money they didn\u2019t pay. It\u2019s a welfare transfer payment.\n\nSo here\u2019s what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments \u2014 a new welfare program that\u2019s a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco\u2019s plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nGovernor Kasich? Let me come to Governor Kasich.\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nNo, I\u2019m sorry. No, excuse me. I was there.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nGovernor Kasich.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nVery quickly, Senator.\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nNow I get my 60 seconds to respond. He\u2019s talking about my tax plan.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nPlease.\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nSo let me begin with this. I actually believe \u2014 first of all, this is their money. They do pay. It is refundable, not just against the taxes they pay to the government, but also the \u2014 on their federal income tax, it\u2019s refundable against the payroll tax.\n\nEveryone pays payroll tax. This is their money. This is not our money. And here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand \u2014 if you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.\n\nBut if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we\u2019re not going to recognize that in our tax code? The family is the most important institution in society. And, yes\u2026\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s not very conservative, Marco.\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\n\u2026 I do want to rebuild the American military.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nHow is it conservative?\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nI know that Rand is a committed isolationist. I\u2019m not. I believe the world is a stronger and a better place, when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nYeah, but, Marco! Marco! How is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the federal government that you\u2019re not paying for?\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nBecause\u2026\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nHow is it conservative?\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\n\u2026are you talking about the military, Rand?\n\nPAUL How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You can not be a conservative if you\u2019re going to keep promoting new programs that you\u2019re not going to pay for.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nWe can\u2019t even have an economy if we\u2019re not safe. There are radical jihadist in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, the Chinese taking over the South China Sea\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\n\u2026Yes, I believe the world is a safer \u2014 no, no, I don\u2019t believe, I know that the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military power in the world.\n\n(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nNo. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re any safer \u2014 I do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court. As we go further, and further into debt, we become less, and less safe. This is the most important thing we\u2019re going to talk about tonight. Can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending? Can you be for unlimited military spending, and say, Oh, I\u2019m going to make the country safe? No, we need a safe country, but, you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined?\n\nI want a strong national defense, but I don\u2019t want us to be bankrupt.\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\n\u2026Middle ground that brings both of these together\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026Yes, the middle ground is this\u2026\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\n\u2026Exactly right, that we have to defend this nation. You think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it. That\u2019s a lot more expensive.\n\n(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nBut, you can do that, and pay for it. You can do that, and also be fiscally responsible. You know, I mention that the 25 programs that I put today, that I would eliminate them. Among them are corporate welfare, like sugar subsidies. Let\u2019s take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\n\u2026under roughly 0.2% of the farmland in America, and yet they give 40% of the lobbying money. That sort of corporate welfare is why we\u2019re bankrupting our kids, and grandkids. I would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026Gentleman, we need to move on\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026This is why \u2014 this is why we must combine, actually, zero-based budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine, and cut, and move, every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government, we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time.\n\nAsk yourself this question, how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year, which the federal government has been doing, receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike, and yet, never has enough money to do the important things?\n\nThe answer? All the money\u2019s always spoken for. All the money\u2019s spoken for. So, we have to go to zero-based budgeting, which is a simple idea \u2014 by the way, there\u2019s been a bill for zeros-based (ph) budgeting\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026It exists, it can be voted on. Every dollar must be examined. Any dollar can be cut. Any dollar can be cut, any dollar can be moved. We have to go to a three page tax code. You lower every rate, you close every loophole, why? Because the government uses the tax code to decide winners, and losers. You have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it. You have to know where every single dollar is being spent\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026We need to move\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026Cut where you need to, and invest where you need to\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026We need too\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026The two go hand in hand\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026We do need to move on. Mr. Trump\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nPlease, if I could just\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026Very quick.\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nWe have to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and a long run, it\u2019s going to save us. I agree with Marco, I agree with Ted, we have no choice. And, I can tell you this with certainty. We all have a different tax plan. Some I don\u2019t totally agree with.\n\nOne thing we understand, each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nLet\u2019s talk about \u2014 No, no, Governor, I really must move on. I really want to move on.\n\nMr. Trump, let\u2019s talk about the international economy\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\n\u2026Mr. Baker, everybody got to talk about taxes\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026We really need to move on\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\n\u2026I think you were coming to me and then\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026No, governor, I promise I will come to you\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\n\u2026Look, I hate to crash the party to you, Mr. Baker, but, you know, what\u2019s fair\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026Listen\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\n\u2026Yes, sir\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026Mr. Trump, can I ask you about\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026Yes\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific. You\u2019ve said that you\u2019d rather have no deal\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026Yeah\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026than sign the one that\u2019s on the table\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026It\u2019s a horrible deal\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\n\u2026Most economists \u2014 most economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents. Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nThe TPP is horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It\u2019s a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. It\u2019s 5,600 pages long. So complex that nobodies read it. It\u2019s like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed.\n\nBut this is one of the worst trade deals. And I would, yes, rather not have it. With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, I\u2019d rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better.\n\nWe lose a fortune on trade. The United States loses with everybody. We\u2019re losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan. By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.\n\nSo I must say, Gerard, I just think it\u2019s a terrible deal. I love trade. I\u2019m a free trader, 100 percent. But we need smart people making the deals, and we don\u2019t have smart people making the deals.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThe \u2014 the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published \u2014 were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and these \u2014 the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent. Which \u2014 are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nYes. Well, the currency manipulation they don\u2019t discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster. If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States \u2014 China in particular, because they\u2019re so good. It\u2019s the number-one abuser of this country. And if you look at the way they take advantage, it\u2019s through currency manipulation. It\u2019s not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement. It\u2019s not even discussed.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThere was a separate \u2014 separate\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nAnd as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have. They don\u2019t even discuss it in this agreement.\n\nSo I say, it\u2019s a very bad deal, should not be approved. If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country. We are losing jobs like nobody\u2019s ever lost jobs before. I want to bring jobs back into this country.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nHey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal.\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN)\n\nTrue. It\u2019s true.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nBefore we get a little bit off-kilter here\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nBut isn\u2019t that \u2014 isn\u2019t that part of the problem? When I say, Senator, that if \u2014 if this deal is not ratified by \u2014 by the U.S. \u2014 by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it\u2019s been seeking to do? And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nThere is an argument that China doesn\u2019t like the deal, because in us doing the deal, we\u2019ll be trading with their competitors. You\u2019re exactly right. But I think we\u2019ve sort of missed the point a little bit here.\n\nThere is an important point, though, about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on. We should negotiate from a position of strength. And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us. I think it\u2019s a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals. We give up the power to filibuster, and I\u2019m kind of fond of that power.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe give up the power to amend. And I think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch. Really, Congress is kind of a bystander. We don\u2019t write the rules. We don\u2019t make the laws. The executive branch does. So even in trade \u2014 and I am for trade \u2014 I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you. Thanks, Senator.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nComing up, the biggest threats facing the next commander-in-chief. You\u2019re watching the Republican presidential debate, live tonight from Milwaukee. We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nWelcome back. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. The candidates taking the questions you want answered. Also tonight, you can see what America is saying about the debate. Go to Facebook and type #gopdebate into the search box.\n\nNow, back to the questions. Americans face security threats at home and abroad. Last year, terrorist attacks rose 61 percent, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, with the most deaths occurring in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria.\n\nDr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president\u2019s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nWell, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re called special ops, they\u2019re actually able to guide some of the other things that we\u2019re doing there.\n\nAnd what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.\n\nWe also must recognize that it\u2019s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can\u2019t give up ground right there. But we have to look at this on a much more global scale. We\u2019re talking about global jihadists. And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers? Because that\u2019s the way that they\u2019re able to gather a lot of influence.\n\nAnd I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate. And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if \u2014 outside of Anbar in Iraq, there\u2019s a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I\u2019ve learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.\n\nBut you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nWe asked Facebook to take a look at some of the major issues we\u2019re talking about, and tackling in this debate tonight. This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most. The bigger the word, the more the talk. One of the most discussed issues in the last month, homeland security. Governor Bush, what is the biggest threat facing America today?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nIt is \u2014 I\u2019d say it is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled. That\u2019s the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.\n\nWe should have a no fly zone in Syria. We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army, and create safe zones. If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there, then we \u2018ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe. And, that requires American leadership.\n\nWithout American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities. It is tragic that you see Iraq, and other countries now talking to Russia. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all. And, so, the United States needs to lead across the board.\n\nThis president, and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play, and we\u2019re now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don\u2019t deal with this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nMr. Trump, in 2012 debate, President Obama mocked Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Russia was the top geopolitical challenge facing the United States, saying he was a Cold War dinosaur. Now, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and has put troops in Syria. You have said you will have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. So, what does President Trump do in response to Russia\u2019s aggression?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nWell, first of all, it\u2019s not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that\u2019s one of the worst deals ever made. One of the worst contracts ever signed, ever, in anything, and it\u2019s a disgrace. But, we have somebody over there, a madman, who already has nuclear weapons we don\u2019t talk about that. That\u2019s a problem.\n\nChina is a problem, both economically in what they\u2019re doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force. So, we have more than just Russia. But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria \u2014 as far as Syria, I like \u2014 if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.\n\nBut, you know that.\n\nBut, if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100%, and I can\u2019t understand how anybody would be against it\u2026\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\n\u2026They\u2019re not doing that\u2026\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026They blew up \u2014 hold it\u2026.\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\n(INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026They blew up, wait a minute\u2026\n\n(AUDIENCE REACTION)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026They blew up a Russian airplane. He cannot be in love with these people. He\u2019s going in, and we can go in, and everybody should go in. As far as the Ukraine is concerned, we have a group of people, and a group of countries, including Germany \u2014 tremendous economic behemoth \u2014 why are we always doing the work?\n\nWe are \u2014 I\u2019m all for protecting Ukraine and working \u2014 but, we have countries that are surrounding the Ukraine that aren\u2019t doing anything. They say, \u201cKeep going, keep going, you dummies, keep going. Protect us\u2026\u201d\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\n\u2026And we have to get smart. We can\u2019t continue to be the policeman of the world. We are $19 trillion dollars, we have a country that\u2019s going to hell, we have an infrastructure that\u2019s falling apart. Our roads, our bridges, our schools, our airports, and we have to start investing money in our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nDonald \u2014 Donald\u2019s wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this. We\u2019re not going to be the world\u2019s policeman, but we sure as heck better be the world\u2019s leader. That\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a huge difference where, without us leading\u2026\n\n(CHEERING)\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\n\u2026voids are filled, and the idea that it\u2019s a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS? I mean, that\u2019s like a board game, that\u2019s like playing Monopoly or something. That\u2019s not how the real world works.\n\nWe have to lead, we have to be involved. We should have a no fly zone in Syria. There are \u2014 they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country. If you\u2019re a Christian, increasingly in Lebanon, or Iraq, or Syria, you\u2019re going to be beheaded. And, if you\u2019re a moderate Islamist, you\u2019re not going to be able to survive either.\n\nWe have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nAssad is a bad guy, but we have no idea who the so-called rebels \u2014 I read about the rebels, nobody even knows who they are. I spoke to a general two weeks ago, he said \u2014 he was very up on exactly what we\u2019re talking about. He said, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump? We\u2019re giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people, we have no idea who they are.\u201d\n\nSo, I don\u2019t like Assad. Who\u2019s going to like Assad? But, we have no idea who these people, and what they\u2019re going to be, and what they\u2019re going to represent. They may be far worse than Assad. Look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion dollars, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place \u2014 who I love, OK? All over.\n\nWe have nothing. And, I said, keep the oil. And we should have kept the oil, believe me. We should have kept the oil. And, you know what? We should have given the oil\u2026\n\n(BELL BRINGING)\n\n\u2026We should\u2019ve given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons, and daughters, because right now, you know who has a lot of that oil? Iran, and ISIS.\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\nYou know, Mr. Trump fancies himself a very good negotiator. And, I accept that he\u2019s done a lot of good deals, so, Mr. Trump \u2018ought to know that we should not speak to people from a position of weakness. Senator Paul should know that as well.\n\nOne of the reasons I\u2019ve said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting.\n\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\nOne of the reasons I\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration, so, I wouldn\u2019t talk to him for awhile, but, I would do this. I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military \u2014 the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose. I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\u2026and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany, not to start a war, but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies. That is why Governor Bush is correct. We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes. We also have a set of allies\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026We also have a set of allies in the Arab Middle East that know that ISIS is their fight. They have asked us specifically over, and over again to support them. King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I\u2019ve known for a very long time, has asked us for bombs and material, we have not provided it.\n\nThe Egyptians are asking us to share intelligence, we are not, I will. The Kurds have asked us to arm them for three years, we are not, I would. The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrain\u2019s, the Emirati, the Kurds\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\n\u2026all of these, I know, by the way, understand ISIS is their fight, but they must see leadership support and resolve from the United States of America\u2026\n\n\n\nMALE:\n\n\u2026let me follow up that\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026we have the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSenator Paul\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSenator Paul, you have already said, sir, that that would be a mistake in not talking to Vladimir Putin, or to rule it out. You\u2019ve argued that it\u2019s never a good idea to close down communication. With that in mind, do you think the same applies to administration efforts right now to include the Iranians in talks on Syria?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nI\u2019d like first to respond to the acquisition, we should \u2014 I think it\u2019s particularly naive, particularly foolish to think that we\u2019re not going to talk to Russia. The idea of a no fly zone, realize that this is also something that Hillary Clinton agrees with several on our side with, you\u2019re asking for a no fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies.\n\nRussia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing, but you better know at least what we\u2019re getting into. So, when you think it\u2019s going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over Iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes. If you\u2019re ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq.\n\nI don\u2019t want to see that happen. I think the first war in Iraq was a mistake\u2026\n\n(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nYou can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the war\u2026\n\n\n\nMALE:\n\n(INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\n\u2026Well, then how would you respond?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nRonald Reagan was strong, but Ronald Reagan didn\u2019t\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\n\u2026send troops into the Middle East\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026he walked away, he quit talks\u2026\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\n\u2026Can I finish\u2026\n\n\n\nFIORINA:\n\n\u2026when it was time to quit talking\u2026\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\n\u2026Can I finish my time?\n\nPAUL:\n\nCould I finish with my time?\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nWhy does she keep interrupting everybody?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTRUMP:\n\nTerrible.\n\n(BOOING)\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nYes, I would like to finish my response, basically.\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nYou know, if I may respond\u2026\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nThis is an important question. This is an incredibly important question. And the question goes to be, who do we want to be our commander-in-chief? Do you want a commander-in-chief who says something that we never did throughout the entire Cold War, to discontinue having conversations with the Russians?\n\nI am not happy about them flying over there. But I\u2019m not naive enough to say, well, Iraq has them flying over their airspace, we\u2019re just going to announce that we\u2019re shooting them down?\n\nThat is naive to the point of being something you might hear in junior high. But it\u2019s scary\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nBut if you\u2019re not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nThe first thing I would do is I wouldn\u2019t arm our enemies. I wouldn\u2019t arm ISIS.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nMost of the people who want to the no-fly zone also favored arming the allies of al Qaeda, which became ISIS. That was the dumbest, most foolhardy notion. And most of the people up here supported it. They wanted to arm the allies of al Qaeda. Some of them still do.\n\nThat\u2019s how ISIS grew. We pushed back Assad, and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum. So the first thing you do is don\u2019t arm your enemies.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nI need to add a couple of points to this. The first is, I\u2019ve never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.\n\nHe understands only geopolitical strength. And every time he has acted anywhere in the world, whether it\u2019s in Ukraine or Georgia before that, or now in the Middle East, it\u2019s because he is trusting in weakness.\n\nHis calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done, which is nothing, the president has no strategy, our allies in the region do not trust us. For goodness sake, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel.\n\nAnd we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran. And so our allies in the region don\u2019t trust us.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nVladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And here\u2019s why.\n\nBecause all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya. They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.\n\nSoon they will be in Turkey. They will try Jordan. They will try Saudi Arabia. They are coming to us. They recruit Americans using social media. And they don\u2019t hate us simply because we support Israel. They hate us because of our values. They hate us because our girls go to school. They hate us because women drive in the United States.\n\nEither they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you, Senator.\n\nGovernor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet state-backed Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion.\n\nAnd as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Would you stop them?\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nLet me tell you this, Mr. Baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us.\n\nI want to give you a little trip around the world. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. In the Ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. In the eastern part of Europe, make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move, we move.\n\nIn Syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the Turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the Jordanian border. Anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. They fly in there a second time, they will not fly out.\n\nAnd it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we\u2019re still involved.\n\nSaudi Arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. But they\u2019re fundamentally our friends. Jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. Egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.\n\nIn the groups \u2014 in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain, the Cleveland Clinic is opening an operation. Clearly we see the same with them. And in Israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them.\n\nAnd finally China, China doesn\u2019t own the South China Sea, and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we\u2019re not going to put up with it any more.\n\nAnd in the trade agreement, the TPP, it\u2019s critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese. They are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend.\n\nAnd finally, I will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. When the fall comes, and we run against Hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. I have two 16-year-old girls, and I want this country to be strong.\n\nWe make promises we can\u2019t keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and we got the budget balanced.\n\nAnd in Ohio, as the CEO, and guess what, we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall. And our ideas have to add up. They have to be solid. And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.\n\nAnd as president, I will lead this country, as I have before in Washington and in Ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, Gerry.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you, Governor. Plenty of opportunities. Thank you.\n\nNeil?\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nAll right. And look at the time, look at the time. You are watching FOX Business, we\u2019ll take a break. Stick around.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nWelcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee.\n\nNow let\u2019s get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.\n\nGovernor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn\u2019t bail out the banks. Would you?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nWe\u2019re not \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t have another financial crisis. What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren\u2019t too big to fail. Dodd-Frank has actually done the opposite, totally the opposite, where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren\u2019t high enough. If we were serious about it, we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions. This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country, and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that.\n\nI was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is. It was \u2014 get the \u2014 kind of the \u2014 anyway. We had\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIt \u2014 and I talked to a banker there. This is a bank that had $125 million of assets, four branches. Their compliance costs because of Dodd-Frank went from $100,000 to $600,000 in a two-year period. The net effect of that is \u2014 and they had \u2014 they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis. They knew \u2014 they knew their borrowers. They gave back to the community. They were engaged in the community. And imagine America without its community banks. Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening because of Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my worry. My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that. She wants to create even more so. She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is \u2014 she was for the trade agreement in \u2014 the Pacific agreement. Now she\u2019s against it. She was \u2014 hinted she was for the XL pipeline. Now she\u2019s opposed to it. All the things that would create sustained economic growth she\u2019s now doubling down against it.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nBut, Governor, but can I just quickly \u2014 did \u2014 you can\u2019t seriously guarantee that there won\u2019t be another financial crisis, can you?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nYou could, if you were serious about\u2026\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nEver? There will never be another financial crisis?\n\n\n\nBUSH:\n\nNo, I can\u2019t say that. But I can say, if you created higher capital requirements, that\u2019s the solution to this, not having concentration of assets. The bigger banks now have more and more control over \u2014 over the financial assets of this country. And that is the wrong approach to take.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nDr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever. Asset held by JPMorgan Chase, for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion. Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up?\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nWell, I think we should have policies that don\u2019t allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that we\u2019re using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.\n\nAnd I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. This country was \u2014 declared its independence in 1776. In less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. Those are the fuels that drive it.\n\nAnd what we\u2019ve done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. If we can get that out, it makes a big difference. And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. And it\u2019s shifted to the individual.\n\nSo \u2014 and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. It is hurting the poor.\n\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won\u2019t tell you that that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s really hurting middle class in the core. They\u2019ll say it\u2019s the rich, take their money, but that won\u2019t help. You can take all of the rich\u2019s money and it won\u2019t make a dent in the problem that we\u2019re having. We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nBut just to be clear, just \u2014 just to be clear, then, you wouldn\u2019t \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t favor breaking up the big banks? You think they\u2019re big enough \u2014 they\u2019re OK as they are, as big as they are?\n\n\n\nCARSON:\n\nI would have policies that wouldn\u2019t allow that to occur. I don\u2019t want to go in and tear anybody down. I mean, that doesn\u2019t help us. But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you, Dr. Carson.\n\n\n\nRUBIO:\n\nCan I just add what \u2014 he\u2019s right on point there. Do you know why these banks are so big? The government made them big. The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations. So the big banks, they have an army of lawyers, they have an army of compliance officers. They can deal with all these things. The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they can\u2019t deal with all these regulations. They can\u2019t deal with all \u2014 they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations. And so the result is, the big banks get bigger, the small banks struggle to lend or even exist, and the result is what you have today.\n\nAnd in Dodd-Frank, you have actually codified too big to fail. We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions, and these banks go around bragging about it. You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod? We are so big, we are so important that if we get in trouble, the government has to bail us out. This is an outrage. We need to repeal Dodd-Frank as soon as possible.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nLet me \u2014 let me also say, Gary \u2014 Gary, let me also say, Jeb is \u2014 what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital, people who invest it and they hold their capital, so that if the bank goes down, the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay. That\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to say.\n\nSecondly, I\u2019ll tell you about Wall Street: There\u2019s too much greed. And the fact is, a free enterprise system is a system that\u2019s produced the greatest wealth for the world. But you know Michael Novak, the great Catholic theologian, says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values \u2014 and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives \u2014 yes, free enterprise is great, profits are great, but there have to be some values that underlay it, and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose.\n\n\n\nBAKER:\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nPAUL:\n\nGerard, can I comment\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSenator Cruz \u2014 and I will get to you \u2014 but, Senator Cruz, on that theme, Facebook data shows that over the last month alone, nearly 1 million people \u2014 nearly 1 million \u2014 have been concerned about reining in Wall Street, apparently believing that some have not been punished enough.\n\nSo, as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general, would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored, in other words, the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder?\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nAbsolutely yes. You know, I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution. And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington.\n\nYou know, the opening question Jerry asked, would you bail out the big banks again? Nobody gave you an answer to that. I\u2019ll give you an answer. Absolutely not.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd what we have right now is we have Washington \u2014 as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich. The truth is, the rich do great with big government. They get in bed with big government. The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under Dodd-Frank and community banks are going out of business. And, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can\u2019t get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism. Some weeks ago, a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate. Sabina Loving is an African-American single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago. She found a store front, she wanted to have her own business. She started a business.\n\nBut then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. They did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the Dead Horse Act. Now, this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but Sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee. It would have driven her out of business, and Ms. Loving sued the IRS. She took the Obama IRS to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSenator\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSenator, I really want to be clear here. Are you saying, sir, that if Bank of America were on the brink, you would let it fail?\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nYes. Now, let\u2019s be clear, there is a role for the Federal Reserve \u2014 what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher- kings trying to guess what\u2019s happening with the economy. You look at the Fed, one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s, we had loose money, we had an asset bubble, it drove up the price of real estate, drove up the price of commodities, and then in the third quarter of 2008, the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices, which caused a cascading collapse. That\u2019s why I am supporting getting back to rules-based monetary system not with a bunch of philosopher-kings deciding, but tied\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCAVUTO:\n\nSir, I understand that. I just want to be clear, if you don\u2019t mind, that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision. And I just want to be clear. If it were to happen again, for whatever the reason, you would let it go, you would let a Bank of America go?\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nSo let me be clear. I would not bail them out, but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, number one, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold, and, number two, serving as a lender of last resort.\n\nThat\u2019s what central banks do. So if you have a run on the bank, the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort, but it\u2019s not a bailout. It is a loan at higher interest rates. That\u2019s how central banks have worked.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll point out \u2014 look, we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods, we had it for about 170 years of our nation\u2019s history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.\n\nWe need to get back to sound money, which helps, in particular, working men and women. What Washington does \u2014 the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government. The people who (inaudible) working men and women\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nNeil, that\u2019s the difference of being an executive. And let me just explain: when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don\u2019t say we believe in philosophical concerns.\n\nYou know what an executive has to decide? When there\u2019s a water crisis, how do we get water to the city? When there\u2019s a school shooting, how do you get there and help heal a community? When there are financial crisis, or a crisis with ebola, you got to go there and try to fix it.\n\nPhilosophy doesn\u2019t work when you run something. And I gotta tell you, on-the-job training for president of the United States doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve done it for 8 years, \u2014 and almost 8 years now. It does not work.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe need an executive who\u2019s been tried, has been tested, and judge the decisions that that executive makes. I don\u2019t like what the Fed is doing, but I\u2019ll tell you what worries me more than anything else: turning the Fed over to the Congress of the United States\u2026\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nThank you, governor.\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nSo, Governor Kasich\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\n\u2026so they can print the money. That would be a very bad approach.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO:\n\nSenator Rubio.\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\n\u2026why would you then bail out rich Wall Street banks, but not Main street, not Mom and Pop, not Sabina Loving?\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nI wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nBut you just said an executive\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nNo. No, I didn\u2019t say that.\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\n\u2026knows to step in and bail out a bank.\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\nThey were \u2014 they were talking about what you would do with depositors. Would you let these banks shut down?\n\nMy argument is, going forward, the banks have to reserve the capital, so that the \u2014 so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches, Ted.\n\nBut at the end of the day\u2026\n\n\n\nCRUZ:\n\nSo you said you\u2019d abandon philosophy and abandon principle\u2026\n\n\n\nKASICH:\n\n\u2026 I\u2019m gonna tell you this.
