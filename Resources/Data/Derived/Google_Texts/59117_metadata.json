Rand Paul (R-KY) is using a little known Senate rule in order to force a vote on the State Department\u2019s approval of a $700 million arms sale to Pakistan.\n\nSen. Paul is invoking the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 in an attempt to end the potential sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan, using an obscure provision that allows any senator to push a vote of disapproval.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, after the senator introduces the resolution of disapproval, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has 10 days to report back to the Senate with its recommendation on the resolution.\n\nIf the committee doesn\u2019t take up the measure within 10 days, the senator can move to secure a procedural floor vote.\n\nThe last time the act was invoked was in 1986 by former Sen. Alan Cranston (D-CA), who forced a vote on banning arm sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nPaul introduced a resolution last month that would block the sale of arms to Pakistan. In addition, Rep.
