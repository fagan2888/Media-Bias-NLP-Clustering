But those efforts have been stymied by the disastrous effects of one of the most sweeping liberal reforms in recent memory: Obamacare.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s conservative successes in 2013 \u2014 on issues such as taxes and regulatory, education, and election reform \u2014 elicited howls of outrage on the left, even prompting an editorial from the New York Times lamenting the state\u2019s \u201cdecline\u201d and accusing the Republican legislature of \u201ctearing down years of progress\u201d achieved under Democratic control. Liberal activist groups cheered on as \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protesters organized a series of rallies outside the state capitol and as Republican governor Pat McCrory\u2019s approval rating steadily declined.\n\nIncumbent Democratic U.S. senator Kay Hagan would like nothing more than to make her 2014 reelection bid all about the \u201cextremist\u201d GOP lawmakers running the Tar Heel State, especially given that Thom Tillis, the Republican considered most likely to be her opponent, is speaker of North Carolina\u2019s House of Representatives and one of the architects of that conservative reform agenda.\n\n\u201cI think when you look at this race, what takes place in 2014, it\u2019s about a contrast: It\u2019s about what I\u2019ve done in Washington versus what has taken place in the Republican-controlled Legislature,\u201d Hagan told Politico in December. \u201cThey have really been focusing on fringe issues and on policies that work against the middle-class families.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Hagan\u2019s fundraising pitches are constantly obsessing over liberal bogeymen such as Karl Rove and the Koch brothers. From a December fundraising e-mail: \u201cCitizens United opened the door to millions of dollars in special interest spending. And special interest insiders like Karl Rove and the Koch brothers ran straight through them, spending money on attacks and smears like it\u2019s their job.\u201d Another December e-mail reminds potential donors that she opposed \u201cthe budget plan that Paul Ryan and out-of-touch Tea Partiers . . . jammed through the House\u201d back in March 2013.\n\nA more likely scenario for Hagan is that public dissatisfaction with Obamacare, a law she supported and continues to back, however hesitantly, will be the overriding issue in November, and if that\u2019s the case, Democrats should be worried.\n\nHagan\u2019s approval rating has been underwater since the Obamacare exchanges launched in October, 49 percent disapproving of the job she\u2019s doing, compared with just 43 percent who approve, according to a December survey from Raleigh-based Public Policy Polling. Compared with a similar survey taken in September, Hagan\u2019s approval rating is unchanged, but her disapproval rating has spiked 10 points, almost certainly a result of dissatisfaction with Obamacare.\n\nThe law has already forced nearly half a million North Carolina residents off their existing health-care plans, despite Hagan\u2019s repeated promises that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it,\u201d which recently won PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year\u201d award for 2013. After leading all potential Republican opponents in previous polls, Hagan is currently running even with them.\n\n\u201cThe problem Democrats have is that Obamacare is sucking up most of the air in the room,\u201d says John Hood, president and chairman of the John Locke Foundation, a Raleigh-based think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s just a more compelling story, a much more powerful issue that is affecting people personally and getting much heavier media coverage.\u201d\n\nHood observes that since the Obamacare launch in October, state Democrats\u2019 early optimism regarding Hagan\u2019s reelection prospects has shifted to a \u201ccautious pessimism\u201d that is directly attributable to Obamacare. That is why, in addition to their efforts to frame the race around state issues, Democrats are hoping that Tillis either loses the GOP primary to a conservative challenger who may be less viable politically or emerges from the primary badly damaged.\n\n\u201cSome Democrats have convinced themselves Republicans are going to do what they did in Missouri or Colorado,\u201d Hood says, referring to states where Republicans appeared to squander winnable Senate races by nominating unpalatable candidates. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be disappointed.\u201d For one, it is going to be hard for Tillis\u2019s opponents to legitimately challenge him from the right, given his success in implementing long-sought conservative reforms at the state level, though it won\u2019t stop them from trying.\n\nDee Stewart, a Republican strategist based in Raleigh, says Democrats have failed to grasp the extent of Obamacare\u2019s negative impact on voters, which far outweighs that of anything passed by Republicans at the state level. \u201cAs long as Obamacare stays in the news, and as long as Republicans field a credible candidate, it\u2019s going to be a very uphill climb for Kay Hagan,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t sense that Democrats are quite as concerned as they ought to be.\u201d\n\nEven if Hagan is able to make the Republican legislature a focal point of her campaign against Tillis, or whoever wins the GOP nomination, it\u2019s unclear how beneficial that would be politically, beyond rallying the liberal base. Francis De Luca, president of the state\u2019s free-market Civitas Institute, notes that many of the supposedly controversial reforms approved by the state government in 2013, such as new voter-ID requirements, are popular with voters, especially when polled individually. The state\u2019s economy is growing faster than the national average, and the unemployment rate has fallen sharply since 2012. Governor McCrory\u2019s approval numbers are starting to recover.\n\nHagan is trying to become the first North Carolina Democrat in more than 40 years to win a second term in the U.S. Senate.
