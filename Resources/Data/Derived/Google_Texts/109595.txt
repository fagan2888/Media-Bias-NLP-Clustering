Combining art and activism

The Justseeds Artists' Cooperative is a group of 30 artists committed to combining art and activism. They share a set of social, environmental and political positions and believe in the power of printmaking to fuel social movements and change.

The artists, from across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, collaborate in formal and informal ways, including creating print portfolios, contributing artworks to grass-roots movements, creating gallery installations and wheatpasting on the streets.

Four artists in the group, Pete Railand, Colin Matthes, Nicolas Lampert and Paul Kjelland, are from Milwaukee.

The collective will present work from four portfolios — "War is Trauma," "Migration Now!" "Resourced" and "Voices from the Outside" — at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside starting Friday. An artists reception will be held Feb. 19 from 4:30 to 7 p.m.
