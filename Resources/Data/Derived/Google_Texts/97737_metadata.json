Your preparation internally will have to consider if your systems allow you to manage the incentives built into payment for quality or assumption of risk contracts.\u201d\n\nPreviously, a hospital\u2019s negotiations with payers related to establishing costs of services. The institution figured out how much money they wanted, the payer came back with what they wanted to pay and eventually an agreement was reached. The hospital had a good idea of expected income over the life of the contract.\n\n\u201cThe incentives built into newer contracts add an organizational risk that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d said Smith. \u201cNot only are the new incentives trying to contain costs, they also try to change clinical behaviors. You will need to know where your organization is, where your focus needs to be, and what investments you will need to make in clinical quality and patient experience to truly understand the risks and your ability to actually obtain savings and meet your quality and incentive goals.\u201d\n\nThe governmental programs are leading the charge away from fee-for-service. This often means that Medicare and Medicaid may have a requirement that applies only to their patients.\n\n\u201cMy doctors remind me that they treat patients and not payers,\u201d said Mark Bogen, senior vice president and chief financial officer at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, New York. \u201cIf they are going to be held responsible for outcomes as part of their compensation, they are not going to be able implement changes only for patients of certain payers.\u201d\n\nThis is a concern because non-governmental payers are going to reap the benefits of changes brought about by Medicare and Medicaid requirements without sharing the savings. In a few years, when commercial insurers look for their own savings, there won\u2019t be many left.\n\n\u201cI am trying to get into a shared savings program with my private companies sooner rather than later,\u201d said Bogen. \u201cIf we manage to shrink the system over the next few years, we will have already squeezed out most of the savings. When the others finally come to the table, there will not be much left over to pay for the significant infrastructure required, which is the dilemma I am facing.\u201d\n\nThis means the focus of the organization needs to change as these programs unfold. Unlike in the past, there may be times when your best response is to walk away.\n\n\u201cInstitutions have to be willing and capable of walking away as much as you are to take them on,\u201d said Smith. \u201cYour gap analysis, where you want to go as an institution, and how fast the organization can make the investments needed to get to the next step are all important considerations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/how-shift-fee-service-changing-payer-contract-negotiations", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor-signing-paper-feature_1.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Clinical analytics, benchmarks and patient experience data now just as important as financial metrics, insiders say.", "title": "How the shift from fee-for-service is changing payer contract negotiations"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor-signing-paper-feature_1.gif"}, "description": "Clinical analytics, benchmarks and patient experience data now just as important as financial metrics, insiders say.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How the shift from fee-for-service is changing payer contract negotiations"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As the transition from fee-for-service payment continues, hospitals are finding they need more information from a more diverse stable of sources to successfully negotiate with payers.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd135a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou will have to add clinical analytics, benchmarks and patient experience measures as well as actuarial services to your financial analysis.\nAs the transition from fee-for-service payment continues, hospitals are finding they need more information from a more diverse stable of sources to successfully negotiate with payers.\nClinical analytics, benchmarks and patient experience data now just as important as financial metrics, insiders say.\n\u201cInstitutions have to be willing and capable of walking away as much as you are to take them on,\u201d said Smith.\nThe institution figured out how much money they wanted, the payer came back with what they wanted to pay and eventually an agreement was reached."}
