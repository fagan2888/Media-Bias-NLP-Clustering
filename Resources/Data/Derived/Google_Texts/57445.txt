AZINCOURT, France — France lost the Battle of Agincourt nearly 600 years ago, but they’re not sore losers.

The French are hosting a re-enactment of the clash with England this weekend. More than 800 people in medieval garb gathered Saturday at the site to commemorate — and re-enact — the battle, which was a turning point in the Hundred Years’ War.

The two-day event, on a field in the northern town of Azincourt, called Agincourt in English, features equestrian jousting, archery and re-enactments of portions of the battle, fought on Oct. 25, 1415.

The battle left the French crippled on their soil, but the weekend event isn’t dwelling on that outcome.

The event is to “celebrate the friendship between France and the English,” said Christophe Gilliot, director of the Center for Medieval History in Agincourt. “It’s great to see all these people laughing and having a good time together,” he said before the spectacle began.

British, French and history enthusiasts from two dozen other nations were invited to take part.

The Battle of Agincourt was the centerpiece of William Shakespeare’s play “Henry V,” about the young warrior king who led the charge “on the vasty fields of France.”
