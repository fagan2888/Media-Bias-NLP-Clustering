NEW YORK (AP) — The bonnets were out on Fifth Avenue for the annual Easter Parade — outlandish 21st century headpieces that were hardly bonnets, featuring everything from bunnies and butterflies to grassy, egg-dotted lawns and even a tall ship on the high seas.

And the parade is hardly a parade. Instead, while Easter Sunday Mass was celebrated at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with Cardinal Timothy Dolan at the altar, the avenue was milling with people decked out in homemade costumes that seem to get zanier each year.

The crowd included Christians, Jews, Hindus, agnostics, atheists and others who felt like strolling around Manhattan on a sunny spring day, including hundreds of tourists.

“It’s all about versatility,” said Mary Anna Smith, a New York custom milliner whose business card reads “The Tipsy Topper.”

It took her a half day to fashion her “hat”: a bright blue sailing ship floating on sea foam, made from an elaborate kite and some fluffy white stuff she said was “a trade secret.”

“It’s about sailing to new heights,” said Smith.

She also created headpieces for two friends, one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird’s nest, then to human hair.

Just feet from the parade, the trio was tending to last-minute finishing touches, adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions didn’t topple.
