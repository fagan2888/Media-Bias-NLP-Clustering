She is also, for the first time this year, shopping for her family of five.\n\nAllsep's husband, a professor, is on sabbatical to write so her family is no longer on an employer-sponsored plan. Like other families, there are several priorities she's balancing when looking for plans: children's care, cost and preferred physicians.\n\nShe's planning to buy one plan, an E Network plan from BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, for her and the children. Her husband will be on an S Network plan.\n\nThe two-plan option will save them about $10,000 year. Allsep will pay out of pocket to see a preferred OB-GYN who is not covered in the E Network.\n\nShe's excited about a feature of the E Network that gives her a free membership to the YMCA and a health coach as long as she goes three times a week.\n\n\"The accountability, for me, will get me to the gym,\" she said.\n\nThe Music Health Alliance has seen about four times the number of people so far this enrollment season than it did last year.\n\nThe state is one of three that already has more enrollees than it did at the first deadline in 2014. There were 88,007 people across the state who selected plans as of Dec. 5.\n\nThat's nearly 1,000 more than the number who selected plans as of Dec. 15, 2014, which included the rush to get coverage in place on New Year's Day.\n\nFederal officials anticipate a surge of enrollees in the run up to the end of Tuesday, the deadline to get coverage that starts on Jan. 1. The enrollment season runs until Jan. 31.\n\nBuy Photo Misganaw Moges gets help signing up for health insurance from Get Covered Tennessee volunteer Tanya Radic on Friday in Nashville.
