And ever since DirecTV's stopped transmitting Raycom stations, owner Jeremy Sauer has been busy setting up his own line of defense.\n\n\"I have three methods of defense. I had to rearrange wires that haven't been used in years just to be able to have both DirecTV and the backups that I needed in order to show all the games,\" Sauer said.\n\nHe spent 10 grueling hours setting up an antenna, a cable box and sound system for six of his 10 televisions.\n\n\"Our Saints crowd is very devoted. They come here specifically for the quality of the TVs and the setup we have,\" Sauer said.\n\n\"From the moment it ended last year, we're looking forward to that first game. I'd like to just sit at home and watch it by myself with family and friends,\" football fan Mike Heid said. \"I'm not going to be able to do that so I'm going to have go to a bar.\"\n\nThe Raycom blackout on DirecTV has been going on since Monday and negotiations continue. The Raycom group owns or manages 53 television stations nationwide.\n\nThat includes WVUE, the Fox television affiliate in New Orleans. Tom Benson's Louisiana Media Company owns the station, but turned over all operations to Raycom late last year.\n\nThe Alabama-based station group employs staff and makes programming-related decisions. Over the past week, Raycom and DirecTV have offered opposing perspectives on the impasse, with both sides telling viewers they hoped for a resolution.\n\nViewers can receive the game over the air, using a television antenna. They will not, however, get the game as part of the NFL's Sunday Ticket package.\n\nBroadcasts of local teams are blacked out from that subscription package.\n\nSuch disputes between local broadcast affiliates and cable and satellite operators have become more common in recent years, with tens of millions of dollars in compensation usually at stake.\n\n\"For this week, I think I would improvise but if this goes on for a while I don't know what we'll do,\" football fan James Thompson said. \"I think that's when you have to look at more serious options.\"\n\nAll this is happening as many Saints fans prepare for Sunday's kickoff.", "article_metadata": {"category": "New Orleans", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 06 Sep 2014 17:40:00 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "LaTonya Norton", "og": {"site_name": "WDSU", "description": "The Raycom blackout on DirecTV has been going on since Monday and negotiations continue.", "title": "Businesses, Saints fans looking for alternatives during ongoing TV dispute", "url": "http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/businesses-saints-fans-looking-for-alternatives-during-ongoing-tv-dispute/27916062", "image": "http://www.wdsu.com/image/view/-/27916464/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/xesbpo/-/saintsbackup-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/businesses-saints-fans-looking-for-alternatives-during-ongoing-tv-dispute/27916062", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wdsu://content/article/27916062", "iphone": "wdsu://content/article/27916062", "googleplay": "wdsu://content/article/27916062"}, "name": {"ipad": "wdsu", "iphone": "wdsu", "googleplay": "wdsu"}, "id": {"ipad": 506060763, "iphone": 506060763, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wdsu"}}, "site": "@WDSU", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wdsu://content/article/27916062", "app_name": "wdsu", "package": "com.hearst.android.wdsu"}, "ios": {"url": "wdsu://content/article/27916062", "app_store_id": 506060763, "app_name": "wdsu"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 106709375881}, "keywords": "Saints, football, Raycom, blackout, kickoff,", "google-site-verification": "iTpGHwvIUZZonMsO4nxEZugdY312ShGHOC_yhKGUGbw", "news_keywords": "Saints, football, Raycom, blackout, kickoff,", "description": "The Raycom blackout on DirecTV has been going on since Monday and negotiations continue."}, "article_summary": "At Mid-City Yacht Club in the 400 block of South St. Patrick Street spirited football fans cheer on their favorite college football team.\nAll this is happening as many Saints fans prepare for Sunday's kickoff.\nAnd ever since DirecTV's stopped transmitting Raycom stations, owner Jeremy Sauer has been busy setting up his own line of defense.\n\"I'm not going to be able to do that so I'm going to have go to a bar.\"\nKickoff to the Black and Gold's 2014 regular season against their archrivals, the Atlanta Falcons, is set for Sunday, but many Saints fans are worried they'll be left in the dark and won't be able to cheer on the home team due to an ongoing dispute."}
