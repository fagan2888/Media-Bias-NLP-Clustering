The excepted benefits final rule also affects vision benefits and long-term care (LTC) benefits.

The Obama administration has posted a 32-page batch of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) regulations that could reshape some non-medical health benefits.

The package, Amendments to Excepted Benefits, affects one category of benefits that are free from most of the requirements that apply to major medical coverage: "limited excepted benefits." The category includes dental benefits, vision benefits, long-term care (LTC) benefits and some other types of benefits, such as employee assistance plans (EAPs).
