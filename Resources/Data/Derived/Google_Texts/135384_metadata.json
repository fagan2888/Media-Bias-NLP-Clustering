They knew he\u2019d command a cap-straining figure, so they did what every team in a similar situation had done: They exploited loopholes to get Kovalchuk paid while not killing their salary cap. In 2009, Marian Hossa, Roberto Luongo and Henrik Zetterberg all signed lucrative, front-loaded deals for absurd lengths. Everyone knew what they were doing, but there was nothing the NHL could do about it. It was legal, so the contracts held up.\n\nThe Devils followed precedent and signed the 27-year-old Kovalchuk to a 17-year (hahahaha) deal for $102 million. But the NHL was tired of looking dumb, and it didn\u2019t let the contract go through. The deal was eventually signed at 15 years, $100 million, which was totally OK for some reason.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the issue. The issue was that the league fined the Devils $3 million and took away two draft picks \u2014 a third-round pick they already lost in 2011, and a first-rounder they were poised to lose this year. They lost a first rounder, a major asset, for doing something that smart teams had done multiple times, going unpenalized. It\u2019s like how the retaliator always gets the penalty\u2026 except in this case, the \u201cinfraction\u201d wasn\u2019t actually against the rules, and the penalty was massive.\n\nBut out of nowhere, the NHL decided to make amends today. Gary Bettman and all non-Adam-Silver-commissioners (so far), take a lot of crap, because they\u2019re mostly awful. They\u2019re greedy and power-hungry. This goes against everything we know and hate, and it\u2019s incredible and strange.\n\nHearing the NHL has reversed part of its penalty against the Devils for cap circumvention (Kovalchuk contract)\u2026. \u2014 Darren Dreger (@DarrenDreger) March 6, 2014\n\nNHL will award Devils with the 30th pick in the Draft instead of the 1st round pick as usually determined. Also forgiving $1.5 mil of fine. \u2014 Darren Dreger (@DarrenDreger) March 6, 2014\n\nThey still got screwed out of a third-rounder, $1.5 million and probably quite a few spots in this year\u2019s draft, but I\u2019m seriously astonished that they amended the mistake at all. There is hope for sports and greedy rich people. Now if Bettman could just rescind Obamacare, amirite?*\n\n*That was a joke. This post is about hockey. Do not take this as a pro-or-anti-Obamacare stance. I like sports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is INSANE. A sports commissioner admitted a mistake and made up for it.
