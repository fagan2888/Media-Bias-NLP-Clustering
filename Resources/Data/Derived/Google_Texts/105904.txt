Days after a shootout that left a Park County deputy dead and two other deputies wounded, Coloradans planted blue flags along the roadway as a show of support for law enforcement.

Community members planted the flags along U.S. 285 on Saturday and plan to continue Sunday on to Kenosha Pass, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.

“This amazing support for law enforcement means the world to us,” the sheriff’s office said in a tweet.

The shooting happened Wednesday morning at the Friendship Ranch subdivision in Bailey when the officers were attempting to evict a man.

The slain deputy, Cpl. Nate Carrigan, was a 13-year veteran of the Park County Sheriff’s Office and a beloved high school baseball and football coach.

Master Patrol Deputy Kolby Martin, an 11-year veteran of the office, was shot multiple times in the lower extremities and was in fair condition at St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood.

Capt. Mark Hancock, a 21-year veteran of the office, suffered an ear injury but was treated and released.

Suspected shooter Martin Wirth died in the encounter.
