Halamka, shown amid rows of servers in the hospital\u2019s data center, is cochair of a federal IT group that advises the government.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The latest threat of identity theft might not come from retail stores or big banks, but your doctor\u2019s office or local hospital.\n\nCriminals are stealing patient records to file fake insurance claims, obtain prescription medication, or sell Social Security numbers. Just this summer, Chinese hackers seized the personal information of 4.5 million patients at a Tennessee-based hospital network. And federal officials disclosed Thursday that an intruder managed to install malicious software on HealthCare.gov, the government\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese and other recent incidents reveal the growing market for patient data and perilous gaps within the health care industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a war we\u2019re in,\u201d said John Halamka, the chief information officer of Boston-based Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and cochair of the Health IT Standards Committee, a federal group that advises the government. \u201cHackers innovate and find new ways to get in and those who store data innovate and find new ways to keep them out. We\u2019re leapfrogging back and forth.\u201d\n\nHalamka considered this summer\u2019s attack on the hospital operator, Community Health Systems, one of the most sophisticated he\u2019s seen and an example of the increasingly clever methods of cyber criminals.\n\nDemand for health records is high. The FBI estimates one goes for $50 on the black market, much more than the few dollars often required for credit card numbers. Ponemon Institute, a research center that examines data protections, says breaches cost the industry up to $5.6 billion a year.\n\nStolen health care data can lead not only to financial loss but also to inaccurate medical records and, thus, misdiagnosis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCriminal intrusions into health care systems have risen 100 percent in the past four years, according to a recent Ponemon report. The FBI warned this April that the health sector, amid mandatory transition to electronic health records, lacked protections to ward off the rising threat of cybercrime. It sent out another alert last month emphasizing the rise of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who prey on health care and medical device fields.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear the industry is up for the fight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re focused on delivering health care, not operational security,\u201d said Stephen Boyer, cofounder of BitSight Technologies, a Cambridge-based security ratings firm that issued a recent report on the topic. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a high priority.\u201d\n\nThe study found that hospitals and other health care providers respond to data breaches more slowly than any other industry.\n\nThe attack on Community Health Systems reportedly resulted from a well-documented vulnerability known as Heartbleed. And the HealthCare.gov hacker found a way into one of the nation\u2019s most monitored websites, although federal officials said the hacker obtained no consumer data.\n\nAnalysts, at Ponemon and elsewhere, warn threats could only get worse with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online exchanges and the rise of digitalized records.\n\nMotivations for attack range from political agendas to sheer greed.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s getting to the point now where it has to be a number one focus for organizations. There are lots of competing priorities but, frankly, security is one that is bubbling up on the top of that list.\u2019 Daniel Nigrin, chief information officer at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nThe infamous hacker group Anonymous this spring disrupted Internet access at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and tried to infiltrate the hospital\u2019s network. Emeline Lubin, a former employee of Tufts Health Plan this April stole Social Security numbers from thousands of patients. (She pleaded guilty last month to a ploy for fake benefits and tax refunds.) And Boston Medical Center fired a vendor this year after the medical information of 15,000 patients wound up unprotected on a physician website.\n\nA state report released this week calculated that Massachusetts experienced 88 health care related data breaches last year. The number still trails the 1,551 that affected banks and financial institutions but suggests a market for health records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point now where it has to be a number one focus for organizations,\u201d said Daniel Nigrin, chief information officer at Boston Children\u2019s who helped mitigate the Anonymous attack. \u201cThere are lots of competing priorities but, frankly, security is one that is bubbling up on the top of that list.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, in conjunction with the passage of a 2009 health IT law, has doled out at least $24 billion to spur the transition from paper records to digital ones. The technological push expands opportunities for misuse to smartphone and computers. Beth Israel notified nearly 4,000 patients in 2012 after someone stole a physician\u2019s personal laptop from a hospital office.\n\n\u201cHealth care has only really gone digital over the course of the last five years,\u201d said Denny Brennan, the executive director of the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium, a group that focuses on improving collaboration around health information and technology.\n\nThis industry does face tougher notification requirements than many retailers. It must report data breaches that affect 500 or more individuals and adhere to a federal law that aims to protect patient privacy. Intrusions don\u2019t mean data is stolen, and Massachusetts law requires business and organizations that handle personal information to report a breach.\n\nBut no federal law mandates specific security procedures industries must follow \u2014 and a cybersecurity bill has stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, low budgets for IT and the increasing sophistication of data theft have left the industry particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe health care industry\u2019s IT department historically receives 2 or 3 percent of the budget compared with more than 20 percent in retail and financial industries, Beth Israel\u2019s Halamka said. The hospital\u2019s board began to prioritize security after incidents such as the doctor\u2019s stolen computer, he said.\n\nA Ponemon report last year noted that health and pharmaceutical companies pay the least for information security staff.\n\nBut changes means convincing hospitals and other health care providers that they need to overhaul budgets, hire more staff, and share information.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services has increased the incentive by cracking down on medical facilities that fail to protect patient data. The agency in May fined New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center $4.8 million for the disclosure of nearly 7,000 medical records because of lax technical safeguards.\n\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance, an organization that pushes information security in health care, partnered with Southern Methodist University in Dallas this year to create the first graduate program dedicated to addressing risk in health care organizations. The training is essential, the organization said, because \u201cgaps in talent are proving more troubling than technical gaps.\u201d\n\nThe industry, in the meantime, is scrambling to catch up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just medical identity theft that can be committed with a medical profile; it\u2019s every type of identity theft,\u201d said Eva Velasquez, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a San Diego-based nonprofit.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, it\u2019s a one-stop shop for the thief.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.834107084", "eomportal-id": 63182, "description": "Criminals are capitalizing on detailed patient records, making them a valuable commodity used to file fake insurance claims, obtain prescription medication or sell social security numbers.
