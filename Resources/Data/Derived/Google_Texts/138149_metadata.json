Instead, the soft-spoken former neurosurgeon Ben Carson will be the man on top. And for the first time, Trump will have to figure out how to regain the spotlight \u2013 and recapture his mojo \u2013 in a race that has suddenly become more fluid and complex again.\n\nRelated: Abolish Medicare? Ben Carson's Mixed Message on Health Care\n\n\u201cFor once, I think you will see the other candidates ignoring Trump,\u201d said John Zogby, a veteran pollster and political analyst. \u201cHe is on a downward spiral, predictably so, not so much for what he has said, but because Hillary Clinton's great week knocked him from his pedestal of endless news coverage. He can't take being ignored, so any efforts by him to be outrageous will simply be even hollower than they have been.\u201d\n\nCarson in the past several days overtook Trump in polls in Iowa, home to the first national GOP caucuses of the 2016 campaign season. And on Tuesday, he took a narrow four-point lead over Trump in a New York Times/CBS survey. This is the first time Trump has taken a back seat to anyone in that poll since late July. However, the margin of error for the sample of 575 Republican primary voters is 6 percentage points.\n\nAccording to the findings, Carson is the choice of 26 percent of likely Republican primary voters, compared to 22 percent for Trump. No other candidate come even close to that: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida picked up 8 percent while former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina both had 7 percent.\n\nRelated: Behind Ben Carson's rebellious public image, a DC insider is hard at work\n\nThe survey suggests that Carson has scored important gains with many key Republican factions. In contrast to earlier months, Carson now leads Trump among women and is running \u201cneck and neck\u201d with Trump among men. Carson, who is a Seventh Day Adventist, has seen his support among evangelicals rise and leads Trump by more than 20 points among that group, according to the survey.\n\nFor a presidential candidate who lives and breathes polls \u2013 and who often uses them as a club to belittle others in the crowded GOP field -- The Times/CBS survey was a stunning jolt to the bombastic New Yorker.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, to be honest with you,\u201d Trump told reporters yesterday. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Carson seemed to take it in stride, telling CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Polls will go up and down over the next year. No one should be terribly alarmed and no one should be terribly excited.\u201d\n\nHe has a point. The RealClear Politics average of all polls to date still shows Trump ahead of Carson 26.8 to 22 percent.\n\nRelated: Trump Knocks Carson as a Seventh Day Adventist as Iowa Polls Shift\n\nSince the start of the campaign, Carson has been something of a novelty act \u2013 an up-by-his-bootstraps nationally renowned surgeon and author from Detroit who charmed conservatives and evangelical Christians with his strong conservative views on education, abortion, health care and immigration reform. Many of his assertions \u2013 like Muslims should not be allowed to serve as president, and the government should deploy military drones to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2013 have raised many eyebrows but weren\u2019t taken very seriously.\n\nYet after months of largely cruising under the media\u2019s radar \u2013 with few willing to concede he had any chance of snagging the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 Carson suddenly is coming under intense scrutiny. He dominated last weekend\u2019s political coverage on the Sunday talk shows.\n\nNow he can count on drawing fire from Trump and other lesser GOP candidates like Bush, Fiorina, Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2013 who all desperately need to find a way to reboot their stalled campaigns. \u201cSince Ben Carson has now taken the lead in Iowa and in a national poll, one must wonder if sharper elbows will be thrown by Donald Trump against him,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a Washington political analyst and adviser.\n\nTrump has already begun a new line of attack, including his recent dig at Seventh Day Adventists for being far out of the religious mainstream. He also indicated he intends to go after Carson\u2019s controversial proposal to replace Medicare and Obamacare with cradle-to-grave health care savings accounts financed in part by a $2,000-a-year government contribution.\n\nThe Media Finally Wakes Up to the Ben Carson Phenomenon\n\nLast weekend on Fox News Sunday and NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Carson insisted in appearances that his medical savings accounts would be optional, and that Americans satisfied with Medicare could keep that coverage. \u201cI would never get rid of the program,\u201d Carson said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what he said over the past two years when he clearly advocated medical savings accounts as replacements for Medicare and Medicaid. And Trump indicated to reporters yesterday that Carson\u2019s proposal almost certainly would be a new line of attack in tonight\u2019s debate, which will be carried by CNBC.\n\nRelated: Carson steals lead from Trump in key state of Iowa: survey\n\n\u201cAbolishing Medicare \u2013 I don\u2019t think that he will get away with that one,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s actually a program that\u2019s worked. So it\u2019s a program that some people love.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s showing in the past few weeks has been impressive, although we have seen in past GOP presidential campaigns that frontrunners come and go. While many Republicans are most impressed right now with Carson and Trump, the Times/CBS poll showed that seven-in-ten Republican voters have not firmly decided on a candidate. Still, Trump has an edge over Carson here because 55 percent of his supporters say their mind is made up, while 80 percent of Carson supporters say it\u2019s too early to decide for sure.\n\n\u201cThe race is still in implosion mode for the outsiders,\u201d Zogby said in an email message. \u201cCarson will fade, Cruz will have his turn in the sun -- then watch for Bush, Rubio, [Ohio Gov. John] Kasich, possibly [New Jersey Gov. Chris] Christie. I do wonder if Fiorina will do well again. She could rise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Get ready for a bizarre new dynamic in the Republicans\u2019 third", "title": "With Trump Ready to Pounce, Will Carson Stay Cool in Tonight\u2019s Debate?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/28/Trump-Ready-Pounce-Will-Carson-Stay-Cool-Tonight-s-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/28/Trump-Ready-Pounce-Will-Carson-Stay-Cool-Tonight-s-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Get ready for a bizarre new dynamic in the Republicans\u2019 third", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5790\"", "article_summary": "Instead, the soft-spoken former neurosurgeon Ben Carson will be the man on top.\nIn contrast to earlier months, Carson now leads Trump among women and is running \u201cneck and neck\u201d with Trump among men.\nBen Carson's Mixed Message on Health Care\u201cFor once, I think you will see the other candidates ignoring Trump,\u201d said John Zogby, a veteran pollster and political analyst.\nRelated: Carson steals lead from Trump in key state of Iowa: survey\u201cAbolishing Medicare \u2013 I don\u2019t think that he will get away with that one,\u201d Trump said.\nThe RealClear Politics average of all polls to date still shows Trump ahead of Carson 26.8 to 22 percent."}
