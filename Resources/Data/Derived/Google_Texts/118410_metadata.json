Senate Leader Says Medicaid Expansion Not Likely To Advance This Session\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman says expansion advocates don't have the votes in the Republican Senate, which is set to adjourn next week.

With just one week remaining before lawmakers are set to adjourn, Senate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman said there isn't enough support in the Republican-controlled Senate to approve the plan.

Nico Gomez, Oklahoma Health Care Authority chief executive officer, said he proposed the rate cut in March amid concerns that the agency would see a major cut in state money for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. However, because the Legislature hadn't proposed a budget as of Monday afternoon, Gomez advised the board to wait to make such a significant decision.
