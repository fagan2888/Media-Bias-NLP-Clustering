Barbara Comstock talks to constituents at a Clifton Republican Women's Club meeting in Fairfax Station on April 17. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThey came at her hard, trying to goad Virginia state Del. Barbara J. Comstock into slipping up:\n\n\u201cHow can we possibly trust her to cut government spending when she\u2019s been first in line at the trough for years?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go to Washington to represent all the people, not just the businesses who can afford to hire lobbyist Comstock to represent them in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us go to tea party meetings, except Barbara.\u201d\n\nCAMPAIGN 2014: This is the second in an occasional series about the race for Northern Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District \u2013 a diverse, fast-changing place and a key swing seat in the capital\u2019s backyard. Read the first story here. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThrough all the appearances with her primary opponents, Comstock (R-Fairfax) smiled and said little \u2014 trying at once to hide her moderation yet not betray it for a fall election she hoped to win in ever-bluer Northern Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis is a swing district,\u201d she said at one forum, \u201cand I\u2019ve always worked with everybody.\u201d\n\nWhen Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) announced he would retire after 34 years, a huge first question in his Northern Virginia congressional district was how the GOP would pick its nominee \u2014 and whether it could prevent the disaster that unfolded last fall, when Democrats swept all three statewide offices against a slate of conservative candidates cast as out of step with changing Virginia.\n\nGOP leaders quickly set about preventing the nomination of a candidate too volatile or right-leaning to appeal to moderate voters in a newly crucial swing district. Battling with the tea party across the country for control of the GOP, these leaders quickly united behind Comstock.\n\nPolished. Conservative enough. And, as a Capitol Hill lobbyist and former head of public affairs for the Justice Department, a master at the kind of messaging needed to thread the needle just so in Virginia\u2019s sprawling 10th District, where Republicans range from gun enthusiasts in rural farm towns to federal contractors in Fairfax County more worried about traffic.\n\nComstock won the April 26 firehouse primary, though not without cost. Bruised by the attacks of her five more conservative opponents, she now must reposition for another potentially bruising battle with John Foust, a Fairfax County supervisor and the Democratic nominee.\n\nHer victory creates half a blueprint for a party struggling to reconcile its conservative base with an ever-changing general electorate. But the other half remains to be seen: whether, in the fall, she can attract the moderates who have been flocking to Democrats in recent elections.\n\nThe firehouse primary\n\nHow Comstock won the primary is a study in political gamesmanship, where every inch of the nomination process was guarded in favor of the establishment\u2019s choice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen the party coalesce around a nominee so quickly,\u201d said John Whitbeck, chairman of the 10th Congressional District Republican Committee.\n\nA key moment came in January, when state Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun) entered the race, carrying with him controversial remarks about spousal rape, homosexuality and sexual assaults in the military that ignited strong support among social conservatives \u2014 but equally strong antipathy from Democrats and some independents.\n\nAlmost immediately, several party leaders publicly encouraged Black to stay in the evenly split state Senate so the balance of power in Richmond would not tilt further toward Democrats.\n\nTwo days after he announced his candidacy, Black withdrew. In a district that stretches from McLean\u2019s soaring mansions to farmland near the West Virginia border, the decks were partially cleared for Comstock.\n\n\u201cRepublicans really dodged a bullet when Dick Black chose not to run,\u201d said David Wasserman, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nOthers tried to turn the primary election into a mandate on the leadership of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). But they, too, said they were quietly encouraged to withdraw.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of people come up to me and say: \u2018What are you doing? You\u2019re running against Barbara?\u2019 \u201d said Howard Lind, a former U.S. naval commander.\n\n\n\nCongressional candidate Del. Barbara Comstock, right, is seen with fellow candidate Howie Lind during a Republican debate in Sterling on April 9. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe establishment was throwing a lot of weight behind her and they were, basically, mad at me,\u201d Lind said.\n\nThen came the mechanics of the primary election, with Republican leaders in the 10th District choosing to hold a \u201cfirehouse primary,\u201d or canvass, instead of a regular primary or a convention. That allowed Comstock to focus much of the nearly $780,000 her campaign raised on a specific group of likely Republican voters through a barrage of visits, phone calls and ads.\n\nHer opponents\u2019 efforts on those fronts were meager by comparison.\n\nA canvass, which limited voting to a five-hour window on a Saturday at 10 locations across the district, was chosen for several reasons, Whitbeck said.\n\nBecause Virginia has open primaries, it guarded against Democrats seeking to subvert the election by supporting a candidate who might be unpalatable to moderate voters in a general election, he said.\n\nIt also avoided a raucous convention, where party activists tend to rally behind more conservative candidates \u2014 and can more easily affect the outcome through a series of delegate votes that require a nominee to win more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cThis would most likely have affected both turnout and outcome,\u201d said state Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), an outspoken and popular conservative who became Comstock\u2019s greatest threat after Black bowed out.\n\nMarshall, known for once calling disabled children a punishment from God on women who\u2019ve had abortions, drew loud applause during debates when he boasted about being a regular foil to Republican leaders in Richmond. He vowed to bring that same uncompromising style to Congress.\n\nComstock\u2019s campaign, which declined to answer questions about the nomination process, lobbied against holding a convention, her opponents said.\n\nBuilding coalitions\n\nFinally, Comstock cast herself as the sensible choice for Republicans by wrapping her congressional bid in Wolf\u2019s legacy and attempting to soften her own conservative record in the legislature, including a vote for a controversial mandate that women seeking abortions first submit to an invasive ultrasound.\n\n\n\nCongressional candidate Del.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nWhere her opponents took hard-line stances on the health-care law, Comstock adopted a more centrist line \u2014 vilifying the Obama administration for pushing the law through while calling for \u201cgood, logic-based patient care reform.\u201d\n\nShe cast herself as a coalition builder on such issues as the fight against human trafficking and luring jobs to Virginia. She also blamed tea party conservatives for her party\u2019s woes in Virginia, particularly the national backlash over the federal government shutdown last November.\n\n\u201cIf we had been opened and talking about Obamacare those five days before the election, I think Ken Cuccinelli would have been governor,\u201d she said at a business forum in McLean.\n\nAs a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential bid, Comstock entered the election with a national profile \u2014 a regular face on cable TV news shows always ready to serve up a soundbite.\n\n\u201cMy 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy,\u201d she said repeatedly during the primary campaign.\n\nThe mandate for Comstock to appeal to divergent voter perspectives \u2014 even in a Republican primary \u2014 is clear in the 10th District\u2019s electorate itself.\n\nRepublicans there can sound like Robert Luzzi, 60, who flies a tea party \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag outside his Springfield home and calls himself \u201ca belligerent conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of guy who\u2019s willing to shut down the government,\u201dsaid Luzzi, a retired U.S. Air Force pilot.\n\nAnd, they can sound like Susan Carney, 59, of Winchester, who cut off one candidate visiting her South American crafts store by saying she\u2019s in favor of the health-care act.\n\n\u201cAs a small business person, with a sick husband, I have to admit that Obamacare would really help me out,\u201d she told the candidate, Stephen Hollingshead.\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate Stephen Hollingshead and his wife, Jan Hollingshead, listen to speakers during a Clifton Republican Women's Club meeting on April 17. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nA sweeping reaction\n\nAppealing to voters across the spectrum has not been the GOP\u2019s strong suit in recent election cycles.\n\nIn last fall\u2019s statewide elections in Virginia, the Republican ticket for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general emerged from a convention dominated by deep conservatives motivated largely by populist outrage over the Affordable Care Act, illegal immigration and other core tea party grievances.\n\nThe candidates \u2014 former attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II, minister E.W. Jackson and state Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg) \u2014 failed to win over moderates and independents in what became the Democrats\u2019 first sweep of all three statewide offices in 24 years.\n\nTo avoid that fate, Comstock walked a gantlet of attacks from her Republican opponents that made her allies nervous. \u201cIf they nominate Bob Marshall, we lose the seat,\u201d confided one senior Republican aide before the primary election.\n\nDuring a candidates\u2019 forum in Purcellville, Rob Wasinger ignited anti-Comstock sentiments inside a packed Patrick Henry College auditorium with a favorite tea party line.\n\n\u201cBarbara, you lie!\u201d said Wasinger, a former chief of staff to two congressman, paraphrasing a charge Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) hurled at President Obama in 2009 during a speech about the health-care law.\n\nIn the face of many of those attacks, Comstock stayed silent \u2014 the only woman amid five white men smiling quietly and looking down as her opponents hammered away at her again and again.\n\nIt worked. Comstock received slightly more than half of the 13,609 votes cast in the primary. Marshall came in second.\n\nMore challenges remain, however.\n\nSupporters of Foust, the Democrat, are seizing on the acrimony of the Republican primary while calling Comstock a weak, \u201cmachine\u201d politician.\n\n\u201cThis intra-party slugfest is the worst-case scenario for Republicans, and Barbara Comstock is limping toward election day as a badly damaged candidate who has been unable to unify the support of even her own party,\u201d said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nIndeed, Comstock volunteers lamented having to do too much damage control from attacks from fellow Republicans. And the damage may still grow from the party\u2019s most conservative activists, who are known to stay home on Election Day if they don\u2019t believe in their party\u2019s nominee. Some voters who were against Comstock expressed apathy about the November election.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a stealth Democrat,\u201d said Lucy Dartley, 77, who supported Marshall in the primary election and admitted it\u2019s unlikely she would make the effort to vote in November.\n\nSearching for a better way to put it, Dartley drew another comparison meant to be negative that Comstock may not mind as she seeks to thread yet another needle in November.\n\n\u201cBarbara Comstock is not anything like Sarah Palin or Michelle Bachman,\u201d Dartley said, with a flick of her hand.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "va tenth, va politics, va local, dc politics, dc local, barbara comstock, john foust, tenth congressional district, firehouse primary", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The race for the U.S. House seat from Virginia\u2019s 10th district encapsulates the challenge faced by the GOP", "title": "GOP leaders unite behind Comstock even as its voters diverge", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/2014/05/17/cfbb7070-d489-11e3-aae8-c2d44bd79778_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/22/Others/Images/2014-04-22/va10%20comstock%20b1398144130.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aolivo"}, "description": "The race for the U.S. House seat from Virginia\u2019s 10th district encapsulates the challenge faced by the GOP", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va tenth, va politics, va local, dc politics, dc local, barbara comstock, john foust, tenth congressional district, firehouse primary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "cfbb7070-d489-11e3-aae8-c2d44bd79778"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6d5\"", "article_summary": "Supporters of Foust, the Democrat, are seizing on the acrimony of the Republican primary while calling Comstock a weak, \u201cmachine\u201d politician.\nBattling with the tea party across the country for control of the GOP, these leaders quickly united behind Comstock.\nOthers tried to turn the primary election into a mandate on the leadership of House Speaker John A.
