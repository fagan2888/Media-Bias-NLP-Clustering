Most everyone in D.C. is busy. But as longtime Hill Navigator readers may have noticed, this week we launched the first Roll Call e-book: Best Intern Ever: How to Ace Your Capitol Hill Internship .\n\nIt's a compilation of Hill Navigator's best advice geared toward acing your internship and turning it into a full-time job.\n\nIt's free. You can download it as an epub or as a PDF . Or read the entire book online .\n\nAnd for those who want the briefest of briefs, here are the six rules of success. Six rules! Surely that can be easy enough to remember. Internships are finite. There are always more bright-eyed, wannabe staffers ready to take your place, so it\u2019s up to you to make the most of it while you can.\n\nGood luck!\n\n1. Stay professional. Every year, Roll Call\u2019s Heard on the Hill writes up anecdotes of intern tomfoolery. While there may be egregious exceptions, more often these gaffes are due to inexperience and a lack of basic understanding of what it means to work in a professional setting.\n\nThings to remember:\n\nTreat every office visitor as a VIP, even if they are just your average Joe from Cincinnati.\n\nTreat everything connected to the office \u2014 email, phone, personal space, midday breaks \u2014 as sacrosanct.\n\nDon\u2019t put anything in email you don\u2019t want to see printed in Roll Call.\n\nLearn the office dress code (see No. 3) and err on the conservative side of following it.\n\nBrush up on your manners. Yes, it\u2019s arcane, but it works wonders. Hold the door for the person behind you, say 'thank you,\" kindly ask if you can put a person on hold before slamming the phone down. Such things can go a long way toward showing you\u2019re a capable team member, hopefully one the office wants to keep around.\n\n2. Check your opinions at the door. You may be majoring in political science, or have read everything Thomas Friedman ever wrote, but your personal opinions are usually best left unsaid. Sure, you can echo your enthusiasm for a cause your boss is championing, or include your admiration in your thank-you notes to the hard-working legislative staff, but you\u2019re there to help advance your boss\u2019 current agenda, not help him or her craft a new one.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about a particular topic\u2014 say Affordable Care Act regulations are a particular passion of yours \u2014 get to know the legislative assistant covering the issue and ask for reading recommendations or even a few minutes of their time for coffee. View your internship as a time to take in information, not spew out opinions.\n\nAnd when you do air your opinions\u2014 even if they are just about how fantastic that office Keurig is \u2014 be smart about your surroundings. Those Metro cars are tiny, voices travel. If you insist on talking about work in a public place, refrain from mentioning the boss\u2019 name or any other identifying details, lest you want to read about them in Roll Call.\n\n3. Learn, memorize, internalize and follow the office dress code. Ignore the smirks on staffers\u2019 faces, Hill Navigator knows that this isn\u2019t the no-brainer that experienced hands assume it is. Dress codes are not always as obvious or natural as it would seem, especially because many interns are in college and do not have extensive work-appropriate wardrobes. The yoga pants and sweatshirt combo might be fine for Econ 301, but Capitol Hill has a \u201csun\u2019s out-suit\u2019s out\u201d mentality.\n\nThe dress code matters.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner\u2019s announced policy for the 113th Congress states that staffers must be in \u201cappropriate business attire\u201d on the House floor, so this ups the ante on how staffers dress on a daily basis. Most offices have dress codes and will happily answer your questions about what to wear. Some stellar offices even have intern handbooks that address this directly. But just in case you aren\u2019t sure or are reluctant to ask, here are some general guidelines that can help get you off to a good start.\n\nWear a suit the first day of work. Even if it\u2019s recess. Or Friday. Or hot outside. Your first day sets the tone of your internship, and a suit shows you\u2019re taking it seriously.\n\nWear a suit (or jacket and tie, or blazer/slacks/skirt for ladies) every day Congress is in session.\n\nDress up every day the boss is in town. Most offices have a relaxed dress code when Congress is out of session, but if the boss is there, take the extra time to dress in business clothing.\n\nFollow the office\u2019s lead. Don\u2019t be the first one to wear jeans or break out into casual Friday polo shirts unless you see your co-workers doing the same thing. And by co-workers, I don\u2019t mean other interns. Take the cues from the higher-ups in the office.\n\nCover up. Keep the short skirts and deep v-neck shirts at home. If you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s office appropriate, it probably isn\u2019t.\n\nStay away from jeans, sneakers, T-shirts and yoga pants. No matter how casual Fridays get, you\u2019re better off in khakis or dress pants than something more comfortable. Wait for the weekends to wear whatever you want. Or wait until your internship is over.\n\n4. Ask this question: What is the office\u2019s social media policy? Social media: so fun, so ubiquitous and yet, it can be so detrimental to careers everywhere. Right after asking about the dress code, request a copy of the office social media policy. And then \u2014 like the dress code \u2014 err on the conservative side of following it.\n\n\u201cOne of the great fears of senior managers in Congress is waking up one day and finding a junior staffer or intern has thrust the office into a crisis because of some silly posting on social media,\u201d said Brad Fitch, president of the Congressional Management Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to helping Congress.\n\nEven privacy settings can\u2019t always protect you if you\u2019re posting items while you are at work, or including details \u2014 however inane \u2014 about your job. Remember that many members of Congress face re-election every two years, races that often cost millions of dollars, and opposition researchers are always looking for material, especially in an election year.\n\n5. Have meaningful \u2014 and realistic \u2014 expectations. Setting achievable goals is one of the best ways to have a positive internship experience, but expecting that you will write legislation, staff the senator or field press calls is setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\n\u201cInterns should understand they\u2019re being tested early on,\u201d Fitch said. \u201c[They] won\u2019t get any valuable work or experience if they don\u2019t do the little stuff right. The smart ones excel at the grunt work and graduate up from \u2018boring\u2019 to \u2018mildly interesting.\u2019\u201d\n\nHill Navigator would argue that even the mundane task of making coffee in a congressional office can be interesting; many offices have chatty back rooms. If you find yourself in one of those, you can pick up everything from legislative procedure to after-hours gossip while you\u2019re acing your tasks at the copy machine.\n\nAnd if your expectations include a paying job at the end of the term, you have all the more reason to excel at the small stuff, as many staff assistants pick up the grunt work once the interns have departed.\n\n6. Have humility, in large doses. This particular piece of advice is courtesy of many current and former Hill staffers: Do good work, but don\u2019t tell us all about it. You don\u2019t need to hang that marked-up constituent letter at your cube, or brag about how you\u2019re the only one who can navigate Cannon\u2019s fifth floor.\n\nEvery Hill office knows which interns are competent. In the frenetic, fast-paced world of Capitol Hill, people who get things done are easy to spot. You may not see it, but it might as well be tattooed on your forehead. Just make sure you\u2019ve got some appropriate business clothes to match your go-get-\u2019em attitude.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interns are busy. Most everyone in D.C. is busy.
