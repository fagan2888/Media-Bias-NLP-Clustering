In the words of one beneficiary whose plan will soon stop paying for aqua aerobics classes at the YMCA, the change in benefits is \u201cpretty dumb.\u201d\n\nIn Tampa Bay, where the plan has about 50,000 enrollees, Moffitt Cancer Center and St. Luke's Cataract and Laser Institute will be out of the network in 2014.\n\nThe insurer blames the changes on the federal government, which is trying to bring payments for Medicare Advantage plans more in line with original Medicare after two decades of being higher. And in 2014, insurers will be required to spend more on patient care and less on marketing and administrative costs. The feds are also offering bonuses for physicians who adhere to specific treatment guidelines.\n\nThe CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Jack Larsen, told the Times that smaller networks are easier to monitor -- and shrinking networks aren\u2019t limited to his company. Larsen said Medicare Advantage plans are underfunded. But UnitedHealthcare, the largest health insurer in the nation, reported $2 billion in profit in the third quarter of this year.\n\nIt\u2019s currently open enrollment season for Medicare, and beneficiaries have until Dec. 7 to switch plans if they want. As the Times reports, many AARP Medicare Advantage members are expected to find a new plan.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s AARP Medicare Advantage plan is dropping thousands of physicians from its network, as well as extras like fitness classes through Silver", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/aarp-plan-drops-perks-doctors", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201311/a4s_MEDICARE110313_11827038_8col.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s AARP Medicare Advantage plan is dropping thousands of physicians from its network, as well as extras like fitness classes through Silver", "title": "AARP Plan Drops Perks, Doctors"}, "story_id": 242994715, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Health News Florida Staff", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "AARP Plan Drops Perks, Doctors"}, "nid": 4484, "datePublished": "2013-11-04", "keywords": "Medicare, Medicare Advantage, AARP Medicare Advantage plans, AARP, Silver Sneakers, health insurance", "wordCount": 298, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe167f\"", "article_summary": "As the Times reports, many AARP Medicare Advantage members are expected to find a new plan.\nUnitedHealthcare\u2019s AARP Medicare Advantage plan is dropping thousands of physicians from its network, as well as extras like fitness classes through Silver Sneakers, the Tampa Bay Times reports (paywall alert).\nLarsen said Medicare Advantage plans are underfunded.\nThe insurer blames the changes on the federal government, which is trying to bring payments for Medicare Advantage plans more in line with original Medicare after two decades of being higher.\nIt\u2019s currently open enrollment season for Medicare, and beneficiaries have until Dec. 7 to switch plans if they want."}
