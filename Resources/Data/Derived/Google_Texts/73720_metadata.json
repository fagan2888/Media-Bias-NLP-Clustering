Indiana previously only had exposure to private credit through an opportunistic debt portfolio, targeted to make up about 2% of its overall investment portfolio, and through which managers could deploy a portion of their mandates in illiquid debt, according to the person.\n\nIndiana joins other investors that are creating dedicated allocations for private credit to bolster returns in a low-interest rate environment.\n\nThe pension fund\u2019s fixed income team, headed by Director Allen Huang, will take the lead in the build-out of private credit, the person said. Indiana\u2019s private equity investment staff, the pension fund\u2019s investment consultant Verus and private equity adviser TorreyCove Capital Partners will help source investments.\n\nVerus, in a presentation delivered to Indiana that was reviewed by Private Equity Beat, made a pitch for direct lending: Private capital providers would be \u201cwell compensated\u201d for making smaller loans that banks were less willing to make after post-economic downturn regulations hit. Verus also said the high volume of high yield bond issuance could present distressed opportunities ahead if the market goes south.\n\nIndiana\u2019s expansion of its new private credit portfolio is expected to be a gradual process spanning years. The pension fund isn\u2019t looking to push money into the market, especially in sub-sectors that are getting crowded, the person said. The pension fund will work on determining its pacing targets going forward.\n\nMore than half of some 50-plus investors polled by Preqin Ltd. this year said they planned to commit more capital to private credit this year than they did in 2014.\n\nThe Arizona State Retirement System, which oversees a roughly $34 billion pension fund, raised its target allocation in private debt to 10% from 3% of its portfolio this year. Liquid fixed income target allocation is slated to shrink by a corresponding seven percentage points over time.\n\nThe Orange County Employees Retirement System also received approval from its investment committee this year to bolster its target allocation to alternative credit.\n\nWrite to Dawn Lim at dawn.lim@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Indiana Public Retirement System is laying the groundwork to take its roughly $25 billion pension pool into private credit funds for the first time, said a person familiar with the matter.", "title": "Committed: Indiana Pension Fund Sets Sights on Building Out Private Credit", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/07/02/committed-indiana-pension-fund-sets-sights-on-building-out-private-credit/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Committed: Indiana Pension Fund Sets Sights on Building Out Private Credit", "description": "The Indiana Public Retirement System is laying the groundwork to take its roughly $25 billion pension pool into private credit funds for the first time, said a person familiar with the matter.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Dawn Lim", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "The Indiana Public Retirement System is laying the groundwork to take its roughly $25 billion pension pool into private credit funds for the first time, said a person familiar with the matter.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-02T20:10:45-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/07/02/committed-indiana-pension-fund-sets-sights-on-building-out-private-credit/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18623", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Indiana Public Retirement System is laying the groundwork to take its roughly $25 billion pension pool into private credit funds for the first time, said a person familiar with the matter.", "title": "Committed: Indiana Pension Fund Sets Sights on Building Out Private Credit", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/07/02/committed-indiana-pension-fund-sets-sights-on-building-out-private-credit/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18623", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-02T20:10:45-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Indiana\u2019s expansion of its new private credit portfolio is expected to be a gradual process spanning years.\nIndiana joins other investors that are creating dedicated allocations for private credit to bolster returns in a low-interest rate environment.\nIndiana\u2019s private equity investment staff, the pension fund\u2019s investment consultant Verus and private equity adviser TorreyCove Capital Partners will help source investments.\nBoard trustees approved an allocation shift that carves out 4% of the Indiana Public Retirement System\u2019s defined benefit portfolio for private credit, the person said.\nThe pension fund\u2019s fixed income team, headed by Director Allen Huang, will take the lead in the build-out of private credit, the person said."}
