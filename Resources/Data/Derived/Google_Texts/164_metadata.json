An 8 percent rate of increase means rates are going to double every nine years, Bill Lindsay, president of Lockton Benefit Group in Denver told \u201cColorado Matters\u201d on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe issue, I think, that most employers have is that this trend is becoming very difficult for them to be able to continue to afford,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nMost Coloradans--about 60 percent--get health insurance through their employers. The remainder buy insurance through the Colorado Health Exchange.\n\nColorado\u2019s rate increases have been higher than the national average, Lindsay said. But he\u2019s not sure why.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big question, and no one really knows the answer,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cOne would think that with an average age lower than many other places in the country, and with a healthier population, very active population, our costs ought to be lower. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case.\u201d\n\nOne possible reason for the higher costs is that Coloradans tend to seek more care than the national average, Lindsay said. Another is that as health care technology improves, the cost of it grows.\n\nContaining costs\n\nThe survey, which covered both large and small companies, included those that self-insure. In those cases, employers cut out insurance companies and pay for employee health care costs directly.\n\nSuch employers -- especially those in Colorado -- often offer wellness programs aimed at improving employees\u2019 health because it can directly affect the bottom line.\n\nThe impact of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, is still under review. Many of its provisions haven\u2019t kicked in yet. But Lindsay argues that the main thrust of the landmark law was it made health coverage more available, not more affordable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a very small part of the law that dealt with cost,\u201d Lindsay said, adding that those provisions focus on Medicare -- not commercial insurance.\n\nIn Colorado, Lindsay sees some reason for hope. The state Legislature in 2014 created a commission tasked with making recommendations to lawmakers and the governor for lowering health care costs. The Denver Post reported in August that the group has a \u201chas a long, hard slog ahead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "That\u2019s slightly lower than this year\u2019s gain of 10 percent, the survey says, but still in line with the state average for recent years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"phone_number": "303-871-9191", "site_name": "Colorado Public Radio", "description": "That\u2019s slightly lower than this year\u2019s gain of 10 percent, the survey says, but still in line with the state average for recent years.", "title": "Employee health insurance to rise 8 percent in Colorado, survey says", "url": "http://www.cpr.org/news/story/employee-health-insurance-rise-8-percent-colorado-survey-says", "region": "Colorado", "locality": "Centennial", "fax_number": "303-733-3319", "email": "info@cpr.org", "street-address": "7409 S Alton Ct", "postal-code": 80112, "type": "article", "image": "http://www.cpr.org/sites/default/files/images/healthcare.01142014.jpg", "country-name": "United States"}, "fb": {"app_id": 851183531577419}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The state Legislature in 2014 created a commission tasked with making recommendations to lawmakers and the governor for lowering health care costs.\nIn those cases, employers cut out insurance companies and pay for employee health care costs directly.\nThe remainder buy insurance through the Colorado Health Exchange.\nMost Coloradans--about 60 percent--get health insurance through their employers.\nAudio: CPR's Elaine Grant speaks with Bill Lindsay of Lockton Benefit Group(Photo: iStockphoto.com) The cost of employee insurance plans will go up 8 percent next year, a new survey of Colorado employers says."}
