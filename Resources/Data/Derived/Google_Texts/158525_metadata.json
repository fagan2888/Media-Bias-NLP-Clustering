Of the women ages 40 to 60 surveyed, about half of already financially strapped caregivers say money worries are their biggest source of stress. Other concerns include not having enough time to celebrate the holidays; juggling work, caregiving and family during holidays; and making the holidays meaningful for loved ones in our care.\n\nDespite the stress, the poll found caregivers also look forward to the holidays in many ways. They anticipate the wonderful feeling of seeing those they care for enjoy the holidays, making memories with them, having family gatherings they can participate in, and seeing their loved ones come alive when watching children experience holiday celebrations.\n\nThe public service ads will air in both English and Spanish on TV and radio, as well as in print media and outdoor spaces, such as billboards and bus shelters. The TV ads (embedded above) hit home for me as a caregiver. They are incredibly moving in the way they show how roles change in families: Our parents cared for us as children and now we are caring for them. Love remains throughout this natural cycle.\n\nThe campaign also encourages those who care for loved ones to reach out for help and support, especially at this joyful, but stressful, time of year.\n\nAmy Goyer is AARP\u2019s family, caregiving and multigenerational issues expert; she spends most of her time in Phoenix, where she is caring for her dad, who lives with her.
