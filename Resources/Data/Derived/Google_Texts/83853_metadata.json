Myles was then arrested on the orders of the Santa Cruz Alcalde who according to legal sources had the right to do so.\n\nOn the day of the arrest of the Mayan leaders of Santa Cruz, Belize\u2019 Prime Minister Dean Barrow criticized the Mayan Council actions, including the tying up and restraining of Miles, as being unacceptable. \u201cThat is indefensible,\u201d Barrow asserted. \u201cThese people, they, I think were pretty much well-positioned in terms of public opinion. I believe they've lost that completely now with this sort of action. Well they should. I mean, it is absolutely indefensible. I want to make clear to them again that, that consent judgment merely recognizes that they are entitled to certain rights. The nature of the rights is not spelled out.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, for them to do something like this,\u201d Barrow continued, \u201cthey talk about their rights, what about that man's human rights? What about his rights as a Belizean?\u201d\n\nIn other press accounts Myles had asserted that Mayan officials had used a racial epithet when referring to him and said they would ban his Mayan wife from meetings for marrying him.\n\n\u201cI don't know how on earth they can ever justify this,\u201d Barrow said. \u201cIn my view they've lost whatever moral high ground they ever had and I want to look carefully at it to see if any of them might not perhaps be criminally liable from what they did to that gentleman.\u201d\n\nBy June 30 however, the Mayan Council\u2019s legal team and arrested Mayan Activist Cristina Coc started to make public statements that described a very different scene.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d said Attorney James Anaya, who represented the Mayan community before the Caribbean Court and was a former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous People. \u201cFirst of all, the Caribbean Court kept jurisdiction over this in order to supervise the implementation of the order and we are saying the government of Belize has violated the consent judgment,\u201d Anaya said in an interview on July 3.\n\n\u201cAnd the Alcalde,\u201d he continued, \u201cis a magistrate, installed by the government, and can order arrests and other actions. Myles did not buy that property; he just went to a sacred site and started building without permission. He was told not to continue. The Alcalde went to the government and Belize police for assistance in stopping Myles and they did not respond.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government is just ignoring the judgment,\u201d Anaya added.\n\nLocal Mayan attorney Monica Coc also appeared at press conferences on July 3 in Belize to further explain their position before the Caribbean Court. \u201cThe application is asking the court to make clarifications and declarations with respect to that consent order and some of the things that we're asking the court to declare include, 1) to declare that the collective property rights arising from Maya customary land tenure includes the right of the Maya villages to determine pursuant to customary law, who may enter, use and reside in customary lands. Secondly, to declare that the government of Belize has breached paragraph 2 and 4 of the consent order\u2026The application is also asking the court to order the government of Belize to pay pecuniary and moral damages to the Maya villages of Santa Cruz, San Isidro and Golden Stream for the government's failure to honor its solemn undertaking under the CCJ order of April 22, 2015.\"\n\nFor activist Cristina Coc, her arrest and that of the other Mayan leaders reflects a different aspect of the situation.\n\n\u201cPerhaps one of the things the state and the elites have trouble accepting is that Mayan people can be land owners. That the elites can no longer use our lands for personal gain, as some of these politicians give away the land as payment for votes,\u201d she asserted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mayan leaders of Santa Cruz in Belize say they were arrested for removing and then arresting a man who had illegally started to build on a sacred site", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/11/mayan-leaders-arrested-protecting-sacred-site-161008", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/rupert_myles_-_courtesy_breakingbelizenews.com_.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Mayan Leaders Arrested for Protecting Sacred Site"}, "abstract": "Mayan leaders of Santa Cruz in Belize say they were arrested for removing and then arresting a man who had illegally started to build on a sacred site", "dc": {"title": "Mayan Leaders Arrested for Protecting Sacred Site"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/11/mayan-leaders-arrested-protecting-sacred-site-161008", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Mayan Leaders of Santa Cruz, Rupert Myles, Illegal Imprisonment, Sacred Sites, Dean Barrow, Cristina Coc, James Anaya, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous People, Monica Coc, Rick Kearns", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-11T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Mayan Leaders Arrested for Protecting Sacred Site"}, "article_summary": "For activist Cristina Coc, her arrest and that of the other Mayan leaders reflects a different aspect of the situation.\nOn the day of the arrest of the Mayan leaders of Santa Cruz, Belize\u2019 Prime Minister Dean Barrow criticized the Mayan Council actions, including the tying up and restraining of Miles, as being unacceptable.\nThe Mayan leaders of Santa Cruz assert that Myles had illegally started to build on top of a sacred site, and that after being asked to stop he appeared at Mayan Council meeting and threatened the officials with a gun.\nMyles was then arrested on the orders of the Santa Cruz Alcalde who according to legal sources had the right to do so.\nMyles did not buy that property; he just went to a sacred site and started building without permission."}
