But the NBA Hall of Famer ended up going anyway and befriended its leader Kim Jong-Un, saying about the North Korean leader, \u201cThat little kid is changing North Korea for the better.\u201d\n\nLater, Trump denied that claim and tweeted out that North Korea is the \u201clast place on Earth\u201d he would want to go.\n\nCrazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to. \u2014 Donald J.
