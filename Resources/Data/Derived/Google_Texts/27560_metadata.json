University of Zurich\n\nIt\u2019s like something from string theory or deja vu all over again. Science has long known that psychological disorders such as bipolar and depression are passed to the next generation, as if through reincarnation. But until now, not much has been known about how psychological stress changes the body in this life and the next.\n\nThese multi-generational phenomena \u2014 i.e., \u201chis dad was nuts, too\u201d \u2014 cannot be explained by mere genetics, according to Isabelle Mansuy, a researcher at the University of Zurich. For years, she has studied the molecular underpinnings of these non-genetic transferences of behaviors caused by traumas endured early in life.\n\nBiologically speaking, it\u2019s not that the son suffers the sins of the father. They both suffer.\n\n\"There are diseases such as bipolar disorder, that run in families but can't be traced back to a particular gene,\u201d Mansuy said in a university news release.\n\nThe researchers achieved success in identifying short RNA molecules as an integral part of such heritability. In the process, enzymes fashion these short RNA molecules by following a portion of the genetic directions \u2014 encoded on DNA \u2014 as a template. These resulting RNAs are then \u201ctrimmed\u201d into mature form by other enzymes, ready to serve a regulatory function in the molecular human world.\n\nIn the larger world of laboratory mice, researchers found that adults exposed earlier in life to trauma experienced differing levels of short RNA production, with some running high and others running low compared to others who\u2019d led more carefree lives. In the lab, mice exposed to trauma earlier in life behaved noticeably different in comparison to others, losing their natural aversion to open spaces \u2014 somewhat \u201csuicidal\u201d in the mouse world \u2014 and displaying behaviors consistent with depression.\n\nThese symptoms were then passed to the next generation not by genetics per se but through the father\u2019s sperm. With absolutely no personal experience with trauma, an individual may feel the effects of an intergenerational hurt, it seems.\n\nAside from depressive behaviors, the mice with trauma history suffered an impaired metabolism with lower levels of blood-sugar and insulin than others. \"We were able to demonstrate for the first time that traumatic experiences affect metabolism in the long-term and that these changes are hereditary,\u201d Mansuy said.\n\nFrom shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations, as the old saying goes. Similar to other studies in the emerging field of epigenetics, the researchers found effects on not only behavior but metabolism.\n\n\"With the imbalance in \u2018microRNAs\u2019 in sperm, we have discovered a key factor through which trauma can be passed on,\u201d Mansuy said.\n\nYet many aspects of the process remain mysterious to researchers, including how the dysregulation in short RNAs actually happens \u2014 which Mansuy speculatively describes as a \u201cchain of events\u201d born of an overproduction of stress hormones.\n\nAlthough we cannot prevent the past, Mansuy and other epigeneticists hope to diagnose what ails us now and into the future. Among interesting avenues of research is the tantalizing idea that behavioral traits may be inherited through similar non-genetic mechanisms building on a skeletal frame of DNA.\n\nSource: Gapp K, Mansuy I, Prados J, et al.
