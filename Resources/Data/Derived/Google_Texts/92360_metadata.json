He says he knows there is interest among students in learning more \u2014 when he began offering his first overview, his room was filled to capacity.\n\nSome of the other class offerings would include Kentucky bourbon tourism, food sanitation, thermal processing and sensory analysis,with more probably added, though it won't replace existing degree programs.\n\n\"It's not like a master's in wine or a graduate degree focused on one subject,\" DeBolt said. \"We kept it purposefully broad, to give a basic introduction. They will still need to get an internship and work their way up.\"\n\nWheeler said the biggest limitation currently facing Kentucky's wine industry is the lack of trained workers.\n\n\"If we can give them even a year or two of experience, it's immensely helpful,\" Wheeler said. \"Knowing how to grow grapes and make wine is a long process. It takes years to learn to make high-end wine. \u2026 I want to introduce students to commercial grape growers, try to set up job opportunities or internships.\"\n\nThe college hopes to begin offering the certification next year.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1qNgxCH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The University of Kentucky agriculture college is proposing undergraduate certification courses for students interested in distilling bourbon and making wine.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The University of Kentucky agriculture college is proposing undergraduate certification courses for students interested in distilling bourbon and making wine.", "title": "UK proposes courses in brewing, distilling", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/11/16/uk-brewing-distilling-bourbon-wine-certification/19142519/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The University of Kentucky agriculture college is proposing undergraduate certification courses for students interested in distilling bourbon and making wine.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b49417815aeda75f5f23d8b6b4ce326b25b2f39/c=0-193-942-1135&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg", "title": "The University of Kentucky proposes certification in brewing, distilling", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Kentucky", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Kentucky", "title": "UK proposes courses in brewing, distilling", "author": "Associated Press", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb0396a0d325c57789f62baf39c33732f4a9509a/c=0-36-942-1292/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2595b09ae225a4b736943ff68e71b8687b12c83d/c=0-193-942-1135/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fc23bf7562918d0ba57913d8d05f39733776dc7/c=0-311-942-1017/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f5210639952a06bfb0b19602558910ead7b51e6/c=0-399-942-929&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-16T18:45:54.840000-05:00", "shorthed": "UK proposes courses in distilling", "articleid": 19142519, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82cab154dd8466e4a45f9bb9294c3671e0c88584/c=0-399-942-929/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f9d1db29af13a319803dce3354595afc2f3a67c/c=98-0-845-1328/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/11/16/alcoholv.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "uk,university,kentucky,brewing,distilling,certification,bourbon,wine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b40\"", "article_summary": "Alcohol (Photo: Thinkstock.com )The University of Kentucky agriculture college is proposing undergraduate certification courses for students interested in distilling bourbon and making wine.\nThe certification would be offered to students who complete at least four classes: spirit chemistry and wine, brewing and distillation science.\nSome of the other class offerings would include Kentucky bourbon tourism, food sanitation, thermal processing and sensory analysis,with more probably added, though it won't replace existing degree programs.\nWheeler said the biggest limitation currently facing Kentucky's wine industry is the lack of trained workers.\nThe college's undergraduate curriculum council has approved the proposal for an undergraduate certificate in distillation, wine and brewing studies, but it still needs final approval from the university."}
