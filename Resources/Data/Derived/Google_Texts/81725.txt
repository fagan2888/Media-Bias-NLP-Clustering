Lights, fog and spirit fingers filled the air as cheer teams from Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and Canada gathered to compete for a National title in the JAMfest Nationals at the Kentucky International Convention Center.

The cheerleaders practice for months leading up to the competition, which consists of a series of three minute choreographed performances to win not only first place, but to take home awards like "Best Sportsmanship," "Best Choreography," and the "Spirit Award," which comes with a megaphone award. "They simply amaze me every time they hit the floor. These girls practice hard and compete even harder," Heather Bryant, one of the coaches of the Cheeriffic All Stars from Logan, West Virginia said.

Teams of cheerleaders lined the hallways curling each other's hair, stretching and going over routines. Even though they are on different teams the uniforms mingle and the cheerleaders watch as other teams practice. JAMfest is an "amazing experience, all of it, the lights, the music, the energy," Bailey Troutt, 17, from Valley Xtreme in Louisville. "We're all competing against each other, but we're not really rooting against each other. We still want everyone to do the best they can," she said.
