Cincinnati â€” Live by the turnover, die by the turnover.

That's the simplest way to sum up Marquette's 62-58 loss to Xavier on Saturday at the Cintas Center.

In the first half, it looked like the former would be the theme of the day for Marquette. The Golden Eagles coaxed 12 Xavier giveaways, including nine steals, during the opening 20 minutes.

Marquette's active zone defenses flummoxed Xavier's offense. Varying between 2-3 and 1-3-1, the Golden Eagles clogged passing lanes, kicked balls, deflected passes and forced the Musketeers to take low-percentage, contested three-pointers, which Xavier hit at just a 16.7% clip.

Put that together and the result was a 31-22 halftime lead over the highest-scoring team in the Big East on their home court.

Then Xavier flipped the script.

For the fourth time in as many road games, turnovers became an issue for Marquette during the second half. The Golden Eagles committed 11 of their season-high 18 turnovers in the final 20 minutes and stagnated offensively with only seven made field goals on 19 attempts.

The Golden Eagles have had 14 or more turnovers five times and are 1-4 in those games. All four losses came in Marquette's four true road games and the win came on Matt Carlino's game-winning shot Wednesday night against Creighton.

"We didn't take very good care of the ball," coach Steve Wojciechowski said. "We should take better care of the ball....I thought some of the turnovers were unforced. We've been down that road before and it's inexcusable."

Marquette's turnovers chiefly came from the starters, who all had at least two. Carlino had five, including four in the second half. Juan Anderson had four, Derrick Wilson had three for the first time this season and Luke Fischer also had three. The Golden Eagles bench, which was without Jajuan Johnson, whom Wojciechowski decided to hold out, accounted for one turnover and three points in 36 minutes.

The Musketeers fed off those turnovers and their momentum steadily grew. They began to move the ball more efficiently against the zone. Unlike the first half, though, Xavier's shooters had open looks and knocked down 8 of 16 attempts from long range.

"We knew they were going to fight, but we just focused on ourselves and playing the way we needed to play," Carlino said. "It just got away from us....

"They attacked the right areas in the zone and we played too stiff to start the second half."

Usually responsible for those treys were Remy Abell and Myles Davis, who came off the bench to combine for 29 points, including 26 in the second half, and 8 three-pointers. Abell gave Xavier its first lead of the game with a three-pointer with 7:20 left in the game and the Musketeers never trailed again.

"I thought the two kids off the bench gave them a huge boost in Myles Davis and Remy Abell," Wojciechowski said. "They hit huge shots for them. Up until that point I thought our defense was pretty good. Once one or two guys hit a shot I think everybody starts seeing a bigger basket."

Despite the turnovers, Marquette had opportunities to win late thanks in part to Carlino taking over offensively. The senior transfer from BYU scored 17 of his game-high 27 points in the second half, including 4 three-pointers.

"He hit all the big shots when we were hanging on," Wojciechowski said. "Matt is a guy who can make and is not scared of big shots."

So it came as no surprise that the ball was in Carlino's hands with Marquette trailing by three with 15.7 seconds left.

Abell, a 6-foot-4 junior guard, requested to be put on Carlino for the deciding possession. Along with center Matt Stainbrook, who went through a screen to provide pressure, Abell forced Carlino to take a tough shot from the wing that fell harmlessly to ensure a Xavier win.

Xavier (12-6, 3-3) shook off a pair of road wins to improve to 10-0 at the Cintas Center. The loss dropped Marquette to 10-7 and 2-3 and meant the Golden Eagles will have to continue to search for their first win on the road.

"We've just got to grow up," Carlino said. "Can't be turning it over. We've got to get one. There's no excuses, really. We've just got to win on the road. We can do it, we're capable. We just haven't shown it."
