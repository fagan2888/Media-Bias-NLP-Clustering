In 2014, Apple paid just $36 million tax on $7.11 billion in profits.\n\nDid Apple name the robot Liam because they built it with all the money they saved using Ireland as a tax haven? #AppleEvent \u2014 Ryan O. Ferguson (@ryanoferguson) March 21, 2016\n\nThroughout the economic recession that started in 2008, when the collapse of the banking system forced the country to bailout from the IMF, the tax rate was kept safe by the ruling parties, citing it as integral to attracting business to the country.\n\nBut today, while Ireland celebrates its (mostly) independence, the republic does not have a working government after the February general election ended in a stalemate between several parties and independents, many of whom oppose the current corporate tax structure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Max Keiser marked 100 years after Ireland\u2019s famed Easter Rising by accusing its government of providing shelter to \u201cfinancial terrorists\u201d from other countries.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Max Keiser marked 100 years after Ireland\u2019s famed Easter Rising by accusing its government of providing shelter to \u201cfinancial terrorists\u201d from other countries.", "title": "Keiser: Ireland sheltering foreign \u2018terrorists,\u2019 100 years after (almost) independence", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2016.03/article/56f6d504c3618845478b45db.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/business/337364-keiser-ireland-sheltering-terrorists/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "Max Keiser marked 100 years after Ireland\u2019s famed Easter Rising by accusing its government of providing shelter to \u201cfinancial terrorists\u201d from other countries.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2016.03/article/56f6d504c3618845478b45db.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Now, Pfizer can avail of Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, compared to 35 percent in the US.\nPfizer, which was previously headquartered in New York, is the latest corporation to have an \u201cinversion,\u201d merging with a foreign firm to benefit from another country\u2019s corporate tax rate.\nSo Trump's attack on Pfizer moving to Ireland means he's going to go after tax shelters in the EU or lower domestic tax rates?\nQUACK QUACK https://t.co/Ztfp4BZlRM \u2014 Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) November 24, 2015The pharma giant raised prices on 133 of its brand-name products in the US last year, putting them further out of reach from the millions of patients who can\u2019t afford critical medications, even with Obamacare coverage.\nThe tax rate has been a controversial issue, with companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft receiving criticism for avoiding higher rates of tax."}
