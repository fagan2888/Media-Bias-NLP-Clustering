The contract crews are picking up 700 tons of tree debris every day, but 621 square miles is a lot of ground to cover.\n\n\u201cThis was a huge storm and it's going to take a long time to clean up,\u201d said Kristy Yager with the City of Oklahoma City.\n\nYager said the city did preliminary damage assessments immediately after the storms and got a shock.\n\n\u201cWe thought we knew how much debris was going to be out there but there was a whole lot more,\u201d she explained.\n\nIt totaled to 13,000 tons.\n\nThat is why it's taking longer than expected.\n\n\u201cWe could go down a street and have to end up at the landfill and it takes a long time to drive out to the landfill and get rid of that debris,\u201d Yager said.\n\nThe city is going to hit every neighborhood twice.\n\n\u201cWe wish we could tell people when we are going to be in their neighborhood, but really there is no way of knowing,\u201d Yager said.\n\nEdge said she cannot help but feel like her neighborhood is at the end of the line.\n\n\u201cI don't know why we are last, or it feels like we are last,\u201d Edge said.\n\nContractors have about 35 trucks currently on city streets picking up tree debris.\n\nStarting next week, the city will increase that to 55 trucks to try to speed things up.\n\nCity crews picking up regularly scheduled bulk waste sometimes pick up small debris piles depending on the size.\n\nHowever, the contract crews will still come back through to hit bigger piles.\n\nMake sure to put old Christmas trees in the bulk waste pile, not in the storm debris pile. Residents cannot mix bulk waste with storm debris. Those must be two separate piles.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma City officials are asking residents to be patient\u00a0when it comes to storm debris collection.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30866857/okc-officials-asking-for-patience-in-storm-debris-pickup", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9564304_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma City officials are asking residents to be patient\u00a0when it comes to storm debris collection.", "title": "OKC Officials Asking For Patience In Storm Debris Pickup"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9564304_G.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma City officials are asking residents to be patient\u00a0when it comes to storm debris collection.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Officials Asking For Patience In Storm Debris Pickup"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-officials-asking-for-patience-in-storm-debris-pickup", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/01/01", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado, ice, storm, debris, pickup, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado, ice, storm, debris, pickup, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "article_summary": "Edge said what many Oklahoma City residents are thinking about the storm debris from Thanksgiving.\nCity crews picking up regularly scheduled bulk waste sometimes pick up small debris piles depending on the size.\nMake sure to put old Christmas trees in the bulk waste pile, not in the storm debris pile.\nTree limbs and debris piles line the streets in Oklahoma City, more than a month after the ice storm that caused the damage.\nResidents cannot mix bulk waste with storm debris."}
