The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has scheduled public meetings next week on the proposed reorganization of the VA Black Hills Health Care System.



Some of the meetings will focus on the National Historic Preservation Act, which requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their actions on historic properties.



The VA has served veterans in Hot Springs for more than a century but now wants to move some services to Rapid City. The Hot Springs VA hospital is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and could be shuttered. An opposition group called Save the VA is fighting that.



The meetings next week are in Rapid City, Hot Springs, Pine Ridge, and three Nebraska communities: Chadron, Alliance and Scottsbluff.
