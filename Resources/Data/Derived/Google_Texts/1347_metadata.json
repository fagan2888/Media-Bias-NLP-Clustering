But it\u2019s much higher than the 6 million that the Congressional Budget Office forecast would be covered this year, a number that seemed unattainable when the botched launch of HealthCare.gov slowed signup to a crawl last October.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMedicare chief Marilyn Tavenner released the first enrollment update since May as she appeared at the House Oversight Committee on Thursday. She pointed to good enrollment news as the administration gears up for the second signup season in November, and as the GOP renews its attack on the Obama administration for security flaws at HealthCare.gov.\n\nBut Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) called the updated figure a \u201cprecipitous drop.\u201d Tavenner countered that it\u2019s a \u201creally strong number.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Firm: Health care still big in midterms)\n\nPaul Houchens, an actuary at Milliman who closely tracks the health law, later said in an email that the new number is \u201cabout what I would expect based on the initial sign ups and reported payment ratios.\u201d\n\nThe figure is complex to unravel. The number came from the health insurers, who told the Obama administration every month how many people are covered by Affordable Care Act plans. A CMS official said Thursday that in prior monthly reports, the numbers varied widely, but recently stabilized.\n\nIt includes some of the 8 million who signed up in the regular season, minus those who didn\u2019t pay or dropped out for some reason, such as deciding that they didn\u2019t like the coverage or getting a new job with insurance. It also includes those who signed up in the \u201cspecial enrollment\u201d period because of changes in their job or family situation that affected their insurance coverage.\n\nTavenner refused to break down the figures and other CMS officials said they couldn\u2019t do so, either.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Fewer uninsured, CDC finds)\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the number of consumers who paid their premiums and continue to enroll in the marketplace coverage every day through special enrollment periods,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublican critics of the health law have been skeptical of the 8 million figure, in part because the administration wouldn\u2019t say for several months how many people had paid.\n\n\u201cFor the past five months, the administration has been silent on enrollment details for the president\u2019s health care law, and now we know why: the number was going down,\u201d said Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas). \u201cSadly, this comes as no surprise.\u201d\n\nThe figure\u2019s release also starts to answer a long-term question facing Obamacare: will people stay on the rolls? It will be a particularly important question in the second year, when the Obama administration tries to enroll millions more Americans in the president\u2019s signature health law.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Report: ACA abortion rules ignored)\n\nThe insurance industry had estimated that roughly 15 percent \u2014 estimates ranged from 10 percent to 20 percent \u2014 of the enrollees wouldn\u2019t pay up. The main industry lobby had no comment on Tavenner\u2019s announcement. But, in general, the insurance industry is increasing, not shrinking, its footprint in the exchanges in the second year.\n\nLarry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the figure suggests that \u201cfears about large numbers of enrollees failing to pay their premiums were unfounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real challenge is now figuring how to ramp up enrollment significantly going into the next open enrollment period,\u201d he said. \u201cReaching the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projection of 13 million enrolled next year will be at least as hard as getting this first 7.3 million signed up.\u201d\n\nIt was the first official enrollment update since shortly after the open enrollment season ended in April. At that time, 8,019,763 had chosen health insurance plans, but not all had paid premiums.\n\nAbout 115,000 customers still have immigration or citizenship data-matching discrepancies, and information to fix those problems has not been sent to the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency official said. Those people could lose coverage this month and cause the number of enrolled people to change further.\n\nThe figure\u2019s release came as Republicans resharpened their attacks on HealthCare.gov\u2019s security in a House Oversight Committee hearing.\n\nIssa accused Obama administration officials of covering up weaknesses in HealthCare.gov and blocking full transparency in the Obamacare website. He went after the administration officials for working with Democrats on the committee \u201cto make this hearing good for you.\u201d\n\nHe accused them of \u201ccovering up the ongoing failure to secure a website that cost \u2026 over a billion dollars.\u201d\n\nTavenner defended the website and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, telling Congress that the agency is \u201ckeenly aware of the challenges we face as a new program of this scale matures, particularly one that faced significant challenges in its first year.\u201d\n\nShe said there\u2019s no evidence to date that any American\u2019s personal information has been \u201cmaliciously\u201d accessed on HealthCare.gov. Issa said that \u201cmalicious\u201d intent is irrelevant if information can be accessed even \u201caccidentally.\u201d\n\nTavenner said the administration is working on \u201csignificant technological improvements\u201d to the federal enrollment website and its systems and that consumers can have confidence that their information is secure.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It was the first official enrollment update since shortly after the open enrollment season ended in April.", "title": "7.3M enrolled in Obamacare plans", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/obamacare-enrollment-numbers-111097.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/10/obamacare_aca_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Health,Marilyn Tavenner", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "It was the first official enrollment update since shortly after the open enrollment season ended in April.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9441\"", "article_summary": "7.3M enrolled in Obamacare plansThe administration\u2019s announcement that 7.3 million people are now enrolled in health insurance plans on the Obamacare exchanges immediately ignited a new round of arguments about the success or failure of the health law.\n\u201cReaching the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projection of 13 million enrolled next year will be at least as hard as getting this first 7.3 million signed up.\u201dIt was the first official enrollment update since shortly after the open enrollment season ended in April.\nThe figure includes people who have paid for their premiums and are enrolled as of Aug. 15.\nThose people could lose coverage this month and cause the number of enrolled people to change further.\nIssa accused Obama administration officials of covering up weaknesses in HealthCare.gov and blocking full transparency in the Obamacare website."}
