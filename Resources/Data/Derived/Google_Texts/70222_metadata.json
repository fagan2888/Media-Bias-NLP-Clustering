Third St. at St. Catherine Street.\n\nSome sang in a 100-member-plus combined choir, and the Mass Choir from Green Street Baptist Church \u2014 one of the daughters \u2014 at 519 E. Gray St. east of downtown performed on its own, directed by Chris Fenner and Ronn Norfleet.\n\nGreen Street member V. Pauline Taylor said that Walnut Street is dear to the hearts of her church\u2019s members. \u201cWe are one of the branches of their tree,\u201d she said.\n\nWorship leaders\n\nAmong the others who helped lead the service were the Rev. Mark Williams, Walnut Street\u2019s senior pastor; pianist Albin C.

Kris Billiter, pastor of Eastpoint Community Church, 13420 Eastpoint Centre Dr. east of Anchorage, Walnut Street\u2019s latest daughter church. It began meeting in 2014 and will hold its formal launch service September 13.\n\nThe Rev. Jim Cobban, pastor of First Baptist Church Middletown, spoke about \u201cWalnut Street Through the Years\u201d as his church was celebrating its 95th anniversary. Cobban, also a former Walnut Street ministerial staff member for 17 years, recalled serving on an Old Louisville Crime and Safety Committee and helping form the Old Louisville Neighborhood Coalition and Old Louisville Neighborhood Council.\n\nEllison talked about \u201csending people from this place\u201d and \u201cextending\u201d the church\u2019s reach across Jefferson County.\n\nWalnut Street Baptist has been celebrating all year and also plans a 200th anniversary \u201chomecoming\u201d gathering Oct. 18. It will start with a 10:30 a.m. worship service followed by lunch and other activities, said Kathy Dehoney Evitts, 200th anniversary team leader.\n\nHistory\n\nWalnut Street Baptist was founded by 13 \u201cbelievers\u201d in a home as First Baptist Church in 1815, according to a church history. By the late 1820s, the congregation had grown significantly, and African American members wanted to form their own church, which ultimately became Fifth Street Baptist.\n\nIn 1849, First Baptist united with its daughter church, Second Baptist, formed in 1838, to become Walnut Street Baptist.\n\nThe first sanctuary was at Fourth and Walnut streets. That property was sold in 1900, and the church moved to the \u201csuburbs\u201d at Third and St. Catherine, dedicating a new sanctuary (which remains today) in 1902.\n\nDaughter churches\n\nActive daughter churches: First Baptist (1815), Fifth Street Baptist (1829), Shiloh Baptist (1842), Green Street Baptist (1844), Immanuel Baptist (1854), Franklin Street Baptist (1865), Broadway Baptist (1870), Third Avenue Baptist (1880), Fourth Avenue Baptist (1883), Parkland Baptist (1886), Highland Baptist (1892), Cable Baptist (1896), Grace Community Baptist (1900), Deer Park Baptist (1908), Highland Park First Baptist (1916), Middletown First Baptist (1920), St. Matthews Baptist (1926), Southside Baptist (1926), Manly Memorial Baptist (1937), Kenwood Baptist (1944), Foster Avenue Baptist (1946), Melbourne Heights Baptist(1948), Walnut Ridge Baptist(1952), Oak Park Baptist (1954), Fairmount Baptist (1957), Hurstbourne Baptist (1966), Chinese/Walnut Street Baptist (1990), Christ Church Goshen (1992), Antioch (2009) and Eastpoint Community (2014).\n\nReporter Martha Elson can be reached at (502) 582-7061 and melson@courier-journal.com.
