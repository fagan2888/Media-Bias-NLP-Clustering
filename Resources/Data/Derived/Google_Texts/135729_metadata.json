One of them demanded money from her, while the other bashed out the glass to a candy machine in the business.\n\nShe handed over $100 dollars that was in the register and the two took off. The Laundromat does have surveillance cameras, but they were not activated at the time since the owner says they were between internet providers.\n\nThe owner says they have had the Laundromat for about five years and have had break-ins in the past, but they usually happen overnight when the place is closed and no one is there. Those thieves would usually smash a window to get in and break into the change machine or the vending machine. Patel says this is the first time someone has robbed her while she was there.\n\nPolice are investigating but have little to go on. Both men were wearing hoodies and covered their faces and spoke English and Spanish.\n\nIf anyone has any information, they are urged to call crime stoppers at 235-7300.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma City police are looking for two men who held up a woman at knife point at a local Laundromat.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24959039/okc-police-search-for-suspects-after-laundromat-robbery", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24959039_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma City police are looking for two men who held up a woman at knife point at a local Laundromat.", "title": "OKC Police Search For Suspects After Laundromat Robbery"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24959039_SA.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma City police are looking for two men who held up a woman at knife point at a local Laundromat.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Police Search For Suspects After Laundromat Robbery"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-police-search-for-suspects-after-laundromat-robbery", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/03/12", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,laundromat,break-in,robbed,patel,police,knife,news9.com,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,laundromat,break-in,robbed,patel,police,knife,news9.com,"}, "article_summary": "The robbery happened early Wednesday morning at the Unique Wash at the corner of Portland and N.W.\nOklahoma City police are looking for two men who held up a woman at knife point at a local Laundromat.\nIt happened early Wednesday morning at the Unique Wash at the corner of Portland and N.W.\nJagruti Patel, the owner of the Unique Wash, says shortly after 8 a.m. when she opened the Laundromat, two guys walked in and pointed a knife at her.\nThose thieves would usually smash a window to get in and break into the change machine or the vending machine."}
