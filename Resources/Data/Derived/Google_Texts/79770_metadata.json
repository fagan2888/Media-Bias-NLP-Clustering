That\u2019s because you probably don\u2019t need one. Odds are that what you really need is medical attention, and if you do, the department will get it to you \u2013 in the form of a smaller truck staffed by a firefighter and a nurse\u2019s assistant from a local hospital.\n\nThe ladder trucks still roll out to actual fires, but saving them for that purpose and not sending a fully staffed one to every fire call that comes in have saved the city money and improved the quality of care for the people it serves. Those improvements are the result of a deep data analysis the city conducted several years ago, which found that 80 percent of its fire calls were actually medical issues.\n\nCities across the country would love to emulate that formula: better service for less money. But at a time when data-driven government effectiveness research is having a moment in Washington \u2013 most recently, in a bill introduced last week by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2013 most local governments are just waking up to its possibilities.\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable arm of former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is making a big bet that it can accelerate that process. It will announce on Monday that it is spending $42 million to create the What Works Cities Initiative, which is aimed at helping 100 mid-size cities make better use of data and evidence in their policymaking.\n\nCities with between 100,000 and 1 million residents will be eligible to apply for help from the program. The money will fund work from several partners, including Results for America, the new Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University\u2019s Government Performance Lab, all of which will work with the cities selected to participate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little data on the use of data and evidence in local governments,\u201d said James Anderson, a former Bloomberg mayoral aide who leads the government innovation program for Bloomberg Philanthropies. \u201cMayors are just hungry for tools and resources that help them use data more effectively. What we\u2019ve found is there\u2019s a gap\u201d between what they\u2019d like to do and what they can do.\n\nDriving that hunger is budget math: Local governments around the country cut budgets to cope with the Great Recession, and they\u2019ve largely kept feeling a squeeze through the not-blistering recovery that has followed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any government that\u2019s not strapped financially right now,\u201d said Greg Fischer, the mayor of Louisville, Ky., who recently hosted a gathering of civic leaders to discuss data opportunities, \u201cso the question is, how do you do more with less?\u201d\n\nLouisville has put data analysis to work in simple and complicated ways. It dug into restaurant inspection data to figure out why 11 percent of the city\u2019s establishments weren\u2019t being inspected on time. From what they learned, they cut that rate to 0.1 percent.\n\nTo better understand incidents of asthma in their town, city officials outfitted 400 inhalers with GPS tracking devices. They mapped where those inhalers were used around town and collected information on time of day, temperature and other external factors that might cause asthma attacks, in hopes that the city might be able to do something to reduce them \u2013 say, change traffic patterns or plant more trees.\n\nIn Mesa, the firefighting analysis pushed the city to buck convention on how to run a fire department - sending full trucks on every call \u201cwas the wrong mode,\u201d John Giles, Mesa\u2019s mayor, said, \u201cbut it\u2019s the model that everybody in the country follows\u201d \u2013 and eventually to teach other cities how they could reorient their departments, too.\n\nThe What Works Cities Initiative hopes to fuel that kind of best-practice sharing. The Johns Hopkins team, for example, will assess cities\u2019 data capabilities \u2013 including open data programs that enlist residents to help solve problems \u2013 and push cities to share their tools and practices with one another.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a funding network to get resources into cities,\u201d said Beth Blauer, the executive director of the Hopkins center. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a support network.\u201d\n\nEven the pioneers of local-government data initiatives have a lot more they could do, said Giles, the Mesa mayor. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to learn from other cities,\u201d he said, and \u201cjust steal good ideas from other people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bloomberg has an idea about bringing data to cities.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jimtank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Bloomberg has an idea about bringing data to cities.", "title": "Bloomberg to give $42 million to help cities do more with data", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/19/cities-arent-great-with-data-could-mike-bloomberg-change-that/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/09/aviary-8.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jimtankersley"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/19/cities-arent-great-with-data-could-mike-bloomberg-change-that/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jimtank"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf905\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable arm of former New York City mayor Michael R.
