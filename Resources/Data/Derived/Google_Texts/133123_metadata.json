The Blue Devils host the Buckeyes on Saturday.\n\nBrown (12-4) lost to Yale in the Ivy League Tournament semifinals Friday and was fortunate to receive one of eight at-large NCAA bids.\n\nBrown is 7-1 on the road.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything but concentrate on Brown, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d DU coach Bill Tierney said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of a relentless offensive team; they will play us very much like Ohio State. They\u2019re going to take a lot of shots. It\u2019s going to be a different game for us. But they really are an explosive group, and it\u2019s so important that we don\u2019t think past them.\u201d\n\nDuke is the two-time defending NCAA champion. The Blue Devils defeated DU 15-12 in the national semifinals last year, but the Pioneers won a rematch 17-13 in the Feb. 14 season opener in Kennesaw, Ga.\n\nOhio State is the last team to defeat DU, doing so 13-11 on March 14 in Columbus.\n\n\u201cDuke and Ohio State are teams we have great history with. They\u2019re both very good lacrosse teams,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cBut we have to keep an eye on Brown and really do our homework. That\u2019s all that matters right now.\u201d\n\nDenver has a chance to host consecutive NCAA Tournament games for the first time. The Pioneers, who will host a first-round game for the third consecutive year and fourth overall, are making their sixth straight NCAA Tournament appearance and eighth overall.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nNCAA tournament pairings\n\nWednesday\u2019s play-in games\n\nBryant at Marist, 5 p.m.\n\nHigh Point at Towson, 5:30 p.m.\n\nSaturday\u2019s games\n\nAlbany at No. 8 Cornell, 10 a.m.\n\nYale at No. 6 Maryland, 12:30 p.m.\n\nTowson or High Point at No. 1 Notre Dame, 3 p.m.\n\nOhio State at No. 5 Duke, 5:30 p.m.\n\nSunday\u2019s games\n\nJohns Hopkins at No. 7 Virginia, 11 a.m.\n\nBrown at No. 4 Denver, 1 p.m.\n\nColgate at No. 3 North Carolina, 3:15 p.m.\n\nMarist or Bryant at No. 2 Syracuse, 5:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU Pioneers men\u2019s lacrosse to host NCAA Tournament", "title": "DU Pioneers men\u2019s lacrosse to host NCAA Tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/03/du-pioneers-mens-lacrosse-to-host-ncaa-tournament/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150429__denver-laxp1.jpg", "height": 535}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150429__denver-laxp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T19:58:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:14:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s all that matters right now.\u201dDenver has a chance to host consecutive NCAA Tournament games for the first time.\n4 overall NCAA Tournament seed and will open against unseeded Brown next Sunday at DU\u2019s Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium (1 p.m., ESPNU).\nThe Denver Pioneers\u2019 path to making their fourth NCAA Final Four appearance in the past five years goes through Denver.\nThe Pioneers, who will host a first-round game for the third consecutive year and fourth overall, are making their sixth straight NCAA Tournament appearance and eighth overall.\n5 Duke (12-5) or unseeded Ohio State (11-6)."}
