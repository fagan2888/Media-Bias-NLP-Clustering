Ron Johnson is taking the Obama administration to court over what he calls egregious special treatment for members of Congress under Obamacare.\n\nHe hopes that a ruling in his favor, which would potentially eliminate the government\u2019s subsidy of members\u2019 and staffers\u2019 health plans, will provide a \u201clong overdue check on presidential power\u201d in light of several administrative changes that the executive branch has made to the health law since its passage.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nJohnson is funding his lawsuit through personal and campaign funds, which he says was approved by the Senate Ethics Committee.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Pol to sue OPM over Obamacare)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be able to, quite honestly, raise funds through my campaign committee,\u201d he said at a news conference in a Senate meeting room Monday, shortly after the case was filed. \u201cNow, an awful lot of members wouldn\u2019t do that. If you\u2019re running for reelection, those can be some pretty precious dollars. But I think this is such an important issue that I think I\u2019m more than willing to either fund it personally or utilize those limited campaign funds.\u201d\n\nIn suing the Office of Personnel Management, Johnson argues that its decision to allow the government to make employer contributions to lawmakers\u2019 health coverage on the insurance exchanges violates the Affordable Care Act as well as rules surrounding the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.\n\nThe health law didn\u2019t authorize the agency to offer exchange plans through the FEHBP, he contends, and the government isn\u2019t a small business so it cannot buy coverage on the D.C. SHOP exchange. Johnson also argues that the OPM policy violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution because it treats members of Congress and their staffs differently than other Americans.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Sensenbrenner hits Johnson suit)\n\n\u201cNeither the ACA nor any other applicable statute or rule permits the OPM to provide group health insurance to government employees who do not participate in the FEHBP,\u201d Johnson\u2019s lawyers wrote in the complaint.\n\nJohnson said he\u2019s trying to achieve equality between lawmakers who lose the government\u2019s employer coverage because of Obamacare and other Americans who may lose their own private employer coverage because of the law. While Obamacare doesn\u2019t require anyone besides congressional lawmakers and their staffs to cede employer coverage, Johnson predicted that many companies will take employees off their health plans when the employer mandate takes effect in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe next wave of lost policies are going to be those individuals getting their health care coverage through their employers,\u201d Johnson said. But only members of Congress and their staff will still be able to have their employer subsidize their new health coverage, he said. Such a \u201ctax-advantaged contribution\u201d is the \u201cspecial treatment. That\u2019s completely unfair. That\u2019s completely unjust.\u201d\n\nDefenders of OPM\u2019s decision argue that most large companies have a similar employer contribution to health plans and that without the contribution, quality staffers would leave Capitol Hill.\n\nJohnson\u2019s first obstacle will likely be proving that he has a right as a lawmaker to file the suit. In most cases, the courts have said that lawmakers can\u2019t sue over legislative policy issues.\n\n\u201cHe seems to be suing because of something Congress did,\u201d said Stan Brand, founder of Brand Law Group in Washington, who is not involved in the litigation. If so, the courts may say that \u201che doesn\u2019t have standing because he\u2019s basically suing his colleagues.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s remedy in such cases has traditionally directed the person to go back to Congress, Brand said. Johnson\u2019s attorney considers this situation different.\n\n\u201dWhat we think gives somebody, and Sen. Johnson and his staff members in particular, standing to raise an objection is \u2026 this is not an abstract concern. This is a provision that specifically affects how Sen. Johnson and his office get their health care,\u201d said Paul Clement, a high-profile Washington attorney who represented 26 states in litigation against the health law\u2019s individual mandate and is working on Johnson\u2019s suit. \u201cThis is a challenge to the implementation of a statute that is specifically directed to the Senate, Congress, their offices and how they get health care.\u201d\n\nJohnson said his wife tried to buy coverage through the D.C. small-business exchange but was stymied by the website and concern over security questions. He said he eventually opted to buy coverage through a private broker in Wisconsin and turned down the government\u2019s employer subsidy, which would have amounted to up to 75 percent of the insurance plan\u2019s cost.\n\nJohnson pushed back on criticisms, including some from fellow Wisconsin Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, that the lawsuit could rob staffers of deserved employer contributions and takes attention away from Obamacare\u2019s larger problems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little puzzled by his reaction,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in any way, shape or form that this is trivial, this is frivolous, this is a stunt. This is, I think, a very important constitutional question. It\u2019s an important issue that deserves a full airing, its day in court and quite honestly, a very full public discussion as well.\u201d\n\nJohnson filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin with one of his staffers, Brooke Ericson.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He wants a \u201ccheck on presidential power.\u201d", "title": "Johnson sues over Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/ron-johnson-opm-lawsuit-obamacare-101793.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/06/140106_ron_johnson_opm_js2.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Ron Johnson,Lawsuits", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He wants a \u201ccheck on presidential power.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Johnson sues over ObamacareSen.
