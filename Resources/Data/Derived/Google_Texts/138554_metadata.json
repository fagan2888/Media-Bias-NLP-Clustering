Not all of these doctors are rogues, but if this were your doctor, would the thought of \u201cconflict of interest\u201d cross your mind?\n\nNow, thanks to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a searchable database where physicians receiving payments over $10 from drug and device companies are posted.\n\nNext to someone\u2019s physical health, few things are more important than their \u201cfinancial health.\u201d That\u2019s why the Department of Labor passed its final rule last month requiring advisors to act in their clients\u2019 best interests when offering advice in retirement accounts.\n\nToday\u2019s affluent are skeptical and cynical about almost everyone, physicians and financial advisors included. Having their \u201cbest interests\u201d behind every decision, whether it\u2019s prescribing a drug or an investment, is a minimal expectation.\n\nFor the past 10 years, our affluent research has identified hidden fees as a major factor contributing to mistrust. Whenever hidden fees are uncovered, regardless of whether it was intentional, clients feel as though they\u2019re being screwed. When fees aren\u2019t transparent, the advisor-client relationship is vulnerable.\n\nThe Rainmaking Opportunity\n\nThe DOL rule will require advisors to be more transparent about their fees and may create more administrative and compliance burdens. Elite advisors, however, will recognize it as a gift.\n\nThis ruling will create a lot of dissatisfaction among affluent investors\u2014and a marketing opportunity for advisors. Affluent clients who aren\u2019t being serviced by an elite advisor will be asking themselves questions like: \u201cIs my advisor overcharging me?\u201d, \u201cAre there hidden fees in my portfolio?\u201d, \u201cAre the investments I own in my best interests or my advisor\u2019s?\u201d, \u201cDoes my advisor have the depth and breadth of knowledge to provide me with the level of advice I need?\u201d\n\nThis creates a perfect prospecting environment for elite advisors. They have both the knowledge and skill to subtly ask pointed questions, such as:\n\nHave you heard about the upcoming DOL fiduciary regulation?\n\nHas your advisor met with you about the upcoming DOL regulations regarding fiduciary?\n\nHas your advisor gone over all the fees that are most likely embedded in your portfolio?\n\nHas your advisor mentioned anything about a BICE (best interest contract exemption) form?\n\nHas your advisor reviewed your financial plan recently?\n\nIs your financial advisor a Certified Financial Planner?\n\nHave you had your financial plan reviewed by an independent CFP?\n\nAs much as this DOL fiduciary ruling is a pain, embrace the reality and it becomes a rainmaking tool.\n\nThe odds are your affluent clients have a different viewpoint about this than the financial community. Use this to your advantage, and double-down on marketing now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As much as this DOL fiduciary ruling is a pain, embrace the reality and it becomes a rainmaking tool.", "title": "The DOL\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Gift to Financial Advisors", "og": {"url": "http://wealthmanagement.com/regulation-compliance/dol-s-gift-financial-advisors", "image": "http://wealthmanagement.com/site-files/wealthmanagement.com/files/uploads/2016/05/doljpgcropdisplayjpgcropdisplay.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "As much as this DOL fiduciary ruling is a pain, embrace the reality and it becomes a rainmaking tool.", "title": "The DOL\u2019s Gift to Financial Advisors"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Rainmaker, DOL, Fiduciary Rule, Gift, Advisors, WealthManagement Magazine, Regulation & Compliance, Practice Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5850\"", "article_summary": "Is your financial advisor a Certified Financial Planner?\nToday\u2019s affluent are skeptical and cynical about almost everyone, physicians and financial advisors included.\nHaving their \u201cbest interests\u201d behind every decision, whether it\u2019s prescribing a drug or an investment, is a minimal expectation.\nThe odds are your affluent clients have a different viewpoint about this than the financial community.\nFor the past 10 years, our affluent research has identified hidden fees as a major factor contributing to mistrust."}
