6:13 PM: Eli Sanders says it looks like the main protest is over, although he notes that a few stragglers are sticking around in small groups in front of Westlake Mall.

Now, a silent protest in front of the tree. Men in black hoods shout at shoppers, "Enjoy your slave labor goods!" and "Go run up your credit cards!" Other protesters shush them.

5:17 PM:

Eli Sanders

A ring of police defending the Christmas tree. Ten feet away, circle of protesters chanting, "No justice no peace" and "Shut it down!"

5:15 PM: Eli Sanders says:

The tree lighting went on with protesters chanting from the Westlake balcony, "Black lives matter" and the announcer saying, "I'm sorry that this has happened." Some in the large crowd of tree-watchers booed the protesters. As families left Westlake Plaza after the tree lighting, a group of protesters on the Westlake Mall balcony chanted, "Anarchy! Anarchy!" Seattle police are now trying to move them off the balcony.

5:07 PM: Mayor Ed Murray just released a statement on the Black Friday protests that reads, in its entirety:

While I understand the hurt and frustration that our city has experienced in the past days, this is a city that respects the rule of law. I support the First Amendment rights of protestors, but violence against property or police officers will not be tolerated in our city.

5:03 PM: Brendan Kiley was heading downtown to cover the protests down there, but he learned the police line is still in effect. Reportedly, there are protesters in Westlake Park and in Westlake Mall at this time.

4:18 PM: Eli reports there's a "loud argument about tactics as men dressed in black, with bandanas on, start to roll out a dumpster for use in confronting police." He says "a woman of color yells at them to stop. They do, but she and her friends leave the protest saying they don't want to be blamed for this, which will reflect badly on everyone."

Eli Sanders

Here's the dumpster they were arguing over.

4:16 PM: Eli says the game of cat and mouse between police and protesters continues at Boren. He says the protesters want to get back down to Westlake by 5 pm, but he hasn't heard why that's the deadline.

4:10 PM: Meanwhile, back up at Broadway and Pike:

Brendan Kiley

"If we don't get it, shut it down: justice for Mike Brown."

Brendan Kiley



4:06 PM: "Before the current standoff," Eli writes, "protesters ran en masse from Pike to Pine on Boren to try to get back downtown that way." They "were blocked," he says.

Eli Sanders



4:03 PM: "Some sort of explosive smoke device being used now at Boren and Pine," Eli Sanders writes.

3:32 PM: Now Brendan Kiley is reporting that protesters are demonstrating at Capitol Hill businesses like the Comet, Lost Lake, and Caffe Vita. One protester said these businesses are being targeted because their owners have asked for increased police presence in the neighborhood and have specifically complained about black youth.

Brendan Kiley



"When you have more police on the streets," the demonstrator said, "you have more confrontations."

Brendan Kiley



3:20 PM: Brendan Kiley says there was a brief face-off between protesters and police at Broadway and Pine before the police retreated to their corner. Now, he says, the crowd is moving back down Pine toward downtown.

Earlier, when the protesters took over the top floor of Westlake Mall and all you could hear were chants, I noticed these two women chatting away at a table for two as if nothing was going on. "We're from Bellingham," Maddie Newman, the woman on the left, told me. "We came here to shop." When I said it was amazing that they were managing to continue their conversation, Joanna Newman, right, said: "What else can you do?" I asked what they thought about the message of the protest. "I agree with it," Joanna Newman said. "And everyone has a right to their opinion. I'm glad. It's the right thing to do—get their point across."

3:07 PM:

Brendan Kiley

Moment of silence with raised fists at Broadway and Pine.

2:47 PM: Here's what SPD is saying about the single reported arrest from the protest:

The man we arrested kicked and damaged an officer's bicycle. We will book him into King County Jail for property destruction. #brokespokes

Eli Sanders reports, "I've seen a lot of restraint by Seattle Police so far. When a bike cop accidentally fell, a couple protesters laughed an exaggerated HAHAHA. One said: 'I hope you got that Obamacare.' Bike cops ignored them."

2:28 PM: With regard to that previous SPD tweet, Eli reports that the doors at Pacific Place are not locked at the moment. He just walked out with no problem.

Eli Sanders

Protesters are going up the escalators at Westlake.

1:37 PM:

Eli Sanders

Protesters shouted "circle up!" and began blocking the intersection of 5th and Union. Blocked cars are occasionally honking and there's an Occupy-style "mic check" going on in which protesters appear to be sharing a phone number for legal assistance in case of arrest.

Eli Sanders

Now protesters are walking through traffic back down 5th toward Westlake. Lots more honking cars.

Eli Sanders

And they're going into the mall.

1:33 PM: Kelly O says the scene at Westlake Park right now is a sea of umbrellas.
