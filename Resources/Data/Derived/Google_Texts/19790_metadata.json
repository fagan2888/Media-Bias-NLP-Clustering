Avila for The Chronicle Joseph Van Horn, a Ph.D. student in political science at UCLA and a Trump supporter, wonders why his fellow scholars aren\u2019t willing to take seriously the merits of a formidable political movement. Peter Calautti finds a lot to like about Donald J. Trump. He likes that the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination is speaking to the concerns of people in working-class neighborhoods like the one where he grew up. He likes that Mr. Trump isn\u2019t afraid to talk about illegal immigration. He likes that the Republican Party, which he says has abandoned conservative principles in favor of large-scale military intervention and tax cuts for the rich, is being punished by Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendancy.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t agree with everything the billionaire says, and bristles at some of his sharply worded proposals. Maybe it\u2019s because Mr. Calautti grew up around New York City, but he\u2019s used to big personalities. He says you have to take their rhetoric with a grain of salt.\n\nAssuming he gets the chance, Peter Calautti plans to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nHis fellow Ph.D. students just can\u2019t believe it.\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole. In August, Mr. Calautti began studying at Indiana University\u2019s Bloomington campus for a Ph.D. in media studies, a field in which casual conversation about the presidential election is inevitable. But when he told the other students in his cohort that he planned to vote for Mr. Trump, they laughed. When he insisted, they didn\u2019t believe him. Even now, half a year after he began the program, Mr. Calautti says other students are only \"starting to come around to the idea\" that he\u2019s serious.\n\n\"It\u2019s an earnest disbelief,\" Mr. Calautti says, but he knows what they\u2019re thinking: \"You\u2019re too smart for that. I don\u2019t believe you.\"\n\n\u2018Out of Your Mind\u2019\n\nConventional wisdom says poorly educated voters have fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s improbable rise. \"I love the poorly educated,\" he proclaimed after winning Nevada\u2019s primary last month (though he also boasted of winning the votes of the well educated). \"The single best predictor of Trump support in the GOP primary is the absence of a college degree,\" wrote Derek Thompson in The Atlantic this month.\n\nIn academe \u2014 where professionals can have three, four, five degrees \u2014 Trump supporters may be hard to find. But they\u2019re out there.\n\nLike many people, Joseph Van Horn first treated Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as a joke. But as more-traditional candidates failed to outpace the billionaire, Mr. Van Horn, a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of California at Los Angeles, listened more closely.\n\nWhat he heard excited him \u2014 among other things, that Mr. Trump was willing to talk about narrow policy proposals rather than harp on conservative social issues. That willingness, coupled with his lack of attachment to the political establishment, made Mr. Van Horn think, \"When\u2019s the last time I heard a candidate and thought, \u2018That could really happen\u2019?\"\n\nMr. Van Horn doesn\u2019t like Donald Trump personally. And he doesn\u2019t find him all that trustworthy. \"I wouldn\u2019t give him the key to my apartment,\" he says. But he\u2019s excited about the Trump movement, particularly how it has spurred higher turnout and more engagement with the election.\n\nWhen he brings up that sense of excitement in an academic setting, however, he gets shut down, he says. \"I was kind of shocked at how staunchly anti-Trump people are,\" he says. Many of his peers are willing to issue a blanket condemnation of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as racist and nativist, Mr. Van Horn says, but \"shouting \u2018racists\u2019 and \u2018bigots\u2019 and \u2018he\u2019s Hitler\u2019 is just not productive.\"\n\n\u201cThe reaction of everyone in the audience was, you know, chuckling, the implication being that no one in this room could possibly take Trump seriously.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as if those terms are not warranted at times. Mr. Trump has been shocking and crass, suggesting, for example, that Mexican immigrants are responsible for widespread rape. \"He\u2019s certainly playing to people\u2019s prejudices,\" Mr. Van Horn says, adding that he doesn\u2019t share those prejudices. He hates the proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country (\"I think it\u2019s really shameful that we have Muslims in the armed forces that have to listen to this stuff\") but thinks such extreme proposals are unlikely to become policy.\n\nSharp rhetoric aside, he says, shouldn\u2019t a political-science department be willing to take seriously the merits of a formidable political movement? Mr. Van Horn says the popular dismissal of the Trump campaign has been disheartening and reflective of a broader bias against right-leaning ideas.\n\nLinda Grochowalski, a Trump supporter who teaches English part time at Assumption College and Quinsigamond Community College, in Worcester, Mass., encountered that bias once upon moving into a new office. A previous occupant\u2019s poster still hung on the back of the door.\n\n\"It essentially said, You have to be pretty stupid to vote for a Republican,\" she says. \"I guess the writing\u2019s on the wall, or the door.\"\n\nThat bias manifests itself in large groups, too. Mr. Calautti recalls attending a colloquium on civility in public discourse at which the speaker used as an example of uncivil discourse \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s performance in the Republican debates. \"The reaction of everyone in the audience was, you know, chuckling,\" he says, \"the implication being that no one in this room could possibly take Trump seriously.\"\n\nThat assumption, he says, may stem from the sense of status that comes from being in academe. The idea that \"if you\u2019re in this room, you\u2019re an elite \u2014 so you\u2019re not going to respond to things like trade policy and illegal immigration because these things largely don\u2019t affect you.\"\n\nGina Marcello, an assistant professor of communication at Georgian Court University, in New Jersey, says she hasn\u2019t often heard the election come up as a topic of conversation on her campus. \"If it does come up,\" she says, \"it\u2019s dismissive of Donald Trump.\" The subtext, which helps prevent her from talking politics with her colleagues, comes through loud and clear: \"You\u2019d have to be out of your mind to support a Trump candidacy.\"\n\nWhy Trump?\n\nThe academics who support Mr. Trump acknowledge that many of his ideas are dangerous. Outweighing that concern is the conviction that something has to change, and that there\u2019s no better alternative than a Trump presidency.\n\nMs. Grochowalski says eight years of the Obama administration left her with $8,000 in medical bills. The Affordable Care Act, she says, forced her and her husband off their preferred health-insurance plan. And she\u2019s been disturbed by President Obama\u2019s use of executive orders to bypass Congress.\n\nMs. Grochowalski, who worked as a marketing and communications director in the private sector, acknowledges that Mr. Trump lacks experience in public office. But she trusts that he would surround himself with smart people because of his business experience.\n\nHis lack of political experience could be an asset, Ms. Marcello says, enabling him to appoint the \"very best people\" to advise him instead of bestowing political patronage.\n\nCompounding their support for the billionaire is a lack of other options. Mr. Van Horn says he would be open to voting for a Democrat, but he thinks the proposals of the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders are unrealistic. As for Hillary Clinton, he neither likes her nor trusts her. (When confronted with the fact that he also says he neither likes nor trusts Mr. Trump, Mr. Van Horn says the former secretary of state is more likely to be beholden to a \"very narrow set of society.\")\n\nAs for those of Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas that Ms. Grochowalski calls \"pretty outrageous,\" legal and constitutional checks are there to stymie any truly devastating plans, she says. \"He probably can\u2019t do 30 percent of them, even if he wanted to.\"\n\n\u2018The Smallest Town\u2019\n\nFor Mr. Van Horn, academe\u2019s reaction to the Trump candidacy has been a particularly disappointing sign of a larger problem.\n\nThe 29-year-old grew up in Louisville, Ky., which he calls a \"small city in the South.\" He enrolled in the University of Kentucky when he was 18, but struggled and dropped out after two years.\n\nHe then became an electrician, but after a few years of doing that, he wasn\u2019t satisfied. \"You can always make a lot of money as an electrician, but learning about the world is something different,\" he says.\n\n\u201cI was this very liberal person where I was from, and then I come out here and they're all very, very liberal, and they're all very, very rigid.\u201d\n\nSo he returned to school, finishing his undergraduate education at Indiana University-Southeast. He then applied to the political-science program at UCLA. He was over the moon about getting to follow his passion for a living \u2014 and to broaden his horizons beyond what his upbringing had restricted him to.\n\nBut two and a half years into the program, he has found that some academics can be even more closed-minded than people he grew up with. \"I was this very liberal person where I was from, and then I come out here and they\u2019re all very, very liberal, and they\u2019re all very, very rigid.\"\n\nAnd in political science, where this year\u2019s election is particularly relevant, the popular treatment of the Trump candidacy as a joke has made Mr. Van Horn wonder about the costs to scholarship: \"How can you do objective scholarly research? You don\u2019t even treat American voters as people who are qualified to cast a ballot.\"\n\nMr. Van Horn still loves studying political science, and he still wants to be a professor. But he watches what he says, and he\u2019s more cynical about higher education.\n\n\"It\u2019s a very closed community,\" he says. \"It\u2019s like the smallest town in the world.\"\n\nCorrection (3/11/2016, 12:16 p.m.): This article originally stated incorrectly that Peter Calautti doesn't support Mr. Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the country.
