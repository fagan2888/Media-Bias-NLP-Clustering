Those are the years where you really set the pace and set the tone for what a child\u2019s diet will be like going forward to teens years.\u201d\n\nOne in three children and adolescents in the U.S. are either overweight or obese \u2014 which increases their risk of eventually developing Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and a host of other health problems. Holtby says previous research has shown the link between fast food consumption and obesity, so cutting down the amount of fast foods young kids eat may help curb the country\u2019s obesity epidemic.\n\n\u201cWe know that children who are overweight when they\u2019re very young can continue to be overweight,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cThat can be more difficult to reverse once you get to the pre-teen puberty years. To a set a course like that in a child\u2019s life is really doing a disservice to health effects later on.\u201d\n\nThe study shows fast food consumption is even higher for children in low-income families or communities of color. Latino children eat the most fast food \u2014 about 70 percent eat it at least once a week. In California, half of all children under the age of five are Latino.\n\nThe UCLA study also shows that Asian children are eating less fruits and vegetables than kids in other ethnic groups. Forty percent of Asian families reported their child ate at least five fruits and vegetables the previous day, compared to a 57 percent state average. Holtby says while Asian children are below the other groups, fruit and vegetable consumption needs to be bumped up for all kids.\n\n\u201cOne easy things parents and daycare providers can do is provide fruit instead of fruit juice,\u201d Holtby says. \u201cFruit juice is really high in sugars. When it\u2019s pressed to make juice a lot of the nutritional value is gone. Present the fruit in a way that kids like to eat. If you hand a kid an apple in his or her lunch tray, they might not eat it. If you slice it up they\u2019re more likely to eat it.\u201d\n\nThe study also looked at soda intake. The more fast food young kids eat, the more they\u2019re likely to drink soda. But overall, soda consumption for this age group has dropped drastically in the past few years. Holtby says the 2003 California law banning sodas in schools sent a strong public health message.\n\n\u201cTaking sodas out of schools was a huge move,\u201d she says. \u201cKids spend a lot of time in school each day and if they don\u2019t have access to soda, it\u2019s just reducing the number of hours in the day they have to drink it. We can\u2019t show causality but certainly the soda bans runs parallel to the decline in soda consumption. The recent McDonald\u2019s announcement saying that they\u2019re not going to provide soda with Happy Meals any more shows that in the fat food industry there is a shift in what consumers want. It\u2019s not a top down industry decision.\u201d\n\nHoltby says California was already looking at banning fast foods from being sold in public schools, but that was put on hold while the national set of standards were being formed.\n\n\u201cI think there are ways to tie the public dollars to policies that promote healthy policies,\u201d Holtby says. \u201c[Public] schools are a really good place to start because they are implemented in one large arena.\u201d\n\nHoltby says her research group focused between the ages of two to five because what children in this age group eat sets the stage for they\u2019ll eat when they get older.\n\n\u201cAs these kids grow older they\u2019re out of the house more and are able to get food on their own,\u201d says Holtby. \u201cParents have control over what their two to five-year-olds eat. As their kids get older, they have less control.\u201d\n\nHoltby says improving a young child\u2019s eating habits can improve a family\u2019s eating habits overall.\n\n\u201cThe longer you wait to introduce high fat, high salt, and sugary foods, the less likely they\u2019ll eat it. If that food is not in the home, you\u2019re not going to eat it either.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two-thirds of children between the ages of two to five years old eat fast-food at least once a week in California, according to a study released Monday by the", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Even California's Pre-School Age Kids Eating Fast Food Regularly\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/11\\/25\\/even-californias-pre-school-age-kids-eating-fast-food-regularly\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-25 11:47:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-11-25 16:41:15\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":16399,\"author_id\":\"46\",\"author_name\":\"Shuka Kalantari\",\"author_display_name\":\"Shuka Kalantari\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/11\\/2680040875_7ace1b2e72_b-e1385408461416.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Two-thirds of children between the ages of two to five years old eat fast-food at least once a week in California, according to a study released Monday by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\r\n\r\nThe study gathered data from the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Survey and found that 60 percent of children are eating fast food at least once a week, and one in 10 is eating three fast food meals a week.", "title": "Even California\u2019s Pre-School Age Kids Eating Fast Food Regularly", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2013/11/25/even-californias-pre-school-age-kids-eating-fast-food-regularly/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/11/2680040875_7ace1b2e72_b-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5dc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTo have that many children that young eating fast food every week calls for attention.\nLatino children eat the most fast food \u2014 about 70 percent eat it at least once a week.\nThe more fast food young kids eat, the more they\u2019re likely to drink soda.\nThe study gathered data from the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Survey and found that 60 percent of children are eating fast food at least once a week, and one in 10 is eating three fast food meals a week.\nHoltby says previous research has shown the link between fast food consumption and obesity, so cutting down the amount of fast foods young kids eat may help curb the country\u2019s obesity epidemic."}
