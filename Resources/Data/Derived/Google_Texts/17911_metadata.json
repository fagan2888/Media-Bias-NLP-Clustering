Frank made his recommendation to members of the board in a Saturday morning memorandum that also was posted on the university\u2019s website.\n\nFrank said he had concluded it might be possible for the university to stick with the full-scale project \u2014 estimated to cost $220 million \u2014 rather than scale back in a \u201cphased\u201d approach, with an estimated original price tag of $195 million.\n\nHe asked the board to allow him to \u201creturn to the Board with both a final program plan and a plan of finance in accord with State and Board policies.\u201d\n\nFrank said explorations of a public-private partnership for the project \u201cwith a variety of potential partners\u201d either didn\u2019t produce viable options or eventually evolved into plans in which ownership of the stadium remained solely in the university\u2019s hands.\n\nHe said those talks led him to conclude that aspects of that public-private partnership plans still could be implemented in \u201cversions\u201d of the university-owned model \u201cin which minimal changes from the original design can meet the fiscal standard we\u2019ve established: the lowest risk of any negative impact on the general fund.\u201d\n\nHe added that he believed a new stadium could \u201chave the likely outcome of a positive fiscal impact without any utilization of tuition, fees or state support.\u201d\n\nFrank also sent out a mass e-mail to the university community announcing his recommendation and directing recipients to the website for the full memorandum. Additional material includes a report on donor support for the various stadium options from Brett Anderson, CSU\u2019s vice president of university advancement, and interim athletic director John Morris. Anderson and Morris said none of the donors who had pledged $100,000 or more were willing to have their contributions used to support remaining at Hughes Stadium.\n\nIn late September, Frank announced in advance of the previous board meeting that the school had come up short of its announced goal of raising $110 million in seed money \u2014 or roughly half the cost \u2014 for the on-campus stadium by October 2014. He said the amount raised was roughly $50 million.\n\nFormer athletic director Jack Graham, who had a falling-out with Frank and was fired in August, maintained that the internal goal virtually from the start had been $75 million. He said he had raised about $45 million for the project and that the total would have been about $60 million by the October board of governors meeting.\n\nAt that meeting in early October, the board approved Frank\u2019s request to study, with input from several committees, four possible options for the football program\u2019s home stadium. Two were the options for remaining in Hughes Stadium. The third was to build a scaled-back or \u201cphased\u201d stadium owned by the university, hoping to add to it when feasible. Finally, the fourth was to stick with the full-scale project and build it as a public-private partnership.\n\nFrank\u2019s Saturday announcement, then, was an indication that he was hopeful the design wouldn\u2019t have to be scaled back significantly and the stadium could remain under university ownership.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU president recommends building on-campus football stadium", "title": "CSU president recommends building on-campus football stadium", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/29/csu-president-recommends-building-on-campus-football-stadium/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141129__csu-hughes-stadium-1p1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141129__csu-hughes-stadium-1p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T09:33:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:25:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5bf0\"", "article_summary": "Anderson and Morris said none of the donors who had pledged $100,000 or more were willing to have their contributions used to support remaining at Hughes Stadium.\nTwo were the options for remaining in Hughes Stadium.\nAdditional material includes a report on donor support for the various stadium options from Brett Anderson, CSU\u2019s vice president of university advancement, and interim athletic director John Morris.\nThe third was to build a scaled-back or \u201cphased\u201d stadium owned by the university, hoping to add to it when feasible.\nAfter nearly three years of studying, planning, fundraising and debating for and about a new stadium on the Colorado State campus, school president Tony Frank has reached a verdict."}
