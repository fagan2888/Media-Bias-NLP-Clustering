Authors of a new study claim that lying and the act of coming up with new ideas using your imagination have something (or a lot) in common: rule-breaking. The researchers found that lying about performance on one task may actually improve creativity on the next task by helping people feel like they can break rules.\n\n\u201cThe common saying that \u2018rules are meant to be broken\u2019 is at the root of both creative performance and dishonest behavior,\u201d lead researcher Francesca Gino of Harvard Business said in the press release. \u201cBoth creativity and dishonesty, in fact, involve rule breaking.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the researchers gave participants tests and number matrices that left them an obvious option to cheat. They were told they would be compensated based on how many number matrices they solved correctly, and were able to self-report \u2014 which gave them the possibility of inflating their own performance (lying, essentially). Meanwhile, the researchers were able to track their actual performance and compare it to what they self-reported, in order to discover whether they were lying.\n\nIn the next task, the participants were given sets of three words and told to come up with a fourth word related to each word in the set, an example of what is referred to as \u201cremote associates,\u201d a way of measuring creativity. Nearly 59 percent of the participants cheated.\n\nAccording to the study, cheating on the number matrices was associated with a boost in creative thinking on the next task \u2014 \u201ccheaters figured out more of the remote associates than those who didn\u2019t cheat,\u201d the press release states. The cheaters possessed a \u201cheightened feeling of being unconstrained by rules,\u201d the authors write.\n\n\u201cWe turned the relationship upside down, in a sense,\u201d Gino said in the press release. \u201cOur research raises the possibility that one of the reasons why dishonesty seems so widespread in today\u2019s society is that by acting dishonestly we become more creative \u2014 and this creativity may allow us to come up with original justifications for our immoral behavior and make us likely to keep crossing ethical boundaries.\u201d\n\nGino\u2019s previous work at Harvard Business School has explored the link between creativity and dishonesty. In 2011, she studied whether creativity works to increase dishonesty, rather than the other way around. Their findings showed that people who have higher creativity are more likely to cheat more and partake in unethical behavior.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "creativity and dishonesty, unethical", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Research shows that lying about performance on certain tasks actually improves a person\u2019s creativity on the next task.", "title": "Does Lying Make You More Creative?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/does-lying-make-you-more-creative-both-dishonesty-and-creativity-involve-rule-breaking-269897", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/21/creativity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research shows that lying about performance on certain tasks actually improves a person\u2019s creativity on the next task.", "title": "Does Lying Make You More Creative?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/does-lying-make-you-more-creative-both-dishonesty-and-creativity-involve-rule-breaking-269897", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/21/creativity.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/21/creativity.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-21T17:19:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-21T17:19:49-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Research shows that lying about performance on certain tasks actually improves a person\u2019s creativity on the next task."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2908\"", "article_summary": "Francesca Gino's work has focused on the link between dishonesty and creativity; she's found that dishonesty increases creative behavior, and more \"outside-the-box\" thinkers are also more likely to be unethical.\n\u201cWe turned the relationship upside down, in a sense,\u201d Gino said in the press release.\n\u201cBoth creativity and dishonesty, in fact, involve rule breaking.\u201dIn the study, the researchers gave participants tests and number matrices that left them an obvious option to cheat.\nIn 2011, she studied whether creativity works to increase dishonesty, rather than the other way around.\nAre dishonesty and creativity intertwined?"}
