We are here to heal. We are not here to be hurt.\"\n\nIn response to escalating violence on their campuses, an increasing number of hospitals have formed their own police departments, according to FierceHealthcare, eschewing standard security personnel for beefed-up corps of officers who have the power of arrest on the facilities' grounds. The move comes amid recent reports that government agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have stepped in to take hospitals to task for failing to adequately address workplace violence.\n\nWhile violence can be directed at all types of staff members and even at visitors and patients, nurses are vulnerable targets because they work so closely with patients, Kim Scott, another Florida ICU nurse told ABC News.\n\n\"[Family members] may want someone to be doing more than what they are doing,\" she said. \"They are frustrated. The nurse is the one they see first. The nurse is at the bedside.\"\n\nScott says she's been hit, pushed, had her hair pulled and had patients grab things from her, though other nurses have fared even worse: In addition to the routine verbal abuse they face, this year the media has reported multiple incidents of nurse stabbings and one nurse was attacked by a metal-bar-wielding patient.\n\nIn addition to prevention efforts taken by hospitals, states have also attempted to use policy to stem the rising tide of violence, with 30 passing laws to make it a felony to assault hospital workers, FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the ABC News report\n\n- check out the Tampa Bay Times article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAmid more violence, some hospitals form police departments\n\nViolence against hospital nurses prompts call for education, planning\n\nAre hospitals responsible for preventing workplace violence?\n\nNurses, emergency department workers often targets of violence\n\nNurse stabbings raise questions on hospital violence\n\nNurses under-report violence, saying it's a \"waste of time\"\n\nStates seek solutions to hospital violence", "article_metadata": {"description": "Members of the National Nurses United union are joining a growing number of industry voices that decry the increasing amount of violence that healthcare workers face on a daily basis,\u00a0reports\u00a0ABC\u00a0News' Tampa, Florida, affiliate.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Members of the National Nurses United union are joining a growing number of industry voices that decry the increasing amount of violence that healthcare workers face on a daily basis,\u00a0reports\u00a0ABC\u00a0News' Tampa, Florida, affiliate.", "title": "Nurses want solution to 'epidemic' of workplace violence", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nurses-want-solution-epidemic-workplace-violence/2015-01-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "abusive behavior,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,registered nurses,Workplace Violence", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "Nurses, emergency department workers often targets of violenceNurse stabbings raise questions on hospital violenceNurses under-report violence, saying it's a \"waste of time\"States seek solutions to hospital violence\nDuring a protest it organized on Tuesday in Tampa, participants called violence toward nurses \"an epidemic.\"\nTo learn more:- read the ABC News report- check out the Tampa Bay Times articleRelated Articles:Amid more violence, some hospitals form police departmentsViolence against hospital nurses prompts call for education, planningAre hospitals responsible for preventing workplace violence?\nMembers of the National Nurses United union are joining a growing number of industry voices that decry the increasing amount of violence that healthcare workers face on a daily basis, reports ABC News' Tampa, Florida, affiliate.\nBut nurses at Tuesday's rally wanted to make it clear that such conditions aren't acceptable."}
