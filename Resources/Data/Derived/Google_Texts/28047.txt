LONDON (AP) — The National Health Service (NHS) Choir has beaten Justin Bieber to capture Britain’s official Christmas No. 1 song — and he’s OK with that.

The Canadian pop star’s “Love Yourself” was ahead earlier this week — but then Bieber tweeted that he wanted fans to “do the right thing” and boost the charity single to the coveted spot.

The choir’s mash-up “A Bridge Over You” on Friday finished nearly 31,000 copies ahead of Bieber in the singles competition — although he still commands three of the top five spots.

The choir said “it’s a brilliant celebration for the NHS across the country, so well done and thank you everyone.” Proceeds will go to several health-related charities.

The NHS, founded in 1948, is a source of national pride for many Britons.
