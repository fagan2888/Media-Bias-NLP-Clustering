Kennedy, Kennedy assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, News\n\nThose resolute voices in American public life that continue to deny the existence of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy argue that \u201csomeone would have talked.\u201d This line of reasoning is often used by journalists who have made no effort themselves to closely inspect the growing body of evidence and have not undertaken any of their own investigative reporting. The argument betrays a touchingly nai\u0308ve media bias\u2014a belief that the American press establishment itself, that great slumbering watchdog, could be counted on to solve such a monumental crime, one that sprung from the very system of governance of which corporate media is an essential part. The official version of the Kennedy assassination\u2014despite its myriad improbabilities, which have only grown more inconceivable with time\u2014remains firmly embedded in the media consciousness, as unquestioned as the law of gravity.\n\nIn fact, many people have talked during the past half of a century\u2014including some directly connected to the plot against Kennedy. But the media simply refused to listen. One of the most intriguing examples of someone talking occurred in 2003, when an old and ailing Howard Hunt began unburdening himself to his eldest son, Saint John.\n\n\u201cSaint,\u201d as his father called him, was a loyal and loving son, who had suffered through the upheavals of the spy\u2019s life, along with the rest of his family. Late one night in June 1972, at the family\u2019s Witches Island home in suburban Maryland, Hunt had frantically woken up his eighteen-year-old son. \u201cI need you to do exactly as I say, and not ask any questions!\u201d said Hunt, who was in a sweaty and disheveled state that his son had never before witnessed. He ordered Saint John to fetch window cleaner, rags, and rubber gloves from the kitchen and to help him rub away fingerprints from a pile of espionage equipment, including cameras, microphones, and walkie-talkies. Later, Saint helped his father stuff the equipment into two suitcases, which they loaded into the trunk of his father\u2019s Pontiac Firebird. Hunt and his son drove through the darkness to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, where the spook got out and tossed the suitcases into the murky water. On the way back home, Hunt told Saint that he had been doing some special work for the White House, and things had gone south.\n\nIt was the beginning of the Watergate drama, in which Howard Hunt played a starring role as the leader of the \u201cWhite House plumbers,\u201d the five burglars who were arrested while breaking into the Democratic Party\u2019s national headquarters. All five of the men had a long history with Hunt, dating back to the earliest days of the underground war against Castro, and at least two\u2014Frank Sturgis and Virgilio Gonzalez\u2014were rumored to have played roles in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nAs the Watergate scandal unfolded, Hunt drew Saint and the rest of his family deeper into his disintegrating life. Saint\u2019s beloved mother, Dorothy\u2014an exotic beauty with her own espionage background\u2014would die in a plane crash in the midst of the Watergate crisis, while serving as a mysterious courier for her husband. When her United Airlines flight from Washington\u2019s Dulles Airport crashed while landing at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport in December 1972, Dorothy Hunt was carrying over $2 million in cash and money orders, some of which was later traced to President Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nAs Nixon frantically tried to cover his tracks in the widening scandal, sketchy money began flowing back and forth. The president was desperate to keep Hunt quiet and during one White House meeting, Nixon\u2014 caught on his secret taping system\u2014figured it would cost \u201ca million in cash. We could get our hands on that kind of money.\u201d Hunt felt that Nixon owed him and his team. \u201cI had five men whose families needed to be supported,\u201d Hunt later said. \u201cAnd I had a big house, stalls for six horses, kids in private school\u2014I had needs for contributions that were greater than the average person\u2019s. . . . There\u2019s a long tradition that when a warrior is captured, the commanding officer takes care of his family.\u201d\n\nNixon knew that Howard Hunt had played key roles in some of America\u2019s darkest mysteries. On June 23, 1972\u2014while discussing the Watergate break-in with H. R. Haldeman, his devoted political deputy and White House chief of staff\u2014Nixon was taped saying, \u201cHunt . . . will uncover a lot of things. You open that scab, there\u2019s a hell of a lot of things. . . . This involves these Cubans, Hunt and a lot of hanky-panky that we have nothing to do with ourselves.\u201d\n\nNixon wanted Haldeman to lean on Dick Helms, who was then CIA director, by warning him that if the spy agency did not help shut down the growing Watergate scandal, \u201c[t]he President\u2019s belief is that this is going to open up that whole Bay of Pigs thing . . . and it\u2019s going to make the CIA look bad, it\u2019s going to make Hunt look bad, and is likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing . . . and we think it would be very unfortunate for the CIA and for the country at this time.\u201d\n\nNixon\u2019s ploy did not work. When Haldeman sat Helms down in his office and delivered the president\u2019s thinly veiled threat about \u201cthe Bay of Pigs thing,\u201d the normally icy-cool Helms exploded. \u201cThe Bay of Pigs had nothing to do with this!\u201d he shouted. Nixon only succeeded in further antagonizing a very powerful Washington institution, one capable of far more deviousness than even he was.\n\nWhat did Nixon mean by \u201cthe whole Bay of Pigs thing\u201d? According to Haldeman, it was Nixon\u2019s way of referring to the unspeakable\u2014the Kennedy assassination. Other historians have speculated that it was shorthand for the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro. In any case, \u201cthe Bay of Pigs thing\u201d was an apt code name\u2014it conjured all the swampy intrigue that began leaching through the Kennedy administration after Allen Dulles and his agency suffered their humiliation in Cuba, everything the CIA wanted to keep deeply hidden. And Howard Hunt was knee-deep in much of this muck.\n\nHunt\u2019s adventures in the spy trade eventually tore apart his family and sent him to federal prison for nearly three years. By 2003, the retired spy was living in a modest ranch house in north Miami with his second wife, Laura, who was twenty-seven years younger. She had fallen for him while watching him give a prison interview on Watergate. \u201cI liked all those men\u2014that must seem strange to you,\u201d Laura Hunt told a Miami Herald reporter. \u201cNot for what he\u2019d done\u2014I don\u2019t admire that\u2014but I admired him for serving the government, and I admired his intellect.\u201d\n\nAt eighty-four, Hunt seemed to be fading out, suffering from a variety of maladies, including hardening of the arteries, which had resulted in the amputation of his left leg and confined him to a wheelchair. He had a new family, including the two children he had with Laura. But Saint John Hunt felt it was time for his father to finally come clean for the sake of his first family. Following years of estrangement, Saint began to spend time with his father, watching his favorite Fox News shows with him at his Miami house and, when the old man felt up to it, dredging up the past. Laura did not want Saint John to reopen this history, but he felt strongly that his father owed him this honesty.\n\nAfter his family fell apart, Saint John had gone on the road as a rock musician and drug peddler, a trip that eventually deposited him in the coastal redwoods of northern California. But by the time he reunited with his father, Saint was a sober, middle-aged, law-abiding citizen who was eager to make sense of his earlier life. He was particularly interested in talking with his father about the Kennedy assassination\u2014which he knew his father had long been linked to in conspiracy literature.\n\nSaint\u2019s father had always insisted that he had nothing to do with Kennedy\u2019s death, that he was at home in Washington the day of the assassination, not in Dallas, as many JFK researchers alleged. Hunt claimed that he was shopping for ingredients at a Chinese grocery store in Washington, to cook dinner that night with his wife, when the news bulletin about Kennedy came over the car radio. But Saint, who was in the fifth grade at the time, had no memory of his father being home that day when he was let out early from school, or later that evening. And he found his father\u2019s cover story about cooking the Chinese meal, which Hunt told under oath at a trial related to the Kennedy assassination, absurd. \u201cI can tell you that\u2019s the biggest load of crap in the world,\u201d Saint John told Rolling Stone in 2007. \u201cMy dad in the kitchen? Chopping vegetables with his wife? I\u2019m so sorry, but that would never happen. Ever.\u201d\n\nHis mother told Saint John, around the time of the assassination, that his father had indeed been in Dallas. The mystery of his father\u2019s whereabouts that day would prey on Saint for years. He was determined to engage his father on the subject before it was too late.\n\nBy 2003, Howard Hunt was ready to finally talk. He feared that his life was coming to an end, and he was deeply regretful that he had so little to leave his family after all they had endured. For a time, he flirted with the idea of telling all to actor Kevin Costner, who had starred in Oliver Stone\u2019s film JFK. Costner dangled a big financial reward in front of Hunt if he revealed everything he knew about Dallas, but when the money never appeared, Hunt finally dismissed the actor as a \u201cnumbskull.\u201d Saint John nonetheless urged his father to continue down the path of full disclosure while he was still of sound mind. He made his plea in a long letter to his father, telling him that it was time to finally reveal what he knew\u2014he \u201cowed it,\u201d wrote Saint, \u201cto himself, the Nation, and his family to leave a legacy of truth instead of doubt.\u201d\n\nSoon afterward, Hunt phoned his son in California and summoned him to Miami. On December 7, 2003, Saint John Hunt flew to Florida\u2014where so much of his father\u2019s secret life had unfolded\u2014to hear his final testament.\n\n*\n\nWhen he arrived at his father\u2019s house, at the end of a cul-de-sac in the Biscayne Bay neighborhood, Saint found Hunt in bed, looking frail and washed out. But the old man perked up when he saw his son. He asked Saint to wheel him into the TV room, where they shared some soup for lunch and watched an agitated round of Fox News at the high volume required by the hard-of-hearing Hunt. Finally, Saint broached the subject that he had come to discuss. \u201cPapa, can we talk about my letter?\u201d\n\nHunt suggested that Saint wheel him back to his bedroom, in case his wife returned. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her getting upset by this,\u201d Hunt told his son. \u201cShe believes what I told her: that I don\u2019t know anything about JFK\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Laura\u2019s very nai\u0308ve about the darker side of politics,\u201d said Saint John.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s one of the reasons I love her so much,\u201d his father replied.\n\nThen, after making Saint John promise he would never reveal what he was about to tell him without his permission, Hunt launched into a remarkable story of the plot to kill John F. Kennedy. It was\u2014even at this late date in Hunt\u2019s life\u2014still a carefully parsed tale. He clearly was not telling everything he knew\u2014and he seemed to be downplaying his own role in the crime as well as the complicity of former CIA superiors to whom he remained loyal. He also couched much of his narrative in an oddly speculative manner, as if he were not fully certain of the exact configuration of the plot. Nonetheless, what Hunt did tell Saint John that day was stunning enough. Over the following months, the spy elaborated on his story as his health occasionally improved. At one point, Saint brought in an expert on the Kennedy assassination and Watergate\u2014Eric Hamburg, a Los Angeles writer-producer and a former aide to Senator John Kerry\u2014to help videotape interviews with his father.\n\nLaura Hunt ultimately cut short her husband\u2019s extraordinary journey of truth telling with his son. But before Hunt died in 2007, he left behind video interviews, audiotapes, and notes in his own hand\u2014as well as a somewhat revealing memoir called American Spy. Hunt\u2019s confessional trove amounts to a tortured effort to reveal what he knew, while still guarding his family\u2019s sensitivities, old professional loyalties, and whatever was left of his good name. After his father died, Saint John would make a valiant effort to get Hunt\u2019s confessions\u2014which should have been headline news\u2014into the hands of the major media gatekeepers. A 60 Minutes producer spent days poring over Saint John\u2019s rich material, but he was finally forced to apologize that the story had been spiked from above. In the end, only Rolling Stone\u2014along with a scattering of alternative media outlets\u2014covered the story of Howard Hunt\u2019s astonishing final statements about the crime of the century. Saint John\u2019s own memoir of his father\u2019s escapades and his family\u2019s ordeal, Bond of Secrecy, was released by a small Oregon publisher and received little promotion or attention.\n\nThis was the story that Howard Hunt left behind. Sometime in 1963, Hunt said, he was invited to a meeting at one of the CIA safe houses in Miami by Frank Sturgis, a soldier of fortune who had worked under Hunt in the anti-Castro underground\u2014a man with whom Hunt would be forever linked when they were later arrested for the Watergate break-in. Also in attendance at the Miami meeting was David Morales, another CIA veteran of the anti-Castro campaign who was well known to Hunt. Morales\u2014a big, intimidating man who had grown up in a poor Mexican American family in Phoenix\u2014did not fit the polished CIA profile. But the agency found a use for \u201cEl Indio\u201d\u2014as Morales, with his strong indigenous features, was known by his colleagues.\n\n\u201cDave Morales did dirty work for the agency,\u201d according to Wayne Smith, a diplomat who worked alongside Morales in the U.S. embassy in Havana before Castro took power. \u201cIf he were in the mob, he\u2019d be called a hit man.\u201d\n\nThomas Clines, a colleague of Morales\u2019s in the CIA\u2019s Miami station, was more complimentary in his description, but it amounted to the same thing: \u201cWe all admired the hell out of the guy. He drank like crazy, but he was bright as hell. He could fool people into thinking he was stupid by acting stupid, but he knew about cultural things all over the world. People were afraid of him. He was big and aggressive, and he had this mystique. Stories about him permeated the agency. If the agency needed someone action-oriented, he was at the top of the list. If the U.S. government as a matter of policy needed someone or something neutralized, Dave would do it, including things that were repugnant to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nRuben Carbajal, Morales\u2019s lifelong friend from their boyhood days on the streets of Phoenix, was even more blunt about \u201cDidi\u201d\u2014the man who was like a brother to him: \u201cWhen some asshole needed to be killed, Didi was the man to do it. . . . That was his job.\u201d\n\nAccording to Morales\u2019s daughter, he was the CIA\u2019s \u201cpeon.\u201d Her father was utterly devoted to the agency. \u201cHe did whatever he was told. They gave him a lifestyle that he would never have had under any circumstances. . . . He did everything for the Company. His family wasn\u2019t his life\u2014the Company was his life.\u201d\n\nAt the secret Miami meeting, Morales told Hunt that he had been recruited for an \u201coff-the-board\u201d operation by Bill Harvey, with whom El Indio had worked closely on the ZR/Rifle project to kill Castro. The aim of this \u201coff-the-board\u201d operation, it soon became clear, was to assassinate President Kennedy. Morales and Sturgis referred to the president\u2019s planned demise as \u201cthe big event.\u201d\n\nIn his account of the meeting, Hunt presented Harvey and Morales as the key operational figures in the plot; Harvey did not attend the meeting but seemed to loom over it. Hunt suggested that Harvey was in charge of hiring the sharpshooters to kill Kennedy and transporting the weapons to Dallas. According to Hunt, the gunmen were likely recruited from the Corsican underworld. As Harvey once indicated, when it came to highly delicate assignments, working with Corsican gangsters was preferable because they were harder to trace back to the CIA than Italian or American Mafia hit men.\n\nHunt found Harvey and Morales to be disturbing characters. The two men \u201ccould have been manufactured from the same cloth,\u201d Hunt wrote in his memoir. \u201cBoth were hard-drinking, tough guys, possibly completely amoral. Morales was rumored to be a cold-blooded killer, the go-to guy in black ops situations where the government needed to have someone neutralized. I tried to cut short any contact with him, as he wore thin very quickly.\u201d\n\nTo Morales, Kennedy was \u201cthat no good son of a bitch motherfucker\u201d who was responsible for the deaths of the men he had trained for the Bay of Pigs mission. \u201cWe took care of that son of a bitch, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Morales told his attorney, Robert Walton, in 1973, after an evening of drinking loosened the CIA hit man\u2019s tongue. It was one more confession that the media ignored, even after it was reported by one of their own, Gaeton Fonzi, a Philadelphia investigative journalist who, after going to work for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, unearthed some of the most important information related to the Kennedy case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The official narrative only gets more implausible, especially when you hear the stories of these secret super-spies", "title": "Inside the plot to kill JFK: The secret story of the CIA and what really happened in Dallas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The official narrative only gets more implausible, especially when you hear the stories of these secret super-spies", "title": "Inside the plot to kill JFK: The secret story of the CIA and what really happened in Dallas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/inside_the_plot_to_kill_jfk_the_secret_story_of_the_cia_and_what_really_happened_in_dallas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/jfk_motorcade2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The official narrative only gets more implausible, especially when you hear the stories of these secret super-spies", "title": "Inside the plot to kill JFK: The secret story of the CIA and what really happened in Dallas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/jfk_motorcade2.jpg", "creator": "@davidtalbot", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Talbot", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Books, CIA, Editor's Picks, Howard Hunt, John F.
