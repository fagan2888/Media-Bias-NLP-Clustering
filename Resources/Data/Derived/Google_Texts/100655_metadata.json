About 346,000 enrolled in 2016 coverage in the Houston area.\n\nThe state continues to lead the nation in the number of uninsured so any gains in reaching first-timers among the uninsured is seen as good news by advocates of the health care law.\n\nThe HHS report showed that 626,000 Texans enrollees in the federally mandated exchange for 2016 were new.\n\nNationally, about 12.7 million people enrolled in insurance plans through the federal marketplace or state exchanges. Of those, 4.9 million or roughly 40 percent were new customers, the report said.\n\nOver time the overall number of enrolled can drop through attrition, either because people find jobs offering health coverage, do not pay for premiums, or are found to be ineligible under the rules of the law. HHS officials have said the goal is to still have about 10 million enrolled by year's end.\n\nSince passage of the ACA, an estimated 20 million people nationwide have gained health insurance, according to HHS.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "HHS officials have said the goal is to still have about 10 million enrolled by year's end.
