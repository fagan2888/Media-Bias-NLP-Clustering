In addition, none of these \u201cincreases\u201d took effect on Jan. 1, 2015, (or on Jan. 1, 2014, as last year\u2019s viral emails purports), and not one \u2014 except for a new addition in this year\u2019s viral email \u2014 had anything to do with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt\u2019s also inaccurate that no Republicans voted in favor of the taxes. In fact, the tax increases listed in the original email were part of the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d package that passed Congress with bipartisan support, according to FactCheck.org and numerous media outlets.\n\nAgain, the recent email with the effective date of Jan. 1, 2015, has the exact same \u201ctax increases\u201d as last year\u2019s Jan. 1, 2014, email \u2014 except for one addition.\n\nHere\u2019s what the email states (with the facts according to FactCheck.org):\n\n\u25a0 Top income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% (it happened more than 2 years ago for singles making more than $400,000 a year or couples making more than $450,000).\n\n\u25a0 Top income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% (FactCheck.org figured this as the combination of federal income tax and the Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, which has never been 52.2%).\n\n\u25a0 Capital gains tax went from 15% to 28% (actually, it went to 20%).\n\n\u25a0 Dividend tax went from 15% to 39.6% (it went to 20% in 2013 with the same incomes as the tax bracket).\n\n\u25a0 Estate tax went from 0% to 55% (the rate is indexed for inflation each year and is still 0% for incomes under $5.43 million per individuall in 2015)\n\nThe one new claim says, \u201cTop Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare tax increase was part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the only tax listed in the email that was \u2014 but it took effect in January 2013, not this year, as FactCheck.org notes.
