AMSTERDAM (AP) — Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paid a visit to the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam Sunday, a diplomatic move ahead of a meeting with the leaders of the U.S. and South Korea to discuss North Korea.

Abe said it was “regrettable, quite regrettable” that 300 copies of Anne Frank’s diary were vandalized recently in Tokyo libraries. A suspect has been arrested and confessed.

“The suspect is currently under custody, and authorities are looking at his motivation, although we are not quite sure what his real motivation was,” he said in a press conference at the museum.

In the run-up to the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, Abe has sought to undo fallout from his December visit to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors all Japanese military casualties — including war criminals. The move angered China and South Korea and revived concerns about Abe’s nationalist and revisionist tendencies.
