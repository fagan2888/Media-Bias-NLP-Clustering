Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, Bernie Sanders is an extremely interesting phenomenon. He\u2019s a decent, honest person. That\u2019s pretty unusual in the political system. Maybe there are two of them in the world, you know. But he\u2019s considered radical and extremist, which is a pretty interesting characterization, because he\u2019s basically a mainstream New Deal Democrat. His positions would not have surprised President Eisenhower, who said, in fact, that anyone who does not accept New Deal programs doesn\u2019t belong in the American political system. That\u2019s now considered very radical.\n\nThe other interesting aspect of Sanders\u2019s positions is that they\u2019re quite strongly supported by the general public, and have been for a long time. That\u2019s true on taxes. It\u2019s true on healthcare. So, take, say, healthcare. His proposal for a national healthcare system, meaning the kind of system that just about every other developed country has, at half the per capita cost of the United States and comparable or better outcomes, that\u2019s considered very radical. But it\u2019s been the position of the majority of the American population for a long time. So, you go back, say, to the Reagan\u2014right now, for example, latest polls, about 60 percent of the population favor it. When Obama put through the Affordable Care Act, there was, you recall, a public option. But that was dropped. It was dropped even though it was supported by about almost two-thirds of the population. You go back earlier, say, to the Reagan years, about 70 percent of the population thought that national healthcare should be in the Constitution, because it\u2019s such an obvious right. And, in fact, about 40 percent of the population thought it was in the Constitution, again, because it\u2019s such an obvious right. The same is true on tax policy and others.\n\nSo we have this phenomenon where someone is taking positions that would have been considered pretty mainstream during the Eisenhower years, that are supported by a large part, often a considerable majority, of the population, but he\u2019s dismissed as radical and extremist. That\u2019s an indication of how the spectrum has shifted to the right during the neoliberal period, so far to the right that the contemporary Democrats are pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans. And the Republicans are just off the spectrum. They\u2019re not a legitimate parliamentary party anymore. And Sanders has\u2014the significant part of\u2014he has pressed the mainstream Democrats a little bit towards the progressive side. You see that in Clinton\u2019s statements. But he has mobilized a large number of young people, these young people who are saying, \"Look, we\u2019re not going to consent anymore.\" And if that turns into a continuing, organized, mobilized\u2014mobilized force, that could change the country\u2014maybe not for this election, but in the longer term.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Democracy Now!", "description": "During an event Tuesday night, Noam Chomsky was asked about Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and said he considered him more of a \"New Deal Democrat\" than a radical extremist, as some have portrayed him.", "title": "Noam Chomsky: Bernie Sanders is Not a Radical, He Has Mass Support for Positions on Healthcare & Taxes", "url": "http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/27/noam_chomsky_bernie_sanders_is_not", "image": "https://www.democracynow.org/images/blog_posts/77/30877/full_hd/wx2016-0427_Chomsky-Sanders2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "twitter": {"site": "@democracynow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "csrf-token": "dqyN8QAi09wRkn+2eWpoWLIuUZp6ophrQRKX2OSPPLLV3APE/O3A/9Dko9fLXME042MITGBZmuNUUDugHlBuyQ=="}, "article_summary": "But he\u2019s considered radical and extremist, which is a pretty interesting characterization, because he\u2019s basically a mainstream New Deal Democrat.\nChomsky said Sanders\u2019 positions on taxes and healthcare are supported by a majority of the American public, and have been for a long time.\nThat\u2019s now considered very radical.\nAnd Sanders has\u2014the significant part of\u2014he has pressed the mainstream Democrats a little bit towards the progressive side.\nHe discusses his role in the country\u2019s financial crisis in his new book, \"And the Weak Suffer What They Must?"}
