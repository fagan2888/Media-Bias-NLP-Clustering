ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) – Another Arizona behavioral health company brought in to replace New Mexico nonprofits accused of Medicaid overbilling and fraud has announced it will stop providing services in New Mexico at the end of June.

Agave Health Inc. runs treatment programs in Bernalillo, Santa Fe and about 10 other counties. The company cited ongoing financial hardships along with Medicaid rate reductions as reasons for its decision.

Agave said in a statement issued Friday that it regrets having to take such as drastic measure.

The move means three of the five Arizona providers brought in by Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration in 2013 to replace the New Mexico nonprofits have pulled up stakes in the state.

The state Human Services Department says it’s working to ensure there are no gaps in coverage.
