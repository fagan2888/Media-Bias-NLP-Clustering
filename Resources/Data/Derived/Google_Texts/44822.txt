Fire developed at a west Wichita mobile home park early Friday. Authorities say it's under investigation.

Crews were called to 550 North Kessler around 2:00 a.m. One mobile home received extensive damage. It was occupied, but no one was hurt.

A KAKE videographer saw a man being taken from the scene in a police car. But fire Captain Doug Winter told reporters no one was arrested.

The fire's cause has not been disclosed.
