The depiction of Cruz’s daughters raised the ongoing, thorny issue of when and how (if ever) it is appropriate to make a politician’s family—particularly young children—a part of the story. All politicians to some extent use Christmas card-like caricatures of their families as political props, but whether that makes them open to scrutiny as public figures has always been open to different interpretations. Telnaes, for her part, thinks the ad makes Cruz’s children open to media coverage and Tweeted as much on Tuesday saying: “Ted Cruz has put his children in a political ad- don't start screaming when editorial cartoonists draw them as well.” Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, however, disagreed:
