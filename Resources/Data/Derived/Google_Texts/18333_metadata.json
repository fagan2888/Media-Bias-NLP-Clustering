This resolute confidence about winning elections does not come from a history of winning elections. He has never won one.\n\nTrump has also changed his party affiliation at least four times in the last 16 years \u2014 an average of once for each presidential election.\n\nIn 1999, as he geared up for a previous, failed presidential quest, Trump quit the Republican Party to join New York\u2019s version of the Reform Party. \u201cI am convinced the major parties have lost their way,\u201d he said. \u201cI really believe the Republicans are just too crazy right,\u201d he also explained.\n\nIn 2001, Trump then publicly switched his allegiance to the Democratic Party and apparently remained a committed Democrat for six years.\n\nIn 2007, he quit the Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m very much independent,\u201d Trump told Wolf Blitzer. \u201cI really am much more attuned to the people, as opposed to the party.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, in 2009, the real estate executive decided he\u2019d had his fill with independence. He registered as a Republican, at least in name.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump clarified his desire to run for president as a Republican as long as he is \u201ctreated fairly\u201d and wins the GOP nomination. He also said he had been \u201cpart of the establishment\u201d until an abrupt departure in June 2015.\n\n\u201cI want to run as a Republican,\u201d he said in an Aug. 11 press conference. \u201cIf I win the Republican nomination, I guarantee you all sitting there, I will not run a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nIn addition to perpetual party-switching, the 69-year-old tycoon has established a sustained record of habitually inconsistent political positions that clash dramatically with the current tide of American conservatism.\n\nAn in-depth study of Trump\u2019s declared views on issues ranging from immigration to abortion to taxes to socialized health care shows that, in many ways, he would find a cozy home in progressive circles. (RELATED: From Immigration To Abortion, Longtime Democrat Donald Trump Must Reckon With His Rich Progressive History)\n\nIn the second of two installments, The Daily Caller focuses here on Trump\u2019s enthusiastic support for single-payer health care, high taxes and an array of Democrats.\n\nTrump\u2019s love for single-payer health care and Obamacare\n\nTrump has been a longtime proponent of single-payer health care funded by federal largesse. He has also heartily endorsed Obama\u2019s signature Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump urged Americans \u201cto reexamine the single-payer plan\u201d and hoped \u201cto improve on the prototype\u201d of national health care implemented in Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cWe must have universal healthcare,\u201d Trump flatly pronounced in the book (currently available used for $3.94 at Amazon).\n\nIn 1999, Trump said he was growing more liberal on the subject of health care. \u201cI\u2019m quite liberal and getting much more liberal on health care and other things,\u201d he told Larry King at the time. \u201cI really say: What\u2019s the purpose of a country if you\u2019re not going to have defensive and health care?\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Trump called national health care \u201can entitlement to this country if we\u2019re going to have a great country.\u201d\n\nIn this prior incarnations as a politician, Trump urged a health care plan that was remarkably similar to the individual mandate Obama eventually formulated. Specifically, Trump proposed taxpayer-subsidized \u201chealth marts\u201d which would establish competing plans for a federally-created, centralized marketplace.\n\nIn June 2009, nine months before Obamacare became law, Trump called an early version of the law \u201cnoble.\u201d but expressed concern about its costs.\n\n\u201cWe are really a debtor nation right now, and I just don\u2019t know how a country in this kind of trouble can afford it,\u201d the four-time bankrupt property tycoon told Greta Van Susteren on Fox News. \u201cI love the idea, but can this country afford it?\u201d\n\nTrump is also no fan of a flat tax. In \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d he rejected the concept, calling it unfair to the working poor. \u201cOnly the wealthy would reap a windfall\u201d from a flat taxation scheme, he said, and a flat tax would not \u201craise enough revenue to keep the government operating.\u201d Progressive taxation \u201cputs the burden on those who can best afford it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s persistent praise for progressive Democrats, especially Hillary Clinton\n\nPerhaps the strongest evidence that Trump is manifestly not a conservative \u2014 and not even a Republican \u2014 is his dependable history of condemning Republicans and praising Democrats.\n\nIn 2004, Trump claimed he identified \u201cmore as a Democrat\u201d because \u201cthe economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\u201d (RELATED: Obama Economy Flatlines)\n\n\u201cIn many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat,\u201d the candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination said on CNN 11 years ago. \u201cIf you go back, it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Trump enthusiastically endorsed then-newly-minted President Obama.\n\n\u201cWe have a young, vibrant, smart president who, I think, is going to do a really good job,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cAnd, honestly, he has to do a really good job or this country maybe will never be the same. We had eight years of a horrendous president, a terrible president. You cannot get worse than Bush. And I really believe that Obama will be a great president.\u201d (RELATED: Remember When Obama Was The Messiah?)\n\nTrump despises Bush.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it, he cannot do worse than Bush,\u201d Trump said of Obama on Fox in 2008.\n\nIn 2007, the billionaire real estate developer appeared on CNN to blast George W. Bush as \u201cpossibly the worst in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Trump excoriated then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as \u201cvery sad\u201d and called Hugo Chavez, then president of Venezuela, \u201ca lot smarter than\u201d Bush. \u201cChavez is obviously very cunning,\u201d Trump explained. \u201cI mean, beating our president at every step of the game.\u201d (RELATED: Venezuela, Chicago Public Schools Face Toilet Paper Shortages)\n\nIn 2008, Trump expressed surprise that then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not attempt to impeach Bush over the 2003 invasion of Iraq. \u201cIt just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing,\u201d Trump said on CNN.\n\nIn the same interview, Trump praised Saddam Hussein because \u201che killed terrorists.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s hatred for Bush is perhaps only rivaled by his love for Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. Trump \u2014 along with his wife and children \u2014 have contributed more than $116,000 to the Clintons.\n\nTrump has given between $100,001 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The first of his two wives has contributed between $5,001 and $10,000 to the charity.\n\nAt least $11,500 of Trump\u2019s cash has gone to fund Hillary Clinton\u2019s various campaigns for political office.\n\nIn 1999, Trump zealously praised Hillary Clinton as \u201ca wonderful woman\u201d in a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer. \u201cShe\u2019s really a very terrific woman,\u201d he gushed. \u201cI know her. She stays in Trump Tower when she\u2019s in New York.\u201d\n\nIn early 2007, during Hillary\u2019s first, failed presidential run, Trump predicted that she would be the Democratic nominee. \u201cI think she\u2019s a very, very brilliant person, and as a senator in New York, she has done a great job. Everybody loves her.\u201d\n\nIn a September 2008 with Larry King, Trump complained that Obama should have picked Clinton as his vice presidential running mate instead of Joe Biden. \u201cI mean, you know, I don\u2019t understand why Hillary wasn\u2019t chosen because she was really winning,\u201d a puzzled Trump said. \u201cThe fact is that Obama went limping across the finish line. He should have chosen Hillary, it would have been a much different race, I believe. Right now, it looks to me like McCain is probably winning.\u201d\n\nThree months later, Trump applauded Obama\u2019s selection of Clinton as his secretary of state nominee. \u201cI think Hillary is a great appointment,\u201d he said. (RELATED: FBI Investigates Hillary Clinton\u2019s Private Email Server Setup At State Department)\n\nHillary Clinton was an honored, front-row guest at Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding when he married his second wife. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the reception (at the ritzy Mar-a-Lago Club).\n\nTrump\u2019s praise for Democrats extends well beyond the Clintons.\n\nIn October 2008, he called Pelosi \u201ca very impressive person.\u201d\n\nIn a CNN appearance in 1999, he called Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel \u201ca terrific guy\u201d who would make an ideal cabinet secretary, perhaps as secretary of state.\n\nIn 2010, a special eight-member panel of the House ethics committee found Rangel guilty on 11 ethics charges.\n\nIn December 2008, Trump called secret-emailing former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson \u201can amazing appointment\u201d by Obama. \u201cI know Lisa Jackson very well because I do a lot of business in New Jersey,\u201d Trump said on CNN.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan for astronomical progressive taxation\n\nIn 1999, the Reform Party version of Trump proposed a colossal 14.25 percent \u201cnet worth tax\u201d that would have raised taxes by $5.7 trillion. The one-time tax would have soaked all American individuals and U.S.-based trusts valued at $10 million or more.\n\nTrump believed the tax \u2014 the cornerstone of his economic plan at the time \u2014 would immediately eliminate the national debt. He also aimed to cut taxes on middle-class people and fund Social Security.\n\nMany economists criticized the highly progressive tax plan at the time, pointing out that a tax on investors and wealth creators would likely crater the American economy. \u201cEven talking about it would risk capital flight out of the country,\u201d economist Andrew Hodge told the Associated Press. \u201cIt is pretty confiscatory in terms of property rights.\u201d\n\nMark Zandi, currently Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist, observed that Trump\u2019s calculations were wrong. The entire net worth of all American households in 1999 was $38.4 trillion, Zandi said. Thus, Trump would need a one-time tax at 14.25 percent of every American man, woman and child and, even then, he couldn\u2019t have reached his target of $5.7 trillion.\n\nTrump insisted that his math was accurate. \u201cThe plan I am proposing today does not involve smoke and mirrors, phony numbers, financial gimmicks or the usual economic chicanery you usually find in Disneyland-on-the-Potomac,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also asserted that his massive tax on wealth would lead to more economic activity and more investment in new businesses.\n\nDoes Trump still favor his massive, punitive tax scheme on wealth? He won\u2019t say. On one hand, as Trump began to flirt with running for president as a Republican in 2011, he began to distance himself from his proposal. He has certainly not made it a cornerstone of his current presidential campaign.\n\nOn the other hand, in an August 2015 interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Trump seemed to suggest he currently has no philosophical problem with the wealth tax. He claimed the enormous was \u201ca very conservative thing.\u201d (RELATED: Trump On A Wealth Tax: \u2018I Think That\u2019s A Very Conservative Thing\u2019)\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter.
