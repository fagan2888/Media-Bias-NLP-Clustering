Both companies are facing suits from drivers who want to be classified as employees, rather than independent contractors.\n\nThe outcome of both lawsuits would only affect California drivers, but the results would set a precedent. In the so-called sharing economy, independent workers leverage their independent contractor status, often declared on 1099 forms with the IRS. After the Great Recession, more Americans have filled the vacuum of full-time work and benefits with a patchwork of part-time gigs and projects that increasingly are accessed online and through convenient mobile apps.\n\nAmid this backdrop, the issue of employee status and benefits has escalated as start-ups in this space are valued at millions or more amid a tech sector surge.\n\n\"For start-ups, it could make the relationship with workers a lot more expensive,\" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \"It might very well make the expansion of such businesses less attractive, financially.\"\n\n\n\nFreelancers broadly are no longer a fringe sector of the U.S. worker economy. More than 53 million Americans are freelancing\u201434 percent of the entire workforce. That's according to a September 2014 study by advocacy group the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk. The groups connect freelancers with jobs and related resources.\n\nRead MoreLawsuits facing Uber, Lyft could alter sharing economy\n\nBeyond full-employee status, the plaintiffs are seeking reimbursement for expenses including gasoline and car maintenance costs, which they would normally receive if they had employee standing in California.
