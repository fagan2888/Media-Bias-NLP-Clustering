(My friend and frequent sparring partner Simon Lazarus of the Constitutional Accountability Center also testified, on the other side, offering a valiant if ultimately insufficient defense.)\n\nGiven the state of current affairs, the hearing focused on Obamacare, whose problematic rollout should have come as no surprise to those who follow this blog. Quite apart from the healthcare.gov fiasco \u2013 incompetent, sure, but it\u2019s not unconstitutional to have a bad website \u2013 you simply cannot require expansive health \u201cinsurance\u201d for all without regard to preexisting conditions and expect insurers not to cancel nonconforming policies or increase premiums. (Forget never running a business or caring about the Constitution; has nobody in the White House ever taken an economics class?)\n\nAfter watching snippets of the hearing and reading the written testimony, I thought maybe I should start my \u201ctop 10 constitutional violations\u201d update with the Affordable Care Act alone. But it seems that I\u2019m not the only one thinking along these lines. Hot off the presses, at 10am today, the office of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) released its second report on \u201cThe Obama Administration\u2019s Attempts to Expand Federal Power\u201d \u2013 the first was on the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous rejection of the Justice Department\u2019s more outlandish positions, a trend I\u2019ve written about as well \u2013 titled \u201cThe Administration\u2019s Lawless Acts on Obamacare and Continued Court Challenges to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHere are the seven items the new Cruz report highlights:\n\nCategory One: Implementation Contrary to Statutory Text\n\nUnilateral grant of a one-year delay on all Obamacare health insurance requirements. Unilateral delay of the employer mandate. Unilateral delay of out-pocket caps. Allowing congressional staff to continue on government-subsidized health care.\n\nCategory Two : Pending Court Challenges\n\nViolates the Origination Clause because it\u2019s a revenue-raising bill that originated in the Senate. Contraception/abortifacient mandate violates religious liberties. Expansion of employer mandate\u2019s penalty through IRS regulation.\n\nAdd to those the individual mandate (which the Supreme Court struck down before Chief Justice Roberts rewrote and upheld the provision as a tax), the coerced expansion of Medicaid (which the Court made voluntary), and the Independent Payment Advisory Board (litigation ongoing), and you\u2019ve got an even ten. And that\u2019s without straining to find the constitutional defects buried in thousands of pages of legislation and hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations.\n\nForget PPACA, ACA, and Obamacare; what people really ought to call the healthcare law is the \u201cConstitutional Scholar Full Employment Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There\u2019s much more to the ACA\u2019s problems than the individual mandate-tax, botched website, and not being able to keep your policy.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "There's much more to the ACA's problems than the individual mandate-tax, botched website, and not being able to keep your policy.", "title": "Obamacare's Top 10 Constitutional Violations", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/obamacares-top-10-constitutional-violations", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/obamacares-top-10-constitutional-violations", "creator": "@CatoInstitute", "description": "There's much more to the ACA's problems than the individual mandate-tax, botched website, and not being able to keep your policy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare's Top 10 Constitutional Violations"}, "site": "Cato Institute", "robots": "noodp", "node_creation_date": "2013/12/9", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2013/12/9", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-09T10:41:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa8a\"", "article_summary": "After watching snippets of the hearing and reading the written testimony, I thought maybe I should start my \u201ctop 10 constitutional violations\u201d update with the Affordable Care Act alone.\nForget PPACA, ACA, and Obamacare; what people really ought to call the healthcare law is the \u201cConstitutional Scholar Full Employment Act.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s without straining to find the constitutional defects buried in thousands of pages of legislation and hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations.\n(My friend and frequent sparring partner Simon Lazarus of the Constitutional Accountability Center also testified, on the other side, offering a valiant if ultimately insufficient defense.)\n(Forget never running a business or caring about the Constitution; has nobody in the White House ever taken an economics class?)"}
