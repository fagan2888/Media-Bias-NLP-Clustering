This should not be about the next election. This should be about the future of our country, where we are right now. We are shutdown as a government. We are facing a debt crisis,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told TODAY\u2019s Savannah Guthrie.\n\nMurkowski, along with fellow Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, crafted the compromise plan with the help of a bipartisan group of other women lawmakers.\n\nRecord number of women senators set tone: 'They're able to talk to each other'\n\nThe deal, however, was rejected by the House and Speaker John Boehner is being criticized for his struggle to keep his members, particularly a small group of the Tea Party conservatives, in line.\n\nMurkowski said the deal at issue is about more than Boehner\u2019s political future.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep in mind what the real goal here is, which is getting this country back on track. Difficult decisions for all but it ought not to be about the politics of the game or whether or not someone keeps their leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to support John Boehner in any way that I can but we need to be pragmatic. This is not going to be a Republican solution or a Democratic solution. This is going to be a solution that is good for the country.\u201d\n\nFaced against a deadline just a day away, House leaders are scrambling to craft competing legislation, one that would help dismantle elements of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans refer to as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nAyotte said it\u2019s time to move past that issue because battle over the health care law already took place, with its detractors losing the fight.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, the government is shutdown, the Obama care exchange is open,\u201d she told Guthrie. Using health care as a hurdle to resolving the nation\u2019s budget and debt crisis is part of a \u201czero-sum policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we need is problem solving that why I\u2019m proud to be here with Susan (Collins) and Lisa to get this resolved for the country,\u201d Ayotte said.\n\nCollins, who spearheaded the plan being used as the basis of the Senate\u2019s proposed deal, hailed the effort by the group that crafted the legislation.\n\n\u201cI would describe ourselves as a bipartisan group that\u2019s trying to get a solution and do what the American people want us to do, which is to govern responsibly,\" she said. \"We put together a bipartisan group, I think it\u2019s significant it\u2019s led by women, but even more significant is the fact that it\u2019s six Republicans, six Democrats and we\u2019ve come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nMurkowski agreed.\n\n\u201cWe think in the Senate, the six of us \u2014 actually, seven women that have been working together \u2014 do have a good bipartisan solution that works,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s get to it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three women senators who helped craft a deal being pushed by Senate leaders to resolve the nation's debt crisis said House lawmakers need to rise above politics to quickly pass a deal that will allow the federal government to open its doors and pay its bills.\u201cThis should not be about someone\u2019s speakership.
