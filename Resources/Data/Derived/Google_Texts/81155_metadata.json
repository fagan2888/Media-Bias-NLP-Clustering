Access Health is located on the street where the backpack was found with the handwritten notes.\n\n\n\n\"The backpack also contained Access Health CT paperwork and it appears that some of that personal information may be associated with Access Health CT accounts,\" said Counihan.\n\n\n\nRead MoreObamacare loopholes mean less money for government\n\n\n\n\"It is still unclear where that backpack came from, and we are working with the Hartford Police Department to investigate, and contact the individuals whose information may be compromised,\" he said.\n\nCounihan called it a \"potential issue of identity theft.\"\n\nDeputy Hartford Police Chief Brian Foley said cops went to Access Health CT offices at around 2:15 p.m. to meet with an official there \"regarding an employee possibly taking customers personal information.\"\n\nNotes in the backpack included \"possible customer information for Access Health CT, including people's names, dates of birth, and some Social Security numbers,\" Foley said, adding \"It is unknown if anybody's personal information was compromised.\"\n\nCounihan said the exchange's legal department is in the process of notifying state and federal officials about the breach, as required.\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" Counihan said. \"We are sorry this happened. This is a very serious situation and we will hold the person or persons who are responsible to account.\"\n\n\"We will work tirelessly until we have remedied this problem and can prevent any such reoccurrence.\"\n\nAaron Albright, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said: \"This situation does not involve consumers who have used HealthCare.gov. We are in contact with Connecticut and the state is providing updates on this incident.\"\n\n\n\nHealthCare.gov is the federally run Obamacare exchange, serving 36 states.\n\n\n\nRead MoreHealth plans had big premium hikes before Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "As many as 400 people enrolled in Connecticut's Obamacare exchange may have had their personal information stolen, officials said Friday afternoon.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ID theft, connecticut, stolen, 400", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "As many as 400 people enrolled in Connecticut's Obamacare exchange may have had their personal information stolen, officials said Friday afternoon.", "title": "Possible first Obamacare ID theft ever in Conn.", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/06/obamacare-id-theft-personal-info-found-in-conn-backpack.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/06/101739244-172823585.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As many as 400 people enrolled in Connecticut's Obamacare exchange may have had their personal information stolen, officials said Friday afternoon.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/06/obamacare-id-theft-personal-info-found-in-conn-backpack.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/06/101739244-172823585.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "First case of Obamacare ID theft?
