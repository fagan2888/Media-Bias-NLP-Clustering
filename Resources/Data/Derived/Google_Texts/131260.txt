Audio Clip Feds Release New Data On Health Insurance Marketplace Sign-ups

The federal government has released new data on the number of people signing up for health care plans on the health insurance marketplace, and there has been a significant uptick in marketplace activity as of December.

New Mexico and Arizona fall toward the back of the line when it comes to signing up young adults between the ages of 26 and 34 for health plans â€” a demographic the Obama administration has been working to court and says is critical to the success of the Affordable Care Act.

However, federal data shows that in California, nearly 498,794 people have selected a marketplace plan between October and December of last year, while in New Mexico, 7,688 people were able to do the same.

Other useful information shows that in the Southwest, more women are signing up for health plans than men. For example, 55 percent of sign-ups in Texas were by women, while women accounted for 53 percent of sign-ups in Arizona.

At this time there is no data to show racial breakdowns of who is signing up, or the number of exemptions filed by those claiming a religious exemption. There is also no information on Native American users who can opt-out to utilize the Indian Health Service.
