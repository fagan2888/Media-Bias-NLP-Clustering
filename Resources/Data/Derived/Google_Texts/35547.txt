After being best known for fiery, liberal, often very-minority positions on issues ranging from Obamacare to U.S. bombing raids on ISIS in Syria, and from workers rights to federal Ebola response, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, made his re-election TV campaign all about making American flags in America.

And his first big post-election move?

He announced he is going to provide American-made American flags to high schools in his District 9, which includes most of east Orange County, all of Osceola County, and part of northeast Polk County.

"Some of our schools are buying flags made in China because they're less expensive," Grayson stated in a press release announcing his flag-donation plan. "I understand that budgets are tight, but I firmly believe that American-made flags should be used whenever possible, particularly when they're being purchased with taxpayer funds.

"I don't think any of us feel an overwhelming sense of pride when we see a 'Made in China' tag stitched into the American flag," he continued.

As a bonus, he's going to arrange to have each flag flown over the U.S. Capitol before it is delivered to a high school. His office is going to pay for the flags.

District 9 schools range from Haines City Senior to St. Cloud High, and from Celebration High to Colonial High. In all, there are more than 40. Grayson will start presenting the flags at the beginning of the 114th Congress, the release announced.

Last year he championed legislation that requires the federal government to buy American-made American flags.

Last month, Orange schools decided it would stop buying Chinese-made U.S. flags for outdoor display after anti-tax activist Doug Guetzloe complained.
