Unfortunately, when the school year started, instead of orientation, our kids got a head full of indoctrination.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point published a list of \u201cExamples of Racial Microaggressions\u201d on its official website. According to UWSP, a microaggression is described as \u201cdaily slights visited upon people of color, women, LGBT persons and other historically oppressed communities.\u201d After some unfavorable national media attention this summer, UWSP clarified that the material is used in new faculty seminars and that the university is not banning the words but rather \u201cbuilding awareness\u201d for a safe and inclusive environment on campus. Intentional or not, this list has a chilling effect on speech for new staff and especially young students who are still forming their own beliefs or worry that straying from the school sanctioned list of words and opinions could result in social repercussions or a lower grade in class.\n\nSo what qualifies as a microaggression? The list of frowned-upon phrases includes, \u201cAmerica is a melting pot.\u201d Under the subject titled \u201cThe myth of meritocracy\u201d are the sentences \u201cI believe the most qualified person should get the job\u201d and \u201ceveryone can succeed in this society, if they work hard enough.\" Why? Because UWSP believes these phrases presume \u201crace is not a factor.\u201d Students also are discouraged from asking a foreign student where they are from, or from asking an Asian person for help in math or science because that is racially stereotyping. The rest of the list is just as ridiculous.\n\nPartial screenshot from University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point's \"examples of racial microaggressions\" worksheet given to new faculty. (Photo: University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point)\n\nNo wonder 79 percent of Americans believe that \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d is a serious problem in our country! We\u2019re growing weary of having our speech monitored and sanitized to suit someone else\u2019s political agenda. Moreover, these self-appointed \u201cthought police\u201d lack basic common sense. Of course some words are offensive, but it is precisely at the university where young people should be learning the power and responsibility that comes with free speech. Not through censorship or shaming, but by encouraging spirited debate and an open dialogue and exchange of ideas \u2014 all ideas. This would foster the kind of diversity universities ought to care most about: diversity of thought.\n\nMillions of immigrants come to the land of the free, fleeing countries where daring to think differently is punished. It is sad and alarming that U.S. publicly funded universities are codifying intolerance to different points of view. Moreover, as a minority myself, I reject the patronizing culture of victimization UWSP is fostering. It only adds insult to injury that students are being discouraged, and possibly stigmatized, for discussing or defending the very ideas and values that built this great nation.\n\nWisconsin tax dollars should be reserved for universities that promote and protect free speech and are committed to education, not indoctrination. I hope freedom-loving students defend their rights and I encourage alumni and taxpayers to call UWSP and your state government leaders. Let them know you disagree with these coercive policies. Wisconsin students deserve better.\n\nTo those intolerant, Age of Aquarius professors and administrators muzzling free speech at UWSP, I say: America is a melting pot, and it makes our country stronger and more beautiful. The most qualified person should get the job. As the daughter and granddaughter of Hispanic immigrants who built their American dream through faith, hard work and personal responsibility, I thank God every day that America is still the place where you can succeed if you are willing to work hard enough. That\u2019s what makes us great and that\u2019s what makes me so proud to be an American.\n\nRachel Campos-Duffy, a mother of seven and wife of Rep.
