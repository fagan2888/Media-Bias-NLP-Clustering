Careful not to say or do the wrong thing. He tried so hard to make the Rockies team in every at-bat and with every groundball that he sabotaged his chances.\n\nLast season he should have made the team out of spring training, and when he finally got the call in late April he showed why. He led the Rockies with 133 games played and hit .298 after the all-star break. And, he made history, becoming the first National League rookie third baseman to win the Rawlings Gold Glove.\n\nArenado ambitiously attacked his offseason, changing to even more explosive training. He plans on playing at 214 pounds, slightly lighter than last year in hopes of imrpoving his lateral quickness.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to just to keep getting better, to everything in my power to help this team win,\u201d said Arenado, who plans on giving his Gold Glove trophy to his parents.\n\nTime to hit:\n\nCorey Dickerson took about 17 minutes off this winter, spending time lifting, running and even facing some live pitching in Mississippi. He weighs 215 pounds, 15 more than a year ago. He wanted more strength, and doesn\u2019t believe he has sacrificed any speed.\n\nCatching on\n\nThe catchers spent part of the first day working on framing pitches. They used a no-break glove, which requires catchers to catch with soft hands to keep the ball from ricocheting away. Tom Murphy, a promising prospect, is among catchers taking part in the the drill.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charlie Blackmon,Corey Dickerson,Nolan Arenado,Tom Murphy", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Two years ago, Nolan Arenado was the kid in the clubhouse.
