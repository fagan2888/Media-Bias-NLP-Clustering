You\u2019re covered whether you want it or not, as long as you have more than 10 years (or 40 quarters) of Medicare-covered employment, according to Medicare.gov.\n\nBut the rest of Medicare \u2014 for doctor visits (Part B) and prescription drugs (Part D) \u2014 is voluntary. Which means, when you turn 65, you have some decisions to make. AARP explains:\n\nMedicare has a seven-month period in which you can sign up for Part B, which covers doctor bills and other outpatient medical costs. This period begins three months before the month of your 65th birthday, includes the month you turn 65 and ends three months after your birthday month.\n\nThe catch? If you don\u2019t sign up at that point, you could pay some serious financial penalties later in life.\n\nAll this has nothing to do with Obamacare, by the way. If you\u2019re eligible for Medicare, Obamacare doesn\u2019t apply to you.\n\nThe exception\n\nWe just said you must sign up around your 65th birthday or pay penalties later. There\u2019s one exception: If you\u2019re eligible for Medicare, are working and have health insurance through your company or your spouse\u2019s employer, you can hold off on signing up.\n\n\u201cBased upon your circumstances, you don\u2019t have to sign up for Medicare at age 65 and there will not be a penalty if you follow the rules,\u201d Gail Buckner wrote at Fox Business.\n\nBefore deciding, talk with your insurance agent or your employer\u2019s human resources office. Also make sure, if you decide to skip Medicare prescription drug coverage, that your plan qualifies with Medicare as \u201ccreditable.\u201d You\u2019ll find more information in this Medicare publication.\n\nThe penalty: Part B\n\nSay you\u2019re 65, no longer working, and don\u2019t want to pay premiums for Part B Medicare insurance (for doctor visits) or Part D (prescription drug coverage). That\u2019s OK. But if you opt out, the costs will be higher if you want to get back in.\n\nThe reason: Insurance plans work because people who don\u2019t need the coverage pay premiums along with those who need it. Insurance plans go broke when the only people paying in are those using it.\n\nSuppose you\u2019re 72 today. You became eligible for Medicare seven years ago, in 2006. But you waited until now to sign up for Part B. If you want to get into Medicare Part B today, your monthly premiums will include a penalty of 10 percent for each year you were eligible but didn\u2019t enroll, \u200badded to your premium forever, says Linda Williamson, an agent in Bellingham, Wash., with Vibrant USA, an independent insurance agency that specializes in Medicare.\n\nPart B premiums are $104.90 a month in 2013, so your monthly cost will be $104.90 plus \u200b10 percent ($10.49) for every year missed, Williamson says. You missed seven years, so you\u2019ll pay an extra $73 \u2014 about $178 a month in all.\n\nThe penalty: Part D\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of drug coverage, Medicare Part D. Likewise, if you opt out now, the insurance will cost you more later. The penalty is 1 percent of the premium each month for every month you are eligible and don\u2019t enroll, says Williamson.\n\n\u201cAfter you join a Medicare drug plan, the plan will tell you if you owe a penalty, and what your premium will be, says Medicare.gov\u2019s explainer on Part D penalties.\n\nOne woman\u2019s story\n\nWilliamson sees firsthand the costs for people who want Medicare now after skipping coverage in their younger years. She tells the story of an elderly friend who decided not to get Medicare prescription drug coverage when it was first offered in 2006.\n\n\u201cThis friend went on Medicare in 1992,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cThere was no drug plan then. Come 2006, she determined that, since she doesn\u2019t take drugs, \u2018Why would I spend the money?\u2019 She just refused to sign up for any drug plan.\u201d\n\nToday the friend, who is 86, needs a daily prescription drug for a serious condition. She paid for it herself until the price rose to about $100 a month recently, Williamson says.\n\nFinally, with the help of her caregivers, she signed up for a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. The insurance reduced the cost of her medicine to \u201csomething like $3.65 for her drug \u2014 very cheap,\u201d Williamson says.\n\nThe insurance premium is $28.80. But, because she waited to sign up, she also pays about $25 a month in penalties. That brings her total monthly premium, including the penalty, to about $53.\n\n\u201cThe penalty can hurt you,\u201d says Williamson. \u201cBut there are a lot of people who say, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m paying a big penalty now but look at what I saved over the years by not having to pay.'\u201d\n\nMaking the decision\n\nShe has other customers who don\u2019t use prescriptions but do buy Medicare prescription insurance as protection against what the future may bring. \u201cBasically, they say, \u2018What\u2019s the cheapest drug plan out there?\u2019 Then they\u2019re not subject to the penalty and if they need it they have it.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, co-payments and deductibles are dropping, making Part D coverage cheaper. Read here about the improvements in Medicare drug coverage next year.\n\nFor personalized guidance on the costs and benefits, contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program for free Medicare counseling, either by phone or face-to-face. Find your state\u2019s program here, at Medicare.gov, or by calling (800) MEDICARE.\n\nThe counselors also can help you decide whether to buy additional private insurance in the form of Medicare supplement (Medigap) plans or Medicare Advantage plans. These insurance plans pay Medicare\u2019s deductibles and co-pays.\n\nIf your income is low, you might qualify for what Medicare calls \u201cExtra Help\u201d paying your premiums. \u201cIn 2013, you may qualify if you have up to $17,235 in yearly income ($23,265 for a married couple) and up to $13,300 in resources ($26,580 for a married couple),\u201d says Medicare.gov, which shows state resources for help, too. Or call Social Security at (800) 772-1213.\n\nOpting in, opting out\n\nHere, in a nutshell, are the Medicare plans and the penalties for opting out.\n\nPart A: Hospital care\n\nCost: Nothing (because you paid for it while you were working).\n\nNothing (because you paid for it while you were working). Deductible: For 2013, the deductible is $1,184 ($1,216 in 2014) for any hospital stay 60 days or less. After 60 days there are co-pays: 61 to 90 days: $296 per day. 91 to 150 days: $592 per day (the limit is 60 of these high-deductible days in your lifetime). More than 150 days within a single benefit period: full cost.\n\nFor 2013, the deductible is $1,184 ($1,216 in 2014) for any hospital stay 60 days or less. After 60 days there are co-pays: Can you opt out? No, but why would you? It\u2019s free.\n\nPart B: Doctor visits\n\nCost: $104.90 a month, provided your income is below $85,000 for a single person, $170,000 if married and filing jointly. If your income is more, you\u2019ll pay more.\n\n$104.90 a month, provided your income is below $85,000 for a single person, $170,000 if married and filing jointly. If your income is more, you\u2019ll pay more. Deductible: $147 per year. Once you\u2019ve met that, however, you\u2019ll still have to pay 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount.

Can you opt out? Yes\n\nYes Penalty for opting out: A formula is used, based on how long you\u2019ve been eligible and without coverage. Medicare explains how the penalties are calculated.\n\nHow do you deal with the deductibles and co-pays?\n\nDoes paying $592 per day for hospital stays over 90 days or 20 percent of doctor visits sound frightening? That\u2019s why there\u2019s such a thing as Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans. These plans fill the gaps left by basic Medicare coverage.\n\nYou can learn more about Medigap policies at this page of the Medicare website.
