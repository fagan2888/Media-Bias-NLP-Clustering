Some critics argue that it should not push a regulatory scheme onto other countries that has not been tested at home. (Darren McCollester/Getty Images)\n\nStung by overseas patent rulings that could undercut U.S. companies, the Obama administration is trying to expand protection for the makers of the world\u2019s most advanced medicines through trade rules that critics argue could lead to higher global drug prices.\n\nThe effort has sparked an intense debate between pharmaceutical firms, which are looking to protect costly research investments and fund the next generation of drug development, and patient advocates and others who worry that a strict application of U.S. rules around the world could keep prices out of reach, particularly for patients in developing countries.\n\nThe issue has injected a moral dimension into negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation pact that would apply similar rules to developing nations, such as Vietnam, which are struggling worldwide to provide access to advanced medicines, and sophisticated industrial countries such as Japan. For the United States, the economic stakes are direct, and they show how U.S. officials hope to use the TPP to shape the landscape for industries considered central to the U.S.\u2019s economic future. Along with pharmaceuticals, U.S. negotiators are pressing hard to set standards that would give logistics and consulting firms, cloud computing and telecommunications businesses, and other leading-edge companies more freedom in the 11 other TPP nations \u2014 and globally if those standards take root.\n\nIn the case of biotechnology, regulations are not clearly settled even in the United States. It was only under the Affordable Care Act, for example, that the U.S. government agreed to allow generic alternatives for the sophisticated and costly-to-develop drugs that are considered among the most promising ways to attack cancer and other chronic diseases.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration continues to work out the details, and the first generics probably are years away.\n\nGiven the uncertainty \u2014 and the expense of treatments that routinely run into the tens of thousands of dollars per patient \u2014 some critics argue that the United States should not push a regulatory scheme onto other countries that has not been tested at home.\n\n\u201cWhat is optimal for the U.S. is not necessarily optimal for other countries,\u201d said Patricia M. Danzon, a professor of health-care management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The broad trade-off accepted in wealthy countries \u2014 years of patent protection that keeps prices high, in order to encourage innovation, before generic competition is allowed \u2014 becomes more of a problem in poorer nations, where insurance coverage may be sparse, national health systems screen out the more expensive treatments, and patients simply do without.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said trade negotiators can square the circle \u2014 and find a way to ensure a strong research climate while also improving affordability and access in poorer countries.\n\nThose goals \u201caren\u2019t mutually exclusive propositions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can make sure that developing partners have the flexibilities that keep medicines affordable,\u201d perhaps by giving some countries more time to phase in the needed regulations.\n\nWhatever compromise may be found within TPP, it\u2019s clear that the United States has been on the defensive \u2014 with other TPP countries opposed to adopting the U.S. proposals, and still other nations chipping away at pharmaceutical patent protections.\n\nIndia has been a particular focus, with the government ordering companies to surrender patent rights and license their products to local companies. India is taking other steps it regards as necessary to lower the cost of advanced treatments for breast cancer and other diseases. Canada remains on a trade watch list after a spate of court rulings that voided patents for major pharmaceutical companies in favor of the country\u2019s strong generics industry.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of concern about whether countries at similar levels of development are held to the same intellectual property standards,\u201d said David Talbot, head of international government affairs for Eli Lilly and Co. \u201cOtherwise, we are chasing problems from country to country, which is what we are doing now.\u201d\n\nThe TPP has become a particular focal point as the United States presses to include in the treaty its approach to regulating \u201cbiosimilars,\u201d the generic versions of the most complex biotechnology products.\n\nThe research and development timeline for biotech products is so long that original patents on a promising molecule may have only a few years left in their terms by the time a drug or treatment is licensed. That is not considered enough to spur the flow of investment that makes the industry tick. To extend that period of protection, the Affordable Care Act gave companies an additional 12 years of \u201cdata exclusivity\u201d \u2014 meaning that the results of tests used in developing the drug cannot be referenced or relied on by companies trying to develop generic substitutes for 12 years after the original drug\u2019s approval.\n\nIn the biotech development process, use of that other research is an important issue. Unlike less complex, chemically derived pharmaceuticals, biotech products are produced from living cell lines. Whereas \u201csmall molecule\u201d drugs such as aspirin can be precisely duplicated, generic versions of advanced biopharmaceuticals can only be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d \u2014 with similar DNA, but not duplicate DNA. The ability to rely, to some degree, on the data and tests generated in the process of approving the original substance helps to lower the cost of generic development and aid in determining if a proposed substitute should be approved.\n\nThe 12-year period was a compromise in the United States between what drug companies said they needed and the shorter span of time that patient advocates argued would speed approval of generics and lower health-care costs.\n\nThe FDA is developing the final rules for licensing biosimilars, but already the competition is lining up. Some biopharmaceuticals will begin to lose their final intellectual property protections in coming months, and other firms are planning to compete.\n\nThe blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis medication Humira, for example, loses its final protection in 2016, and at least four companies in Germany, Brazil and elsewhere have begun studying how to replicate the drug \u2014 one of a class of compounds known as monoclonal antibodies.\n\nMichael Soldan, global head of regulatory affairs for biosimilars at Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim, compared the process of building a monoclonal antibody to that of building a jet airplane \u2014 where simple aspirin would be akin to a bicycle, and simpler biologic compounds like a car.\n\nBut the potential rewards are mammoth: Humira is one of the top-selling drugs of all time and, at a retail price of about $30,000 a year, generated more than $9 billion in 2012 sales for its manufacturer, AbbVie, a spinoff of medical giant Abbott Laboratories.\n\nDeveloping biosimilars is \u201cthe logical next step. . . . The trend is for more biosimilars. You\u2019ll see that 20 years from now. It is clear how this is going,\u201d Soldan said.\n\nWhether it leads to lower prices is another matter. Europe developed a system for licensing biosimilars a few years ago. A few have come to market and, according to industry officials and studies, they have shaved 20 to 30 percent off the price of drugs \u2014 not the 80 or 90 percent savings, for example, that have helped increase access around the world to the most effective treatments for AIDS. That might make much of the current discussion moot if other manufacturers find it too difficult and too expensive to develop biosimilars and cede the market to a drug\u2019s inventor.\n\nBut pharmaceutical industry advocates worry that without strong global rules, the drug development process will suffer.\n\n\u201cAccess to medicines is critically important, but so is existence of the medicine,\u201d said Stephen Ezell, an analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \u201cIt is the returns on one generation of innovation that finances the next generation of research.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "generic pharmaceuticals, biosimlar regulation, transpacific partnerhip", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Critics argue that tougher rules will keep prices too high for the poorest nations", "title": "With protections set to lapse on advanced drugs, U.S. presses strict rules overseas", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/with-protections-set-to-lapse-on-advanced-drugs-us-presses-strict-rules-overseas/2014/03/13/68b24258-83af-11e3-8099-9181471f7aaf_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/14/National-Economy/Images/Hkg9534646-1581.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hpschneider"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/with-protections-set-to-lapse-on-advanced-drugs-us-presses-strict-rules-overseas/2014/03/13/68b24258-83af-11e3-8099-9181471f7aaf_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "generic pharmaceuticals, biosimlar regulation, transpacific partnerhip", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "68b24258-83af-11e3-8099-9181471f7aaf", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Critics argue that tougher rules will keep prices too high for the poorest nations"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e4d\"", "article_summary": "But pharmaceutical industry advocates worry that without strong global rules, the drug development process will suffer.\nIn the case of biotechnology, regulations are not clearly settled even in the United States.\nFor the United States, the economic stakes are direct, and they show how U.S. officials hope to use the TPP to shape the landscape for industries considered central to the U.S.\u2019s economic future.\nSome biopharmaceuticals will begin to lose their final intellectual property protections in coming months, and other firms are planning to compete.\nWhatever compromise may be found within TPP, it\u2019s clear that the United States has been on the defensive \u2014 with other TPP countries opposed to adopting the U.S. proposals, and still other nations chipping away at pharmaceutical patent protections."}
