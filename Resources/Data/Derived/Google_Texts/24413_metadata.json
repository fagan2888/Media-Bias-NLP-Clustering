If you are one of those people waiting until the last minute, financial professional Brad Allen with wealthwisconsin.com joined us on Live at Daybreak Saturday with some reminders of common mistakes people make when they file. MILWAUKEE -- Your tax deadline this year is April 18. Now, t\n\nAllen told us two of the most common mistakes on returns are listing an incorrect Social Security number or doing your math wrong. Make sure to double check everything before you send out, because it can cost you money in your refund or flag you for an audit.\n\nIt is also not frowned upon by the IRS to file an extension, says Allen. An extension will give you an extra six months to file. Remember if you owe money on your taxes, make your best estimate because you still need to pay by April 18, Allen says.\n\nAffordable Care Act tax penalties increased for people who did not have qualified health care coverage last year- and they will go up again next year, says Allen.\n\nThere are also changes to the contribution limits for Health Savings Accounts for families. Allen says it rose $100 to $6,750.", "article_metadata": {"isPremium": "false", "description": "Financial professional Brad Allen with\u00a0wealthwisconsin.com\u00a0joined us on Live at Daybreak Saturday with some reminders of common mistakes people make when they file.", "hasVideo": "true", "og": {"site_name": "TMJ4", "description": "Financial professional Brad Allen with\u00a0wealthwisconsin.com\u00a0joined us on Live at Daybreak Saturday with some reminders of common mistakes people make when they file.", "title": "Tax experts warn of changes this year", "url": "http://www.tmj4.com/on-air/tax-experts-warn-of-changes-this-year", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://mediaassets.tmj4.com/photo/2016/04/09/serious_1460211921732_35850035_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 370197263, "iphone": 370197263}}, "site": "@tmj4", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.tmj4.com,recp.mkt32.net", "msvalidate.01": "F33258882556C3E953931ECED98AF6A1", "fb": {"app_id": 142215452542251}, "keywords": "On Air,Video,Homepage Showcase", "shortHeadline": "Tax experts warn of changes this year", "isStory": "true", "google-site-verification": "cWB2tZoWqDt2Trwygmj9fHxwbdcrRWA1ta4QHDovteM", "article": {"section": "On Air", "published_time": "2016-04-09T14:25:34+0000", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T14:25:34+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now, tAllen told us two of the most common mistakes on returns are listing an incorrect Social Security number or doing your math wrong.\nAffordable Care Act tax penalties increased for people who did not have qualified health care coverage last year- and they will go up again next year, says Allen.\nRemember if you owe money on your taxes, make your best estimate because you still need to pay by April 18, Allen says.\nThere are also changes to the contribution limits for Health Savings Accounts for families.\nIt is also not frowned upon by the IRS to file an extension, says Allen."}
