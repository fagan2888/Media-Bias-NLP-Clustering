April 15, 2016

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.—Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit today announced the arrest of a Broward County dentist for allegedly billing the Medicaid program more than $14,000 for services not rendered. Dr. Marino F. Vigna, 49, allegedly billed Medicaid for dentures that recipients never received and for tooth extractions Vigna never performed.

According to the investigation, Vigna billed for services performed at times he vacationed out of the country and on days he closed his dental office. Additionally, Vigna allegedly billed for services provided to recipients at a time after the recipients passed away.

Vigna faces one count of grand theft, a third degree felony. If convicted, Vigna faces up to five years in prison, fines and restitution. The Attorney General’s Office of Statewide Prosecution is prosecuting the case.
