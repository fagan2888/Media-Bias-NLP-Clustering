That sorry showing follows growth of 1.4 percent and 2 percent in the previous two quarters. If such a thing is possible, the already-anemic economy is actually getting worse.\n\nBut even worse than that, the latest GDP numbers reveal a collapse in business investment, the real driver of the economy.\n\nWhen businesses don\u2019t spend and invest, they don\u2019t hire and cannot offer better-paying jobs. Business investment and wages are two sides of the same mirror. If a company purchases five trucks rather than 10, there are five fewer trucking jobs. If employers don\u2019t invest in more computers, there are fewer programming jobs. If businesses don\u2019t purchase more jackhammers and cranes, fewer construction workers are hired.\n\nBusiness investment hasn\u2019t grown for two years. Over the past two quarters, total business fixed investment has fallen by an annualized average of 4 percent. Business equipment and software has dropped by more than 5 percent. Non-residential structures \u2014 such as commercial office space, shopping malls, factories, and hotels \u2014 have dropped by nearly 8 percent.\n\nBut let\u2019s go further back. For the entire 32-quarter economic recovery, business fixed investment has averaged just 1.1 percent at an annual rate. Since 1960, however, business fixed investment has averaged 4.4 percent at an annual rate. So the present expansion in business investment is roughly one-quarter of the 55-year average.\n\nWhy? One key factor is tax policy, especially business tax policy.\n\nAt 40 percent for combined federal and state business tax rates, the U.S. has the largest corporate tax burden in the developed world. We double-tax corporate profits earned overseas, as virtually no other country does. Our depreciation rates for investment tax expensing are among the worst in the world. And despite all the talk about corporate tax reform, nothing gets done \u2014 even under a Republican Congress.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Obama administration has raised tax rates on capital gains, dividends, and income (paid by small-business pass-throughs). So, as the tax cost of capital has gone up, business investment has come down.\n\nArthur Laffer has taught us: \u201cIf you tax something, you get less of it.\u201d That\u2019s why firms are moving offshore in droves. It\u2019s not about being unpatriotic. It\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t pay, after-tax, to invest in the United States.\n\nA second key reason for the business-investment slump is monetary policy. While this may not be the right time for rate hikes, ultra-low interest rates have led to financial engineering rather than the deployment of excess corporate cash for productivity-enhancing investment.\n\nRather than invest in job creation and higher wages, firms are buying back stocks to boost price-earnings ratios. In many cases, they are even borrowing money they don\u2019t need so they can buy back stocks.\n\nA third key reason for the business-investment collapse is over-regulation. Obamacare rules and mandates are job-killers. Dodd-Frank red-tape costs have held back lending to such an extent that business start-ups have practically come to a halt. And community banks have drastically pulled back loans to existing small businesses.\n\nThen we have the Obama EPA\u2019s new rules, which amount to a war on fossil fuel. The president pushes for climate-change regulations instead of a massive build-out of energy infrastructure, including pipelines, liquid-natural-gas terminals and new refineries.\n\nWant more manufacturing? The energy business, and the potential for North American energy independence, is the key. Hillary Clinton, with her promise to end oil and gas fracking, will pull us further in the wrong direction.\n\nMany people do not understand that business investment is a critical prosperity-booster, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and stronger family income. Put another way, rising tax and regulatory burdens that penalize investors and businesses also punish middle-income wage earners.\n\nAnd it\u2019s these wage earners who would benefit most from business tax reforms, such as a 15 percent corporate rate for large C-corps and small S-corps. This should be accompanied by immediate tax-deduction expensing for new investment and a territorial tax regime that would stop double-taxing profits earned abroad.\n\nStudy after study shows that corporate tax reform is a middle-class tax cut, not a tax cut for the rich. You see, corporations don\u2019t really pay taxes. They simply collect them and pass the cost along in the form of lower wages and benefits, higher consumer prices and reduced shareholder value.\n\nThe overarching theme of this election is an angry revolt by the middle class over the fact that jobs and wages have barely increased in the past decade. They blame Washington, China, immigration, power elites and almost everything else. So be it. There is a lot of work to be done on all these fronts. But without radical tax, regulatory and currency reform, business investment will never fully recover.\n\nAnd neither will the economy.\n\nTo find out more about Lawrence Kudlow visit the Creators Syndicate Web page at www.creators.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/05/02/growth-anemia-blame-collapse-business-investment/83834532/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Without radical tax, regulatory and currency reform, business investment won\u2019t recover.", "og": {"site_name": "The Jackson Sun", "description": "Without radical tax, regulatory and currency reform, business investment won\u2019t recover.", "title": "Growth anemia: Blame a collapse in business investment", "url": "http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/05/02/growth-anemia-blame-collapse-business-investment/83834532/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/jacksonsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Without radical tax, regulatory and currency reform, business investment won\u2019t recover.", "creator": "@JSunNews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b3bcc82e602172b43d6a4667403e271ee6b3fd9/c=2-0-147-145&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/02/JacksonTN/B9322001480Z.1_20160502143011_000_G72E8HQB9.1-0.jpg", "title": "Growth anemia: Blame a collapse in business investment", "site": "@JSunNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=893610877", "fb": {"app_id": 174739675893665}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "But even worse than that, the latest GDP numbers reveal a collapse in business investment, the real driver of the economy.\nAt 40 percent for combined federal and state business tax rates, the U.S. has the largest corporate tax burden in the developed world.\nSo the present expansion in business investment is roughly one-quarter of the 55-year average.\nBusiness investment hasn\u2019t grown for two years.\nBusiness investment and wages are two sides of the same mirror."}
