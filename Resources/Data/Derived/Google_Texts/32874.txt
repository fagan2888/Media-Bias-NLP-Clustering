The Oklahoma City Police Department's Larceny Unit worked with the State Lottery Commission to catch a convenience store clerk in a lie that would lead to an arrest.

On Thursday, an undercover investigator presented a winning lottery ticket worth $20,000 to Vipul Kumar Patel at his El Reno convenience store. Patel reportedly told the investigator the ticket was not a winner and kept it.

The next day, Patel presented the ticket to the Oklahoma Lottery Commission in Oklahoma City in hopes of cashing the ticket, police said.

Officers then took Patel into custody.
