In the United Kingdom there\u2019s been a 34 percent increase in abortion rates for Down syndrome babies since new testing came out in 201. The recent release of these findings led one Canadian columnist to wonder if the practice is really all that different than Nazi eugenics. After all, where will it stop? Because of that same prenatal test in the UK, 10 babies were aborted simply because they had a cleft palate (!), a birth defect that is entirely treatable.\n\nIt\u2019s comforting to know, then, that states like Ohio are taking steps to ban abortions of babies who have Down syndrome.\n\nLifeNews.com has the details:\n\nAn Ohio state legislative committee approved a pro-life bill today to ban abortions specifically done on unborn babies who are diagnosed with Down syndrome. The vote in favor of the measure sends the bill to the full Ohio state House for a vote. The Ohio House Committee on Community and Family Advancement voted in favor of the bill 9-3 with bipartisan support. [\u2026] Ohio Right to Life\u2019s Down Syndrome Non-Discrimination Act (H.B. 135) was introduced in the Ohio House of Representatives. The legislation, sponsored by Representatives Sarah LaTourrette and David Hall, comes after multiple studies have demonstrated that upwards of 90 percent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. Sixteen legislators signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. \u201cWith these committee hearings, Ohioans have had the opportunity to define what kind of state we want to be: one that accommodates difference and protects every person\u2019s right to life,\u201d said Stephanie Ranade Krider, executive director of Ohio Right to Life. \u201cWe are tremendously proud of this committee for taking steps towards making Ohio a safer place for every human child, regardless of how many chromosomes they have.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, North Dakota became the first state in the nation to ban abortions of babies because they were diagnosed with Down syndrome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I pray this becomes a nationwide trend. .05/26/2016 4:19:57AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "I pray this becomes a nationwide trend.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Ohio Committee Passes Bill to Ban Abortions Based on Down Syndrome", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/06/17/ohio-committee-passes-bill-to-make-it-the-second-state-to-ban-abortions-based-on-down-syndrome-n2013783", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/57/9b96c5f3-8d22-42b1-b427-0a8adaa2d4e8.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "I pray this becomes a nationwide trend.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Ohio Committee Passes Bill to Ban Abortions Based on Down Syndrome", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/06/17/ohio-committee-passes-bill-to-make-it-the-second-state-to-ban-abortions-based-on-down-syndrome-n2013783", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/57/9b96c5f3-8d22-42b1-b427-0a8adaa2d4e8.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Ohio Committee Passes Bill to Ban Abortions Based on Down Syndrome, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb28f\"", "article_summary": "The Ohio House Committee on Community and Family Advancement voted in favor of the bill 9-3 with bipartisan support.\nThe vote in favor of the measure sends the bill to the full Ohio state House for a vote.\nLifeNews.com has the details:An Ohio state legislative committee approved a pro-life bill today to ban abortions specifically done on unborn babies who are diagnosed with Down syndrome.\nIn the United Kingdom there\u2019s been a 34 percent increase in abortion rates for Down syndrome babies since new testing came out in 201.\nIt\u2019s comforting to know, then, that states like Ohio are taking steps to ban abortions of babies who have Down syndrome."}
