She conveniently neglected to mention that it was the Jindal administration\u2019s decision a year ago to lower premiums as a means of lowering the state\u2019s 75 percent match, thereby freeing up money to plug gaping holes in Jindal\u2019s makeshift budget.\n\nThat move, of course, help decimate OGB\u2019s reserve fund. What started out as a $540 million surplus a year ago now stands at less than half that.\n\n\u201cAt first glance it may seem like having a fund that large is a great thing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut in reality, keeping hundreds of millions unnecessarily locked up in a reserve fund was not the best use of taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the state funds 75 percent of member premiums through taxpayer dollars, letting that large of a balance sit unused meant that those funds weren\u2019t being used for other important projects,\u201d she said.\n\nNichols, of course, overlooks the fact that successful insurance companies keep health reserve funds in cases of a natural disaster or major epidemic. Companies who only manage to pay claims out of premiums on the other hand, traditionally don\u2019t survive.\n\nHer entire 800-word piece never once mentioned that state employees and retirees would soon be asked to pay significantly higher premiums for equally significantly reduced benefits. Instead, she parsed words, saying, \u201cPlan changes for fiscal year 2015 are estimated to lower expected claims costs by $131.8 million\u2026\u201d\n\nThat sounds pretty good until you read the first page of the nine-page report released Monday by Legislative Fiscal Officer John Carpenter and Legislative Fiscal Office Section Director J. Travis McIlwain.\n\nState employee health plan changes, according to the report, include, among other things:\n\nAn increase in premiums state employees and retirees pay for health coverage;\n\nSignificantly increase the out-of-pocket maximum for all health plan options;\n\nIncreasing deductibles for all health plan options;\n\nIncreasing co-pays 100 percent for those proposed health plans with co-pays;\n\nIncreasing the out-of-pocket maximum for the prescription drug benefit by $300 from $1,200 to $1,500 per year, a 20 percent increase;\n\nRequiring prior authorizations for certain medical procedures;\n\nEliminating the out-of-network benefit for some health plan options;\n\nRemoving all vision coverage from the health plan options.\n\nThe latest premium increase of 6 percent will go into effect on Jan. 1 is on top of a 5 percent increase implemented on July 1 of this year.\n\nOf course, the revamp of OGB premiums and benefits was the result of the infamous Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) study.\n\nThe really amazing thing about that is Jindal rushed into the OGB privatization convinced he could do no wrong and that his was the only way and that the state was going to save millions. Yet, when things started going south, he calls in the big A&M guns.\n\nNot only that, he forked over $199,752 to A&M to learn the best way to screw state employees.\n\nSpeaking of A&M, the contract with the firm was originally for a little more than $4.2 million but was promptly amended by $794,678, bumping the amount up to a cool $5 million. The problem with that is state law allows only a one-time contract amendment of no more than 10 percent without legislative concurrence. The amendment was for 18.9 percent.\n\nAs if that were not egregious enough, the Division of Administration subsequently amended the contract by yet another $2.4 million in May\u2014again without bothering to obtain the legally mandated concurrence from the legislature.\n\nNothing, it seems, is beneath this administration.\n\nWell, don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned. LouisianaVoice said before the OGB privatization ever took place that it would be necessary to raise premiums or lower benefits.\n\nBut Jindal, wunderkind that he is, insisted his privatization plan, ripped straight from the pages of the handbook of his only private sector employer, McKinsey & Co., would be more cost efficient than having those lazy state workers process claims and that the state would save money.\n\nAnd lest you forget, McKinsey advised AT&T in 1980 there was no future in cell phones.\n\nAnd of course, McKinsey developed the flawless business plan for Enron.\n\nTo a degree Jindal is correct; the state will now save money\u2014on the backs of state employees.\n\nState Rep. John Bel Edwards (D-Amite), who is an announced candidate for governor in the 2015 election agrees.\n\n\u201cThe OGB fiasco is proof positive that privatization for the sake of privatization is foolish,\u201d he said. \u201cA reserve balance that recently exceeded $500 million is half that now and bleeding $16M per month due to mismanagement and budget chicanery, and the ultimate price will be paid by state retirees and employees through higher premiums, higher co-pays, higher deductibles, and higher co-insurance in exchange for fewer benefits, more forced generic drugs, and more preclearance of needed treatments and other changes that make crystal clear that the OGB beneficiaries will pay more for less.\u201d\n\nBingo! And right on cue, Carpenter\u2019s report echoed Edwards:\n\n\u201cThe health plan and prescription drug plan policy changes\u2026will shift more of the costs from the state to the OGB plan member,\u201d it said.\n\nThat shift will save the state a minimum of $44.7 million for health plan changes and at least $69 million for prescription drug plan changes in fiscal year 2015, the report said.\n\n\u201cAlong with premiums, the major costs incurred for medical services by an OGB plan member will be deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance,\u201d it said. \u201cThe new health plan offerings will significantly reduce the cost to OGB, while the OGB members pay more for their medical services.\u201d\n\nOf the total OGB population, 75 percent are currently enrolled in the HMO plan which presently has no deductible for the employee but those members will, effective January 1, be subject to both a deductible and coinsurance whereas most are currently subject only to fixed co-pays.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "title": "Blame Jindalcare, not Obama for Louisiana OGB member costs", "og": {"url": "http://www.bayoubuzz.com/buzz/latest-buzz/item/725775-blame-jindalcare-not-obama-for-louisiana-ogb-member-costs", "type": "article", "description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "title": "Blame Jindalcare, not Obama for Louisiana OGB member costs"}, "author": "Guest OpED", "keywords": "US, Louisiana News, Louisiana political, Louisiana politics, Louisiana business, New Orleans, Baton Rouge,  Louisiana cities, US politics, US news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a81\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAlong with premiums, the major costs incurred for medical services by an OGB plan member will be deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance,\u201d it said.\nAnd right on cue, Carpenter\u2019s report echoed Edwards:\u201cThe health plan and prescription drug plan policy changes\u2026will shift more of the costs from the state to the OGB plan member,\u201d it said.\nOf course, the revamp of OGB premiums and benefits was the result of the infamous Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) study.\nNot only that, he forked over $199,752 to A&M to learn the best way to screw state employees.\nLouisianaVoice said before the OGB privatization ever took place that it would be necessary to raise premiums or lower benefits."}
