Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) needlessly afflict thousands of patients each year, lengthening hospital stays, boosting hospital readmission rates, and driving up the cost of care.\n\n\u201cThese devastating bloodstream infections don\u2019t need to happen,\u201d says Patricia Stone, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN, the Centennial Professor of Health Policy in Nursing at Columbia University School of Nursing. Stone contributed to the best-practice guidelines issued by the Joint Commission and has published extensive research on the prevention of bloodstream infections.\n\n\u201cNurses are on the front lines and can take advantage of their constant contact with patients and other caregivers to explain infection control techniques and help health facilities develop and enforce standards of care that have been proven effective against CLABSI,\u201d she says.\n\nCatheters deliver life-saving medicines and nutrients to some of the most vulnerable patients \u2013 including premature babies in intensive care units, adults recovering from major trauma and surgery, and frail elderly patients in long-term care settings. Without proper insertion, utilization, and maintenance, catheters can also transmit deadly infections to the bloodstream.\n\nNurses, using their infection control training, play a vital role in creating a culture of patient safety, Stone says. They often help organize and implement effective prevention techniques including catheter insertion checklists, regular replacement of dressings, and proper handwashing techniques. With their background in education, nurses have the knowledge to inform patients and colleagues about evidence-based practices to reduce CLABSI.\n\nEach year in the U.S., there are an estimated 100,000 deaths from healthcare-associated infections, and one third of the fatalities are from CLABSI, according to the Joint Commission.\n\nHealthcare-associated infections create approximately $33 billion in excess medical costs for U.S. hospitals every year, yet it isn\u2019t clear how to ensure that best-practices for prevention are followed, Stone found in a review of programs in place at acute-care hospitals that was presented earlier this year at IDWeek, a conference dedicated to research in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and epidemiology of infectious disease. While most hospitals have infection prevention policies, adherence can be haphazard, putting patients at risk, Stone found.\n\n\u201cThese infections drive up healthcare costs, wasting resources that could be spent meeting so many other patient needs,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThe Joint Commission\u2019s guidelines underscore the value of investing in nurses and making sure caregivers at the bedside have all the resources they need to keep patients safe.\u201d\n\nSource: Columbia University School of Nursing\n\n", "article_metadata": {"vpi-date": "2013-12-03", "description": "Nurses are well positioned to stop dangerous and costly bloodstream infections caused by the improper placement of catheters in large veins in the neck,", "og": {"url": "http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2013/12/guidelines-highlight-importance-of-nurses-in-preventing-bloodstream-infections.aspx", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Nurses are well positioned to stop dangerous and costly bloodstream infections caused by the improper placement of catheters in large veins in the neck,", "title": "Guidelines Highlight Importance of Nurses in Preventing Bloodstream Infections"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ICT_magazine", "description": "Nurses are well positioned to stop dangerous and costly bloodstream infections caused by the improper placement of catheters in large veins in the neck, chest or groin, according to guidelines", "card": "summary", "title": "Guidelines Highlight Importance of Nurses in Preventing Bloodstream In"}, "DC.date": "2013-12-03", "google-site-verification": "fhACDHu0y1VRuJn2Kl-av9ETvTB9CzlLpR66C8YSLQY", "keywords": "bloodstream infections, Joint Commission, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), Patricia Stone", "site_name": "Infection Control Today", "verify-v1": "Cttvcxv1MIeEwmvkSyjObGtyI++pWRbmbaPFysXm+1s=", "y_key": "ead0b0ebf297bedc"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1210\"", "article_summary": "Stone contributed to the best-practice guidelines issued by the Joint Commission and has published extensive research on the prevention of bloodstream infections.\nCentral line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) needlessly afflict thousands of patients each year, lengthening hospital stays, boosting hospital readmission rates, and driving up the cost of care.\nThey often help organize and implement effective prevention techniques including catheter insertion checklists, regular replacement of dressings, and proper handwashing techniques.\n\u201cThese devastating bloodstream infections don\u2019t need to happen,\u201d says Patricia Stone, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN, the Centennial Professor of Health Policy in Nursing at Columbia University School of Nursing.\n\u201cThese infections drive up healthcare costs, wasting resources that could be spent meeting so many other patient needs,\u201d Stone says."}
