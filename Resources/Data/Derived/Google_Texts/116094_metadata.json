I worked with both of them. Michael dated her while she worked for me. It\u2019s a small world.\u201d\n\nSentenced to life in prison, Branham lived seven more years. Although it appeared he died of natural causes, a medical examiner will determine his exact cause of death, said spokeswoman Jessica Cary.\n\nAlthough he fired 13 times at close range, his defense was that she was approaching with a pair of scissors.\n\nAfter a 10-day trial in September 2007, Hardee County jurors decided in 30 minutes that Branham was guilty of first-degree murder.\n\nTheir decision was painful and joyous for Janette\u2019s mother, Kathy Seamans. \u201cI want to thank (Michael Branham) for the joy he brought to our family when he first met (Janette). \u201cI have forgiven him. I speak only for myself, and I do so, so that our hearts will not live in the black hell that his has. It doesn\u2019t mean I like him, or want to have anything to do with him.\u201d\n\nBranham, a former Avon Park police officer who weighed 394 pounds and was shackled in a wheelchair, showed no emotion as the jury\u2019s verdict was read.\n\nAfter the murder trial, her parents sued Branham in Highlands County Circuit Court. Judge Olin Shinholser awarded them more than $7 million in damages, ruling that Branham intentionally pursued his wife\u2019s death.\n\nWiltgen said Branham abused Janette and that the domestic violence became too much for their marriage. \u201cShe loved her husband in the week prior to her death. But she couldn\u2019t live with him anymore.\n\n\u201c(Janette) is free forever and \u2018Tiny,\u2019 you are not,\u201d Patty Seamans, Janette\u2019s sister-in-law, used his nickname.\n\n\u201cMichael Branham shot that gun 13 times and he hit his target 13 times,\u201d said Assistant State Attorney Steve Houchin. \u201cThirteen was important to the defendant. It\u2019s spooky, it was a theme to him. He was counting his shots as he was pulling that trigger. How poetic, (Janette) was going to leave after 13 years of marriage.\u201d\n\nJanette Branham, who lived in Hardee County, was a well-known and well-liked attorney. A former 10th Judicial Circuit prosecutor, she had gone into criminal defense practice in Avon Park and advocated for children. Attorneys have established an annual scholarship in her name.\n\ngpinnell@highlandstoday.com\n\n863-386-5828", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 19 Jul 2014 18:23:40 -0400", "Description": "SEBRING \u2014 Convicted murderer Michael Branham died July 10 at Dade Correctional Institution, a Florida Department of Corrections official has confirmed.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "SEBRING \u2014 Convicted murderer Michael Branham died July 10 at Dade Correctional Institution, a Florida Department of Corrections official has confirmed.", "title": "Convicted killer of Highlands County lawyer dies in prison", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/convicted-killer-of-highlands-county-lawyer-dies-in-prison-20140719/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140719/ARTICLE/140719237/AR/0/AR-140719237.jpg", "height": 2882}, "updated_time": "2014-07-19T18:33:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "SEBRING \u2014 Convicted murderer Michael Branham died July 10 at Dade Correctional Institution, a Florida Department of Corrections official has confirmed.", "title": "Convicted killer of Highlands County lawyer dies in prison", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140719/ARTICLE/140719237/AR/0/AR-140719237.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-19T18:23:40Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T18:33:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcedd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMichael Branham shot that gun 13 times and he hit his target 13 times,\u201d said Assistant State Attorney Steve Houchin.\n\u2014 Convicted murderer Michael Branham died July 10 at Dade Correctional Institution, a Florida Department of Corrections official has confirmed.\nA former 10th Judicial Circuit prosecutor, she had gone into criminal defense practice in Avon Park and advocated for children.\nAlthough he fired 13 times at close range, his defense was that she was approaching with a pair of scissors.\nBranham, a retired Avon Park Police officer, was accused of shooting his wife, Janette, 40, a prominent Highlands County attorney, in July 2005."}
