At a glance: Total spending on health and human services rises to $36 billion, up from $32.1 billion. Much of the spending involves federal funds. The state-funded share is $11.9 billion, up from $10.5 billion last year. The funding is spent through the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, formerly the Department of Public Welfare. It's the largest single slice of the budget, and includes funding for things such as financial assistance, health care for people with lower incomes, long-term care for seniors and the disabled, and drug and alcohol programs.

What it means: Much of the increase in state spending involves expanded services for seniors and people with intellectual disabilities. The proposed budget would, among other things, expand home- and community-based supports for seniors, which would result in more than half of seniors receiving long-term care getting it in their home or community rather than a nursing home. The proposed budget states that each person served outside a nursing home saves the state $2,457 per month.

The proposed budget also includes an extra $19 million to reduce the waiting list and expand services for people with intellectual disabilities, and nearly $13 million to continue a previous expansion.

The budget includes undoing former Gov. Tom Corbett's version of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. As federal approval is obtained, Gov. Wolf plans to gradually return many people to a one-benefit package, while doing away with a "low-risk" option created by Corbett. Wolf says his version will streamline benefits and save the state $500 million. It should be kept in mind the federal government is still paying 100 percent of the cost of the expansion, with the federal share dropping to 95 percent in 2017 and to 90 percent by 2020 and thereafter.

The budget includes $7.5 million in new funding to help address the heroin and prescription drug addiction crisis.
