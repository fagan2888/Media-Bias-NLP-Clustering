Obama ended up apologizing for the lie in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd in November 2013, even if he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to admit that it was a lie. \u201cWe weren\u2019t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place,\u201d was as far as Obama\u2019s contrition went.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for Huge Obamacare Premium Hikes in 2017\n\nAlmost three years later, there is little evidence of any more contrition on that failure, or others in Obamacare for that matter. Earlier this week , Charlie Rose interviewed three former Obama speechwriters on a variety of topics. After discussing their work on lighter-topic speeches, Rose asked whether they felt they had an impact on Obama\u2019s more serious addresses. Jon Lovett replied that he felt most proud of his impact on \u201cthe most serious speeches \u2013 health care, economic speeches.\u201d\n\nThat prompted his colleague, Jon Favreau, to interject. \u201cLovett wrote the line about \u2018if you like your insurance, you can keep it,\u201d he said, as the panel erupted in laughter. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d Lovett shot back in mock indignation. \u201cAnd you know what?\u201d he asked as the laughter continued. \u201cIt\u2019s still true \u2026 no.\u201d\n\nAre incompetence and deceit humorous? Perhaps in the Obama administration, the answer might be yes. For the rest of us, especially those who find themselves stuck between a federal tax mandate and an insurance market that has narrowed as significantly as its costs have skyrocketed, no is the correct answer.\n\nIn fact, those two dynamics continue to this day, despite promises that the ACA markets would stabilize after the first two or three years and would eventually \u201cbend the cost curve downward.\u201d Consumers have their plans cut out from underneath them each year as insurers have either pared back plans or exited exchanges altogether as Obamacare\u2019s economic model continues to fail. At the same time, premiums and deductibles have continued to skyrocket, and tax subsidies cannot hide the impact on families.\n\nWhat was promised as more \u201cchoice\u201d is becoming fewer choices as UnitedHealthcare and now Humana begin to pull out of certain regions. An AP story in 2014 reported that of the 19 nationally recognized cancer centers that responded to a survey, only 4 reported access through all Obamacare insurers. Last month, Blue Cross Blue Shield released a report warning that costs under the president\u2019s plan are unsustainable \u2013 fully 22 percent higher than people covered by employers. And The Hill reported that Obamacare insurers lost money in 41 states in 2014, which could determine whether big companies like Aetna stick with it.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Is Wide Open to Fraud \u2013 and They\u2019re Not Going to Fix It\n\nAs the fourth year of Obamacare approaches, Politico\u2019s Paul Demko reports that consumers can expect more of the same price hikes and narrowed choices as they have seen the first three years. The Obama administration insists that prices only rose eight percent for 2016 over the previous year \u2013 even though that itself is still more than three times the rate of inflation, and ignores states like Minnesota where the average premium increase was over 30 percent.\n\n\u201cThere are reasons to think the next round may be different,\u201d Demko warns. He quotes a Deloitte executive who agrees. \u201cA number of carriers need double-digit increases\u201d for 2017. Those price increases will hit the Obamacare exchanges on November 1st, one week before voters elect a new President and Congress.\n\nKaiser Health News reports that 2017, far from being the year that stabilizes the Obamacare exchanges, will be another \u201cadjustment year\u201d for the risk pools. Even the director of Covered California expects to see higher rate increases in the fourth year of Obamacare than previously seen, although Peter Lee shrugs off the risk for his own exchange. \u201cThere are a number of reasons 2017 will have higher rate increases than the last few years,\u201d Lee tells KHN. \u201cBut we believe in California we won\u2019t see the significant headwinds many other states are experiencing.\u201d However, Lee would not answer when KHN asked if UnitedHealth Group had applied to participate in Covered California for 2017.\n\nRelated: More Bad News for the Remaining Obamacare Co-ops\n\nThis brings us back to the ability to keep one\u2019s plan. UnitedHealth has made clear its intentions to exit most of the state Obamacare markets next year, and California may well be one of them. A more troubling exit looms on the horizon \u2013 the exit of all insurers from the lowest-cost bronze plans.\n\nOne BlueCross BlueShield subsidiary in Virginia has already filed plans to get out of the bronze plan, according to Inside Health Policy, and other insurers will follow suit if BCBS succeeds. That will destabilize the markets further, as one analyst told Leslie Small at Fierce Health Payer, because most of the younger and healthier participants in these risk pools have chosen bronze plans \u2013 and would likely bail out rather than pay higher premiums for insurance that they hardly ever use. However, that will force others who wish to comply with the mandate to once again lose their plans, and force them into finding other, more expensive coverage.\n\nIn other words, if consumers like their third different plan in three years, many of them won\u2019t be able to keep that one, either. Needless to say, they won\u2019t be laughing. Perhaps they will be voting instead.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Remember the now-infamous promise made by President Barack Obama when pushing the Affo", "title": "Obamacare: Costs Go Up, Insurers Drop Out and Consumers Get Screwed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/05/12/Obamacare-Costs-Go-Insurers-Drop-Out-and-Consumers-Get-Screwed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-09-21T191236Z_1_CBRE98K1HDF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-HEALTHCARE-COURT-RULING-OBAMA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/05/12/Obamacare-Costs-Go-Insurers-Drop-Out-and-Consumers-Get-Screwed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-09-21T191236Z_1_CBRE98K1HDF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-HEALTHCARE-COURT-RULING-OBAMA.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Remember the now-infamous promise made by President Barack Obama when pushing the Affo", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3194\"", "article_summary": "And The Hill reported that Obamacare insurers lost money in 41 states in 2014, which could determine whether big companies like Aetna stick with it.\nAn AP story in 2014 reported that of the 19 nationally recognized cancer centers that responded to a survey, only 4 reported access through all Obamacare insurers.\nRemember the now-infamous promise made by President Barack Obama when pushing the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare?\nThose price increases will hit the Obamacare exchanges on November 1st, one week before voters elect a new President and Congress.\nRelated: More Bad News for the Remaining Obamacare Co-opsThis brings us back to the ability to keep one\u2019s plan."}
