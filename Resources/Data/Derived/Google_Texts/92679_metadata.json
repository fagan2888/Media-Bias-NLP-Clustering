Most of those funds remain missing.\n\nThe police believe that both the bank and SWIFT should take the blame for the oversight, Alam said in an interview.\n\n\"It was their responsibility to point it out but we haven't found any evidence that they advised before the heist,\" he said, referring to SWIFT.\n\nA spokeswoman for Brussels-based SWIFT declined comment.\n\nSWIFT has previously said the attack was related to an internal operational issue at Bangladesh Bank and that SWIFT's core messaging services were not compromised.\n\nA spokesman for Bangladesh Bank said SWIFT officials advised the bank to upgrade the switches only when their system engineers from Malaysia visited after the heist.\n\n\"There might have been a deficiency in the system in the SWIFT room,\" said the spokesman, Subhankar Saha, confirming that the switch was old and needed to be upgraded.\n\n\"Two (SWIFT) engineers came and visited the bank after the heist and suggested to upgrade the system,\" Saha said.\n\nGLOBAL WHODUNIT\n\nThe heist's masterminds have yet to be identified.\n\nBangladesh police said earlier this week they had identified 20 foreigners involved in the heist but they appear to be people who received some of the payments, rather than those who initially stole the money.\n\nBangladesh Bank has about 5,000 computers used by officials in different departments, Alam said.\n\nThe SWIFT room is roughly 12 feet by 8 feet, a window-less office located on the eight floor of the bank's annex building in Dhaka. There are four servers and four monitors in the room.\n\nAll transactions from the previous day are automatically printed on a printer in the room.\n\nThe SWIFT facility should have been walled off from the rest of the network. That could have been done if the bank had used the more expensive, \"managed\" switches, which allow engineers to create separate networks, said Alam, whose institute includes a cyber-crime division.\n\nMoreover, considering the importance of the room, the bank should have deployed staff to monitor activity round the clock, including weekends and holidays, he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in BOSTON; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Alan Crosby)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's central bank was vulnerable to hackers because it did n", "title": "Bangladesh Bank exposed to hackers by cheap switches, no firewall: police", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Bangladesh-Bank-exposed-hackers-cheap-switches-no-firewall-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed-bangladesh_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Bangladesh-Bank-exposed-hackers-cheap-switches-no-firewall-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed-bangladesh_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's central bank was vulnerable to hackers because it did n", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A spokesman for Bangladesh Bank said SWIFT officials advised the bank to upgrade the switches only when their system engineers from Malaysia visited after the heist.\nPOLICE BLAME BANK, SWIFTCyber criminals broke into Bangladesh Bank's system and in early February tried to make fraudulent transfers totaling $951 million from its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nSWIFT has previously said the attack was related to an internal operational issue at Bangladesh Bank and that SWIFT's core messaging services were not compromised.\nExperts in bank security said that the findings described by Alam were disturbing.\nBangladesh Bank has about 5,000 computers used by officials in different departments, Alam said."}
