WASHINGTON (AP) - You may be strong with the Force, but you still need health insurance.

That’s the message the District of Columbia’s health insurance exchange hopes to send to moviegoers this weekend.

DC Health Link will have representatives stationed at the Regal Gallery Place Stadium 14 theater in downtown Washington starting Friday afternoon. They’re hoping to sign people up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act before or after showings of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

The goal of the promotion is to reach the young adult population, which studies show is the group most likely not to have health insurance.

DC Health Link will also run advertisements inside the theaters and at the concession stands.
