Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, secured approval of his proposal to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid system, MaineCare, by using federal funds to buy private insurance for the state\u2019s poorest residents.\n\nSaviello was joined by only two of his Republican colleagues, as well as the entire caucus of minority Democrats, who agreed for the sixth time in three years that Maine should expand state- and federally funded medical insurance programs under the federal Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.\n\nGOP members joining Saviello to support expansion were Sen. Roger Katz, R-Augusta, and Sen. David Woodsome, R-North Waterboro.\n\nSaviello\u2019s victory is bittersweet for supporters of expansion, which is likely to pass in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives later this week to encounter an all-but-certain veto by Maine\u2019s Republican Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nLePage has five times successfully vetoed bills to expand the health care program largely with the support of his Republican allies in the Legislature.\n\nSaviello hoped for more Republican support in the Senate, especially from rural lawmakers or those in Senate districts with large hospitals or facing the ravages of the state\u2019s heroin epidemic.\n\nDuring his floor speech, Saviello shared his opinion about why Maine should take advantage of a federal matching rate that provides $9 for health care for every $1 the state spends on coverage.\n\n\u201cSome have called my mission insanity,\u201d Saviello said in reference to his support of the five previous unsuccessful attempts to expand Medicaid. \u201cBecause this is repeating over and over again past mistakes.\u201d\n\nBut Saviello said voting against expanded health care for Mainers and their families, along with the federal support that came with it, was the real insanity.\n\n\u201cYou will say no to our dollars coming back to our state to help the less fortunate and working poor,\u201d Saviello said. \u201cYou will be saying no to the millions of dollars to help the drug addicted get treatment. You will be saying no to mental health care. You will be saying no to preventative medicine.\u201d\n\nAnd unlike with previous expansion efforts in Maine, Saviello highlighted how the state\u2019s law enforcement leaders, including the Maine Chiefs of Police Association and the Maine Sheriffs Association, supported this effort, largely to remove those with drug addictions and mental health issues from the state\u2019s jails.\n\nHe said those rejecting the expansion were \u201creaffirming the use of our law enforcement personnel as our doctors and nurses in the treatment of heroin addiction.\u201d\n\nSupporters estimate an expansion also would create an estimated 3,000 jobs.\n\nBut lawmakers opposing the expansion said Maine had a clear track record from previous expansions of Medicaid in 2001 and again in 2003 that left the state owing its hospitals $450 million for the care they provided under the program.\n\n\u201cWe have only just in the last few years begun digging ourselves out of that hole,\u201d Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, said. \u201cBut now many would like to see us embark on that path again. It risks putting our state in an untenable financial position yet another time.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Volk, R-Scarborough, also spoke in opposition to the expansion, noting the state\u2019s previous Medicaid debt as well.\n\n\u201cMaine is already doing a lot of what\u2019s covered in this legislation,\u201d Volk said. \u201cIs it perfect? No. But within the confines of the Affordable Care Act, Maine is on far more stable ground than other states that have expanded Medicaid.\u201d\n\nVolk said the state should learn from its past experience in trying to expand Medicaid when thousands more joined the program than were projected.\n\nSen. Anne Haskell, D-Portland, said a provision in Saviello\u2019s bill that sunsets the expansion in 2020 if the next Legislature decided not to continue the program and one that allows the state to leave the program if the federal matching rate were reduced amounted to a \u201cbelt and suspenders\u201d approach to protecting Maine\u2019s taxpayers.\n\nSaviello said economic arguments against expansion ultimately would have to be weighed against the moral ones for providing people with health care coverage.\n\nQuoting Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who supported Medicaid expansion in his state, Saviello alluded to a question St. Peter would ask lawmakers who hoped to get into heaven.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably not going ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. He\u2019s going to ask you what you did for the poor \u2014 and you better have a good answer,\u201d Saviello said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By a single vote Tuesday night, Sen.
