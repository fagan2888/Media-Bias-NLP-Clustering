Arlington, Va.-based Evolent Health, the developers of a health care data platform that ties together electronic medical records and billed services to create more efficient doctor’s visits, has filed for a $100 million IPO under the NYSE ticker symbol EVH, according to a regulatory filing.

Evolent was early to aligning itself with the medical record organization goals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The company’s proprietary technology, called Identifi, gathers data across multiple healthcare business entities before then aggregating, analyzing and effectively illustrating it in a way that doctors are able to make use of.

J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are serving as co-lead underwriters for the process. In September 2013, the company raised a $100 million venture capital round at an unprecedented early stage — only its second financial raise — investors included, District-based The Advisory Board, UPMC Health Plan and private equity firm, TPG Growth, VentureBeat reported.

Evolent's chief executive Frank Williams also served as vice chairman and CEO at The Advisory Board.

The company reported a $52.3 million net loss on $100.9 million in revenue for 2014.

In a December 2014 interview with the WBJ, Williams said, “We'll probably be in 35 markets nationally by next year, so the map nationally is beginning to be filled up. You can see this vision of the national network. We'll be over $100 million in revenues this year [up from $40 million last year] and growing very rapidly so, really, we're building a financial base for the business. And we're seeing such high demand that we'll be looking for creative ways we can continue to build the platform. We ultimately want to be the market leader.”

In 2014, Evolent Health was named the #12 most promising company in America by Forbes Magazine.
