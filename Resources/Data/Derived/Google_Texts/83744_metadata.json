Pelosi's play for women\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is trying to make the midterm elections all about women.\n\nArmed with Democratic polling, the California Democrat has for months been touting a \u201cwomen\u2019s economic agenda\u201d in more than two dozen events across the country, with more planned soon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe agenda is \u201cgood politics if it changes the minds [of] our colleagues,\u201d Pelosi told POLITICO in an interview. \u201cWhat are elections about? To raise the awareness of issues.\u201d\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Nancy Pelosi?)\n\nThe strategy is aimed squarely at a demographic Democrats need to win: women \u2014 especially single women who tend to vote for them, and who often stay home during midterm elections. Getting women to the ballot box in higher numbers may be the only hope for Pelosi, who last wielded the speaker\u2019s gavel in 2010, and who most political observers believe is a long shot \u2014 at the very best \u2014 in 2014 to reclaim it.\n\nIn a bid to win the House majority and retain the Senate, national Democrats seem intent on remaking the midterm electorate to resemble the one that came out to support President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Traditionally, turnout in midterm elections has declined steeply.\n\nObservers say it\u2019s an uphill slog for congressional Democrats, who would need to reverse a historical trend going back to 1832 \u2014 Andrew Jackson was president \u2014 as the last time the midterms saw more voters than a presidential contest.\n\n( PHOTOS: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s career)\n\n\u201cHistory is against them,\u201d said Michael McDonald, associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University who has studied turnout trends. \u201cYou can never say never \u2026 but I think the evidence is still against the Democrats on this.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question the Democratic agenda is an extension of the \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative that Democrats have been using to slam Republicans, quite effectively, in recent elections. But now, it\u2019s been broadened to include economic issues that Democrats argue Republicans have been ignoring.\n\nAs House Democrats start their annual retreat on Wednesday in Cambridge, Md., Pelosi argues that they should focus intensely on issues of pay equity, preventing women from being fired or demoted while pregnant or on maternity leave, and extending scholarships for single women who want to further their education. The retreat will include a presentation titled \u201cUnmarried Women: They Will Elect You if You Get it Right,\u201d led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).\n\n( WATCH: Nancy Pelosi and her daughter at 'Women Rule' event)\n\nIn an interview, Pelosi insisted she is more interested in passing legislation than winning elections. Yet Pelosi also knows that turning out women is critical to any chance of winning in swing districts this year, including in New York, New Jersey, California and New Mexico. The Voter Participation Center, which seeks to increase the number of unmarried women voters, estimates that 22 million fewer female, minority and young voters will go to the polls this year than in 2012, a staggering drop-off. One-third of those will be unmarried women, the VPC suggests.\n\n\u201cI say it all the time \u2014 we\u2019d rather [Republicans] pass a minimum wage and pay-equity act and consider that our victory,\u201d Pelosi added. \u201cIf they would just listen and not have it be invisible to them, which it is right now \u2026 then we believe we can change some of the votes here.\u201d\n\nPelosi is convinced that these issues would pass the House easily if Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) simply allowed them to get a vote.\n\n( WATCH: O'Reilly reporter confronts Pelosi)\n\n\u201cWe know that we would pass a minimum wage [increase] if it were allowed to come to the floor. We would,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe know that we would pass universal pre-K, if we could get it to the floor.\u201d\n\nPelosi has done more than two dozen events across the country to talk up her six-part agenda, with more planned soon. And rank-and-file House Democrats, including some male Democrats facing women challengers, are playing it up as well, hoping to exploit the \u201cgender gap\u201d between the GOP and Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis economic agenda not only unites our party and motivates our base, it contrasts our fight for the middle class with Republicans\u2019 reckless and irresponsible agenda that robs women of their health care rights and ignores their struggle for equal pay,\u201d said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel.\n\nSlammed by pro-Republican outside groups, Senate Democrats are focusing on mobilizing women, younger voters and minority groups. Obama got huge applause from House Democrats when he mentioned pay equity for women as part of his State of the Union address, and the Labor Department has launched its own women\u2019s agenda, focusing heavily on a minimum wage boost.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, aren\u2019t convinced the tactics being employed by Pelosi or other Democratic leaders will have any benefit come Election Day. GOP leaders look at the polling on Obamacare, as well as Obama\u2019s own weakness on economic issues, and the traditional \u201csix-year itch\u201d facing incumbent presidents, and they see a big opportunity to expand their majority.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a defensive maneuver by Democrats since they are losing support from women who are feeling firsthand the devastating effects of Obamacare,\u201d said Liesl Hickey, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nYet House Republicans can read the polls too, and they know they\u2019ve got a problem with women. POLITICO reported in early December, the leadership has begun efforts to teach the GOP rank and file how to speak to women voters. The NRCC has held similar events for both incumbents and challengers.\n\nThe NRCC also has recruited a record number of female candidates this election cycle. Currently, there are at least 14 Republican women running in competitive races this year, according to NRCC officials.\n\nA December memo from Democracy Corps, Women\u2019s Voices Women Vote Action Fund and VPC argued that highlighting positions such as raising the minimum wage and other pocketbook issues are key to driving up support among women for Democrats.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Kourtney Geers @ 02/13/2014 09:32 AM Correction: The Voter Participation Center estimates that 22 million fewer female, minority and young voters will go to the polls in 2014, not 30 million as was originally reported.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The agenda is \u201cgood politics if it changes the minds [of] our colleagues,\u201d she tells POLITICO.", "title": "Pelosi's play for women", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/nancy-pelosi-women-103405.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/23/131023_nancy_pelosi_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Women,Democrats,Nancy Pelosi,2014 Elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The agenda is \u201cgood politics if it changes the minds [of] our colleagues,\u201d she tells POLITICO.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0084\"", "article_summary": "Pelosi's play for womenHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is trying to make the midterm elections all about women.\nPOLITICO reported in early December, the leadership has begun efforts to teach the GOP rank and file how to speak to women voters.\nYet House Republicans can read the polls too, and they know they\u2019ve got a problem with women.\nAnd rank-and-file House Democrats, including some male Democrats facing women challengers, are playing it up as well, hoping to exploit the \u201cgender gap\u201d between the GOP and Democrats.\nThe strategy is aimed squarely at a demographic Democrats need to win: women \u2014 especially single women who tend to vote for them, and who often stay home during midterm elections."}
