Now that it\u2019s shut down forever, she has finally turned into the person who leaves thousand-word rambling rants on your Facebook wall that make exactly zero sense.\n\nPalin is about as original as she is smart, which is why her latest, perhaps craziest, Facebook rant is about \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 death panels.\n\nYou see, President Obama is still pushing a plan that got cut from the Affordable Care Act to reimburse doctors who discuss end-of-life care with their patients. This has nothing to do with death panels and everything to do with doctors helping people make some of the most important decisions of their lives.\n\nBut Sarah Palin doesn\u2019t care if you get to choose whether an ER doctor breaks your ribs in a fruitful attempt to give you a few more hours of life or whether you die peacefully at home surrounded by your family. She cares about being a demagogue, and worst of all, she isn\u2019t even any good at it. Just look at some of the nonsense she\u2019s spewing:\n\nRemember when coining \u201cdeath panel\u201d I focused on the dangers of rationing healthcare services \u2013 as it\u2019s the inevitable result of any government takeover of healthcare.\n\nThat\u2019s three made-up nonsense conspiracies in one sentence!\n\nMedia coverage of my position on this is skewed; as usual they got it wrong. I\u2019m calling you out, L.A. Times. You underestimate the wisdom of the people with your claim that I\u2019m \u201cdiscredited.\u201d\n\nI\u2019M NOT DISCREDITED. YOU\u2019RE DISCREDITED. THE WHOLE DANG SYSTEM IS DISCREDITED.\n\nI\u2019m so angry at democrat and republican politicians who just rolled their eyes when I, and many others, rose up with warnings that each step forward taken by champions of this socialist program would jerk back two steps from every free American and our God-given rights.\n\nI just\u2026 at what point do we start seriously suggesting that Sarah Palin seek some help?\n\nIf you feel like it, read the whole thing. But I can\u2019t promise that it won\u2019t somehow hypnotize you into joining the Palin cult. On the other hand, if she could do that, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have had to cancel her Internet channel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It seems Sarah Palin's $99/year Internet channel was the last thread clinging to any shred of her sanity.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "It seems Sarah Palin's $99/year Internet channel was the last thread clinging to any shred of her sanity.", "title": "Sarah Palin Is Totally Freaking Out", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/palin-freakout.png", "updated_time": "2015-07-13T10:10:02-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/sarah-palin-is-totally-freaking-out/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "It seems Sarah Palin's $99/year Internet channel was the last thread clinging to any shred of her sanity.", "title": "Sarah Palin Is Totally Freaking Out", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/palin-freakout.png"}, "creator": "@jesseberney", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "affordable care act,obamacare,Sarah Palin", "published_time": "2015-07-09T23:06:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-13T10:10:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9eb7\"", "article_summary": "I just\u2026 at what point do we start seriously suggesting that Sarah Palin seek some help?\nYou underestimate the wisdom of the people with your claim that I\u2019m \u201cdiscredited.\u201dI\u2019M NOT DISCREDITED.\nIt seems Sarah Palin\u2019s $99/year Internet channel was the last thread clinging to any shred of her sanity.\nBut Sarah Palin doesn\u2019t care if you get to choose whether an ER doctor breaks your ribs in a fruitful attempt to give you a few more hours of life or whether you die peacefully at home surrounded by your family.\nPalin is about as original as she is smart, which is why her latest, perhaps craziest, Facebook rant is about \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 death panels."}
