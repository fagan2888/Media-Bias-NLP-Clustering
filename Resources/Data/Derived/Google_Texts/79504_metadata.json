The gunman killed a movie director at the meeting, and later shot up a synagogue, killing a young Jewish man.\n\n\u201cThe United States condemns today\u2019s deplorable shooting in Copenhagen,\u201d said the short, four-line, three-sentence statement from the White House. \u201cWe offer our condolences\u2026 [and] stand ready to lend any assistance necessary to the investigation,\u201d said the brief statement.\n\nObama\u2019s next statement came Sunday evening, after a group of Muslims beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in neighboring Libya.\n\nObama denounced \u201cthe despicable and cowardly murder of twenty-one Egyptian citizens in Libya by ISIL-affiliated terrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cISIL\u2019s barbarity knows no bounds\u2026 This wanton killing of innocents is just the most recent of the many vicious acts\u2026 including the murders of dozens of Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai,\u201d said the statement about the Muslim religious murders in Libya.\n\nBut Obama downplayed the killer\u2019s Islamic justification for the murders in Libya and Denmark, and the promise of more attacks against Christians.\n\n\u201cISIL\u2019s barbarity knows no bounds. It is unconstrained by faith, sect, or ethnicity,\u201d he said.\n\nObama also ignored the motivation for the Copenhagen killings, but merely said they were \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Obama quickly suggested that the North Carolina killings of the three Muslims were motivated by anti-Muslim attitudes, despite the initial evidence that the killings were prompted by the unemployed killer\u2019s anger over a parking dispute.\n\n\u201cNo one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,\u201d said Obama\u2019s statement.\n\nThe unproven suggestion of anti-Islamic purpose will likely bind Islamic leaders to Obama\u2019s progressive coalition, and expand the social and cultural divide between Americans and the rapidly increasing population of Muslim immigrants.\n\nThe immigrant U.S. Muslim population has grown by roughly 1 million since 2000, up to almost 2.7 million in 2013. The population has grown because the federal government has given work-permits to many devout preachers from Muslim countries, and is offering residency to many migrants from chaotic Muslim countries, such as Somalia and Syria.\n\nThe leaders of Muslim groups in the United States are working with Obama\u2019s deputies to help keep Muslim youths and communities divided from U.S. culture. For example, Muslim clerics \u201cand counselors need to be given some leeway\u201d by police when they hear of Muslim terror plots, said Suhaib Webb, the senior cleric at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, at a May, 2013 event at the Center for American Progress.\n\nObama\u2019s prior statements have already helped exacerbate the deep cultural divide between Americans and Muslims in America.\n\nOn Feb. 5, a week before the North Carolina murders, Obama met with a group of immigrant Muslim political leaders to ask for their political support. The president \u201cencouraged the [Muslim] participants to remain civically engaged in their communities, and told them that he looked forward to seeking additional opportunities to continue the discussion of these and other issues,\u201d said a White House statement released after the meeting.\n\nThe day after the Feb. 5 White House meeting, Obama sparked a public dispute that pitted Christians against his alliance of progressives and Islamic advocates. He used a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast to place peaceful modern Christianity and combative Islam on the same moral level, by equating Christian violence in the Crusades 1,000 years ago with Muslim violence since the 1980s.\n\nThe three weekend statements also showed how Obama is trying to distance himself from his deputies who have described a \u201cbroader failure of policy\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nObama\u2019s Sunday statement about the mass murder in Libya downplayed the White House\u2019s admission that the Islamic State has expanded from northern Syria, and has established a foothold in Libya.\n\nLibya has been in a state of nature, without a strong government or social peace, since Obama\u2019s decision in 2010 to depose Libya\u2019s dictator without deploying any U.S. troops to help establish a peaceful state.\n\n\u201cThis heinous act once again underscores the urgent need for a political resolution to the conflict in Libya,\u201d said Obama\u2019s Feb. 15 statement.\n\nObama did not offer aid to the Egyptian government.\n\nEgypt\u2019s government came to power in 2013, when it overthrew a Muslim Brotherhood government that was backed by Obama.\n\nInstead, the Feb. 15 statement on the Libyan beheadings only offered aid to officials in the United Nations who are trying to persuade Libya\u2019s rival Islamic and tribal groups to negotiate a peace deal.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Libyans to strongly reject this and all acts of terrorism and to unite in the face of this shared and growing threat [and] we continue to strongly support the efforts of the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bernardino Leon to facilitate formation of a national unity government and help foster a political solution in Libya,\u201d said the statement.\n\nIn contrast, Obama\u2019s deputies at the FBI and in the Justice Department are jumping into a local police investigation to see if the North Carolina murderer was harboring anti-Muslim attitudes that would justify federal \u201chate crimes\u201d charges.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is taking steps to determine whether federal laws were violated,\u201d said his Feb. 13 statement.\n\nThe Justice Department also released a 16-line statement about the North Carolina murders: \u201cI was shocked and saddened by this week\u2019s heinous murders of three young people\u2026 we pledge to stand with the families of these three remarkable young people \u2013 and with all whose lives were touched by this tragedy \u2013 as they begin the long road to healing,\u201d said the statement by Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nPolice officials in North Carolina say they are conducting a complete investigation of the killings.\n\n\u201cWe understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,\u201d said Chapel Hill police chief Chris Blue.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Obama?
