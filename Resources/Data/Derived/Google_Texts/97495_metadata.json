Now the process is in place in 70 clinical areas in eight of UPMC's 20 hospitals, according to Greenhouse. More than 30 other hospitals also use the program, she said.\n\nThe methodology strives to view the healthcare experience through the eyes of the patient. To that end, PFCC working groups include everyone from clinicians to parking attendants, Greenhouse said.\n\nThe program places heavy emphasis on shadowing the patient experience. Here, observers--be they medical students, new hires in the midst of orientation or middle managers--take in objective and subjective details and bring them back to the working group. The observation process, Greenhouse said, \"creates empathy, which leads to inssight ... and an urgency to create change for those who are doing it.\"\n\nChanges initiated by the PFCC range from small (universal phone chargers in intensive care unit family waiting areas) to large (restructuring UPMC's Level 1 trauma teams), Greenhouse said.\n\nEngage clinicians to engage patients\n\nAll that said, the patient experience won't improve if clinical staff don't buy into the patient engagement process. Making that happens requires a bit of a balancing act, said Boissy.\n\nPhysicians need to understand their role in building a relationship with patients, Boissy said. When patients don't give the Cleveland Clinic a patient satisfaction score of \"9\" or \"10,\" she said, it's often because they weren't treated with respected or given enough information.\n\nAt the same time, physicians need to come to that understanding in a \"safe, comfortable place,\" Boissy said--one mindful of the fact that, while nurses receive regular feedback and training in bedside manner, physicians do not. As you work to engage physicians, be mindful of your institution's larger culture, she said.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nConsumer-driven healthcare: How three organizations respond to the demands of patient-centered care\n\nAdvisory councils help hospitals boost patient engagement, satisfaction\n\nPatient, consumer engagement only begins road to empowerment\n\n8 hospital actions for stronger patient engagement\n\n5 pieces of the care coordination puzzle", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pamela Greenhouse, executive director of the Patient and Family Care Center Innovation Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Adrienne Boissy, M.D., chief experience officer and director of the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Excellence in Healthcare Communication describe the personal approaches their organizations take to pro", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Pamela Greenhouse, executive director of the Patient and Family Care Center Innovation Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Adrienne Boissy, M.D., chief experience officer and director of the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Excellence in Healthcare Communication describe the personal approaches their organizations take to pro", "title": "True patient-centered care needs a personal touch", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/true-patient-centered-care-needs-personal-touch/2015-05-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Adrienne Boissy,Cleveland Clinic,Pamela Greenhouse,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Experience,patient-centered care,patient-centered communication,University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1300\"", "article_summary": "Engage clinicians to engage patientsAll that said, the patient experience won't improve if clinical staff don't buy into the patient engagement process.\nThe observation process, Greenhouse said, \"creates empathy, which leads to inssight ... and an urgency to create change for those who are doing it.\"\nSee care through patients' eyesUPMC started what it now calls its PFCC methodology at a single bone and joint hospital in 2006.\nThe program places heavy emphasis on shadowing the patient experience.\nThe methodology strives to view the healthcare experience through the eyes of the patient."}
