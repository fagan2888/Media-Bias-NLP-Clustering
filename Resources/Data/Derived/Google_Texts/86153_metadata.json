But Nobles says she refused to cooperate.\n\n\u201c[We] heard from her attorney who \u2026 said that she would not respond unless we agreed to pay her and him,\u201d Nobles said.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton took responsibility for MNsure, saying \u201cthe buck stops with me\u201d \u2014 even though the report says he and other leaders were kept in the dark.\n\nBut Dayton, a Democrat, says Republicans are using the report to kill health care.\n\n\u201cThe vote was totally partisan because Republicans wanted and are going to continue to do everything they can to destroy the exchange and to destroy the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Dayton said.\n\nDemocrats defended MNsure, and the thousands of people who found insurance. Republicans were derisive.\n\n\u201cWe look back and say, \u2018It was a computer problem. We didn\u2019t have enough operators.\u2019 No, it was a programmatic, systemic failure,\u201d Rep. Nick Zerwas, R-Elk River, said.\n\nThe report covers only the first fateful year of MNsure, and not the open enrollment period that ended on Sunday.\n\nMNsure reported only minor problems for signups, but says enrollments are falling far below projections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lack of adequate testing before the state's health insurance exchange launched in 2013 and other issues meant the exchange's \"failures outweighed its achievements\" in its first year, the legislative auditor concluded in a report released...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/02/17/latest-audit-will-look-at-mnsures-planning-implementation/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/mnsure.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/mnsure.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "A lack of adequate testing before the state's health insurance exchange launched in 2013 and other issues meant the exchange's \"failures outweighed its achievements\" in its first year, the legislative auditor concluded in a report released Tuesday.", "title": "Auditor: MNsure's 'Failures Outweighed Its Achievements'"}, "twitter": {"site": "/wcco", "image": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/mnsure.jpg?w=1500", "description": "A lack of adequate testing before the state's health insurance exchange launched in 2013 and other issues meant the exchange's \"failures outweighed its achievements\" in its first year, the legislative auditor concluded in a report released Tuesday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Auditor: MNsure's 'Failures Outweighed Its Achievements'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Minnesota, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "WCCO | CBS Minnesota", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota", "author": "http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota"}, "keywords": "local, news, politics, seen on wcco-tv, syndicated local, watch + listen, achievements, april todd-malmlov, audit, failures, health insurance, james nobles, legislative auditor, mark dayton, mnsure, nick zerwas, pat kessler, st. paul", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/306ed083e68aa1a8027608b8156838d2?s=16", "news_keywords": "achievements, april todd-malmlov, audit, failures, health insurance, james nobles, legislative auditor, mark dayton, mnsure, nick zerwas, pat kessler, st. paul"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3efa\"", "article_summary": "A year-long investigation of the MNsure meltdown by the legislative auditor found the problems are so extensive that MNsure\u2019s first-year failures outweighed its achievements.\nThe auditor tried to interview MNsure\u2019s former executive director, April Todd-Malmlov, who resigned under pressure during the website crash.\nThe report chronicles a cascading series of events that brought MNsure\u2019s website crashing down, at a time when hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans tried to sign up.\n\u201cMNsure did not deliver what was promised, what was expected and what was needed,\u201d Legislative Auditor James Nobles said.\nMINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) \u2014 A scathing audit report was released Tuesday on the rocky rollout of Minnesota\u2019s health care website last year."}
