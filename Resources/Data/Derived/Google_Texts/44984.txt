Jonathan Bush, athenahealth chairman and CEO, explains why he thinks Obamacare feels like "some horrible federal program."

The cousin of former president George W. Bush told CNBC on Friday he blamed both Democrats and Republicans for the botched introduction of Affordable Care Act reforms, arguing that years of inaction allowed health care to balloon in cost and complexity.

Jonathan Bush, the co-founder and CEO of health-care information technology company athenahealth, said health-care reforms needed to happen "long before Obama was elected."



"The product gets bulkier and more expensive and finally, there's 40 million people left out and Obama comes in and says guess what, 'I'm going to make my mark on this thing,'" Bush said Friday on "Squawk on the Street." "Now of course you've got the consequences of that, which is all these people being marched to the head of a rifle to 'marketplace' themselves in the federal website."

Bush faulted both Republican and Democrat lawmakers with allowing health care to become less like a business product and individual plans to become less distinguishable from each other.

"It isn't a Republican and Democrat thing," Bush said. "Frankly, I'm a Bush and I can't tell the difference between Republicans and Democrats. I'm just saying in general, what's going on is the marketplace has been wimping out on making health care a product and really managing it and selling it."



Because so many people lacked health insurance before the introduction of the Affordable Care Act and there was never a true variety of plans, both factors forced President Barack Obama's reforms to become more like a program than a marketplace, Bush said.
