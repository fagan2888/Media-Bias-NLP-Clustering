Brookings Institution\n\nOnce-rundown industrial urban districts could begin to give the traditional suburban corporate research park a run for its money, says a new paper from the Brookings Institution.\n\nResearchers Bruce Katz and Julie Wagner offer several examples of the rise of the so-called \u201cinnovation district,\u201d in which acres of shabby city warehouses, often located downtown, are being re-purposed as research centers that are luring top talent given their walk-ability and density.\n\nThat\u2019s a break from the past, when pharmaceutical companies and engineering firms preferred for sprawling\u2014but relatively inaccessible and closed\u2014research centers in the suburbs.\n\nWhere\u2019s this happening? The paper spotlights redevelopment in several:\n\nSeattle \u2019s South Lake Union district\n\n\u2019s South Lake Union district Downtown Detroit\n\nCambridge, Mass. , and Boston \u2019s Inner Harbor\n\n, and \u2019s Inner Harbor St. Louis \u2019 Cortex district\n\n\u2019 Cortex district The Philadelphia neighborhood west of the 30th Street train station\n\nneighborhood west of the 30th Street train station The Research Triangle Park in North Carolina\u2019s Raleigh-Durham metro area\n\n\u201cThere is a shift towards open innovation: firms want to be closer to the big ideas,\u201d which often means locating in the middle of cities, near universities, start-ups, and other business incubators, said Mr. Katz.\n\nTheir paper argues that these changes could further reshape cities, and they focus on several examples where they say underutilized industrial districts are being remade by technology, bio-medical, and even light manufacturing firms.\n\nWhat are the key ingredients of this new model of urban development? Seedier industrial or waterfront areas have offered cheap real estate that can be repurposed. These areas tend to be closer to midtown or downtown districts, which in many cases are already becoming sought-after residential destinations. They\u2019re also close to transit hubs and they tend to have a university or two or another anchor research institution.\n\nThere\u2019s more in the full report and an online introduction.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Once-rundown industrial urban districts could begin to give the traditional suburban corporate research park a run for its money, says a new paper from the Brookings Institution.", "title": "A Look at Six U.S. Cities Pioneering New Economic Zones", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/09/a-look-at-six-u-s-cities-pioneering-new-economic-zones/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "A Look at Six U.S. Cities Pioneering New Economic Zones", "description": "Once-rundown industrial urban districts could begin to give the traditional suburban corporate research park a run for its money, says a new paper from the Brookings Institution.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Nick Timiraos", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Once-rundown industrial urban districts could begin to give the traditional suburban corporate research park a run for its money, says a new paper from the Brookings Institution.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-09T17:04:05-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/09/a-look-at-six-u-s-cities-pioneering-new-economic-zones/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-25934", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Once-rundown industrial urban districts could begin to give the traditional suburban corporate research park a run for its money, says a new paper from the Brookings Institution.", "title": "A Look at Six U.S. Cities Pioneering New Economic Zones", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/09/a-look-at-six-u-s-cities-pioneering-new-economic-zones/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-25934", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-09T17:04:21-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The paper spotlights redevelopment in several:Seattle \u2019s South Lake Union district\u2019s South Lake Union district Downtown DetroitCambridge, Mass.\nSeattle\u2019s South Lake Union district is at the vanguard of new city districts that could reshape traditional economic development planning, say researchers at the Brookings Institution.\nThese areas tend to be closer to midtown or downtown districts, which in many cases are already becoming sought-after residential destinations.\nTheir paper argues that these changes could further reshape cities, and they focus on several examples where they say underutilized industrial districts are being remade by technology, bio-medical, and even light manufacturing firms.\nThey\u2019re also close to transit hubs and they tend to have a university or two or another anchor research institution."}
