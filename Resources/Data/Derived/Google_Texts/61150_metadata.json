For those of us who have hidden part of our identities from people we know and love, finally revealing that thing can be daunting. Fear and anxiety, no matter how ungrounded, have a way of clutching our hearts.\n\nWhen I decided four years ago to write a book aimed at secular parents, I knew that it would require that I disclose my atheism to my friends and family. My own parents were comfortably secular themselves, which no doubt made the task a whole lot easier. But I had plenty of other loved ones who felt strongly about their faith and would surely be offended or uncomfortable with my stance \u2014 not to mention worried about my daughter\u2019s eternal soul. So I definitely felt that sense of coming out of a closet.\n\nI took a few days to send a bunch of e-mails and make a few phone calls. And while no one disowned me in the process, the revelation did hurt some people I love, at least a little. And that made it hard.\n\nBut now, four years later, I can candidly say that, for me personally, being \u201cout\u201d has been one of the most surprisingly gratifying choices I\u2019ve ever made. Here\u2019s why.\n\n1. It turns out I really enjoy shattering people\u2019s assumptions. I don\u2019t fit the media\u2019s stereotype of a non-believer \u2014 who does, right? \u2014 so it\u2019s nice to be able to spread the \u201cgood word\u201d that atheists, agnostics and other \u201cnones\u201d are just as likely as the next guy to be engaging people, good parents and involved community members. I particularly enjoy slipping my atheism into conversation with religious people who already know and like me; it forces them to confront any stereotypes they might have. Always a good thing.\n\n2. I like religious people more now. When I was closeted, it was way too easy to sit back and become preemptively resentful. I sometimes felt a little pissed that others were \u201cfree\u201d to share their views while I had to keep mine to myself. I assumed, as many do, that people\u2019s reactions would be negative if I were to inject my views into these conversations. But once I was out \u2014 and because I only brought up my atheism in truly neutral ways, not as a point of conflict \u2014 the reactions from religious people have been overwhelming positive. Some quietly disapprove, sure. But, in my experience, religious people have been, outwardly, very lovely about my lack of belief. (As lovely, incidentally, as I am about their belief.) They don\u2019t insult me or shy away from me. They don\u2019t avoid the subject (well, some do, and that\u2019s okay!) or make snide comments. They don\u2019t try to change me. And with every positive experience I have, I am more open and less judgmental of \u201creligious people\u201d myself. I find that the more open I am about myself, the better I feel about the people around me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I never expected I'd take such pleasure in shattering people's assumptions about the nonreligious", "title": "4 reasons I\u2019m glad I came out as an atheist", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I never expected I'd take such pleasure in shattering people's assumptions about the nonreligious", "title": "4 reasons I\u2019m glad I came out as an atheist", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/4_reasons_im_glad_i_came_out_as_an_atheist_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/shutterstock_229503433.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I never expected I'd take such pleasure in shattering people's assumptions about the nonreligious", "title": "4 reasons I\u2019m glad I came out as an atheist", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/shutterstock_229503433.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Wendy Thomas Russell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Christianity, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf42\"", "article_summary": "When I decided four years ago to write a book aimed at secular parents, I knew that it would require that I disclose my atheism to my friends and family.\nMy own parents were comfortably secular themselves, which no doubt made the task a whole lot easier.\n\u2014 so it\u2019s nice to be able to spread the \u201cgood word\u201d that atheists, agnostics and other \u201cnones\u201d are just as likely as the next guy to be engaging people, good parents and involved community members.\nTopics: AlterNet, Christianity, Religion, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetComing out of any proverbial closet can be hard.\nI assumed, as many do, that people\u2019s reactions would be negative if I were to inject my views into these conversations."}
