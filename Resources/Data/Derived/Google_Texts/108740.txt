'Home Alone' for two

Cabin fever makes people do crazy things. But when Milwaukee native Kari Houghtaling, 25, and friend Liz Smith, 26, were housebound in Guttenberg, Iowa, during the coldest weekend of 2014, they did something really insane: They shot a full-length remake of their favorite movie, the Macaulay Culkin-starring 1990 Christmas classic "Home Alone," appearing as nearly every character.

Their no-budget labor of love — or is it madness? — is now complete, with the title "Abode Solo," having its premiere Sunday at 8 p.m. at Hotel Foster, 2028 E. North Ave., with sets from Milwaukee band Jaill and Suzie. The cover is $5.

Rest assured: The place will not be booby-trapped.
