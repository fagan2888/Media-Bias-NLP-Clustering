Certainly there\u2019s fertile ground for those seeking parallels between the main protagonists of this quintessential political soap opera, and our more flesh and blood \u201cheroes.\u201d Like their imaginary foils, the Clintons\u2019 moral compass is functionally impaired, so much so one suspects the HoC scriptwriters modeled their lead characters on the Democratic Party\u2019s resident \u201croyal couple.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, a critical assessment of Hillary Clinton\u2019s fitness for the Oval Office can\u2019t be undertaken absent some reference to the respective roles she and her husband have played in each other\u2019s professional lives. Many folks will recall their indelible slogan from Bill Clinton\u2019s successful tilt at the top job in 1992, where the campaign pitch to voters was,\u201cTwo for the price of one.\u201d\n\nPresident Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1997. (White House photo)\n\nAgain, one not unlike the mantra the Underwoods might concoct for voters. One wonders why the Clintons have not retooled that hoary old refrain for 2016, and here I\u2019m thinking,\u201cBuy one, get one free\u201dmight fit the bill.\n\nThe Clintons then (cue Frank and Claire again) are the consummate political \u201cchancers\u201d (British slang for \u201copportunists\u201d), with style overwhelming substance, ruthlessness eclipsing truthfulness, and political expediency supplanting personal integrity. Occupying their own \u201chouse of cards\u201d is a long, yet not so illustrious history of deception, malice, corruption, duplicity, careerism, avarice, turpitude, warmongering, hubris, incompetence, arrogance, media manipulation, venality, hypocrisy, influence touting, and everything in between that the ugly, sleazy side of politics has on offer.\n\nThis reality was first underscored most notably when \u2014 in what must be the modern American narrative\u2019s most indelible \u201cstand by your man\u201d moment \u2014 the then \u201cTammy Wynette\u201d of U.S. politics vigorously defended her husband against allegations of unbridled lechery and sexual predation. These allegations, along with many others in her view, were invented by what she later defined as a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d one that was unscrupulously trying to take them down and out.\n\nBut irrespective of whether this much touted \u201cconspiracy\u201d was actually a reality (the Clintons surely had powerful and well-heeled enemies), a product of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s penchant for self-aggrandizing delusion , or simply dirty politics (the perfect tautology if there is one), it is now safe to say it was going to take much more than a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d to stop the Clinton juggernaut in its tracks.\n\nPowerful Juggernaut\n\nThat this \u201cjuggernaut\u201d shows few signs of losing steam is evident; at the same time it continues to showcase all that\u2019s wrong about Establishment politics \u2014 Republican or Democrat. And whilst we can say now the accusations against her husband contained more than a grain of truth (at least those related to womanizing and self-aggrandizement), both Bill and Hillary were in for the long haul.That she tendered her impassioned denials in the full knowledge that many were true is difficult to refute, and if nothing else, says much about the candidate\u2019s capacity to deny reality in the service of a larger ambition.\n\nFrom \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d President Frank Underwood (played by Kevin Spacey) and his wife, Claire (played by Robin Wright).\n\nAnd without placing too fine a point on it, this is one area where given the prevailing zeitgeist in Washington \u2013 in both neoliberal and neoconservative circles \u2013 Hillary Clinton is most definitely qualified as both the preferred candidate of Democratic insiders and the Establishment\u2019s choice for president (including a number of erstwhile Republicans).\n\nIn any event, the Clintons themselves are no slouches when it comes to playing \u201cdirty politics,\u201d for whom we might say all\u2019s fair in love, warandtheir chosen vocation. They embody moreover, raw political ambition at its hard-core finest, steeled by narcissistic megalomania, all of it unencumbered by accountability, transparency, humility, ethics, honesty, scruples or altruism. Her seemingly inevitable selection as the 2016 Democratic flag-bearer \u2014 and from there most likely the presidency \u2014 is ample indication of that \u201clong haul\u201d ambition.\n\nTo their credit as political survivors, they\u2019ve been effectively dodging political snipers ever since they parachuted into public consciousness during the 1992 campaign. And if the current contest is any guide, the Clintons have not lost their innate talent in this regard. As for Hillary Clinton, one suspects even her most zealous detractors could not help but admire \u2014 if begrudgingly \u2014 the mix of chutzpah and resilience that have been key to her longevity, with her not always subtle campaign \u201ctrump\u201d cards: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn!\u201d Even without playing the \u201celect me as your first woman president\u201d card, the palpable sense of quasi-regal entitlement becomes icing on the Clinton cake!\n\nWe might argue that given the weight of mounting evidenceagainsther fitness for office \u2014 a modicum of which would deep-six most politicians\u2019 career ambitions \u2014 they have become ever more adept at keeping their political ducks flying in a row, and well out of the range of the shooters. Not that they\u2019ve achieved this all on their own.\n\nIn this the Clintons have been ably served by the mainstream media (MSM), who\u2019ve generally eschewed the forensic analysis \u2014 whether political, policy or personal \u2014 vital to objectively evaluating her fitness as the Democratic nominee (and therefore president).\n\nMistress of Malevolent Mayhem\n\nThe prospect then of another Clinton presidency should make all right-thinking Americans increasingly concerned \u2013 even afraid \u2013 about the direction in which their country is heading. I knowIam, and I\u2019m not even an American!\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton honor the four victims of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony held at Andrews Air Force Base, Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Sept. 14, 2012. [State Department photo)\n\nLike many of America\u2019s key allies over recent years, our country Australia is no different in that more and more Aussies are harboring anxious \u2014 one might sayexistential\u2014 fears about the respective agendas of the U.S. neoconservative and neoliberal establishments. And notwithstanding her blandly reassuring campaign rhetoric on both counts, Clinton hasn\u2019t just aligned herself with these agendas; it\u2019s increasingly clear she\u2019s the preferred standard bearer of the authors.\n\nWith this in mind, outside of her aforementioned Tammy Wynette moment, we should explore a little more of the aspiring president\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. In an excellent book, aptly titled Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton ,Diana Johnstone does just this. The author chronicles in a clear-eyed manner her subject\u2019s back story in excruciating detail. What makes Johnstone\u2019s tome all the more remarkable and essential is the depth and breadth of her narrative, one that goes way beyond the outwardly narrow focus suggested by the book\u2019s title.\n\nFor Johnstone, Clinton\u2019s \u201cmisadventures\u201d aren\u2019t simply a reflection of the warmongering misadventures of the country she aspires to lead and whose dubious \u201cvirtues\u201d Clinton obsequiously and glibly extols at every turn. In Johnstone\u2019s studied analysis of the candidate, Hillary Clinton embraces all the vices that distinguish the prevailing Washington \u201cgroup think\u201d on foreign, national security and military policy. Indeed, Clinton does so as promiscuously as her philandering spouse did in pursuing his own personal vices.\n\nMoreover, along with being attendant to her husband\u2019s career, the back story of Hillary Clinton\u2019s political ascendancy is inextricably woven into the larger narrative of America\u2019s preeminence as the \u201cindispensable\u201d empiredu jourin the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, itself coinciding more or less with Bill Clinton\u2019s election to the presidency in 1992.\n\nAs Johnstone notes, in her youth, the then Hillary Rodham, a former Republican and \u201c Goldwater girl,\u201d \u201cgrew up with the viewpoint of a rich and dominant America obliged to maintain its position on top of an envious and resentful world. This was the standard attitude.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that it was her husband\u2019s foreign and national security policies that in so many ways facilitated the rise of the \u201cfull-spectrum dominance\u201d mindset that prevails in Washington to this day. In fact, Bill Clinton\u2019s track record as POTUS is a singular pointer to how a Hillary Clinton presidency will shape up on the critical economic and financial, as well as the geopolitical and national security fronts.\n\nThough we may never know the full extent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s influence on her husband\u2019s foreign and national security policies during his tenure, we can safely assume it was never less than substantive. In this we might point to her well-documented encouragement of Bill Clinton to bomb Yugoslavia, as just one example.\n\nBringing in Bubba\n\nAnd now with her husband as a key fundraiser, campaign strategist and arguably her closest political confidant, it\u2019s a safe bet that once Hillary Clinton is ensconced in the White House, \u201cBubba\u201d Clinton will almost certainly reign behind the throne as her indispensibleconsigliore. In fact, we can\u2019t rule out his appointment as a key player in the next administration.\n\nArkansas Gov. Bill Clinton debating with President George H.W. Bush in 1992.\n\nAs it is, such a prospect was announced just this past week when the candidate said she is likely to appoint her husband to a senior economic advisory position, purportedly to \u201crevitalize\u201d the economy. \u201cYou know, he knows how to do it,\u201d she declared.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, the aptly designated \u201cWar Party\u201d \u2014 the cabal of neoconservatives and liberal interventionists who are the flag-bearers of America\u2019s hegemonic ambition \u2014 are now more entrenched than in Bill Clinton\u2019s heyday and key leaders are backing Hillary Clinton. This being the case, the die one imagines is already cast \u2014 America\u2019s future preordained. There can be only one outcome from a Hillary Clinton presidency \u2013 more wars.\n\nIn an interview with Joan Brunwasser on OpEdNews, Johnstone explained there were two things [that] inspired her to writeQueen of Chaos. The first was the Libyan intervention and accompanying \u201cregime change\u201d gambit. Johnstone described the war that eventually destroyed Libya as \u201ctotally unjustified\u201d \u2014 a familiar refrain in the decades-long history of America\u2019s war for the Greater Middle East . The author added that most people are \u201ctotally unaware [of] how much falsification was used to justify that war.\u201d\n\nIt was Clinton as Secretary of State, Johnstone says, who cajoled President Obama into that war and is \u201cquite ready to use it as model for further regime change in countries whose leaders she doesn\u2019t like.\u201d Clinton\u2019s sniggering, grandiose exultation \u2014 \u201cwe came, we saw, he died\u201d \u2014 upon hearing of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s grisly demise at the hands of Western-aided anti-government rebels was clear evidence of this.\n\nHenry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State.\n\nHer close pal (and now presumably, aspiring \u201cpresidential whisperer\u201d) Henry Kissinger \u2014 himself a past master of malevolent mayhem and Machiavellian mischief \u2014 doubtless would\u2019ve been mightily impressed with the way the Libyan debacle unfolded, although \u201cHank\u201d one expects may have had the decorum not to gloat about it in public, if only for appearances\u2019 sake.\n\nAs for her second reason, Johnstone points out it was, \u201cthe totally disproportionate hostility aroused against Vladimir Putin and Russia as a result of the Ukrainian crisis \u2026 [itself] incited largely by Washington and the European Union. That hostility was already brewing, and Hillary has kept it stirring. These events are part of a trend toward a much greater war than people today think possible.\u201d\n\nIn a recent article at Counterpunch ,Johnstone declared that she had hoped the occasion of the campaign might be seized upon not only to\u201cexpose the lies of Hillary Clinton,\u201d but, also to \u201cseek freedom from America\u2019s seven decades of subjugation to the military-industrial complex and its organic intellectuals who never cease conjuring up threats and enemies to justify the war economy. This entire policy needs to be exposed, denounced and rejected.\u201d\n\nThe Regressive Progressive\n\nAndrew Levine from the Institute for Policy Studies singled out so-called \u201cprogressive liberals\u201d for their unstinting support of Hillary Clinton. In his view, no notable people within this nebulous constituency (one of her unabashed admirers Paul Krugman comes to mind here) have been able to come up with examples of\u201canything progressive or worthwhile that Hillary has accomplished.\u201d\n\nLevine notes, somewhat acerbically, as First Lady Clinton, \u201cset the cause of health care reform back a generation, laying the groundwork for all that is wrong with Obamacare; as a Senator, she did nothing noteworthy at all; and, worst of all, as Secretary of State, all she has been good for is facilitating world-endangering disasters.\u201d\n\nAnd on the neoliberal front, more people are now viewing secretive faux trade agreements like the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) as Trojan Horses concocted to enhance corporate power and influence, allowing the transnationals to further enrich themselves at the expense of the national sovereignty, economic prosperity and self-determination of the countries who sign off on them. [See Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201c Neocons and Neolibs: How Dead Ideas Kill. \u201d]\n\nIn Australia, our all but obligatory commitment to this agreement has many Australians doubtful not just about the alleged benefits of the pact itself, but our \u201cno questions asked\u201d vassal-status alliance with America in general. That few if any of these agreements do what their advocates claim they do is evident to all but the most myopic or deluded of observers of the political economy.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s own 1994 NAFTA agreement might be Exhibit A here. And Hillary Clinton\u2019s flip-flopping on this issue is not a good \u201clook\u201d in the eyes of those increasingly opposed to these \u201ctrade\u201d regimes.\n\nFurther, despite her earnest proclamations about reining in Wall Street, Clinton is not likely to do so. The Clintons\u2019 respective presidential campaigns \u2014 indeed their political ascendancy, and by some accounts , their personal financial rehabilitation after Bill Clinton left office \u2014 were funded in large part and via various means by the \u201c gangbanksters\u201d of \u201cgrab-it-all\u201d street .\n\nThese massive payments \u2014 essentially pay-to-play \u201cpayola\u201d dressed-up as speaking fees, charitable donations or campaign contributions \u2014 could be viewed as Wall Street\u2019s protection money guaranteeing that a President Hillary Clinton will use her office as the bulwark between the financial criminals and the folks with the pitchforks .\n\nPepe Escobar has noted that \u201cWall Street\u2019s Golden Girl\u201d likes to portray herself at least for public consumption as a dedicated disciple of the \u201cNo Bank Is Too Big To Fail\u201d ethos and \u201cfully committed\u201d to financial industry reform. But she is \u201cthe reigning Queen of Turbo-Charged Casino Neoliberalism \u2026 the evidence insists to suggest that her actions do not exactly match her rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street bull statue by Arturo Di Modica\n\nIt seems then that few presidential aspirants have campaigned for office schlepping so muchobvious\u201cbaggage\u201d with them. In fact, it is a testament to the Clintons\u2019 formidable, perpetual motion political machine that much of HRC\u2019s \u201cbaggage\u201d is either hidden from public view or is rarely subjected to the rigorous scrutiny that should accompany any candidate aspiring to the highest office in the land.\n\nParadoxically, this applies even more so now despite more informed folks having the Clintons\u2019 political and personal measure. But as indicated, the MSM has dutifully shoved her dirty linen down the political laundry chute and welded the doors shut at both ends so the smell doesn\u2019t offend the nostrils of the voting public.\n\nIn at least one case, the MSM appears to have been joined in pulling punches by some in alternative, independent media (AIM) circles. Fellow Australian, renowned filmmaker and journalist John Pilger noted recently , in reference to an article he published onCounterpunchconcerning Clinton\u2019s fitness for the White House, another well known and generally respected AIM outletTruthout,refused to republish it in full until he excised some of what they viewed as his more contentious statements regarding the Woman who Would be President. Pilger said this was the first time he\u2019d ever been asked to undertake such self-censorship. He was, as might be expected, less than impressed, saying\u201clike all censorship, this was unacceptable.\u201d\n\nPilger added that Truthout said \u201cmy unwillingness to submit my work to a \u2018process of revision\u2019 meant [they] had to take it off their \u2018publication docket\u2019. Such is the gatekeeper\u2019s way with words. At the root of this episode is an enduring unsayable. This is the need, the compulsion, of many liberals to embrace a leader from within a system that is demonstrably imperial and violent. Like Obama\u2019s \u2018hope\u2019, Clinton\u2019s gender is no more than a suitable facade.\u201d\n\nIn this case, it was a news outlet positioning itself as a credible alternative to the glorified stenographers and perception managers populating the newsrooms and editorial boards within and across the NYT/WPost/LAT axis.\n\nFor Pilger and other like-minded observers, the broader challenge for those wishing to expose the leading candidate\u2019s \u201cdirty linen\u201d to greater scrutiny when it is needed most is made more difficult as a result of her status as the anointed candidate amongst the Washington power elites.\n\nNow that Clinton has fashioned herself as the \u201cwomen\u2019s candidate\u201d and \u201cchampion of American liberalism\u201d in its \u201cheroic struggle\u201d with those mostly unelected folks who dictate U.S. economic, foreign, military and national security policy, it is increasingly difficult given the existing political climate to counter this cockamamie narrative.\n\nOr as Pilger put it: \u201cThis is drivel, of course; Hillary Clinton leaves a trail of blood and suffering around the world and a clear record of exploitation and greed in her own country. To say so, however, is becoming intolerable in the land of free speech.\u201d\n\nSurviving President Clinton-45?\n\nWhat should be especially troubling for Americans contemplating their next commander in chief, Clinton clearly views herself amongst those elites whose position, profile, public persona and self-importance license them to see themselves being above the law. Of course, this phenomena is nothing new , but it is becoming increasingly obvious to ordinary Americans that those in power and/or those with influence aren\u2019t routinely \u2014 without fear or favor \u2014 subject to the same rules and penalties astheywould be, all things equal.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nGiven her legally suspect track record on so many issues, this alone should disqualify Clinton from consideration as President. Her arrogant, contemptuous dismissal of the very idea that she might face prosecution from her careless handling of sensitive information in the so-called \u201cServer-gate\u201d scandal \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s simply not going to happen\u201d \u2014 is ample evidence that she sees herself as a member of the exclusive but expanding \u201cToo Big to Jail\u201d Club.\n\nAs former CIA intelligence analyst Ray McGovern sees it , with the FBI investigation into the matter about to wrap up, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess at this stage as to whether the U.S. Justice Department will find against her for using a private email account and server to conduct official, classified and/or top secret State Department business while Secretary of State, and from there prosecute her to the full extent of the law.\n\nBut McGovern goes on to add the following: \u201cif there is something incriminating \u2014 or at least politically damaging \u2014 in Clinton\u2019s emails, it\u2019s a safe bet that at least the NSA and maybe the FBI, as well, knows. And that could make life difficult for a Clinton-45 presidency. The whole thing needs to be cleaned up before the choices for the next President are locked in.\u201d\n\nIn a recent piece \u2014 querulously titled \u201cWould The World Survive President Hillary?\u201d \u2014 Paul Craig Roberts noted that the Clintons represent everything that is deeply flawed about the way Washington works as they serve as the \u201cposter couple\u201d for the corrosive graft, corruption, political perversion and criminal sleaze that infects the Beltway milieu.\n\nRoberts writes: \u201cgovernment has been privatized. Office holders use their positions in order to make themselves wealthy, not in order to serve the public interest. Bill and Hillary Clinton epitomize the use of public office in behalf of the office holder\u2019s interest. For the Clintons, government means using public office to be rewarded for doing favors for private interests.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason HRC\u2019s fitness for the Oval Office has not been subjected to the sort of scrutiny we all should expect was the reluctance of her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders to go for the jugular throughout the primary campaign. Hillary Clinton might own the most vulnerable \u201cjugular\u201d in this battle, but she\u2019s been extraordinarily adept at ensuring hers is a constantly moving, hard-to-hit target.\n\nYet even if Sanders had conducted a more aggressive campaign against Clinton based on her dubious record, it\u2019s arguable the MSM would not have accorded such efforts that much attention, no matter how on the money Sanders was or how well such tactics might have played with voters. Insofar as the MSM is concerned, the nomination of Clinton as the Democratic \u2014 indeed,Establishment\u2014 candidate, was a foregone conclusion from the get-go. The MSM\u2019s job is to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nNeglecting Sanders\n\nAll this was underscored by the amount of MSM ink lavished on the respective campaigns, with Sanders receiving a fraction compared to Clinton (or certainly Donald Trump). Even then, the coverage of Sanders was often begrudging and dismissive (focused recently on why he won\u2019t just concede the nomination and stop \u201churting\u201d Clinton).\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. (NBC photo)\n\nPlus, there were the reports of vote rigging in various primary contests and Democratic campaign funding anomalies , all of which have been ignored or played down in MSM circles. For its part, the MSM have long since abrogated any and all responsibility for guiding voters towards the selection of a president who might begin to reverse the course America seems hell bent on pursuing, whether in the broad economic, financial, social, military, national security or geopolitical spheres. It wasn\u2019t going to change gear this time around.\n\nLast but not least is the aforementioned Clinton machine itself, whose principal drivers are doubtless leaving nothing to chance in their relentless, ruthless drive towards the \u201cinevitable\u201d nomination of their standard bearer and ultimately the presidency. This, coupled with the Democratic National Committee\u2019s (DNC) own \u201cout of the starting gate\u201d anointment of HRC as the presumptive nominee along with the crucial backing (aboveandbelow board) that accompanies said \u201canointment,\u201d translated to Sanders having to work much harder to gain sufficient traction, and from there position himself as the more qualified, suitable candidate for nomination.\n\nThat he continues working harder as of this writing is both a testament to Sanders\u2019s own determination and the undeniable level of grassroots support for him. It is also an indictment of the Democratic Party itself which seems determined to stop him \u2014 along with those among the \u201copinionocracy\u201d equally determined to write him off \u2014 even if this means risking destruction of the party as a viable political entity.\n\nIn an interview with talk show host Ed Schultz , Sanders said \u201csuper-delegates\u201d \u2013 party insiders who get to vote on the nominee without being elected as a regular delegate \u2013 had to \u201cdo some hard thinking\u201d before deciding who to support at the convention.\n\nThe Vermont senator had this to say about the state of play: \u201c\u2018Take a look at the polls, take a look at the nature of the campaigns. And I think if you do that, you\u2019ll find that the energy, the enthusiasm, the voter turnout will be with us. We are the strongest campaign to defeat Hillary Clinton \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump, and hopefully Hillary Clinton as well here, and if that\u2019s the case, I would hope they support us.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s Fitness\n\nAnd though it may be too little, too late, some people within the AIM ranks are still calling into question Clinton\u2019s suitability, qualification and fitness for the White House. To this end, in a recent article journalist Robert Parry of Consortiumnews posed a simple but seemingly vexed question about HRC \u2014 is she qualified to be president, not just based on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but on her actual performance in office?\n\nOusted Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi shortly before he was murdered on Oct. 20, 2011.\n\nParry wrote that Clinton \u201cseemed incapable of learning from her costly errors \u2014 or perhaps she just understands that the politically safest course is to do what Washington\u2019s neocon-dominated foreign policy establishment wants. \u2026\n\n\u201cThat way you get hailed as a serious thinker in The Washington Post and at think-tank conferences. Virtually all major columnists and big-name pundits praised Clinton\u2019s hawkish tendencies as Secretary of State, from her escalating tensions with Iran to tipping the balance of the debate in favor of \u2018regime change\u2019 in Libya to urging direct U.S. military intervention in Syria in pursuit of another \u2018regime change\u2019 there.\u201d\n\nSuch fitness for office should be a fundamental consideration for selecting a U.S. president, along with an equally crucial question: What kind of individual is the best person to reverse the course America seems intent on pursuing at the expense of everything it purports to stand for? At one stage Obama held out this promise to America, and more recently for some, Sanders.\n\nHillary Clinton is, indeed, the \u201cQueen of Chaos\u201d inhabiting her own real-life \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d one that\u2019s been erected by a fawning, uncritical mainstream media, bankrolled by wealthy elites and the denizens of Wall Street and the military-industrial-security complex with its perimeter secured by the neoconservatives and their fellow travelers, the (not-so) liberal interventionists. In other words, the power enclaves that constitute the existentially toxic Washington political firmament.\n\nAll things considered, simply being \u201cafraid\u201d somehow just doesn\u2019t cut it. When it comes to the Clintons, one imagines we\u2019d all be safer and more secure with the conniving Frank Underwood as President and his calculating wife Claire as Vice President, or perhaps vice versa. Now, there\u2019s a thought!\n\nGreg Maybury is a freelance writer based in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nconsortiumnews", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "MEONews", "app_id": 202189779824966}}, "article_summary": "In an excellent book, aptly titled Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton ,Diana Johnstone does just this.\nIn this we might point to her well-documented encouragement of Bill Clinton to bomb Yugoslavia, as just one example.\nParadoxically, this applies even more so now despite more informed folks having the Clintons\u2019 political and personal measure.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen.
