The White House has recruited yet more celebrities to sound the alarm on the latest Obamacare deadline.

In a new advertisement, Seattle Seahawks players Richard Sherman and Russell Wilson encourage Americans to sign up for 2015 health coverage under Obamacare by February 15.

“Everyday we step onto the football field, we’re thinking about what we need to win,” Sherman begins.

“And also what we need to do to keep ourselves healthy so we can keep doing what we do best,” Wilson adds.

“When your health or the game is on the line, nothing is more important than quality coverage,” continues Sherman.

The NFL stars tell uninsured Americans to “make the right call” and visit Healthcare.gov before the February 15 deadline.

The White House is certainly no stranger to recruiting celebrities to tout the president’s health care law. Pharrell Williams, Julianne Moore, Kerry Washington, Shaun White and others urged Americans to “get covered” on social media last year.
