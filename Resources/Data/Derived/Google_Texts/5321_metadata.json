(Photo: Photo courtesy of OCEARCH)\n\nBELMAR \u2013 Boaters off Belmar might catch a glimpse of the Jersey Shore\u2019s newest visiting shark, Elias, a 100-pound, nearly 7-foot male hammerhead who has fished the waters between Lavallette and Highlands since July 31.\n\nElias, who is being tracked by OCEARCH, last surfaced less than 4 miles offshore of Belmar at 7:22 a.m. Sunday morning.\n\nThe shark has traveled 431 miles since being tagged on July 19 off Montauk, N.Y. OCEARCH is tracking sharks for scientific research, to promote their protection, and foster marine science education.\n\nThe hammerhead surfaced Saturday morning at 6:13 a.m. less than a mile off Chadwick Beach, and again at 6:42 a.m. off Osprey Lane in Mantoloking.\n\nElias is just one of a variety of ocean animals gaining fame at the Shore this year. Mary Lee, a 3,400-pound great white shark visited the Shore in May. Most recently, a dolphin swam into the South River and perished. In July, a humpback whale was photographed feeding off Sandy Hook.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@GannettNJ.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
