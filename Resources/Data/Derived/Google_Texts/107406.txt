One of Mitt Romney’s biggest Wall Street backers predicted Monday that the former presidential candidate would run again in 2016 under certain conditions.

SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci said the former Massachusetts governor would run in 2016 if GOP favorites such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush decline to run.

“I don’t think he’s 100 percent made the decision,” Mr. Scaramucci said in an interview with Fox Business. “But a couple of factors could happen: If Governor Jeb Bush drops out or declares that he’s not going to run, I think that puts Governor Romney in… position.”

Mr. Scaramucci, who served as national finance co-chair during Mr. Romney’s campaign, said that Mr. Romney had retained popularity among the Wall Street elite.

“I can tell you right now. The governor has a very strong following, including myself. And he’d be my number one draft pick,” Mr. Scaramucci said.

Mr. Romney has repeatedly said that he will not seek the presidency in 2016 but has admitted that “circumstances can change.”

“I think he’s going to do it,” Mr. Scaramucci said. “I don’t think there’s any reason for him not to do it. His family is behind him.”
