Two are long forgotten. The third may live forever. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d became a meme because it nailed the issue that drove that election. One overarching issue drives this election, but neither Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign nor the Democratic Party got the memo. Any swing voter could tell them what it says: It\u2019s the corruption, stupid.\n\nDonald Trump got the memo. What you notice first about Trump is his xenophobia, but he also speaks more about corruption than immigration. For example: when he falsely claims to self-fund his campaign, blames Bush\u2019s donors when he gets booed, shames his opponents for crooking the knee to the Kochs, or belittles the Clintons for attending his wedding. He brags of buying influence as if buying it were less corrupt than selling it. He gets away with it because few in the press see the issue\u2019s centrality to the race \u2014 or would know what questions to ask if they did.\n\nDeep in their unconscious, even Trump\u2019s most ardent fans must know that such a colossal liar couldn\u2019t possibly be a reformer. Asked to explain their enthusiasm, they invariably cite his independence. Doubtless many are also drawn to his racism \u2014 but corruption is what Trump and his backers talk most about. In any event, the only real reformer in the race is Bernie Sanders. Even he must broaden his message beyond cracking down on Wall Street and repealing Citizens United. All Democratic candidates call for repealing Citizens United. Democratic audiences cheer when they do. Other audiences doze off, and for good reasons.\n\nOne reason is that people don\u2019t know what they mean. If you talk about Citizens United or Glass Steagall, you must tell us what they are. The key to campaign finance is discussing how much money flows into the system, where it comes from and how it\u2019s spent. For financial regulation, talk about how without it, banks can bet their depositors\u2019 money \u2014 and if they lose big enough, even with Dodd Frank, we taxpayers end up bailing them out.\n\nAnother reason is that Democrats who bewail Citizens United so often depict corruption as a right-wing plot of which they themselves are mere victims. Not even the base buys that. Citizens United arrived in 2010. Pay-to-play politics took off in the mid-\u201970s, right about the time the middle class stopped getting raises. The sad truth is elite Democrats like the current system a lot. Here\u2019s a well-guarded secret: They even see a lot to like in Citizens United.\n\nPoorly written and atrociously reasoned, Citizens United rests on three simple, absurd precepts: Money is speech; corporations are people; and corruption is OK so long as it is sanctioned. OK, the third one isn\u2019t so simple, but it sure is absurd. It pertains to what Justice Kennedy, the opinion\u2019s author, calls \u201csoft\u201d corruption, by which he means the entire system: big donors, lobbyists, lush retreats, revolving doors, exorbitant speaking fees. The whole shebang.\n\nKennedy says that unlike \u201chard\u201d corruption (bribery, mainly), \u201csoft\u201d corruption harms and offends no one, so Congress can\u2019t regulate it. The issue hadn\u2019t come up at trial, so there was nothing about it in pleadings. There\u2019s tons of data about how evil it is and how much we hate it, but Kennedy ignored it. He offered no proof to support his \u201cfinding.\u201d He just said it was so and now it\u2019s the law.\n\nI\u2019d rate Citizens United the second most corrupt decision in Supreme Court history after Bush v. Gore. Blind partisanship drove Bush v. Gore. Right-wing ideology informs both decisions. But Citizens United\u2019s key findings, that our politics isn\u2019t really corrupt and we don\u2019t care anyway, is neither partisan nor extreme. It is in fact the bipartisan consensus of Washington\u2019s soul-sick, brain-dead establishment.\n\nIf you doubt it, consider Barack Obama. In 2008, America was almost as angry at its government as it is today. Then as now, the media and political consultants to both parties were blind to the issue. But Obama and strategist David Axelrod sort of got it. Axelrod wasn\u2019t much for specificity. He preached the \u201cpolitics of biography\u201d (sell the person, not the policy). So Obama spoke of transforming \u201cWashington\u2019s culture.\u201d It was powerful stuff, but not quite powerful enough.\n\nVoters knew the problem wasn\u2019t \u201cpartisan gridlock\u201d but a hammerlock of special interests. They could abide politicians\u2019 incivility but not their corruption. Obama added some policy meat to the metaphorical bone of his message. He called whistle-blowers heroes and vowed to strengthen freedom of information, to let C-SPAN cameras film healthcare negotiations, end no-bid contracts, close revolving doors and never hire lobbyists to handle matters of special concern to their ex-clients. By late fall, nearly every speech he gave ended in a rousing call for reform.\n\nBreaking those vows was the original sin of the Obama administration. No C-SPAN cameras ever filmed a meeting. He didn\u2019t treat whistle-blowers as heroes; he broke records prosecuting them. He didn\u2019t end no-bid contracts; he increased them. He didn\u2019t ban lobbyists; he recruited them. (Healthcare industry consultants drove that team; he even hired a defense lobbyist to oversee Pentagon procurement policy.) Revolving doors kept swinging; every ex-Obama staffer you ever heard of now sits on some comfy corporate perch. Republicans didn\u2019t kill the reforms. Obama had the power to implement each one by executive order, but chose not to.\n\nIn 2008, Obama raised more money from big business than any candidate in either party\u2019s history and in 2009 he hired the most conservative economic team of any Democratic president since Grover Cleveland. He then sided with insurers against a public option, with banks against rescuing homeowners and with business against raising the minimum wage. If you\u2019re highly educated and care more about cultural than economic issues, you may not have noticed. If you\u2019re financially pressed, you may be torn between Sanders and Trump, or have given up on politics altogether.\n\nClinton calls it an \u201cartful smear\u201d to suggest that she, Obama or any Democrat is influenced by the money they say corrupts every Republican. Her anger is partly a pose. But any card-carrying member of the establishment will take any suggestion that the system is compromised as a personal insult. This is true of elite reporters as well as politicians.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The key 2016 issue is outrage over a rigged system by special interests.
