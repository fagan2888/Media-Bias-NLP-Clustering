Many are rolling out perks such as free gym membership, commuting subsidies, even pet health insurance.\n\nBut often, those benefits are being provided in lieu of higher salaries. Government data shows the growth in spending on benefits is outpacing gains in wages. Companies say the structure caters to the growing workforce of finicky millennials who prize flexibility over stability and allows them to reward star employees without increasing fixed costs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this seismic shift,\u201d said Gary Burnison, chief executive of Korn Ferry, an executive search and talent management firm. \u201cAnd I think one of those is that the raise has gone the way of the gold watch.\u201d\n\nThe decline of the raise could help explain one of the most frustrating puzzles of America\u2019s lumbering economic recovery: stagnant wages. Wage growth has been stuck at about 2 percent for the past five years despite a rapid drop in unemployment and a surge in hiring since 2014. Without a bigger bump in their paychecks, many workers feel the recovery remains elusive.\n\nBut some economists say the focus on wages is shortsighted. Bonuses and other awards have spiked to the highest level in more than three decades, according to an analysis by Aon Hewitt. A survey this summer by a human resources industry group found about 35 percent of companies increased spending on benefits, up 7 percentage points from the previous year. That included health care, bonuses, vacation time and tuition reimbursement \u2014 making up about a third of workers\u2019 total compensation.\n\n\u201cWages tell you almost nothing,\u201d said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt has changed over the last 20 to 30 years as companies try to compensate workers in a way that matches their lifestyle.\u201d\n\nWhen Ashley Chandler went beyond the call of duty at her sales job, she was rewarded not with a bigger paycheck but with something she said was just as valuable: time.\n\nThe 25-year-old spent weeks poring over paperwork at the flooring installation company where she works in North Carolina to help one of the managers close some complicated projects on time \u2014 the type of dedication that a generation ago might have placed Chandler first in line for a big raise at the end of the year.\n\nBut at MonMan, which manufactures and installs high-tech floors, Chandler received three extra days of paid time off.\n\n\u201cWould I like to make more? I think everybody would like to make more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for me, what I liked most about it was the flexibility.\u201d\n\nThe shift toward bigger benefits and smaller salary increases accelerated as firms tightened their belts following the financial crisis, experts say, but it is rooted in broader demographic changes in the nation\u2019s workforce. Millennials say they prize the freedom to work away from their cubicles, while businesses have learned that flexible compensation can help the bottom line.\n\nAt MonMan, Chandler\u2019s boss, Ryan Hulland, used to give employees 6 percent or 7 percent raises, no questions asked. But that was before the 2008 financial crisis, when the boom in high-tech construction that drove sales of the company\u2019s specialty flooring began to drop off. In downtown Charlotte, N.C., Hulland saw work grind to a halt on the gleaming skyscraper Wachovia Bank once planned to use as its corporate headquarters. The bank was taken over by Wells Fargo, and Hulland was determined that his company would not meet a similar fate.\n\nSo he slashed raises to 3 percent and began searching for other ways to reward his best employees.\n\nHulland started by giving out $100 gift cards and was taken aback by how excited workers were to receive them. Encouraged by the response, Hulland began offering an intangible reward: extra paid time off.\n\nThough the dollar amount didn\u2019t make up for the smaller raises, human resources experts say such rewards provide a more immediate psychological boost, particularly when times are tight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we give people gifts at Christmas and not just bags of money,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, an economist at job search firm Glassdoor. \u201cThey can build a relationship that goes beyond a paycheck.\u201d\n\nYlan Q.
