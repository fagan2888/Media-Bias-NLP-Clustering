Ben Carson finds a skeptical audience in Baltimore\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 Republican leaders have talked obsessively about the need to appeal to more minority voters in 2016, after a disastrous showing in the last presidential election. But it wasn\u2019t until Thursday that a GOP presidential candidate actually visited this city, the country\u2019s current heart of racial tensions.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who lived here in Baltimore for 36 years, returned Thursday afternoon for a roundtable with a largely African American group of clergy members and businesspeople to discuss what his team called the \u201cneed for healing\u201d following the death of a young man in police custody, and the subsequent riots that tore through the city.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCarson, a long-shot presidential candidate whose support so far is largely from the most conservative element of the GOP, is African American and grew up in extreme poverty in Detroit and Boston. (He was so poor, he has said, that when he went to the state fair as a child, he couldn\u2019t afford to go on any rides or even buy cotton candy.) Carson\u2019s team believes he is uniquely able to connect to poor and minority communities by telling his personal story, and they saw an opportunity for him to speak out this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Carson put that theory to the test, to mixed reviews. He drew on his life experiences to articulate a view that police brutality is real \u2014 \u201cI got used to [seeing] people having the crap beat out of them by police\u201d \u2014 but that it\u2019s generally targeted at people who are \u201cdoing some wrong stuff.\u201d The comments show a tension that all the GOP contenders are grappling with: how to appear compassionate to a black community that feels deeply wronged, while showing support for police as they seek the nomination of a party that deeply values law and order.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the levels of honesty that has to be had within the community,\u201d said Carson, who as a Johns Hopkins pediatric neurosurgeon regularly operated on gunshot wounds to the head. \u201cPeople must be willing to admit this is a two-way street. I don\u2019t think police go around looking for people to abuse, but I do think if people are doing things, sometimes a situation gets out of hand.\u201d\n\nCarson was hesitant to weigh in on State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby\u2019s decision to charge six members of the Baltimore police force for their involvement in the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.\n\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have charged them to that degree, but then again I\u2019m not a lawyer, I\u2019m not a district attorney,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, none of us have seen the evidence she has seen. So without seeing the evidence it\u2019s impossible to really weigh in.\u201d\n\nBut he did say, drawing on his medical experience, that Gray must have sustained \u201cdirect trauma to the spine.\u201d While Carson said he didn\u2019t believe there was intent to kill Gray, he noted that \u201cobviously that looks very suspicious to the community.\u201d\n\nThe room was full of people who weren\u2019t necessarily Republicans, but who were \u201copen\u201d to hearing Carson\u2019s viewpoint, said Edwin Avent, a local entrepreneur who said he had invited about half the attendees. But the openness only went so far: Carson faced a bevy of skeptical questions, including from Avent, who pressed him on what he would do about mass incarceration (Carson\u2019s response: Improve the economy so there were more jobs available and fewer people would turn to drugs; later, he expressed support for body cameras on police and said he\u2019d be open to looking at \u201call sentencing\u201d requirements).\n\nAnother attendee pushed Carson to talk more about racism and racial issues, and a third, hedge-fund manager Kevin Davis, interrupted to demand that students in attendance discuss their relationships with the police, and at least one went into detail about feeling singled out for being black.\n\n\u201cThese are the good kids,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTheir frustration is real.\u201d\n\nCarson responded by calling on police officers to get to know the communities where they work, so that a child\u2019s first interaction with a cop is a positive one \u2014 playing catch together, for instance \u2014 rather than a contentious one. And he told several students from rough neighborhoods who were in attendance that he escaped his rough childhood by reading books. One attendee ridiculed that suggestion, saying that not every child in the inner city has a mother like Carson\u2019s, who insisted her children read.\n\nBaltimore has proven a perilous topic for other 2016ers. On the Republican side, Rand Paul \u2014 the most vocal in the field in calling for criminal-justice reform \u2014 drew fire for saying he was glad his train didn\u2019t stop in Baltimore. Among Democrats, Martin O\u2019Malley has swatted away complaints that, as Baltimore mayor from 1999 to 2006, he presided over an era of hyper-aggressive policing that contributed to the city\u2019s recent explosion of street violence. Hillary Clinton called for an end to the \u201cera of mass incarceration\u201d \u2014 only to have people note her advocacy of her husband\u2019s tough-on-crime policies as first lady.\n\nAnd on Thursday, Carson faced his share of tense moments. But the conservative bomb-thrower who once equated Obamacare with slavery and has likened the Obama era to the Third Reich also demonstrated that he can tone it down on occasion. When one attendee asked if the president\u2019s health-care law had any redeeming qualities, he said the \u201cconcept of providing coverage for indigent people\u201d who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have coverage is \u201credeeming,\u201d and allowed that \u201cmaybe the intentions were good,\u201d even if he disagreed with the actual law.\n\nCarson was better able to connect on issues he\u2019s written and spoken about for years, earning murmurs of agreement as he talked about education as the ticket out of poverty, and finding common ground with clergymembers and NGO workers by discussing the importance of strong families.\n\nThe roundtable came together within the last 48 hours, but Carson\u2019s team said the candidate, who announced his White House run on Monday, has wanted to weigh in on Baltimore since the controversy over Gray\u2019s death erupted late last month. They view him as an effective voice who can relate both to people who feel Gray was wrongfully killed, and to those who deplore the rioting.\n\nThe audience was a more conservative one than Carson might find in the broader black community \u2014 filled with clergy who agreed with him on social issues and with business-minded people who liked his economic posture \u2014 but there was also at least one school counselor who noted her distaste for school choice, an indication that the crowd was not overwhelmingly friendly. And several people interviewed said they had low expectations for Carson\u2019s politics coming in, and were at least somewhat pleasantly surprised.\n\nAvent found Carson \u201cto be as intelligent as I thought I\u2019d find him, to be engaging, and he listened. Those are starting points.\u201d\n\nDavis, the hedge-fund manager who was a Republican National Committee delegate for George H.W. Bush in 1988 but more recently supported Barack Obama, said Carson \u201cseemed a little more open and receptive to some ideas that were put forth,\u201d including on promoting mental health in schools, than he had expected. But Davis, who prefers Ohio Gov. John Kasich for 2016, said he thought Carson was largely missing the point on concerns about mass incarceration and relationships between police and African Americans.\n\n\u201cIt was a lost opportunity because 99 percent of the adults in that room had bad encounters with the police, likewise the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been an opportunity for him to acknowledge [that].\u201d\n\nInstead, Davis noted, he responded with anecdotes about his cousin, who Carson said was beaten \u201chalf to death\u201d by police. But at the same time, Carson said, his cousin was \u201cdoing wrong stuff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He's the first GOP presidential candidate to visit the city amid its racial tensions.", "title": "Ben Carson finds a skeptical audience in Baltimore", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/ben-carson-finds-a-skeptical-audience-in-baltimore-117752.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/07/20150507_ben_carson_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,Baltimore,Ben Carson 2016,Baltimore Protests,Ben Carson,Elections 2016,Freddie Gray", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He's the first GOP presidential candidate to visit the city amid its racial tensions.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Carson, who lived in Baltimore for 36 years, returned for a roundtable with community leaders.\nCarson\u2019s team believes he is uniquely able to connect to poor and minority communities by telling his personal story, and they saw an opportunity for him to speak out this week.\nAvent found Carson \u201cto be as intelligent as I thought I\u2019d find him, to be engaging, and he listened.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the levels of honesty that has to be had within the community,\u201d said Carson, who as a Johns Hopkins pediatric neurosurgeon regularly operated on gunshot wounds to the head.\nBen Carson finds a skeptical audience in BaltimoreBALTIMORE \u2014 Republican leaders have talked obsessively about the need to appeal to more minority voters in 2016, after a disastrous showing in the last presidential election."}
