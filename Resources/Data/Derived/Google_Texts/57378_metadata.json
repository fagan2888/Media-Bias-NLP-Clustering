The exam, researchers reported, did cause harm: One-third of women reported discomfort, pain, embarrassment or anxiety \u2014 leading some to avoid care altogether. For roughly 1 percent of women, a suspicious finding triggered a cascade of anxiety-provoking interventions \u2014 including tests and surgery, which carry a risk of complications for conditions that nearly always turned out to be benign.\n\n[Ever wonder how doctors learn how to do pelvic exams?]\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists fired back. Despite what the group acknowledged was a lack of evidence that \u201csupports or refutes\u201d the exam, ACOG strongly endorsed it, citing the \u201cclinical experience of gynecologists.\u201d Patients expect it, the group said, and the screening builds trust, reassures women and encourages them to discuss sensitive matters such as sexual dysfunction. A decision about whether to undergo the exam should be made by doctors and patients, ACOG concluded.\n\nThese dueling recommendations leave women in the unenviable position of sorting out what to do.\n\nThe uncertainty echoes the ongoing debate about whether women need mammograms annually or every two years. The decision about the pelvic exam may get easier in the coming months, if the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which is weighing the evidence, makes a recommendation. The Task Force, a volunteer advisory group of medical experts, is one of the organizations whose recommendations govern what is covered without a co-pay under the Affordable Care Act. A yearly \u201cwell-woman\u201d visit, which may include a pelvic exam, is currently among the services covered under the health law.\n\nThe debate over the pelvic exam exemplifies the thorny process of distinguishing effective care from that deemed by some experts to be \u201clow-value,\u201d an issue facing all specialties as medicine becomes increasingly evidence-based. The controversy also underscores the difficulty of changing long-established clinical practice and raises questions about the role of reimbursement in shaping physician behavior.\n\n[Why does being pregnant make people want to reach out and touch your belly?]\n\n\u201cThis is about what you believe might be helpful,\u201d said Judy Norsigian, former executive director of the Boston Women\u2019s Health Collective and a co-author of \u201cOur Bodies Ourselves,\u201d the groundbreaking feminist health book first published by the group in 1970. \u201cEveryone brings into this decision their values and concerns about the medical system,\u201d and must weigh the risk of overtreatment against the failure to detect something important. \u201cThe question is: Which risk do you want to take? Women have very different views on this.\u201d\n\nTo George Sawaya, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine, \u201cThe question is: What should we be doing in that well-woman visit?\u201d He regards the routine exam as \u201cmore of a ritual than an evidence-based practice.\u201d A 2013 study he co-authored found that many gynecologists erroneously believe the exam effectively screens for ovarian cancer. It doesn\u2019t; in fact, no effective screening method exists. And Sawaya\u2019s team found that among the reasons doctors do pelvic exams is to \u201censure adequate compensation\u201d for routine gynecological care and because patients expect it.\n\nBut Barbara Levy, ACOG\u2019s vice president for policy, said that clinical, not financial, concerns are the driving force. Gynecologists, Levy said, are \u201ctrying to provide the best service for patients that we can.\u201d In Levy\u2019s view, the ACP guidelines are misguided. \u201cA lack of evidence does not equal lack of benefit,\u201d she said.\n\n(Rebekka Dunlap for The Washington Post)\n\nScaling back Pap tests\n\nUntil recently, the annual pelvic exam, performed along with a Pap smear, a test that analyzes cells to screen for cervical cancer, was sacrosanct. But in 2009, the Pap recommendation was revised, after studies showed that most healthy women between 21 and 65 could wait three to five years after a normal Pap test before having another. After 65, most could stop getting a Pap test altogether.\n\nThe pelvic exam is performed on a woman who lies on a table naked from the waist down with her feet in stirrups. The doctor inserts two gloved fingers into the vagina, pressing on the lower abdomen with the other hand to check the size and position of the ovaries and uterus. A Pap test, performed during a pelvic exam, involves collecting a small number of cells from the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, which are analyzed in a lab for cancer or precancerous changes.\n\n[Older women enjoy sex, contrary to what some people assume]\n\nSome gynecologists say the increased interval between Pap tests has unsettled some patients. And the pelvic exam controversy has added to the confusion.\n\n\u201cMy experience is that patients are taken aback when told they don\u2019t have to have a pelvic exam,\u201d said Tamika Auguste, an OB/GYN at Washington Hospital Center. \u201cThey ask, \u2018Why am I here?\u2019 For women coming to the gynecologist it is expected.\u201d\n\nAuguste, chair of the D.C. chapter of ACOG and an associate professor at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, tells her patients that she recommends an annual exam \u201cto make sure things look okay on the outside and feel okay on the inside.\u201d Not one of them, she said, has opted out.\n\nUrogynecologist Jill Rabin, a professor at Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine in New York, said she has found conditions that needed prompt treatment, including melanoma, during a routine pelvic exam. \u201cIf you\u2019re counting on people waiting to come in with symptoms,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to come in late in the game.\u201d\n\nSupporters of routine exams often cite anecdotes in which a routine exam made a difference. \u201cStories are very powerful, but they are the antithesis of epidemiological evidence,\u201d Sawaya said. \u201cThe focus should be on symptoms, and on how to keep people healthy, not to turn healthy people into patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime we suggest something to someone in the name of prevention, we have to have a high bar for evidence of benefit,\u201d Sawaya added.\n\nOne of the first studies to suggest that routine pelvic exams were unnecessary, even potentially harmful, was published in 2011 by Carolyn Westhoff, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology who directs the division of family planning and preventive services at the Columbia University School of Medicine.\n\nWesthoff\u2019s team compared outcomes research in the United States and in parts of Western Europe, including the United Kingdom, where the exam is performed only on women who have symptoms, and found a huge disparity in hysterectomies, which they linked in part to the use of routine pelvic exams. (The U.S. rate is more than double that of Western European countries, including the United Kingdom.)\n\n[Home birthers feel misunderstood and harshly judged]\n\nPelvic exams, they concluded, are not recommended to screen for ovarian cancer, are not used to detect sexually transmitted infections, are not a prerequisite for many forms of contraception including birth control pills, and are \u201cuncomfortable, disliked by many women . . . use scarce time during a well woman visit\u201d and contribute to high health costs without a corresponding benefit.\n\nIn an interview, Westhoff said that doctors routinely find a lot of unimportant conditions and then \u201cstart ordering tests or more-frequent exams\u201d or surgery, which carries a risk of complications for things that don\u2019t need treatment. \u201cIf a woman is asymptomatic, we should leave well enough alone.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hard to stop doing it\u2019\n\nBut, Westhoff noted, the exam inspires fierce loyalty for reasons both cultural and financial. \u201cA pelvic is deeply embedded in what it means to be an OB-GYN. People who go into obstetrics are very action-oriented, very procedure-oriented,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a clinician myself, it was hard to stop doing it.\u201d Many gynecologists, she added, are \u201cnot going to get paid if [they] don\u2019t do a pelvic\u201d because insurance reimbursement is largely predicated on procedures.\n\nWesthoff said that some of her colleagues, only half in jest, have asked, \u201cCarolyn, are you trying to put us all out of business?\u201d Without the need for an annual pelvic exam or Pap test, some women without symptoms, particularly those who also see an internist or family physician, may skip their annual visit to the gynecologist.\n\n[Here\u2019s why more sex, even on \u2018off\u2019 days, may up your chances of pregnancy]\n\nTo Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women\u2019s Health Network, a Washington-based advocacy group, the pelvic exam consumes time that could be better spent screening for sexually transmitted diseases or discussing important issues such as blood pressure or diet. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an essential part of a well-woman exam,\u201d Pearson said, \u201cnor does it help women stay healthy.\u201d \u2019\n\nInternist Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, a past president of the American College of Physicians, tells patients the choice is theirs. \u201cFor something that\u2019s uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking, it\u2019s only fair for women to know what the evidence shows,\u201d said Fryhofer, who practices in Atlanta. Half of her patients request a pelvic exam, which \u201ctakes less time than discussing it.\u201d\n\nAt Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, gynecologists abandoned routine pelvic exams about a decade ago, after internal studies found little benefit.\n\n\u201cNow that we do cervical cancer screening every three years, we leave [a decision about the pelvic exam] up to the patient, and we certainly want to see them every three years,\u201d said Steven J. Masters, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser. Masters said he considers the value of the pelvic exam to be \u201cabsolutely nil,\u201d but he performs the exam if a patient requests it. Most of his patients, he said, are \u201cdelighted\u201d to skip it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about saving money at all, but about doing things based on outcomes rather than habit.\u201d\n\nBut ACOG\u2019s Levy said she believes the pelvic exam can be a bonding experience. \u201cIt opens the door and is a time of intimacy between the patient and care provider,\u201d encouraging patients to discuss sexual concerns, urinary incontinence and other issues they might otherwise avoid.\n\nNorsigian of \u201cOur Bodies Ourselves\u201d said it behooves consumers to make an informed choice. \u201cWomen should not be bullied by their doctors\u201d into having an exam, but should make the decision that best suits their circumstances, she said. \u201cMedicine is often slow to change, particularly in this field.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced through a collaboration between The Post and Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent news service that is a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, pelvic exam, stirrups", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The dreaded yearly exam has been an essential part of women\u2019s health care.
