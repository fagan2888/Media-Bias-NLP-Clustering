That meant cross country camps this summer in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. This season\u2019s version will be especially young, but it\u2019ll once again have the example of a good front-runner in senior Bonnie McKinnon. Central may make strides this season, but it might not be enough while competing in one of the toughest regions in the state.\n\nLAMBERT\n\nHead coach: Natalie Leonard, sixth season.\n\nLast season: Third at county meet, seventh at Region 6-AAAAAA.\n\nKey returners: Ashton Alcorn, sr.; Libby Bocko, so.; Haley Bolt, jr.; Kate Coriell, jr.; Anna McCarthy, jr.; Mae McKenna, jr. ; Elly Sherman, so.; Kaylee Stiwell, so.\n\nKey newcomers: Lindsey Allen, fr.; Alycia Huntington, fr.; Brianna O\u2019Neal, fr.; Ashley Rossiollo, fr.; Katie Schwind, so.\n\nOutlook: Lady Longhorns head coach Natalie Leonard has her team embracing the role of underdog this season. That\u2019s understandable, considering Lambert shares a region with state heavyweights Northview, South Forsyth and West Forsyth. But Lambert does have a strong leader in junior Mae McKenna. Sophomore Katie Schwind could be a big addition for the Lady Longhorns. She played softball last season, but is devoted to cross country after an encouraging track season. Otherwise, Lambert is still the midst of a youth movement, with only four seniors among 54 girl runners in the program.\n\nNORTH FORSYTH\n\n\n\nCoach: Heather Moore, first season.\n\nLast season: Fourth at county meet, ninth at Region 6-AAAAAA.\n\nKey returners: Gigi Fulkerson, sr.; Nina Carter, sr.\n\nKey newcomers: Kylee Howlin, fr.; Caitlin Lemieux, so.\n\nOutlook: The Lady Raiders have a tough climb up in Region 6-AAAAAA, especially with its third head coach in three years. But this is first-year head coach Heather Moore\u2019s third year with the program, so the transition shouldn\u2019t be as dramatic for North. It also helps to have senior Gigi Fulkerson, an experienced runner. Regardless, the Lady Raiders have work to do catch up in the county, let alone region.\n\nPINECREST ACADEMY\n\n\n\nCoach: Melissa Nevarez, second season.\n\nLast season: Sixth at Region 2-A meet.\n\nKey returners: Maria Carroll, sr.; Abbie Guard, jr.; Meghan Jennings, so.\n\nKey newcomers: Christina Aufleger, sr.; Charlotte Peronne, fr.\n\nOutlook: After something of a lull, Pinecrest hopes its program is starting to gain momentum after fielding a full competitive team last season. A middle school program returned after a two-year absence to help feed the high school ranks. The Lady Paladins might not be ready yet to contend, but it has a strong senior leader in Maria Carroll, who finished top 25 at region last season. She\u2019ll set a good example for the infusion of new and young runners joining the team this season.\n\nSOUTH FORSYTH\n\n\n\nCoach: Van Munn, fourth season.\n\nLast season: First at county meet, first at Region 6-AAAAAA meet, second at state meet.\n\nKey returners: Milicent Bergey, jr.; Savannah Carnahan, sr.; Kaylee Dupont, so.; Emma Maisel, sr.\n\nKey newcomers: None.\n\nOutlook: Few teams, runners Nos. 1 through 4, are stronger than the Lady War Eagles. This is, after all, the same core that helped South win Region 6-AAAAAA and place second in AAAAAA last season to region opponent Northview. Carnahan is the two-time Forsyth County News Girls Runner of the Year who finished fourth at state. Kaylee Dupont was a top-six finisher at state last season as a freshman. Milicent Bergey and Emma Maisel were both top-30 finishers. If South wants to take down Northview, it\u2019ll be spots five through seven that determine it.\n\nWEST FORSYTH\n\n\n\nCoach: Clayton Tillery, ninth season.\n\nLast season: Fifth at county meet, third at Region 6-AAAAAA meet, fourth at state meet.\n\nKey returners: Madison Bowers, sr.; Julie Ericson, jr.; Liz Galarza, jr.; Kaitlyn Griffith, sr.; Amanda MacArthur, so.; Dara Niemi, sr.; Stephanie Shea, jr.\n\nKey newcomers: Mallory Luskus, fr.; Regan Poteet, jr.\n\nOutlook: Huge things could be in store for the Lady Wolverines thanks to a strong nucleus returning and some key additions. Liz Galarza returns after finishing third individually at state last season. The Lady Wolverines also return strong contributors in Julie Ericson, Kaitlyn Griffith and Dara Niemi. Plus, two pivotal reinforcements are added: junior Regan Poteet, a transfer from Kell who finished sixth in AAAAA last season, and freshman Mallory Luskus, who placed eighth at the middle school state championship last season.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/27988/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2015/08/17/SF_Start1_web.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORSYTH CENTRAL", "title": "GIRLS CROSS COUNTRY PREVIEW: Team-by-team capsules"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "GIRLS CROSS COUNTRY PREVIEW: Team-by-team capsules"}, "article_summary": "Last season: First at county meet, first at Region 6-AAAAAA meet, second at state meet.\nLast season: Fifth at county meet, third at Region 6-AAAAAA meet, fourth at state meet.\n; Haley Bolt, jr.; Kate Coriell, jr.; Anna McCarthy, jr.; Mae McKenna, jr. ; Elly Sherman, so.\nLast season: Third at county meet, seventh at Region 6-AAAAAA.\nKey returners: Madison Bowers, sr.; Julie Ericson, jr.; Liz Galarza, jr.; Kaitlyn Griffith, sr.; Amanda MacArthur, so."}
