Just let me backfill things a bit.\n\nWhether its Macaca-gate or Todd Akin or PlameGate or Aaron Schock,, a Republican scandal is always run to ground by the media. When the media\u2019s done with it, we know the full truth, and the politician in the crosshairs is usually wounded, if not politically dead.\n\nBut when it comes to Benghazi or the IRS, the media is always looking for an off-ramp. The story is never run to ground. The media is done with the IRS story, and I have no real idea what all happened. I don\u2019t know who the bad guys were. The media shrugged over the missing emails.\n\nI think the reason the media is so far doing a good job of covering Hillary scandal has a lot to do with Trey Gowdy. He has learned from his predecessors\u2019 mistakes not to give the media reason to scream \u201coverreach!\u201d And I have to laugh because I have heard the media more than once admit they are waiting for that moment, even smart people like Chuck Todd.\n\nDo I think the media is going to stay on this story until we know all the facts? Absolutely not.\n\nEW: I do think the Hillary Clinton story is being run to ground, and I do think that fact is an effective counterpoint to claims of liberal bias in the MSM.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen the studies showing how news rooms tilt Democratic. I have no basis to challenge that, and my own anecdotal interactions support that. I do think there are things that matter more to reporters than ideology, and that\u2019s when public officials block reporters from getting information. That is a far stronger bias among reporters. They go nuts when people try to block information or circumvent their Freedom of Information requests.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton\u2019s past on the transparency front is a good explanation for why the media is going after the story. The primary bias in the media is getting the information, getting the story, getting the exclusive. And when people stand in the way of that, they are going to get the full force of the media backlash. Whether it\u2019s eventually run to ground in the way you\u2019re describing, I can\u2019t say. But the early indications are that the media is taking this serious. Look at the AP suit.\n\nBNN: I actually am impressed with the AP suit. And the AP appears to be writing stories and breaking news that sometimes goes against a dismissive attitude I see elsewhere in the MSM on some particulars of the scandal. All of a sudden the AP is saying, \u201cNo, this matters. This is a big deal.\u201d\n\nSo far I have to say that so far I\u2019m pretty happy with the way the media is covering it. So far.\n\nFACT CHECKERS\n\nBNN: Let\u2019s talk about fact checkers, just in general. I know you have colleagues and I\u2019m not trying to put you on the spot.\n\nEW: I saw your story on our fact checker. I even tweeted it out.\n\nBNN: I saw that. Thank you.\n\nEW: And I liked the way our guy [Glenn Kessler] responded to you, and took your concerns seriously.\n\nBNN: Very professional and responsive. I appreciated that very much.\n\nEW: Here are my thoughts on that specifically, and I told Glenn the same thing: You are saying that the Washington Post disproportionately targeted Republicans, and that\u2019s fine. My only point is that I don\u2019t think anyone can expect politicians from any party to lie at an even rate.\n\nBNN: That wasn\u2019t my approach with the Washington Post, though. My argument wasn\u2019t that Kessler was calling more Republicans liars, my issue was that, by 2-to-1, Republican statements were chosen for the fact check treatment.\n\nEW: So they started out more skeptical of Republicans.\n\nBNN: Whatever it was, over the course of three whole months, Republicans were targeted for scrutiny by 2-to-1. No Elizabeth Warren fact-checks over three months? Hillary was covered but never officially fact checked? But I just think that the general idea of the fact checker is wrong. So much \u201cfact checking\u201d is subjective. Sometimes something is just true but the fact checker will add all this subjective nonsense to make what is objectively true untrue.\n\nEW: You have company on the left. [MSNBC\u2019s Rachel] Maddow is famous for attacking PolitiFact. But here\u2019s the thing I like about them. The good ones like PolitiFact and Glenn give you all the resources. You don\u2019t necessarily have to agree with them, but all the material is laid out.\n\nBNN: When PolitiFact fact checks a quip from Ted Cruz about Iran celebrating \u201cHate America Day\u201d \u2014 everyone knows what he means, but they still call him a liar. It just goes too far. A subjective decision is made to get literal so Cruz can be called a liar. Kessler did this one once where Romney said Obama had never gone to Israel \u2014 and that was a fact. But Romney got Pinocchios because Kessler made a subjective decision to make certain context relevant. That\u2019s an opinion column, not a fact check.\n\nEW: PolitiFact is big on context too. Like the time Rachel Maddow went crazy on them. In a State of the Union speech, Obama took credit for creating so many jobs and PolitiFact said that wasn\u2019t entirely true because those jobs were not created as a result of his policies.\n\nBNN: Exactly!\n\nEW: You think she\u2019s right about that.\n\nBNN: I think she\u2019s dead right about that. That\u2019s a subjective decision to bring in subjective context. Put it on the opinion pages.\n\nEW: And you think that cudgel is used more often against Republicans.\n\nBNN: Much more often.\n\nFOX NEWS\n\nBNN: Let\u2019s move on to one of your favorite subjects, Fox News. Why don\u2019t any news outlets copy the extraordinary success of Fox News? I\u2019m not even talking ideology. I think one of the reasons Fox News is so successful, and even draws large number of Democrat viewers, is simply based on the fact that it\u2019s not part of the MSM\u2019s narrative plantation. Fox offers variety \u2014 different stories are covered. And when they cover a story everyone else is covering, you oftentimes get a different point of view and information.\n\nEW: Listen, the creation of Fox News was a masterstroke. Figuring out that there was a big audience looking for a counterpoint to the mainstream media is a massive coup, and I\u2019ve always maintained that Fox News is such a stroke of genius that they have a lot of latitude to work as they please in terms of how they present the news. Megyn Kelly can bump Sean Hannity who bumps Greta, and the audience remains. So it\u2019s not as if every programming decision Ailes makes is brilliant. I really like \u201cThe Five.\u201d It\u2019s entertaining, it\u2019s fun, the characters are great. But if you put someone else in there, it would still win the ratings.\n\nBut as far as your idea of news outlets choosing different top stories and presenting them in a different way, isn\u2019t Al Jazeera America doing that?\n\nBNN: (laughs) I have no idea. I don\u2019t get them on my cable.\n\nEW: They\u2019re trying the approach you suggest, and there you go. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s room for that. What Ailes and Murdoch are doing is a singular thing. There is no way to imitate or take any lessons from what they have done. Whether you want to copy Fox News ideologically or not, there are no lessons there for anyone else.\n\nBNN: If I were running MSNBC, if I were Phil Griffin, I would experiment with rigidly objective news programming. I think people would go for that. MSNBC\u2019s lost the left to CNN. In my opinion, CNN has moved so far to the left, MSNBC\u2019s audience has drifted to CNN.\n\nEW: You\u2019re forgetting that MSNBC released a memo at the end of last year admitting they have problems and that they are now going to get out there and gather news. Maybe they are taking your advice and trying to be more reportorial. In January, they sent people over to over the Charlie Hebdo massacre. But look at the ratings. That ain\u2019t working.\n\nBNN: That\u2019s because no sane person turns on MSNBC and believes that if you\u2019re looking for objectivity Thomas Roberts is an upgrade from Ronan Farrow and Joy Reid.\n\n(pause for mutual laughter of agreement)\n\nEW: The other problem is that MSNBC is the most boring thing on earth. You cannot stick with it. The programs aren\u2019t interesting. And they certainly won\u2019t get you the news first. I said this two years ago and I think it still applies: MSNBC\u2019s approach is \u201clet\u2019s agree TV.\u201d\n\nBNN: From what I can see, Fox doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nEW: One of the biggest misconceptions is that cable news is a shout-fest, when it\u2019s really people sitting around and agreeing. Fox does a significant degree of it, but you are right, there is honest dissent on Fox News. I think they could get some more powerful liberal voices, but they are there.\n\nFox isn\u2019t afraid to bring on a liberal hot shot who can articulate liberal views. The hosts tend to side with the conservative guest, but it\u2019s good TV, and they do spend a lot of money on reporting \u2014 some have reported that Fox has a larger news-gathering investment than either CNN or MSNBC. When Fox gets away from politics and race, it is straight up news.\n\nEveryone thinks I hate Fox News, but when they do good things I try to point it out. Over a very weak gun charge, Marine Jon Hammar was in prison in Mexico until December of 2012. Fox News \u2014 O\u2019Reilly, Greta and others \u2014 made releasing him a cause. Olivia Hammar, who is Jon Hammar\u2019s mom \u2014 she and I talk once in a while \u2014 she tells me that Bill O\u2019Reilly saved the life of her son.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal. This is an example of a news organization doing a legitimate good for one of our troops, above and beyond something like pausing for a moment.\n\nThat\u2019s a counter-example of the Brian Williams thing; someone really caring.\n\nOftentimes our media is shallow and self-serving in its praise of our nation\u2019s armed forces. I think the military senses it, too. Brian Williams often presents himself as a great champion of the military, but you can\u2019t be a great champion if you don\u2019t represent the facts.\n\nBNN: This was great. Thank you for being so generous with your time.\n\nEW: This was fun. Thanks for asking me.\n\nJohn Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Post's Erik Wemple\u2013The Breitbart News Interview, Part 3", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Washington Post's Erik Wemple\u2013The Breitbart News Interview, Part 3", "title": "Washington Post's Erik Wemple\u2013The Breitbart News Interview, Part 3 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Erik_Wemple_Borderstan-580x362-1.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-04-17T14:35:25-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/04/17/washington-posts-erik-wemple-the-breitbart-news-interview-part-3/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington Post's Erik Wemple\u2013The Breitbart News Interview, Part 3", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Erik_Wemple_Borderstan-580x362-1.jpg", "title": "Washington Post's Erik Wemple\u2013The Breitbart News Interview, Part 3 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "erik wemple, Hillary Clinton 2016, Hillary Clinton Email, The Washington Post,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-04-17T14:08:29-07:00", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T14:35:25-07:00", "tag": "The Washington Post", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "My only point is that I don\u2019t think anyone can expect politicians from any party to lie at an even rate.\nHILLARY\u2019S EMAIL SCANDALTHE WASHINGTON POST\u2019S ERIK WEMPLE: Just to push back a little, do you think the media is letting Hillary off easy with this email scandal?\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s room for that.\nDo I think the media is going to stay on this story until we know all the facts?\nAnd when people stand in the way of that, they are going to get the full force of the media backlash."}
