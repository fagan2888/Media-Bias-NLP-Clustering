The passenger with the more moderate injuries was also not identified, but was described as another pilot.\n\n\"The injuries were traumatic in nature, but they were not thermal,\" Pitkin County Sheriff's Office director of operations Alex Burchetta said. \"So the fire never reached inside the cabin as far as we can tell.\"\n\nFederal Aviation Administration spokesman Allan Kenitzer said there was not much information that could be confirmed early on.\n\n\"The airplane appears to be a Bombardier Challenger 600, coming from Tucson to Aspen. It crashed while attempting to land,\" Kenitzer said.\n\nMultiple witnesses, including singer LeAnn Rimes Cibrian and comedian Kevin Nealon, reported seeing the plane crash on twitter and wrote that smoke was coming from the site.\n\nAround 2:30 p.m. ET Nealon wrote, \"Horrible plane crash here at Aspen airport. Exploded into flames as it was landing. I think it was a private jet.\"\n\nAfter the crash, air traffic controllers directed emergency services to the crash and alerted other pilots that there had been a crash in the area.\n\n\"What's with all the smoke behind us at our 5 o'clock position?\" one pilot asked.\n\n\"There was an incident on the runway here sir,\" an air traffic controller replied.\n\nThe airport has been closed indefinitely following the crash.\n\nABC News' Matt Hosford contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The plane, which according to the Sheriff's Office had three people onboard, originated from Mexico and stopped in Tucson, Ariz., before arriving in Aspen.", "language": "english", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/At-least-1-dead-in-Aspen-Airport-plane-crash-238790811.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HT_aspen_plane_crash_dolak_130105_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The plane, which according to the Sheriff's Office had three people onboard, originated from Mexico and stopped in Tucson, Ariz., before arriving in Aspen.", "title": "UPDATE: At least 1 dead in Aspen Airport plane crash"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The plane, which according to the Sheriff's Office had three people onboard, originated from Mexico and stopped in Tucson, Ariz., before arriving in Aspen.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/At-least-1-dead-in-Aspen-Airport-plane-crash-238790811.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HT_aspen_plane_crash_dolak_130105_16x9_992.jpg", "title": "UPDATE: At least 1 dead in Aspen Airport plane crash", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "UPDATE: At least 1 dead in Aspen Airport plane crash", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE At least 1 dead, in Aspen Airport plane crash"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefbe\"", "article_summary": "ET Nealon wrote, \"Horrible plane crash here at Aspen airport.\ncourtesy @NicoSEnea / Nico Salvatore Enea/ABC NewsAt least one person is dead and another has serious injuries after a private plane crashed today at the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport in Aspen, Colo., the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office said.\nCo-pilot Sergio Carranza Brabata, 54, of Mexico, was killed in the crash, according to the Pitkin County Sheriff's office.\nThe plane, which according to the Sheriff's Office had three people onboard, originated from Mexico and stopped in Tucson, Ariz., before arriving in Aspen.\n\"The injuries were traumatic in nature, but they were not thermal,\" Pitkin County Sheriff's Office director of operations Alex Burchetta said."}
