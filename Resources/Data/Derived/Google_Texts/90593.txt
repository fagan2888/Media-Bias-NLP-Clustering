2 A.M. at The Cat's Pajamas

by Marie-Helene Bertino (Crown, 272 pages, $18.77 hardcover)

Ready to throw your eggnog at me? OK here goes. I am not fond of holiday stories.

That said, I loved this smart and quirky tale set on the day before Christmas Eve. It follows three lonely souls (and a dog with wanderlust) through the streets of Philadelphia. There's Madeleine, the feisty nine-year-old who can really sing; Sarina, the teacher with love troubles; and Lorca, the owner of the Cat's Pajamas jazz club. All three eventually meet up — like instruments in a spectacular finale — at the club's closing time.

Perfect for fans of Jennifer Egan, Karen Russell and anyone else seeking a fresh take on the magic that surrounds the season.
