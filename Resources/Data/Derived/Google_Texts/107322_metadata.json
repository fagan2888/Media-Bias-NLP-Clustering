The Iraqi central government then doles out the weapons as it sees fit. After pursuing this strategy for more than a decade, some analysts say that if President Obama starts unilaterally arming the Kurds, it would undermine his message that he has faith in the leadership abilities of the Iraqis.\n\nIndeed, even after the fall of Ramadi, where Iraqi forces were run out of the city by Islamic militants after an unexpected routing last month, the White House reaffirmed its strategy of supporting the Iraqi government through airstrikes and military training \u2014 but no U.S. boots on the ground or directly arming additional soldiers like the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe believe this policy remains the most effective way to support the Counter-ISIL Coalition efforts to combat ISIL and maintain a unified, federal, pluralistic and democratic state of Iraq, as envisioned in the Iraqi constitution,\u201d said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a Pentagon spokeswoman, in a statement.\n\nBut Republican 2016 presidential contenders are ready to break with that strategy.\n\nEven Sen. Rand Paul, a dove among GOP hawks, said he supports helping the Kurds.\n\n\u201cI think the only way this battle is won, ultimately, is with troops on the ground, but they need to be Arab troops,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said during a February interview on Fox\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d \u201cThe Kurds are the best fighters over there, [and] I think we really need to incorporate them.\u201d\n\nOther 2016 candidates who have formally announced they are running for the high office \u2014 such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former New York Gov. George Pataki and business executive Carly Fiorina \u2014 have stressed the need to work more collaboratively with allies in the region such as the Kurds, as well as the Jordanians, Turks and Egyptians.\n\n\u201cThere are a whole set of things we\u2019ve been asked to do by our allies who know this is their fight. And we\u2019re not doing any of them,\u201d Ms. Fiorina told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell last week. \u201cSo I would hold summit and talk with them about that.\u201d\n\nArming the Kurds does pose some risks, like giving rise to another sectarian conflict, but pressure does need to be put on the central Iraqi government to incorporate both the Kurdish peshmerga and the Sunni militias in their fight against the Islamic State and to not treat them as inferiors.\n\n\u201cThere are legitimate concerns of how you do this, but at the head of it is the fact that the U.S. needs to be willing to put serious pressure on the central government to provide arms and munitions to both the peshmerga and the Sunnis,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Shia-led government of Iraq is unwilling to let the peshmerga and Sunni tribes fight as equals against ISIS.\u201d\n\nSome Republican presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who announced his candidacy on Monday, former Sen. Rick Santorum, Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Rubio have also supported the U.S. putting some boots on the ground in Iraq, even if the position is politically unpopular.\n\nRecent polling has shown Americans are growing less supportive of sending U.S. troops to the fight against the Islamic State. Just 35 percent of likely voters support sending troops back to Iraq as part of an international coalition, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll released May 22. That\u2019s down from a 52 percent support rate in early February.\n\nHowever, Mr. Graham said that he would put an additional 10,000 U.S. service members on the ground in Iraq to combat radical Islamic terrorists. Mr. Santorum of Pennsylvania also supported an influx of that number during a speech in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference before he declared his candidacy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid some Americans have grown tired of fighting them. I have some bad news to share with you,\u201d Mr. Graham said in South Carolina when he announced he would run for president. \u201cThe radical Islamists are not tired of fighting you. In partnership with others, we must take the fight to them, building lines of defenses over there, so they can\u2019t come here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most Republican 2016 presidential contenders say they support arming Kurdish fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State, marking a clear departure from President Obama's current foreign strategy and a welcome game plan among military analysts, who say arming the Kurds is a must-do to defeat the terror organization.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Most Republican 2016 presidential contenders say they support arming Kurdish fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State, marking a clear departure from President Obama\u2019s current foreign strategy and a welcome game plan among military analysts, who say arming the Kurds is a must-do to defeat the terror organization.", "title": "Rand Paul, GOP back arming Kurds against Islamic State", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/rand-paul-gop-back-arming-kurds-against-islamic-st/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/6_7_2015_ap6611981934258201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/6_7_2015_ap6611981934258201.jpg", "description": "Most Republican 2016 presidential contenders say they support arming Kurdish fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State, marking a clear departure from President Obama's current foreign strate", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Rand Paul, GOP back arming Kurds against Islamic State"}, "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Richard Brennan, Iraq, Iraqi Government"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4625\"", "article_summary": "Recent polling has shown Americans are growing less supportive of sending U.S. troops to the fight against the Islamic State.\nEven Sen.
