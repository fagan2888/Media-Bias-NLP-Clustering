Berri Leslie will be administrator of Oregon's health insurance marketplace, Department of Consumer and Business Services Director Patrick Allen announced.

The marketplace will be housed at DCBS beginning June 30, 2015, and will help Oregonians access affordable, high-quality health insurance. Leslie's position is effective April 1, so she can hire staff and lead the transition of the marketplace functions from Cover Oregon to DCBS as set out in Senate Bill 1.

Leslie has been deputy administrator of the DCBS Insurance Division since July 2011, leading day-to-day operations of the division and working with stakeholders on implementing the Affordable Care Act. Other leadership roles include managing the regulation of mortgage lending in Oregon during the 2008 financial crisis and, more recently, leading a restructuring of the Oregon Construction Contractors Board.

"Berri has the experience, skills, and commitment we need to not only seamlessly transfer the marketplace duties to DCBS but to reach even more Oregonians with the tools and resources they need to get health coverage," Allen said. "She is a proven leader with a track record of successfully tackling challenging issues."

Leslie graduated from the University of Oregon with a bachelor's degree in political science and from Portland State University with a master's degree in public administration.

"I am excited to take on this new challenge to help Oregonians get the health coverage they need and, ultimately, improve their lives," Leslie said.

The Department of Consumer and Business Services is Oregon's largest business regulatory and consumer protection agency. For more information on the marketplace, visit http://www.oregon.gov/DCBS/health-marketplace/Pages/default.aspx.
