It includes 5 mini-roundabouts embedded in a giant one. Imagine driving that on the left side of the road!\n\nRoundabout. Traffic Circle. Rotary. According to the Harvard Dialect Study, we Americans are pretty divided about what to call a traffic circle, which is my own word of choice, like nearly 40% of the rest of you.\n\nBefore we headed to Burlington, Vermont, a few weeks ago, I checked out the same survey's results on what Vermonters would say:\n\nSo, Vermonters are in the heart of New England\u2019s Rotary Country.\n\n\n\nRead more Reinvention and resilience across the nation\n\nDisappointingly, we didn\u2019t find a single rotary to drive through during our few visits to Burlington.
