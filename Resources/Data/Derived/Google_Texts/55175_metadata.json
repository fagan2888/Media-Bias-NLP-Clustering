Still, the \u201cdeath panels\u201d conspiracy theory played a key role in reviving and rearticulating conservative power after the Bush years ended in calamitous disaster\u2014a rearticulation that has been overwhelmingly negative, thus leaving the door wide open for the likes of Donald Trump.\n\nNow, after years of seemingly endless contentless promises, votes and pledges to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare, there are rumblings that Republicans will actually try to do something next year. The American Enterprise Institute has released its \u201cAgenda for Reform,\u201d and in a blog post about it, Physicians for a National Health Plan explained that it was important to know what they had in mind, noting that \u201cSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan has promised this next year a comprehensive Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe only problem is that the core of AEI\u2019s reform plan\u2014the magical power of \u201cempowered consumers\u201d and \u201cconsumer-driven healthcare\u201d\u2014is every bit as mythical as the death panels were. The only difference is the death panels were Evil! Evil! Evil! while empowered consumer-driven healthcare is Good! Good! Good! At the L.A. Times, Michael Hiltzik explained:\n\nAmong the holy grails of would-be healthcare reformers, the holiest and grailiest quest is for the \u201cempowered consumer.\u201d This creature, armed with discernment about his or her medical needs and free choice of doctors and hospitals, will bring us to the paradise of low-cost medical care and uncompromisingly good health.\n\nJust like deregulating the financial sector made us all as rich as JP Morgan, right? It\u2019s a similarly ludicrous con-job, but with a somewhat different fatal flaw: Health care costs are heavily concentrated among a relatively small number of very sick people\u2014the top 1 percent of spenders account for more than one fifth of all spending, the top 5 percent for almost half\u2014and no amount of pundit incantations will magically turn them into \u201cempowered consumers.\u201d Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent account for just 3 percent of spending. In terms of cost, they don\u2019t seem to need any fixing at all. Yet, paradoxically, they\u2019re the best candidates for acting like \u201cempowered consumers.\u201d The top 5 percent are simply too sick, too desperate to qualify.\n\nThis high concentration of need is just the most glaring example of how deeply the \u201chealthcare market\u201d differs from the textbook fairytale of a perfectly competitive market, the natural habitat of the unicorn, I mean the \u201cempowered consumer.\u201d\n\nAs Hiltzik breaks it down, \u201ctrue consumer-driven healthcare requires three things,\u201d price information for competing providers, reliable outcome data, and \u201cconsumers who are inclined or able to base their healthcare decisions on the first two factors.\u201d The first two are difficult enough to obtain\u2014comparative outcome data \u201care hard for even trained clinicians to determine, and even then only after years of research,\u201d Hiltzik notes, \u201cexpecting patients to have this data at hand is chimerical\u201d\u2014but the third is virtually impossible. As already noted, the sickest 5 percent, accounting for 50 percent of costs, simply aren\u2019t able to base their decisions on price and outcome data. But what about the rest?\n\nHere, too, there\u2019s an utter divorce from reality. Hiltzik quotes Amitabh Chandra of Harvard from a piece at Forbes, where he\u2019s identified as \u201ccenter-right,\u201d in a piece aimed at mapping out middle-ground positions. \u201cSimply calling a patient a consumer doesn\u2019t make buying healthcare like buying cars,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cIn healthcare, the consumer (i.e. the patient) is sick, tired, confused, distracted\u2014they want their doctor or their insurer to help them manage the health-care that they need. Making them deal with a high-deductible plan is double jeopardy: first, they get hit with an illness. And then we hit them financially and cognitively. It\u2019s not fair. And it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBut high-deductible health plans [HDHPs] are one of the key elements in the AEI approach. They put consumers\u2019 \u201cskin in the game,\u201d which is what \u201cempowers\u201d them to \u201cmake smart choices\u201d and \u201cdrive costs down.\u201d It all makes perfectly wonderful good sense\u2014magical, even\u2014just like unicorns and virgins. But the internal logic of the fairy tale has nothing to do with the real world, except in superficially misleading ways, as Chandra explained:\n\nThere is no industry which has reduced costs without engaging customers. So it\u2019s tempting to think that we can do this in healthcare\u2014through a combination of \u201cskin-in-the-game\u201d health plans (a.k.a. high-deductible plans) and transparency tools to encourage shopping.\n\nBut Chandra studied the actual workings of such a plan, a \u201cnatural experiment that occurred at a large self-insured firm with tech-savvy and well-paid employees,\u201d he explained. If ever there was a group of consumers prepared to be \u201cempowered,\u201d this group was it. And at first, it really looked to be working:\n\nThis firm moved its employees from an insurance plan that provided free healthcare to a non-linear, high deductible plan. The switch caused a spending reduction of 12%\u2014 so HDHPs certainly save money. A 12% saving is really large. If the result is general, it implies that moving everyone to such plans would save about $300 billion annually!\n\nSounds great! Except, that\u2019s just what I meant by \u201csuperficially misleading,\u201d as Chandra goes on to explain:\n\nBut once we peeked under the hood, what we saw really troubled us. First, we found no evidence of consumers learning to price shop after two years in high-deductible coverage. None. So strike one. We also found that consumers reduce quantities across the spectrum of healthcare services, including potentially valuable care (e.g., preventive services) and potentially wasteful care (e.g., imaging services). So they don\u2019t know what care is valuable and what isn\u2019t. Strike two. We then leverage the unique data environment to study how consumers respond to the complex structure of the high-deductible contract. We find that half of all reductions come for the sickest consumers, while they are under the deductible, despite the fact that these consumers have quite low end of year prices as a result of their sickness. In other words, consumers respond to prices but they\u2019re responding to the wrong prices\u2014they don\u2019t fully understand the complicated structure of the HDHP. Strike three.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what a center-right expert had to say. It\u2019s not surprising, really. The first modern welfare state, Germany\u2019s, was established by conservatives\u2014partly to steal the socialists\u2019 most popular idea and undercut their political support, and partly to meet a number of conservative\u2019s goals: slowing the flow of emigration to America, making German industry more able to compete with Britain, reinforcing elite/state power and gender roles. Conservatives elsewhere either followed suit or came to support welfare states created by others. And health care is a key component in all such systems. Only U.S. conservatives have such a visceral, long-standing animosity to what conservatives elsewhere recognize as a practical, efficient way of dealing with basic human needs that simply don\u2019t fit into the Coke-or-Pepsi consumer preference market model. Make that elite U.S. conservatives, since the overwhelming majority of self-identified conservative voters have no interest in having their Medicare and Social Security taken away from them\u2014which is one reason Trump appeals to them much more than AEI does.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans use fancier terms than \"death panels\" now, but with same goal: Turning people against their health care", "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans use fancier terms than \"death panels\" now, but with same goal: Turning people against their health care", "title": "They\u2019re still gunning for Obamacare: Make no mistake, the right will not rest until they\u2019ve destroyed your health care", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/02/theyre_still_gunning_for_obamacare_make_no_mistake_the_right_will_not_rest_until_theyve_destroyed_your_health_care/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/12/rubio_cruz_ryan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans use fancier terms than \"death panels\" now, but with same goal: Turning people against their health care", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/12/rubio_cruz_ryan.jpg", "title": "They\u2019re still gunning for Obamacare: Make no mistake, the right will not rest until they\u2019ve destroyed your health care", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "They\u2019re still gunning for Obamacare: Make no mistake, the right will not rest until they\u2019ve destroyed your health care", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Health Care, Obamacare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Health Care, Obamacare, NewsMass hysteria over the conspiracy theory of government \u201cdeath panels\u201d may have been the key to rallying massive opposition to health care reform in the summer of 2010, but it only managed to make the end result more compromised, not to kill it outright.\nYet, paradoxically, they\u2019re the best candidates for acting like \u201cempowered consumers.\u201d The top 5 percent are simply too sick, too desperate to qualify.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dBut high-deductible health plans [HDHPs] are one of the key elements in the AEI approach.\nAnd health care is a key component in all such systems.\nMaking them deal with a high-deductible plan is double jeopardy: first, they get hit with an illness."}
