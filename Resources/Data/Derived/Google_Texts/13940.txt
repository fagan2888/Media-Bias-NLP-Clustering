Two very important people were at the Oakland Heights Masonic Lodge.

Winfrey Sikes celebrated his 100th birthday at the Oakland Heights Masonic Lodge Saturday. Among those in attendance was the grand master of the Mississippi Masons. Sikes was born on Dec. 3rd of 1915 and has been a member of the lodge since 1944.

"Well, the only thing I can say is I just thank the good lord for sparing me, and I thank my family for looking after me and agreeing with what I did," 100 year old Winfrey Sikes says.

Also a member of the Wesley House was there to accept a donation to the Coats for Kids campaign from the lodge.
