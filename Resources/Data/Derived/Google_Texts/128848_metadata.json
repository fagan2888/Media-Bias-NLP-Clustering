Gordon Klingenschmitt was confronted at the state capitol with questions about his \u201ccontroversial, tax-exempt charity.\u201d\n\nIn what is becoming a familiar scene when Republicans are questioned, rather than actually responding, Klingenschmitt pulled a Michele Bachmann and fled the scene as fast as his feet could carry him.\n\nTo add to the insult, he called security to eject the Colorado Government Watch team from the building.\n\nBecause questions.\n\nColorado Government Watch explains what happened:\n\nFlanked by a uniformed Colorado State Patrol officer, the first-term Colorado Springs legislator refused an interview when approached outside the chamber of the state House of Representatives by CoGW Executive Director Dede Laugesen. Klingenschmitt then stormed off as Laugesen called out questions about whether the lawmaker was using his nationwide nonprofit religious ministry\u2014which has raised more than $1 million since 2010\u2014to drum up business for his parallel for-profit operation.\n\n\n\nThe state trooper blocked Laugesen and an associate from following Klingenschmitt\u2014into a common area used by the public on the State Capitol\u2019s second floor\u2014and he ushered them out of the building.\n\nWatch Klingenschmitt flee scrutiny courtesy of Colorado Government Watch:\n\nKlingenschmitt\u2019s charity is a big deal because, as is explained,\n\nPersuade the World Ministries, also known as Pray in Jesus Name\u2014a 501(c)(3) Colorado nonprofit corporation whose only officer is Klingenschmitt\u2014took in more than $850,000 in tax-deductible contributions in 2014 and over $1 million since 2010, its latest tax returns show.\n\nPerhaps he should rename it \u201crake in money in Jesus\u2019 name\u201d because as we all know, Jesus was all into raking in the dough, running for office, and then denying people the rights he himself enjoyed. Oh wait, no, that\u2019s pretty much any Republican politician you care to name.\n\nBut Klingenschmitt is a special case. In 2014, the disgraced former Navy chaplain, who had already said he wants to kill liberals, brought his demonic obsessions to the Colorado State Senate and things haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nThis is a man who has claimed Allah is Satan, that if you\u2019re not welcome in a church you can\u2019t use a public rest room, and that a suitable replacement for the Affordable Care Act is \u2013 God.\n\nBecause the world is full of people who have never died while praying to God for healing. Overpopulation is due to these people whom God stubbornly refuses to let die, not new births. Seriously. It\u2019s a problem.\n\nThe real problem, of course, is Republican corruption. There are admittedly a great deal more corrupt Republicans than people who refuse to die of disease without health insurance. Look at Red State after Red State if you want evidence.\n\nBut here is a man who claims to represent the \u201cAlmighty\u201d while lying for a living and screwing over not only the people he pretends to represent but people unwittingly lining his pockets while he claims (without evidence) to support an orphanage in India.\n\nHe won\u2019t even release his tax returns, which he is required to do by law. State capitals in America are full of people like Klingenschmitt. Trump should not have been a surprise to anyone.\n\nThis is the Religious Right, America. Right here in the person of Gordon Klingenschmitt, who has sanctified his foul deeds by claiming he is serving God. Don\u2019t expect him \u2013 or the Religious Right \u2013 to away any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Klingenschmitt sees demons everywhere, so maybe that's what he thought he saw when he called security to eject a journalist asking a question", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Klingenschmitt sees demons everywhere, so maybe that's what he thought he saw when he called security to eject a journalist asking a question", "title": "Colorado State Rep.
