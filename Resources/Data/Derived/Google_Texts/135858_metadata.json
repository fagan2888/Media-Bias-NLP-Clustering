I was a wet-behind-the-ears political reporter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe this guy\u2014this charismatically challenged, hushed-spoken congressman\u2014was the favorite to take the legendarily smooth Paul Laxalt\u2019s place. How could he win?\n\nHe did. Now, five terms later, the man who is arguably the most powerful and influential elected official in Nevada history has changed state and national politics by announcing he will not run.\n\nI can\u2019t believe it.\n\nReid may be a retiring sort, but I never thought he would retire. He has no real hobbies except pounding Republicans and brothers whose last name is Koch. I never figured this guy for settling into an easy chair anywhere, even in his new Las Vegas home, his feet up on the ottoman, watching Bryce Harper.\n\nEven after his crushing eye injury, I didn\u2019t think he would leave. But what I think happened is that, as someone close to the senator suggested, Reid decided that having his face blasted by a piece of exercise equipment forced him to step back and say: I\u2019m old. It\u2019s time.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid of losing. Even those who despise Reid know he has this special kind of vertebrae that don\u2019t allow him to back down. His health is otherwise fine, and he arguably is more at home as a minority leader, launching political Scuds Mitch McConnell\u2019s way.\n\nThis was an intensely personal and intensely secretive decision. Not even his closest friends knew until Reid and top aides started making phone calls before dawn in Nevada. This was between Reid and his wife, Landra, who is by far the most influential person in his life. Even some of his kids were not aware.\n\nOne person who knew put it succinctly: \u201cThe honest truth: He didn't want to be the old senile guy in the Senate. That people looked at and said he used to be sharp. And he wants to win the majority back and go out on top. Prospect of another eight years was too long. 2 or 4 yes; 8 no. And he would never allow his seat to be appointed by R governor. So now he can pick who he wants to run in his seat.\u201d\n\nHe already has: Former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who has said she wants to be a U.S. senator. If she runs, she will be the favorite, and Reid will try to do what Laxalt did unsuccessfully nearly three decades ago: Pick and elect his successor.\n\nReid\u2019s legacy surely will be mixed. There are those who will say he was a nasty partisan, an obstructionist extraordinaire who destroyed the reputation of the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. (I believe the Senate may be libel proof.)\n\nBut for those who are not rabid haters or partisan critics, Reid\u2019s impact on the state and country in other ways are indelible. It\u2019s not hyperbole to suggest this guy was most responsible for the president\u2019s signature legislative achievement and for preventing the worst bill targeting Nevada from ever taking effect.\n\nI have always said that the Affordable Care Act should be called Reidcare not Obamacare because without the then-majority leader, the law would not have passed.\n\nReid all but bribed a few of his colleagues\u2014remember the Cornhusker Kickback and the Louisiana Purchase?\u2014to jam the bill through.\n\nAnd does anyone really think that nuclear waste wouldn\u2019t be buried 100 miles away from Las Vegas if Reid hadn\u2019t been where he has been? He strangled the project, pushed favorable appointees to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and persuaded the president to take it off the table.\n\nReid also has been Prince-like in his wielding of political power, singlehandedly controlling who runs and who doesn\u2019t, and not just in Nevada. In his home state, no Democratic candidate for major office in the last couple of decades has announced a candidacy without kissing Reid\u2019s ring. He has been a grandmaster, moving the pieces on a board he controlled. His meddling occasionally has backfired, but for the most part, what Harry wanted, Harry got.\n\nReid surely is the most feared pol in Nevada and has been for years. Yes, this guy, the pale senator with the black hat, unafraid to get what he wants and by almost any means necessary.\n\nMy relationship with the senator has been like the New York New York rollercoaster on the Strip. He has cut me off repeatedly for offenses real and imagined, but I still feel as if he represents the bookends to one chapter, the main chapter of my career. He is still the most interesting man in Nevada.\n\nReid is known for not saying goodbye, for just hanging up on people, be it the president or a pesky reporter. How fitting that there was no buildup to his exit announcement, just a sudden ending.\n\nThis guy just hung up on all of us.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Reid is known for not saying goodbye.
