Jeb Bush (R) hurried into the 2016 presidential race in part because he was concerned about questions surrounding his private-sector work. But at this point, those questions are apparently getting louder.\n\nTwo weeks ago, for example, the likely Republican candidate was eager to criticize President Obama\u2019s breakthrough on U.S. policy towards Cuba, but Bush\u2019s condemnations proved problematic when the public was reminded that Barclays reportedly paid Bush more than $1 million a year, even while the financial giant was being accused of violating Cuban sanctions.\n\nLate last week, as Jason Millman reported , a similar problem popped up.\n\nThe for-profit hospital chain Tenet Healthcare announced on Christmas Eve that Jeb Bush would be stepping down from its board of directors by the end of the year. Bush, who has served on the board of Tenet since 2007, is starting to cut his business ties as he explores a run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. And there\u2019s one obvious reason why keeping Tenet on his resume might not look so good politically: Tenet has benefited greatly from the Affordable Care Act, which much of the GOP base is still committed to repealing. Bush is giving up a lucrative board post. He earned $128,500 in cash plus $170,000 in stock last year for a total of $298,500 according to Tenet\u2019s 2013 proxy statement.\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, Jeb Bush isn\u2019t accused of doing anything wrong during his tenure on the company\u2019s board.\n\nHe\u2019s resigning, however, because as Politico put it , \u201cBush\u2019s involvement with Tenet could give ammunition to conservatives in the GOP who view him as too moderate \u2013 particularly those who despise the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth appreciating just how odd these circumstances are. A for-profit health care company made money through the for-profit American health care system. One of its board of directors earned quite a bit by way of the company\u2019s success. So, good for him? Actually, no, that\u2019s bad for him because Republican primary voters hate the American health care system and those who profit from it.\n\nKevin Drum added , \u201cIn normal times, Bush would have left Tenet because it\u2019s a big, soulless corporation that\u2019s paid fines for Medicare fraud and been criticized for dodgy tax practices at the same time it was beefing up executive pay. A man of the people who aspires to the Oval Office can\u2019t afford to be associated with this kind of dirty money. But no. At least if Politico is to be believed, this isn\u2019t really an issue in the GOP primary. What is an issue is that Tenet might have profited from Obamacare, which in turn means that Jeb may have profited from Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOf course, this will only get worse for Bush as the campaign begins in earnest. He\u2019s resigning from Barclays, but he\u2019ll have to answer questions about its work. He\u2019s resigning from Tenet\u2019s board, but that will require explanation, too. The foreign money invested in Bush\u2019s private-equity business has already generated questions, as has his work as an adviser to Lehman Brothers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Can a Republican presidential candidate profit off the Affordable Care Act and still garner support from far-right voters?
