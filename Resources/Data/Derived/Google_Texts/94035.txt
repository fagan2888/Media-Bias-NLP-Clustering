Former Broncos guard Chris Kuper has been hired by the Dolphins as their offensive quality control coach, reuniting him with former offensive coordinator Adam Gase.

“It’s great,” said Kuper, 33. “To be in a team setting is something I’ve always enjoyed and plan on thriving in it.”

Kuper, 2006 fifth-round draft pick by the Broncos, played eight seasons in Denver before retiring in March 2014, shortly after the Broncos’ loss to Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII. A string of injuries, including a dislocated ankle that required multiple surgeries and never fully healed, forced Kuper to the sidelines prematurely. But he didn’t stray too far.

Kuper stayed in Colorado after retiring and returned to football as a coach at Columbine High. He also teamed with former Nugget Chauncey Billups and former Bronco Brandon Stokley to open a D1 Sports Training complex in Highlands Ranch, and joined Boulder start-up Black Lab Sports as a managing partner.

Gase, the Broncos’ offensive coordinator from 2013-14, was hired as Miami’s head coach earlier this month after spending a season with the Bears as their offensive coordinator.

ESPN’s Adam Caplan first reported Kuper’s hiring.
