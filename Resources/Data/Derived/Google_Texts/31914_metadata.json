That would be me,\" Cruz told a Manchester, New Hampshire, audience. \"I don\u2019t have health care right now.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz explained that he had purchased an individual policy and that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas had canceled all of its individual policies in Texas, effective Dec. 31. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, who is on temporary leave from her job with Goldman Sachs, purchased an individual plan last year after previously receiving coverage through the Wall Street firm. A spokeswoman for Cruz's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to clarify his remarks.\n\n\"So our health care got canceled, we got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market. And so we\u2019re in the process of finding another policy,\" Cruz said. \"I hope by the end of the month we\u2019ll have a policy for our family. But our premiums \u2014 we just got a quote, our premiums are going up 50 percent. That\u2019s happening all over the country. That\u2019s happening in New Hampshire.\"\n\nIt would appear that news of the cancellation did not go over well in the Cruz household.\n\n\"By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you,\" he remarked. \"It\u2019s not a good \u2014 I\u2019ve had, shall we say, some intense conversations with Heidi on that.\"\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Texas did stop selling some of its individual policies for 2016 but not all of them. The company earlier said its individual PPO products \u2014 which give people a broader choice of providers \u2014 were no longer financially sustainable, so they were discontinued at the end of last year. Blue Cross HMO plans, which are more restrictive, are still available in Texas on HealthCare.gov, and other insurance companies in the state offer a variety of network types.\n\nAlso, while premiums did rise across the country this year, they did not spike 50 percent.\n\nRachana Pradhan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you.&quot;", "title": "Cruz reveals he doesn't have health insurance", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/ted-cruz-no-health-insurance-218070", "image": "http://static.politico.com/e9/78/801d7ace48c19007a90604ebd63c/160121-ted-cruz-1160-gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NickGassReports"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you.&quot;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Getty Cruz reveals he doesn't have health insuranceTed Cruz revealed on Thursday that he is not currently covered by any health insurance, chalking up the lack of coverage to Obamacare.\n\"By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you,\" he remarked.\n\"So our health care got canceled, we got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market.\nTed Cruz reportedly canceled his health insurance because of steeply rising premiums.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Texas did stop selling some of its individual policies for 2016 but not all of them."}
