The voluntary registry by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extends to all Zika-infected women and their babies throughout the United States.\n\nThe Puerto Rican governor, meanwhile, has declared a public health emergency, and the CDC, which earlier urged pregnant women to reconsider visits to Puerto Rico, has asked Congress for $250 million in emergency aid to battle Zika here. The CDC has also sent nearly 40 health workers to help, and is using the island as a test bed for Zika studies.\n\n\u201cFor the U.S., it really is the territory that is going to have the most infections,\u201d said Steve Waterman, head of the CDC\u2019s dengue branch in Puerto Rico. \u201cIt has the best medical and public health infrastructure to try and answer some of these questions at the same time that we\u2019re trying to control the disease.\u201d\n\nAmong the CDC\u2019s main goals is to test every pregnant woman in Puerto Rico for Zika and prevent people like Dominicci from contracting the virus. The CDC is urging people to take preventive measures, a call that Dominicci and her husband heeded after the first Zika case was reported in December.\n\n\u201cWe have locked ourselves up at home,\u201d said Dominicci, who is nearly 37 weeks pregnant. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant concern, especially for women like us who are so far along because our options are limited. Ending a pregnancy at this stage is not even legal.\u201d\n\nZika causes headaches, fever and a rash, though most people with the virus never show symptoms. CDC researchers in Brazil and Puerto Rico are trying to determine whether the virus can cause microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads, and a rare paralyzing condition, Guillain-Barre, which can be fatal.\n\nAt least 117 people have tested positive for Zika in Puerto Rico, including five pregnant women. At least five people have been hospitalized, including a man recovering from Guillain-Barre.\n\nWaterman said more than 20 percent of the island population could contract Zika in an outbreak that could peak by summer.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to protect as many pregnant women as possible and that is what we are trying to do,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Puerto Rico braces for wave of mosquito-borne Zika virus", "author": "Danica Coto", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Puerto Rico braces for wave of mosquito-borne Zika virus", "title": "Puerto Rico braces for wave of mosquito-borne Zika virus", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/27/puerto_rico_braces_for_wave_of_mosquito_borne_zika_virus/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/puerto-rico-zika-threat.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Puerto Rico braces for wave of mosquito-borne Zika virus", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/puerto-rico-zika-threat.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Puerto Rico braces for wave of mosquito-borne Zika virus", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Puerto Rico braces for wave of mosquito-borne Zika virus", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At least 117 people have tested positive for Zika in Puerto Rico, including five pregnant women.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Leilani Dominicci has all the typical worries of pregnant women plus a new one spreading across Puerto Rico: the fear she will become infected with the Zika virus and put her baby at risk.\n\u201cFor the U.S., it really is the territory that is going to have the most infections,\u201d said Steve Waterman, head of the CDC\u2019s dengue branch in Puerto Rico.\n\u201cOur objective is to protect as many pregnant women as possible and that is what we are trying to do,\u201d he said.\nThe Puerto Rican governor, meanwhile, has declared a public health emergency, and the CDC, which earlier urged pregnant women to reconsider visits to Puerto Rico, has asked Congress for $250 million in emergency aid to battle Zika here."}
