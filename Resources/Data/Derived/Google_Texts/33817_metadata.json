Nothing,\u201d he remarked. \u201cSo, I\u2019m leaning toward voting for Hillary unless something major comes up. I don\u2019t trust the Republicans anymore because they\u2019re wanting to repeal the Obamacare. And I don\u2019t want them to do that, man, because then I\u2019ll have to go to work again. My life\u2019s already planned out.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a tough decision,\u201d Webb sighed. \u201cI voted for Republicans for 32 years, I\u2019m a charter member of my Tea Party Patriots chapter. I\u2019m also a veteran of the U.S. Army under Reagan, when Reagan was in. That was great when Reagan was in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings have changed. So unless the Republicans change with it, I\u2019m probably going to have to swing my vote over toward Hillary.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from the Hot Lead YouTube channel.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tpp_hillary_150415a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "WATCH: Terrified \u2018Tea Party Patriot\u2019 realizes he could lose Obamacare if GOP wins in 2016"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd9c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd I\u2019m serious because I asked myself, \u2018Which party has helped me out the most in the last, I don\u2019t know, 15 years, 20?\u2019 And it was the Democrat [SIC] Party,\u201d Webb lamented.\n\u201cI voted for Republicans for 32 years, I\u2019m a charter member of my Tea Party Patriots chapter.\nI\u2019m also a veteran of the U.S. Army under Reagan, when Reagan was in.\nI don\u2019t trust the Republicans anymore because they\u2019re wanting to repeal the Obamacare.\nSo unless the Republicans change with it, I\u2019m probably going to have to swing my vote over toward Hillary.\u201dWatch the video below from the Hot Lead YouTube channel."}
