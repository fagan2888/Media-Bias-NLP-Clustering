Panicking, I launched into an explainer of the refugee situation. "That's not what we're talking about," the smoked poultry gobbled. Playing for time, I took a bite of turkey, then blanched as the bird began to scream.

"WHERE'S YOUR OBAMACARE NOW?" my meal shouted, every syllable loaded with agony. With a fistful of napkins I tried to stanch the flow of gravy; my relatives' grumbles turned to shouts as I stuffed their servings back into the bird.
