Though it is mainly on account of food prices. The RBI has been benchmarking it to the CPI numbers, I think it is unlikely,\" she added.\n\nWhile retail inflation in June rose to an eight-month high of 5.4%, the overall Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was (-)2.4% in the same month.\n\nRBI mostly tracks the consumer price inflation for its monetary policy decision.\n\n\"It would be a status quo.

I expect RBI to cut rates by 25-50 basis points this fiscal.\"\n\nIn its last bi-monthly monetary policy review on June 2, RBI cut repo rate 0.25% for the third time this year.\n\nDuring the calender year, RBI has reduced the rate thrice by 0.75%. It was cut by 0.25% each on March 4 and June 2.\n\nRBI cut the policy rate (the short-term lending rate) from 7.5% to 7.25% in June, but left all other policy tools such as cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) unchanged at 4 per cent and 21.5%, respectively.\n\nDBS in a research report said: \"The RBI meets next on August 4 and we expect the benchmark repo rate to be held unchanged at 7.25% after cumulative 75 bps cuts since January 2015.\"\n\nThe report said, if the official commentary signals a start to the US rate hiking cycle later this year, \"it will affirm our expectations that the RBI will maintain a prolonged pause on the rates front.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reserve Bank of India to face a tough choice on rate front on Tuesday - Most bankers and experts believe the possibility of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank on August 4 is very low as retail inflation remains high.", "copyright": "Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.", "og": {"site_name": "dna", "description": "Reserve Bank of India to face a tough choice on rate front on Tuesday - Most bankers and experts believe the possibility of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank on August 4 is very low as retail inflation remains high.", "title": "Reserve Bank of India to face a tough choice on rate front on Tuesday | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-reserve-bank-of-india-to-face-a-tough-choice-on-rate-front-on-tuesday-2110369", "image": "http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2015/08/03/361459-rajan-rbi-reuters-3-edited.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-02T17:01:00+05:30", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most bankers and experts believe the possibility of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank on August 4 is very low as retail inflation remains high.", "title": "Reserve Bank of India to face a tough choice on rate front on Tuesday", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-reserve-bank-of-india-to-face-a-tough-choice-on-rate-front-on-tuesday-2110369", "image": {"width": 187, "height": 92}, "creator": "@dna", "site": "@dna", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 1474930936151793}, "keywords": "India Business Report, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Rate cuts, Monetary Policy, Interest Rates, Third bi-monthly monetary policy, Raghuram Rajan, Reserve Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, US, DBS, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Ranjan Dhawan, SBI, India Inc, WPI, Price Index, Paresh Sukthankar", "article": {"section": "Money", "tag": "India Business Report, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Rate cuts, Monetary Policy, Interest Rates, Third bi-monthly monetary policy, Raghuram Rajan, Reserve Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, US, DBS, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Ranjan Dhawan, SBI, India Inc, WPI, Price Index, Paresh Sukthankar", "published_time": "2015-08-02T17:01:00+05:30"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "India Business Report, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Rate cuts, Monetary Policy, Interest Rates, Third bi-monthly monetary policy, Raghuram Rajan, Reserve Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, US, DBS, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Ranjan Dhawan, SBI, India Inc, WPI, Price Index, Paresh Sukthankar"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbec2\"", "article_summary": "However, India Inc is pitching for a rate cut because of low wholesale inflation and slowdown in industrial growth.\nMost bankers and experts believe the possibility of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank on August 4 is very low as retail inflation remains high.\n\"I am not expecting any rate cut,\" SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said.\nIn its last bi-monthly monetary policy review on June 2, RBI cut repo rate 0.25% for the third time this year.\nWith retail inflation showing no signs of abating, RBI to face tough choice on cutting rate second time this fiscal to meet government and industry expectations of lowering cost of borrowing to boost growth."}
