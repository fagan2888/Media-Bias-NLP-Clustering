Coffey received a business administration degree from the University of Wyoming and a transition to teaching certification in 2011 from Fort Hays State University. He is currently pursuing a master's degree in education.

He is part of his school's leadership team, the moderator of a monthly Twitter chat for educators and the co-founder of an annual Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics camp. He's also the head wrestling coach at Dodge City Middle School.

Coffey was chosen from among eight finalists.
