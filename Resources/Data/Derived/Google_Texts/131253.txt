A man is in custody after police bust a meth lab in his garage. Police were called to a report of suspicious activity in Bentley.

People in the neighborhood of York Court say they woke up early Sunday morning to all sorts of agencies swarming their block.

"A big red truck sitting out in the road running and it was a Homeland Security all over it and I thought what is going on," says Steve Jones.

After seeing crews in Hazmat suits immediately target a resident's garage, it didn't take long for neighbor Steve Jones to figure that out.

"He was brewing up some crack or meth or something like that."

Crews, trucks and equipment covered the end of the block starting in the morning.

"Then it's just been non stop all day long," adds Jones.

The Bentley Police Chief tells KAKE News Sunday was a busy day for dozens of officers from a long list of agencies working this scene. He says crews found items to manufacture meth in the resident's one stall garage. Tests are underway to determine the amount of drugs that have been seized.

Jones saw police place his neighbor in custody this morning.

"It's kind of strange in a small town, I'll say that," says Jones. "But hey, it's big excitement in a town like this."

The next-door neighbors to the bust were asked to leave their property for safety reasons as crews removed the lab.

Jones says learning about this meth lab isn't too surprising for his neighborhood, but he's ready for everything to calm down.

"I'll be glad to see it out from in front of my house, I couldn't go anywhere if I wanted to everything is so blocked in."

Police say this was the first meth lab bust in Bentley in the past two years. The Sedgwick County Sheriff's Department tells KAKE News they will update this case on Monday.
