Especially those in his own party.\n\nCarson\u2019s manner strikes some as odd, but Iowa voters seem to love it. \u201cThat smile and his soft voice makes people very comforted,\u201d one told the New York Times in a story about Carson\u2019s secret weapon. \u201cHe is kind when he speaks,\u201d another says. (No mention that some of his ideas are, let\u2019s be honest, utterly crazy.)\n\nCarson, it\u2019s worth pointing out, has no political experience at all: He is running on an inspiring back story, and on being untouched by the corrupt world of politics. But temperament clearly plays a role in his support as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s the role of calmness in politics past and present, and human interaction in general? Salon spoke to Justin Frank, a psychoanalyst at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. \u2014 and the author of \u201cObama on the Couch\u201d and \u201cBush on the Couch\u201d \u2014 about the appeal of calmness in unsteady times. The interview has been edited slightly for clarity.\n\nBen Carson is polling very high in Iowa. The New York Times argues that it\u2019s partly his mellow manner that is drawing people to him. Does that sound feasible to you?\n\nYes \u2013 that\u2019s very likely, and very feasible. I think people who are calm inspire confidence. And there\u2019s a difference between calm, like Ben Carson, and low energy, like Jeb Bush: He does not inspire confidence, because he is saying he can\u2019t take it, that he\u2019d rather do something else.\n\nBen Carson inspires confidence because he\u2019s calm, everyone knows he\u2019s smart. He\u2019s been a very important surgeon at Johns Hopkins, and people have confidence in him because of his steadiness.\n\nI also think that there\u2019s a calmness that people are not as willing to admit to themselves: Barack Obama has been a calm president. In the face of attack from all kinds of people, he\u2019s remained steady. He can transform the barbs into thought, so he\u2019s not just reactive. He\u2019s able to process attacks, take them seriously. In that way he\u2019s stronger than Ben Carson, who sticks much more to a set of political beliefs.\n\nTheres\u2019s two kinds of calm, then. [There\u2019s] the calm that can tolerate cognitive dissonance, that can tolerate more than one idea in one\u2019s mind that might be conflicting with another. And then there\u2019s calm like Ben Carson, which is confidence, but it\u2019s the confidence that comes from being sure he\u2019s right.\n\nYeah \u2013 there\u2019s a smugness to it.\n\nYes \u2013 it\u2019s a subtle form of arrogance. It reminds me of my days in medical school \u2013 we used to walk across the street and say, \u201cDon\u2019t hit me, I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d to the cars. There was an arrogant jokiness. It\u2019s something Carson, I think, has maintained over the years.\n\nPeople confuse calmness with steadiness and intelligence. He has a defensive attitude toward certainty. Some people are more tolerant of not always being certain. But people like their leaders to be certain. That\u2019s been one of Obama\u2019s problems \u2013 he thinks, so people think he\u2019s weak. But Carson gives a sense of being certain and being calm.\n\nI find certainty, as a psychoanalyst, as a defense against anxiety. And he\u2019s an absolutist. That is very appealing, compared to Trump, who seems to be all over the place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon speaks to the author of \"Obama on the Couch\" about why the GOP candidate's steady demeanor has him surging VIDEO", "author": "Scott Timberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon speaks to the author of \"Obama on the Couch\" about why the GOP candidate's steady demeanor has him surging VIDEO", "title": "Calm, confident, crazy Ben Carson: The \u201csubtle form of arrogance\u201d that\u2019s pushing him ahead in the polls", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/26/calm_confident_crazy_ben_carson_the_subtle_form_of_arrogance_thats_pushing_him_ahead_in_the_polls/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ben_carson11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon speaks to the author of \"Obama on the Couch\" about why the GOP candidate's steady demeanor has him surging VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ben_carson11.jpg", "title": "Calm, confident, crazy Ben Carson: The \u201csubtle form of arrogance\u201d that\u2019s pushing him ahead in the polls", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Calm, confident, crazy Ben Carson: The \u201csubtle form of arrogance\u201d that\u2019s pushing him ahead in the polls", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 presidential election, Ben Carson, electoral politics, GOP, Psychology, Republican Party, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Ben Carson inspires confidence because he\u2019s calm, everyone knows he\u2019s smart.\nAnd then there\u2019s calm like Ben Carson, which is confidence, but it\u2019s the confidence that comes from being sure he\u2019s right.\nThat\u2019s been one of Obama\u2019s problems \u2013 he thinks, so people think he\u2019s weak.\nIn that way he\u2019s stronger than Ben Carson, who sticks much more to a set of political beliefs.\nBen Carson is polling very high in Iowa."}
