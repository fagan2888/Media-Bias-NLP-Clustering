For example:\n\n\u201cPuritan New England: Fair warning to Quakers and Catholics: The Puritans sometimes cut off your ears and bored out your tongues, so skip this week if you don\u2019t want to hear or talk about that. Ditto for practitioners of Wicca, who will surely be alarmed by the trials of their sister witches at Salem.\u201d\n\n\u201cProhibition and the Roaring Twenties: Al Capone ran a massive crime ring before the Feds arrested him for tax evasion. Trigger alerts: Italian-Americans, accounting majors.\u201d\n\nAlthough Zimmerman\u2019s syllabus is satirical, many believe it illustrates how satisfying an inflated degree of hypersensitivity might threaten academic freedom.\n\nComfort vs. Intellectual Engagement\n\nIn September, the American Association of University Professors issued a lengthy report on trigger warnings in which the organization condemned their use in college classrooms and described an assortment of alleged issues they create.\n\n\u201cThe presumption that students need to be protected rather than challenged in a classroom is at once infantilizing and anti-intellectual. It makes comfort a higher priority than intellectual engagement,\u201d the report said.\n\nAccording to the AAUP, trigger warnings stifle faculty\u2019s discretion in choosing \u201ccourse materials and teaching methods;\u201d discourage critical thinking; draw too much attention to one theme or aspect of a complex topic, film or literary work; and \u201c[put] the onus for avoiding such responses on the teacher\u201d rather than referring students with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or other \u201ccases of serious trauma\u201d to health care professionals.\n\nThe AAUP report used Wellesley College as an example. Students there petitioned the university to relocate \u201ca sculpture of a man in his underwear because it might be a source of \u2018triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault,\u2019\u201d the report said.\n\nAAUP also noted the open-endedness of trigger warnings can single out \u201cpolitically controversial topics like sex, class, capitalism, and colonialism for attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf such topics are associated with triggers, correctly or not, they are likely to be marginalized if not avoided altogether by faculty who fear complaints for offending or discomforting some of their students,\u201d the report said.\n\nAccording to Lindsey Burke, the Will Skillman fellow in education at The Heritage Foundation, the debate over trigger warnings on college campuses serves to further discredit American higher education.\n\n\u201cIssues like this are part of the reason students, parents and employers are increasingly questioning the value of a bachelor\u2019s degree and even whether its time as a proxy of employability has passed,\u201d Burke told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe Role of Sexual Assault\n\nDigital trigger warnings, which first appeared in the feminist blogosphere on sites such as Jezebel and Feministing, have garnered attention in the last couple years since sexual assault prevention has become a topic of national conversation.\n\nMary-Megan Marshall, 23, told the feminist magazine Ms. in May that including trigger warnings on syllabi demonstrates empathy toward former victims of sexual assault such as herself.\n\n\u201cI think college professors show they care about survivors by providing trigger warnings for their classes,\u201d Marshall told Ms. \u201cCollege is an experience of learning, but unfortunately\u2014and this was true in my case\u2014it\u2019s fraught with sexual assault.\u201d\n\nBut the AAUP asserts that using trigger warnings to warn sexual assault victims of content they may find disturbing takes attention away from addressing the broader problem of \u201csocial behaviors that permit sexual violence to take place.\n\n\u201cTrigger warnings will not solve this problem, but only misdirect attention from it and, in the process, threaten the academic freedom of teachers and students whose classrooms should be open to difficult discussions, whatever form they take,\u201d the AAUP report said.\n\nRather than mandate the addition of trigger warnings to syllabi, the AAUP said colleges should encourage students with PTSD and other cases of trauma to \u201cagree on a plan for treatment with the relevant health advisers\u201d to work on preventing unexpected reactions to certain material.\n\n\u201cFaculty should, of course, be sensitive that such reactions may occur in their classrooms, but they should not be held responsible for them,\u201d the AAUP said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The AAUP issues report on trigger warnings", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The AAUP issues report on trigger warnings", "title": "Trigger Warnings: Should Colleges Alert Students?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/492533791.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-01T12:49:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1u4dFaq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The AAUP issues report on trigger warnings", "title": "Trigger Warnings: Should Colleges Alert Students?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/492533791.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2014-11-01T03:01:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T12:49:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Trigger warnings, AAUP, Wellesley College, Sexual assault, colleges, University of California Santa Barbara, New York University, Feminist,"}, "article_summary": "In his mock syllabus, Zimmerman listed the topics of a U.S. history course along with corresponding descriptions containing trigger warnings.\n\u201cThe presumption that students need to be protected rather than challenged in a classroom is at once infantilizing and anti-intellectual.\nThe AAUP report used Wellesley College as an example.\nRather than mandate the addition of trigger warnings to syllabi, the AAUP said colleges should encourage students with PTSD and other cases of trauma to \u201cagree on a plan for treatment with the relevant health advisers\u201d to work on preventing unexpected reactions to certain material.\nAccording to Lindsey Burke, the Will Skillman fellow in education at The Heritage Foundation, the debate over trigger warnings on college campuses serves to further discredit American higher education."}
