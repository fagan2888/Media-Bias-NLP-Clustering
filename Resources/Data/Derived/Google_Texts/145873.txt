Edgerton, MN

Southwest Minnesota farmers are hoping Governor Mark Dayton follows through with promises of state assistance for their flooded fields.

Keith Van Hulzen farms 5,000 acres in four southwest Minnesota counties. He's lost 4,000 of those acres to flooding. But he's still hoping to salvage at least some of his crop.

Hobnobbing with the top elected leaders of Minnesota is giving some hope to farmers like Van Hulzen that all is not lost in the aftermath of record flooding.

"They make you feel good. At least it looks like they care to come to a little town like Edgerton," Van Hulzen said.

Van Hulzen worries that bureaucratic barriers will bog down efforts to repair his damaged fields.

"See once, if they'll let us do some stuff without the DNR really getting on us about it," Van Hulzen said.

Farmers are barely treading water without some assistance from the government.

"We do have federal crop insurance, that's kind of like a band-aid but it may help us pay our rent and our costs," Van Hulzen said

Van Hulzen wants to replant the soybean crop he lost in the flood.

"We're thinking that maybe we could get 70-percent crop, maybe. If we plant here before the 4th of July," Van Hulzen said.

First, the ground will have to get dry enough for replanting. Even in the midst of this wettest of growing seasons, Van Hulzen is hopeful of getting back into his fields.

"As farmers, we don't ever give up," Van Hulzen said.

Van Hulzen says an early frost this fall would likely doom any soybeans he's able to replant.
