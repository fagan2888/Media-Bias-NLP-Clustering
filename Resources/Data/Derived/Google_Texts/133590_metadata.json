But I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Wagle removed Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook, R-Shawnee, as chair of the Health and Human Services Committee as punishment after Pilcher-Cook tried to add the Hospital Association\u2019s bill as an amendment onto an unrelated bill.\n\nThe bill, Senate Bill 371, had not even had a hearing, but Pilcher-Cook said she wanted the Senate to vote it down in order to send a message to the House that the Senate had no interest in Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn announcing Pilcher-Cook\u2019s removal as chair of the committee, Wagle issued a press release Feb. 13 saying, \u201cThe body will take up the question of KanCare expansion under ObamaCare for a vote in the next few weeks.\u201d But she added, \u201cOnce that vote is taken, I think it will be clear that a majority of the Kansas Senate firmly oppose expansion of KanCare under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSince then, though, no action has been taken on the bill, and the new interim chairman of the committee, Sen. Michael O\u2019Donnell, R-Wichita, said that he has no intention of holding hearings on it.\n\nWagle said Wednesday the language of the bill could be amended into another bill dealing with Medicaid or health care, but such a move would likely mean it would only be debated on the floor of the Senate and would never have a committee hearing in which advocates could present data and testimony.\n\nMeanwhile, advocates who spoke during a panel discussion at the Kansas Hospital Association\u2019s forum said small towns and rural communities are paying a heavy price for the Legislature\u2019s refusal to even discuss Medicaid expansion.\n\nRural hospitals have been hit particularly hard because part of the financing for the Affordable Care Act comes from reducing payments to hospitals from Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly, in exchange for getting more people enrolled through Medicaid or private insurance, which would reduce the amount of money they lose from treating the uninsured.\n\nIn states like Kansas that have chosen not to expand Medicaid, the number of uninsured individuals has not dropped substantially. But hospitals are still taking the loss from reduced Medicare payments.\n\nTerry Deschaine, a trustee at the Sumner Regional Medical Center in Wellington, said voters in Wellington recently approved a 1-cent sales tax to help keep the local hospital afloat. But he said there are an estimated 31 hospitals in Kansas, mostly in small communities, that are at risk of having to close in the near future.\n\n\u201cIf half of these 31 hospitals at risk in Kansas would end up closing in their communities, that would be, in my opinion, total devastation to those communities,\u201d he said.\n\nRob Freelove, who is CEO and medical director at Salina Family Health Care, said the lack of Medicaid expansion in Kansas has made it hard for his facility to recruit doctors.\n\n\u201cI think what it shows is a lack of support, and a lack of understanding of the benefits of health and primary care, access to health and support for physicians,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s going to be very difficult to overcome from a recruitment standpoint.\u201d\n\nDeschaine said the only way to get Medicaid expansion in Kansas may be for voters to demand it at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cWe need our legislators to support us on something that is so basic and such a no-brainer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, then we need to go out and find somebody else.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
