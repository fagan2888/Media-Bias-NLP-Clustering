Maybe the folks running the HealthCare.gov call centers don't have an enemies list. Instead, based on the experience of Fox News's Jim Angle, it might be an enemies directory, with anyone they're aware of in the media and perhaps other organizations included therein.

That's what one almost has to think based on the experience Angle recounted on the air and relayed via Twitter Friday (HT Twitchy; individual Angle tweets are here, here, and here):

The body of Angle's report was also important, because it showed how another aspect of President Obama's core promise to the Americans people â€” this time, it was "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, period," won't pan out, because Obamacare plans are deliberately keeping the number of doctors in their networks low to try to control costs.

Angle's on-air summary: "So the site seems to be more successful at identifying reporters than explaining the options and signing people up for health insurance."

Based on how Angle relayed the story, it would appear that the only way the helpful HC.gov call center folks could have determined that Angle was a likely media member was by cross-checking his given address against an existing list or directory of media members' home addresses.

If that's the case ... Wow. Talk about paranoia.

If a member of the establishment press had received this kind of creepy treatment at a citizen service line during the Bush 43 administration, I daresay it would have gotten noticed by the likes of the New York Times and the Associated Press.

I don't think that's going to happen this time around.

Here's one reaction to Angle's second tweet:

They can track you but they can't enroll you now that is weird.

I can think of a few other words more apt to the circumstances than "weird."
