(The local chapter kept $17 million; $10 million went to help people nationwide.)\n\nThe new building is a few miles south, off Interstate 405, of the current Irvine location near John Wayne Airport.\n\nWe spoke with McAleer about what he has witnessed over his tenure in dealing with a disease that claims an estimated 84,000 people in Orange County.\n\nQ. What do we know now that we didn\u2019t know in 2004 about this disease?\n\nA. We know its presence when somebody has the disease. We know some of the pathology. What we don\u2019t know is what causes it. We didn\u2019t know what caused it then.\n\nWe\u2019re still arguing about what helps and doesn\u2019t help. We\u2019re becoming increasingly clear that the hope is in prevention, more than in cure.\n\nBut we were arguing about fish oil 10 years ago; we\u2019re still arguing about fish oil today. We\u2019re still arguing about vitamin E. A lot of the treatments have not progressed much.\n\nQ. Can you talk about why it\u2019s so significant to participate in clinical trials?\n\nA. Without bodies, research doesn\u2019t happen. Without participants in clinical trials, we don\u2019t have research. We don\u2019t find new drugs; we don\u2019t find new treatments of any kind. Nothing that will slow or prevent it.\n\nWe have to have people who are at risk and not affected to see if preventive stuff works. There\u2019s a huge study, called the A4 study (a4study.org) they are trying to populate. They want over 10,000 people.\n\nQ. Who\u2019s doing that?\n\nA. It\u2019s an international study. What it\u2019s looking at is, let\u2019s find people who have risk factors, right? Obesity is a risk factor. Smoking \u2013 147 percent increased risk. If you have a first-person relative, it probably increases your risk.\n\nIt takes those people, where it doesn\u2019t show up at all clinically, and it\u2019s going to treat them with the same medications we give people with the disease today. Maybe it will stop that beta amyloid (plaque-forming proteins) from aggregating.\n\nThat\u2019s a long-term study. It\u2019s prevention. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re treating something today; it\u2019s trying to stop it from happening. ... That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to advance.\n\nQ. An earlier story in the Register said that the association helps about 25 percent of the people in Orange County affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. What\u2019s going on with the rest?\n\nA. We\u2019re now probably pushing between 28 and 30 percent. The problem is, the population total is creeping up. ... Twenty-five percent don\u2019t know they have it. So why would they seek help? There may be some changes in their life happening, but they think it\u2019s normal aging and that sort of thing.\n\nThere\u2019s probably another 25 percent that\u2019s in strong denial or culturally, you don\u2019t talk about it.\n\nQ. Early detection is important yet doctors don\u2019t routinely check for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s at any particular age, do they? Why not?\n\nA. They\u2019re supposed to. Right now, Medicare requires after 65 that you have an annual screen for memory issues. The people that we are working with, the plans and health systems, aren\u2019t doing it.\n\nWe still have a huge number of physicians who think memory loss is a part of normal aging. We have an even greater number of physicians who think that nothing can be done about it.\n\nQ. You\u2019re saying Medicare requires screenings but it\u2019s not happening?\n\nA. Right. Definitely not happening to a great extent. Those requirements are new under the Affordable Care Act and are actually embedded in some of the changes attached to that. So we\u2019re talking two years that\u2019s been required.\n\nBut there\u2019s no teeth to it; no penalties if you\u2019re not doing it.\n\nSince this disease is largely diagnosed with change over time, that annual screen can tell you if your memory is changing over time.\n\nQ. What are some recent innovations here to move forward on this issue?\n\nA. We\u2019re fortunate that we live in a county where research is going on every single day, in a number of different places, most notably UCI. There\u2019s some world-class research going on there.\n\nOur patient referral program \u2013 going to the different plans like Kaiser, St. Joe\u2019s and Memorial Care and trying to get them to do these screens and refer to us. That\u2019s unique in the nation. It\u2019s not happening anywhere else.\n\nWe\u2019re one of the few chapters that are HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant so we can take that patient information safely, guard it and still communicate with medical-care providers. That\u2019s probably one of our most signature programs.\n\nWe also have a couple of different social programs for the earliest stages of the disease that are unique. We do a lot of connecting to culture. We have partnerships with Bowers Museum.\n\nWhen folks are (diagnosed) really early \u2013 still working possibly, still driving \u2013 they don\u2019t want to sit in a support group many times. But they do enjoy socializing, hanging out with, commiserating with other people in similar situations.\n\nQ. You\u2019re moving to new headquarters. How is that going to help the people you serve?\n\nA. Visibility and awareness \u2013 knowing we\u2019re here. The new building will help accomplish that. It\u2019s a giant billboard for us. All those people driving up and down the 405 will at least know there is a thing called the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nThe other thing it does is it gives us more internal ability to host events to bring people into us, where our resources are strongest. Our material resources, social workers all over the place \u2013 we can help you better, closer to home.\n\nThe third is for a nonprofit in Orange County it shows stability. It shows we\u2019re here, committed, long term. We\u2019re not going anywhere.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-7793 or twalker@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "undef", "description": "Life: A decade of disease-fighting: O.C.
