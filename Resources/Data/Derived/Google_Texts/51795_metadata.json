A third one, the 2013 Mental Health Parity Act, likely will bring the total increase to $108 a year, according to the report.\n\nIn a statement to FoxNews.com on Tuesday night, Emily Cain, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said the Obama administration is committed to maintaining a balance between protecting Americans' well-being while promoting economic growth. She added that the net benefits of regulation issued through the fifth fiscal year of Obama's presidency were about $200 billion, not just in monetary savings, but also in lives saved and injuries prevented.\n\n\"We have not yet reviewed this American Action Forum report, so we do not know if it is as deeply flawed and misleading as some of the group\u2019s previous reports,\" Cain said. \"However, it is clear the report simply focuses on costs and ignores the high net benefits to Americans from many regulations, in terms of promoting health, safety and welfare as well as reducing costs.\"\n\nThe study was done with help from the George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Economic
