Either way, it\u2019s pretty clear you can\u2019t trust at thing he says. So what else is he lying about?\n\nThe public views one Republican presidential candidate as far more dishonest than the rest. With 52 percent of Americans viewing him as \u201cnot honest,\u201d Donald Trump is widely considered the biggest liar in the Republican primaries.\n\nAmericans are right not to believe what Trump says. He constantly denies having said things he said, even when they are quoted back at him verbatim. Following are ten times\u2014out of many more\u2014that Trump has lied about what he has said or about his stated principles.\n\n1. \u2018I didn\u2019t say shut down immigration.\u2019 The day after the Brussels terrorist attack, Trump said in an interview with CBS \u201cThis Morning,\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say shut it down. I said you have to be very careful. We have to be very, very strong and vigilant at the borders.\u201d\n\nOn December 7, 2015, Trump issued a press release that begins, \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d He read and reaffirmed his statement at a rally that day.\n\n\n\nIn fact, on March 22, Trump also said on Fox News, \u201cI would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. \u2018I don\u2019t like mandates.\u2019 At the February 26 Republican debate, Trump said he opposed government mandating that individuals purchase health insurance. While he said he would require insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions, he said insurance companies \u201cwere wrong\u201d that mandating preexisting conditions would require an individual mandate. During Sean Hannity\u2019s hour-long interview before the debate, Trump similarly claimed that he opposed such mandates.\n\nIt is hard to square Trump\u2019s claimed position here with his statement to Anderson Cooper just eight days before the debate: \u201cI like the mandate.\u201d That\u2019s right, during a forum with Trump on February 18, Cooper asked, \u201cIf Obamacare is repealed and there\u2019s no mandate for everybody to have insurance, why would an insurance company cover a preexisting condition?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s response: \u201cWell, I like the mandate. So here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different. I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n3. \u2018I never discussed Libya.\u2019 Ted Cruz tied Trump to Clinton-Obama foreign policy by noting that Trump supported their intervention in Libya\u2019s civil war that resulted in Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow. Trump responded with indignation: \u201cHe said that I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, video exists of him discussing that subject\u2014and calling for U.S. troops to intervene to topple Gaddafi. Trump cared so much about the subject that he actually went out of his way to record a video blog in February 2011, in which he stated:\n\nI can\u2019t believe what our country is doing. Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we\u2019re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we\u2019re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that\u2019s what it is: It\u2019s a carnage. \u2026 It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.\n\n\n\nAbout Syria, which Cruz also invoked, Trump has been all over the place. One day he says, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to be the policemen of the world\u201d and \u201cLet Syria and ISIS fight. Why do we care?\u201d Another day, he says he would invade Syria with \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d\n\n4. For Iraq Before He Was Against It Trump isn\u2019t just talking out of both sides of his mouth on Libya, Trump has a long track record of supporting a war before turning against it when the going gets tough. So, too, on Iraq. He often lies at debates that he opposed George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq. At the September 2015 CNN debate, Trump said he was \u201cthe only person on this dais that fought very, very hard against us [going into Iraq].\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can check it out,\u201d he continued. Indeed you can, and others have\u2014finding that Trump was lying. On the Howard Stern show on September 11, 2002, Trump was asked, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time [in the \u201990s] it was done correctly.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump defended himself at the February 2016 CNN forum by saying, \u201cThat was quite a bit before the war started.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat was one day before President Bush made a speech to the United Nations calling for action against Iraq and three weeks before Congress approved and Bush signed into law the resolution of force against Iraq on October 2, 2002. It was also only half a year before the invasion began on March 20, 2003.\n\nOn January 28, 2003, with Bush still trying to convince foreign allies to support putting pressure on Saddam Hussein, Trump griped, \u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d The day after the invasion began, March 21, Trump said, \u201cIt looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201d He also expressed no skepticism over the weapons of mass destruction claims. Instead, he said, \u201cIt will be very interesting to see what kind of weapons they find.\u201d\n\nJust a few days after celebrating the success of the war and its positive impact on the economy, Trump said on \u201cNightline,\u201d \u201cThe war\u2019s a mess,\u201d and \u201cIf they keep fighting it the way they did today, they\u2019re going to have a real problem.\u201d\n\nHe said on September 11, 2003, seven months after the war started, \u201cI would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq,\u201d and on April 16, 2004, almost a year after the war started, he said it was \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d\n\nNow Trump says that we would be better off if Saddam was still in charge, because, \u201cAt least he killed terrorists.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut even after Trump turned against the war when it was already underway, he still celebrated the removal of Saddam. He said on December 15, 2003, \u201cIf we are there, you have to take down Saddam Hussein. And they have done that, and they did it maybe not as quickly as they thought in terms of finding him, but they found him. And that is a huge day for this country.\u201d\n\nIn summary, Trump didn\u2019t fight the war before it started. Even more, he didn\u2019t fight \u201cvery, very hard\u201d against it. He made what he has himself subsequently determined was a terrible misjudgment about the efficacy of overthrowing Saddam.\n\n5. \u2018I never said the government should pay for everybody\u2019s health care.\u2019 Cruz demonstrated he knows the old lawyer\u2019s maxim to never ask a question for which you don\u2019t know the answer. In February\u2019s Republican debate, he asked Trump point-blank, \u201cDonald, true or false, you said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care?\u201d\n\nDonald took the bait and answered directly\u2014and lied\u2014saying, \u201cThat\u2019s false.\u201d Oops. Donald said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on November 27, 2015, four months after he launched his campaign, \u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it [universal healthcare].\u201d\n\nDonald Trump and universal health care\u2026 #GOPDebatehttps://t.co/FBuaIfPsMN\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 26, 2016\n\n\n\nThis clip of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, which is a little bit longer, wasn\u2019t produced by the Cruz campaign yet shows exactly the same thing in context.\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s a longer clip of the exchange at the debate.\n\n\n\n6. \u2018I would never use filthy language.\u2019 Asked about former Mexican President Vicente Fox\u2019s statement that Mexico would never pay for that \u201cf*****g wall,\u201d Trump pretended to be offended by his language. \u201cI saw him make the statement,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used only half of that word, it would have been national scandal. This guy used a filthy disgusting word on national television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize.\u201d\n\nInteresting comments from a man who refused to apologize for uttering the words \u201cschlonged\u201d and \u201cpussy,\u201d as well as the f-word, all on stage.\n\n7. \u2018I called McCain a war hero.\u2019 Since Trump has no backbone, he never takes responsibility for the insults he dishes out on the campaign trail. He tries to insert plausible deniability into his attacks on women, disabled people, conservative activists, and prisoners of war.\n\nDilbert author Scott Adams pointed this out with Trump\u2019s use of the vulgarity \u201cschlonged\u201d: \u201cSchlonged has just enough deniability built into it (similar to saying someone \u2018sucks\u2019) that Trump could almost-sort-of-but-not-quite explain it away.\u201d\n\nWhile attacking McCain, Trump was pressed by pollster Frank Luntz to admit McCain was a war hero, to which Trump responded, \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He is a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he got captured.\u201d The clear implication is that Trump doesn\u2019t think McCain did actively anything to earn the title of war hero.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Trump tried to deny responsibility for saying that. On ABC News\u2019s \u201cThe Week,\u201d he said he didn\u2019t owe McCain an apology, because \u201cIf you look at Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s report last night, four times she said I said perfectly, I said whatever it was, and it was absolutely fine.\u201d Whatever that means. But even after he said McCain was \u201ca war hero\u201d only because he was captured, he added, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\n8. \u2018I would never use the f-word.\u2019 After getting caught on video at a New Hampshire rally saying Americans should tell businesses that bring back factories to America under a hypothetical Trump presidency \u201cto go [f**k] themselves,\u201d Trump went on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show and denied saying it.\n\nDid Trump drop the \"F bomb\" in NH? Here's a preview of Bill's interview with @realDonaldTrump tonight on The Factorhttps://t.co/OD01jaaUol\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bill O'Reilly (@oreillyfactor) February 5, 2016\n\n\n\nWatching the video, the audio of the word coming out is quiet, so it\u2019s not clear whether he said it verbally or just mouthed it, but of course no one was lost as to his meaning. That\u2019s another case of him trying to insert plausible deniability.\n\n\n\nEven if Trump is granted benefit of the doubt there, however, it\u2019s absolutely not true that he \u201cwould never use the word,\u201d as he told O\u2019Reilly, In fact, he has used the word four other times in major speeches, as highlighted in the supercut.\n\n\n\n9. \u2018No one should question someone else\u2019s religion.\u2019 After Pope Francis said, \u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the gospel,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cNo leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man\u2019s religion or faith.\u201d\n\nTrump has already violated his newly created standard many times in this campaign and prior. Trump has questioned Cruz\u2019s religion: \u201cHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?\u201d\n\nHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?\n\n\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s said of Cruz, when questioning Cruz\u2019s faith, \u201cNot too many evangelicals come out of Cuba, okay?\u201d\n\nHe has also questioned President Obama\u2019s religion: \u201cWould I be comfortable [with a Muslim president]? I don\u2019t know if we have to address it right now. Some people have said it already happened, frankly,\u201d he said in September 2015.\n\n\u201c[Obama] doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there\u2019s something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim,\u201d he said in 2011.\n\nDoes Madonna know something we all don't about Barack? At a concert she said \"we have a black Muslim in the White House.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2012\n\n\n\nRecently in Utah, Trump questioned Mitt Romney\u2019s faith: \u201cBy the way, Mitt Romney is not one of them. Did he choke? Did this guy choke? He\u2019s a choke artist, I can\u2019t believe. Are you sure he\u2019s a Mormon, are we sure?\u201d\n\n10. Calling Marco Rubio \u2018Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator\u2019 The CNBC debate was a trainwreck by all accounts, but there was one nugget of information we got out of it: Trump is willing to lie about concrete facts regarding things he has expressed that are easily Google-able.\n\nWhen moderator Becky Quick asked, \u201cYou had talked a little bit about Marco Rubo\u2014Rubio\u2014I think you called him \u2018Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator,\u2019 because he was in favor of the H-1B visas,\u201d Trump answered, \u201cI never said that. I never said that.\u201d\n\n\n\nViewers googled it and found Trump\u2019s own position page on immigration, which stated, \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.\u201d Trump later appeared to reverse himself on this facet of immigration policy, too, even though it is his key policy stance, saying of H1-B visas, \u201cI\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll get them in\u2026I\u2019m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.\u201d\n\nAt first Quick foolishly believed The Donald and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d but later in the debate, possibly after having heard from Twitter users, she corrected the record.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:36:32 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Either Donald Trump has a horrible memory or he\u2019s a pathological liar.
