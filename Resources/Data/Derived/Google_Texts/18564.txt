"I remember thinking, your name just does not fit you. You don't seem like a Randy. And I started calling him Rand, and he liked it," Paul's wife, Kelley, told CNN's Dana Bash during an at-home interview.

Rand Paul, 52, was called Randy his whole life until the pair started dating more than two decades ago, CNN reported.

In the interview, Kelley Paul shows off a libertarian-themed cookbook in the couple's kitchen and also disclosed that her ophthalmologist husband cuts his own hair.

"It's not necessarily that he doesn't like to get his hair cut, he's kind of impatient for things like that," she said.

Paul said she was hesitant about her husband's 2010 bid for the Senate and she has "trepidation" about 2016.

"I do have trepidation. He wouldn't run if I didn't want him to, but for that reason I don't want to be the person that says, 'don't do it,'" she told CNN.
