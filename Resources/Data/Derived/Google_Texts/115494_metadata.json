(I believe it\u2019s a Professional Hockey Writers Association rule: Thou shalt tweet shot of sparse crowd in Florida, Carolina or Arizona by the 5:00 mark of the first period.)\n\nBut, hey, when it happens in the New York area, or in other \u201cOriginal Six\u201d markets such as Boston or Chicago in not-so-long ago slow periods, or even in Edmonton and Calgary when the Canadian economy had lost an edge, that\u2019s overlooked.\n\nI\u2019ve long been on the record: I don\u2019t make value judgments about consumers\u2019 entertainment dollar expenditures. There is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with markets that don\u2019t fill seats and line the coffers of franchise owners and leagues.\n\nBut in no other sport are the double standards so blatant and accepted.\n\nThe Devils\u2019 average home crowd of 13,905, or 78.9 percent of capacity, ranked 26th in the 30-team league going into Friday\u2019s games. That\u2019s especially interesting to me, and perhaps to all others who attended the initial news conference at the Meadowlands and heard politicians and owners insist that the New Jersey franchise \u2014 still officially unnamed after confirmation of its sale and move from Denver the day before \u2014 never would have an unsold ticket.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years in East Rutherford, with only moderate box-office success, the Devils\u2019 relocation to downtown Newark and the new Prudential Center has done little, if anything, to help at the gate.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice building, accessible from other spots in New Jersey, just two blocks from Newark\u2019s Penn Station and only a $5.25 train ride from Manhattan. New Jersey has been on balance, one of the more consistent and well-run franchises in the league, but if one of the \u201cnontraditional\u201d markets drew Devils home crowds for good teams, it would be cited as additional proof that they don\u2019t belong in the NHL in the first place.\n\nOn the same trip, the Avalanche played the Islanders for the first time at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn after the franchise\u2019s switch from Uniondale, about 20 miles to the east.\n\nThe failure to get a new and adequate arena off the drawing board to replace the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum led to the move, and the Barclays Center is a terrific building \u2014 for basketball and a lot of other things, but certainly not for hockey. The Islanders went from a bad arena with few amenities and great sight lines to a nice arena with all the bells and whistles, but with horrible sight lines for hockey, especially in one end.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s an easy subway ride from Manhattan to the Barclays site, across the street from the Atlantic Terminal. That\u2019s the area where the domed-stadium replacement for Ebbets Field was supposed to be built before New York Building Commissioner Robert Moses refused to go along, helping trigger the Dodgers\u2019 move to Los Angeles.\n\nAnnounced attendance for the Islanders-Avalanche game was 11,585.\n\nTwo nights later, the first Rangers-Islanders game in Brooklyn drew a sellout of 15,795. And then it was back to normalcy.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nPatrick Kane, LW, Blackhawks\n\nWhen: The Avalanche plays at Chicago on Tuesday to conclude a three-game road trip against the defending Stanley Cup champion at the United Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Kane will take a 25-game points streak \u2014 16 goals and 23 assists \u2014 into Sunday\u2019s game against visiting Vancouver, and if he produces a point, he will surpass Pittsburgh\u2019s Sidney Crosby for the longest streak since the 1992-93 season, when Mats Sundin had points in 30 consecutive games for the Quebec Nordiques. Crosby\u2019s 25-game streak was in 2010-11.\n\nBackground: Kane, 27, is a magician with the puck, but off-ice issues hit this summer when he was accused of raping a woman at his Buffalo-area home. In November, no charges were brought because of a lack of evidence. Now, the 27-year-old can stay focused on what so far is a career-best season.\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Kane is hockey\u2019s best offensive small forward at 5-foot-11 and 177 pounds, and what he\u2019s doing in this low-scoring era is remarkable.\n\nMike Chambers, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Attendance woes in New York, New Jersey highlight NHL\u2019s double standards", "title": "Frei: Attendance woes in New York, New Jersey highlight NHL\u2019s double standards", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/frei-attendance-woes-in-new-york-new-jersey-highlight-nhls-double-standards/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T16:59:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "The crowd was so sparse, the blocks of empty seats so glaring, it all looked like one of the gatherings visiting NHL beat writers love to poke fun at, but only if it\u2019s in the easy-target, nontraditional league markets.\nThere is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with markets that don\u2019t fill seats and line the coffers of franchise owners and leagues.\nBut in no other sport are the double standards so blatant and accepted.\nAgain, it\u2019s an easy subway ride from Manhattan to the Barclays site, across the street from the Atlantic Terminal.\nThe Devils\u2019 average home crowd of 13,905, or 78.9 percent of capacity, ranked 26th in the 30-team league going into Friday\u2019s games."}
