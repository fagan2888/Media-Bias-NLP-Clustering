Sunday\u2019s game doesn\u2019t count between the Broncos and San Francisco 49ers, but it will be remembered.\n\nThe 49ers pull the curtain on Levi\u2019s Stadium, holding the first football game in their new digs. Kids, we aren\u2019t in Candlestick Park anymore. The is place is palatial, befitting the Super Bowl 50 it will host in two years. There are, of course, logistics to iron out.\n\nFans are advised to arrive early, car pool or parachute into the nearby Great American amusement park. Traffic snarled, sprinkled with detours, and navigating the lot was a bit of an adventure. But once parked, between tailgaters and rowdy fans, all became normal for an NFL Sunday.\n\nIn my previous life on the baseball beat, I provided a behind the scenes looks at ballparks. That\u2019s not possible in the NFL given the security and lack of pregame access to the locker room.
