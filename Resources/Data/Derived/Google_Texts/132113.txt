Looking at nonclinical staff, 98% of physician practices have either full- (78%) or part-time (20%) front-desk staff. The rate of full-time members of this staff is down from Medscape's 2013 survey (84%). (The earlier report did not show part-time staff members.) The current survey includes coders as a category, which was not present in 2013; 21% of physician practices reported hiring full- or part-time dedicated coders, and 42% employed staff who handled both billing and coding. Forty-two percent employ billers only. The percentage of practices employing a full-time medical records clerk remained steady at 25% between 2013 and 2015.

Among all clinical positions, practices are most likely to hire medical assistants (85%). About two thirds (67%) employ full-time medical assistants, a slight increase from 65% in 2013. This year, 29% of physician practices employed full-time registered nurses, and 27% had full-time nurse practitioners on staff, down from 37% and 31%, respectively, in 2013. In contrast, the percentage of full-time physician assistants rose slightly, from 24% in 2013 to 26% this year.
