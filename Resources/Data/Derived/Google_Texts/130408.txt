Four hospitals in the Charlotte region will be docked 1 percent of Medicare payments because they exceeded federal standards for infections and other safety factors.

The Charlotte Observer reports the penalty will begin in 2016, and is part of the Affordable Care Act's punishment-and-reward system created to keep down unnecessary medical spending and control health care costs.

Charlotte-area hospitals on the list are Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center in Charlotte and Shelby's Cleveland Regional Medical Center, which is owned by Carolinas HealthCare System. In South Carolina, Chester Regional Medical Center in Chester and Springs Memorial Hospital in Lancaster will also be penalized in 2016.

According to Kaiser Health News, the fines are based on the frequency of occurrence of infections and other complications between July 2012 and June 2014.
