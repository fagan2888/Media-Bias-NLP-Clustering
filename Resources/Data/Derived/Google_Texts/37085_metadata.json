But unless you\u2019ve given your consent ahead of time, robocalls are illegal.\n\nScammers are robodialing phones around the country claiming to be from the Health Insurance Marketplace. Using a scare tactic, the prerecorded message states that under the law you must buy health insurance or face a fine and asks you to press 1 to talk to a live person. Those who do press 1 reach an \u201coperator\u201d who claims to work with the law and asks for a slew of personal information, including date of birth and Social Security number.\n\nPressing 1 or another number to remove your phone number from the caller\u2019s telemarketing list doesn\u2019t help either. It makes it worse. The scammers behind the robocalls now know that a real person is at the other end of the call, so they increase the robocalls to that number.\n\nBetter Business Bureau offers the following tips when you encounter a robocall:\n\nThe best thing you can do is hang up on robocalls. Don\u2019t press 1 or any other option, no matter what the prerecorded voice promises or threatens.\n\nIf you were tricked into sharing your Social Security number or other sensitive information, visit www.identitytheft.gov to learn what you should do next to protect yourself from identity theft.\n\nYou can report robocalls to the FTC at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov to assist them with thwarting these scammers.
