When Knorr died several years ago in Fort Lauderdale, her belongings \u2014 including the Diebold stock \u2014 passed on to an acquaintance, Debra Hole.\n\nAttorney John F. Bradley said it could now be worth more than $1.1 million because of stock splits and dividends over the years that could swell the number of shares to some 29,500. Bradley represents the Ness estate, with at least three surviving heirs, in a federal lawsuit seeking to force Diebold to pay up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of picturing him as America\u2019s first superhero. Sadly, he died with not that much,\u201d Bradley said of Ness. \u201cIt\u2019s just a simple debt as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nNorth Canton, Ohio-based Diebold declined to comment, but in court filings the company has tried to get the lawsuit dismissed. Diebold, which started out making bank safes and vaults 150 years ago, now provides multiple financial services including ATM machines and drive-through teller equipment. Also named in the lawsuit is Wells Fargo bank, which handles Diebold\u2019s stock transfers.\n\nIn court documents, Diebold and Wells Fargo insist there is no record available of any stock ownership by Ness.\n\n\u201cThe certificate is no longer valid,\u201d their filing states.\n\nNess was Diebold\u2019s chief executive officer from 1944 to 1951, after his crime-fighting successes in Chicago and a later stint as Cleveland\u2019s safety director. His 1929-31 service as a Prohibition agent in Chicago was the subject of a popular book and later a television show with Robert Stack as Ness, followed by the 1987 film with Kevin Costner in the agent\u2019s role and Robert De Niro as Capone.\n\nThe name \u201cUntouchables\u201d comes from his unit\u2019s reputation for refusing to take bribes from Capone, according to media accounts of the time. Although Ness\u2019 efforts eventually led to some 5,000 bootlegging charges against Capone, the infamous gangster was actually convicted of tax evasion. The liquor violations were eventually dropped.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Estate of \u2018Untouchables\u2019 Ness in legal fight over old stock", "title": "Estate of \u2018Untouchables\u2019 Ness in legal fight over old stock", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Estate of \u2018Untouchables\u2019 Ness in legal fight over old stock", "title": "Estate of \u2018Untouchables\u2019 Ness in legal fight over old stock", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/03/estate_of_untouchables_ness_in_legal_fight_over_old_stock/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/eliot-ness-stock.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Estate of \u2018Untouchables\u2019 Ness in legal fight over old stock", "title": "Estate of \u2018Untouchables\u2019 Ness in legal fight over old stock", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/eliot-ness-stock.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Curt Anderson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffc9\"", "article_summary": "When Knorr died several years ago in Fort Lauderdale, her belongings \u2014 including the Diebold stock \u2014 passed on to an acquaintance, Debra Hole.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsMIAMI (AP) \u2014 A legal fight is brewing in Florida between the estate of \u201cUntouchables\u201d Prohibition agent Eliot Ness and an Ohio company over some long-undiscovered stock that apparently belonged to Ness and may be worth more than $1 million.\nIn court documents, Diebold and Wells Fargo insist there is no record available of any stock ownership by Ness.\nBradley represents the Ness estate, with at least three surviving heirs, in a federal lawsuit seeking to force Diebold to pay up.\nAlthough Ness\u2019 efforts eventually led to some 5,000 bootlegging charges against Capone, the infamous gangster was actually convicted of tax evasion."}
