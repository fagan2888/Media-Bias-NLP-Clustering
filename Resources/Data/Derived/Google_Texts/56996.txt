The Colorado Association of Health Plans’ board announced Friday executive director Ben Price will leave in mid-June for a position as chief executive with the Littleton-based National Board of Surgical Technology and Surgical Assisting.

Price has served seven years as head of the trade association, which represents companies providing health care benefits to more than 3 million Coloradans. He guided the association through passage of the Affordable Care Act and the development of the state’s health insurance exchange, Connect for Health Colorado.

Previously, Price served 10 years as government-affairs director with the Association of Surgical Technologists.

“I’ve truly enjoyed the collaborative way that our legislature, regulatory agency and community groups have worked together and the partnerships that have allowed us to improve the health and lives of Coloradans,” Price said in a statement on the association website.

The association board formed a committee to lead the search for a new leader. Sara Orrange has been named interim executive director.
