Country darling Taylor Swift was presented with the Pinnacle Award, which goes to artists who have achieved the highest levels of record and concert sales and who have made an impact both on country music and the wider world of pop culture.\n\nOne of the sweetest moments of the night belonged to the first couple of country music: Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton. They will have to make room in their Oklahoma home for their respective Vocalist of the Year awards. This marks Lambert\u2019s third Female Vocalist of the Year win and Shelton\u2019s fourth.\n\nLambert didn\u2019t just rule the night, she ruled the red carpet, showing off a noticeably slimmed-down figure. When asked the secret to her weight loss, she admitted: \u201cAll through my 20s I worked a lot \u2013 I was on the road since I was 17 and the road life is a lot of fast food and a lot of late nights and a lot of drinking \u2013 I didn\u2019t give up drinking. I refused. You have to drink to put up with my husband! Just kidding! But I just felt that I should get a little more healthy and I have a record coming out in the spring and it\u2019s a very important album to me \u2013 it\u2019s my fifth album \u2013 and I have this spot, I found a great spot in country music and I want to keep it.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed for more, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t give up really a lot really. Just Cheetos mostly!\u201d\n\nThe CMAs were also chock-full of great performances. Check out Swift\u2019s dramatic rendition of \u201cRed\u201d with special guests Vince Gill and Alison Krauss.\n\nDid you watch the CMAs?
