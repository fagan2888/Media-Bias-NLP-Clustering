They both presided over record setting streaks of private sector job growth.\n\nThe Department of Labor announced Friday that the economy added 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped (little change) to 6.1%. The private sector has added 10 million jobs over 54 straight months, with private businesses adding 134,000 jobs in this report. President Obama has shattered Bill Clinton\u2019s previous record of 51 consecutive months of private sector job growth. This is an extension of the longest streak on record for private sector job growth and it happened under a Democratic President.\n\nUpon release of the new jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, noted, \u201cThe private sector has added 10 million jobs over 54 straight months of job growth, extending the longest streak on record. Today we learned that total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 142,000 in August, mainly reflecting a 134,000 increase in private employment. Private-sector job growth was revised up for July and down for June for little total revisions. Over the past twelve months, private employment has risen by a total of 2.4 million.\u201d\n\nChart via Jason Furman:\n\nThis surge in private sector job growth is the opposite of what Republicans told the public would occur under a Democratic President. Republicans claim to be the party of business and of the markets, yet time and time again, we see consistent growth under a Democrat.\n\nFurman further noted that the other time we added 10 million private sector jobs was between November of 1996 to April of 2001. Former President Bill Clinton served as President from 1993 to 2001. It\u2019s almost as if as soon as he left office, the private sector began weeping jobs.\n\nAn excellent record of job growth under a Democratic President is not an anomaly. President Clinton added a total of 23.1 million jobs, while George W. Bush only added 3 million over his entire 8 year term and his father, George H.W. Bush, only added 2.5 million but he did that over one term. Heck, Ronald Reagan only added 16 million jobs, and he is held up by Republicans as the business God.\n\nAll is not rosy, however, \u201cAlthough the pace of job gains in August was below recent months, the broader trends are moving in the right direction.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cLong-term unemployment has fallen rapidly over the past year but remains well above its pre-recession average.\u201d That recession started in 2007.\n\nIt is largely thanks to the Congressional Republican that the unemployment numbers are not better. Not only have House Republicans refused to pass a real jobs bill, but they\u2019ve also been engaged in a desperate defunding war on government and public sector employees. This specific poutfest is years old now.\n\nFurman said in his statement that the report proves we need to do more to create jobs, \u201cWith today\u2019s report, the economy has now added 10 million private-sector jobs over 54 straight months of job growth. This figure is a marker of the progress that has been made, but also a reminder that more must still be done to create jobs, especially for the long-term unemployed, and grow the middle class. Although the pace of job gains in August was below recent months, the broader trends are moving in the right direction. To continue to support the progress our economy has made, the President will act wherever he can to create good jobs, facilitate investments in American infrastructure and manufacturing, and make sure that hard work pays off with higher wages.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi concurred in her statement, \u201cToday\u2019s jobs report shows our economy continuing to move forward. It is clear, however, that Republicans\u2019 special interest obstruction and dysfunction are stalling the middle class and costing our country jobs.\u201d\n\nPelosi continued, \u201cAcross the country, Americans are raising a drumbeat for action, calling for a Congress committed to creating jobs, jumpstarting the middle class, and building an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy. They want us to spend September creating good paying jobs, raising the minimum wage, renewing emergency unemployment insurance, standing with students, and giving America\u2019s women the respect of equal pay for equal work. Yet House Republicans continue to insist on putting the special interests ahead of everyone else, planning yet another month of special interest giveaways \u2013 including their 53rd vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe next time someone calls Republicans the party of business and private sector success, just point them to the Obama stock market and the private sector job growth under Clinton and Obama.\n\nThen you can kindly point out that when Republicans talk about \u201cbusiness\u201d it is really a euphemism for catering to a select few big businesses that donate heavily to the GOP and whose profit margins grow when they are allowed to harm and even kill U.S. citizens through deregulation and underfunded government agencies. If your \u201cbusiness\u201d is death and disease, then the GOP is your party. If it\u2019s jobs you\u2019re looking for, private sector job creation has been best under a Obama and then Clinton.\n\nImagine what a Democratic Congress might accomplish.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The private sector has added 10 million jobs over 54 straight months, an extension of the longest streak on record for private sector job growth and it happened under a Democratic President.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The private sector has added 10 million jobs over 54 straight months, an extension of the longest streak on record for private sector job growth and it happened under a Democratic President.", "title": "Democratic Presidents Bring It: Obama Shatters Clinton's Record For Private Sector Job Growth", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/09/05/jobs-report.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-12.20.13-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-05T13:00:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-09-05T12:49:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T13:00:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0430\"", "article_summary": "President Obama has shattered Bill Clinton\u2019s previous record of 51 consecutive months of private sector job growth.\nThey both presided over record setting streaks of private sector job growth.\nThis is an extension of the longest streak on record for private sector job growth and it happened under a Democratic President.\nIf it\u2019s jobs you\u2019re looking for, private sector job creation has been best under a Obama and then Clinton.\nThe private sector has added 10 million jobs over 54 straight months, with private businesses adding 134,000 jobs in this report."}
