Eric Jamison/Invision/Associated Press\n\n50 Cent is trying to use his boxing promotion company to dodge a sex-tape lawsuit.\n\nThe rapper placed SMS Promotions LLC in bankruptcy Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Hartford, Conn., to dodge a suit filed by Rick Ross\u2019s ex, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nLastonia Leviston, rapper Rick Ross\u2019s ex-girlfriend, sued 50 Cent in 2010, claiming he violated her privacy by posting a sex tape featuring her and Ross online.\n\nTen minutes before the trial was set to start Tuesday, Ms. Leviston\u2019s lawyers got an email notifying them of the bankruptcy filing. The filing puts the brakes on lawsuits against SMS. 50 Cent\u2019s lawyers say that because the rapper owns the company, he should be protected from lawsuits, as well.\n\nMs. Leviston\u2019s lawyer said the filing was an \u201cegregious case of sandbagging\u201d and will seek to proceed with trial in state court.\n\nBankruptcy lawyers for SMS Promotions\u2019 bankruptcy lawyer didn\u2019t return emailed requests for comment. But according to a statement released by Billboard, \u201cUnder the direction of Mr. Jackson, SMS Promotions looks forward to reorganizing as a new corporate entity and becoming one of the leading promotion companies in the world of professional boxing.\u201d\n\nSMS Promotions, which launched in 2012, reported assets and debts each between $100,000 and $500,000 in its chapter 11 filing. Judge Ann M. Nevins is handling the case.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated that Mr. Ross appeared in the sex tape.\n\nWrite to Melanie Cohen at melanie.cohen@wsj.com.
