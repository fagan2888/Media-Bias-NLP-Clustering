Parking at Bonita Lakes Park will be limited with more parking available by Bonita Lakes Mall.\n\n\u201cWe have Choctaw Transit and the Meridian Trolley will be making runs over to Bonita Lakes Mall area near Tuesday Morning right behind Belk, so you can park there where there is plenty of parking and ride the shuttle over and that way you don\u2019t have to worry with the traffic,\u201d stated Carmichael.\n\nThis free family friendly event will have it all to celebrate Independence Day including some great entertainment to rock the night.\n\n\u201cAa\u2019Keela & the Beats, which we are really excited about that and then N\u2019Tune featuring Kidd Kabana will be on stage, lots of patriotic music and of course the big climax to the evening is our fireworks show and we are really excited about the fireworks,\u201d stated Carmichael.\n\nFireworks are in place and ready to launch tomorrow night, but where is the best seat in park to see the fireworks?\n\n\u201cRight across the lake is where the band is set up which is the lower lake by the boat ramp, it is a great place to view the fireworks there because you are right across from the actual launching site, but really anywhere around the lake you will be able to see them, they are just beautiful,\u201d said Carmichael.\n\nFireworks will end the celebration and will begin at 9 PM tomorrow night.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "City of Meridian crews are readying Bonita Lakes Park for the annual Fourth of July celebrations.", "language": "english", "author": "Nick Gunter", "og": {"description": "City of Meridian crews are readying Bonita Lakes Park for the annual Fourth of July celebrations.", "title": "Preparations Underway for Fourth of July Celebrations", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Preparations-Underway-for-Fourth-of-July-Celebrations-311585281.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BC8/A93/BC8A932437BE498DA277B4EF678ACCCD", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/16C/F03/16CF03F979E04833917603EFBD48692F.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "City of Meridian crews are readying Bonita Lakes Park for the annual Fourth of July celebrations.", "title": "Preparations Underway for Fourth of July Celebrations", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Preparations-Underway-for-Fourth-of-July-Celebrations-311585281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/fireworks134.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Preparations Underway for Fourth of July Celebrations", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Preparations Underway for Fourth of"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafb0\"", "article_summary": "Parking at Bonita Lakes Park will be limited with more parking available by Bonita Lakes Mall.\nCrews with the City of Meridian are getting Bonita Lakes Park ready for the thousands of people expected to fill the park grounds to enjoy the annual Fourth of July Celebration.\nGates to the park will open at three thirty in the afternoon on the Fourth with vendors starting at four.\nFireworks are in place and ready to launch tomorrow night, but where is the best seat in park to see the fireworks?\nThis free family friendly event will have it all to celebrate Independence Day including some great entertainment to rock the night."}
