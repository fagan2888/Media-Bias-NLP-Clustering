The up-armored semi-truck tractor was used when the Azov Battalion stormed Mariupol in June 2014 to take the city back from separatist control.\n\nWhile Azov members or their supporters donated most of these civilian vehicles, the Ukrainian government has also supplied hand-me-downs from the Soviet era, including T-64 tanks and Soviet armored personnel carriers, called BTRs.\n\nAzov\u2019s T-64 tanks, armed with 125-mm guns, were mostly built in the 1980s and have upgraded armor and targeting and communications equipment. One tank has deep gouges in its armor from combined Russian-separatist machine gun fire. All of the armored vehicles are being repainted in Azov\u2019s distinctive camouflage pattern (the soldiers call it \u201cza za style\u201d) and unit symbol.\n\nThe Ukrainian government supplied the armored vehicles as part of the Azov Battalion\u2019s incorporation under the Ministry of the Interior as an official National Guard unit earlier this year. (The unit began as a civilian paramilitary group during the 2014 Maidan revolution.)\n\n\u201cIn the first days, the separatists couldn\u2019t even take apart a rifle,\u201d said Azov\u2019s 42-year-old deputy regiment commander at Urzuf who goes by the nom de guerre, Apis.\n\n\u201cNow they have tanks and artillery and anti-aircraft weapons,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd now we face Russian soldiers. We\u2019ve had to become more professional to fight them.\u201d\n\nAzov\u2019s base in Urzuf used to be the seaside villa of deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. There are about 400 soldiers based here for the defense of Mariupol\u2014an industrial city of 500,000 about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northeast.\n\nYet, as the Ukraine war continues to escalate and as casualties mount, the Azov Battalion remains sidelined from the conflict, highlighting the uneasy relationship between the government in Kyiv and the many volunteer units on which it leaned heavily in the early days of the war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied to be off the front line,\u201d said Vyniy, the commander of Azov\u2019s public affairs unit.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re mad about it.\u201d\n\nBenched\n\nIn August the Ukrainian government pulled all volunteer battalions, including Azov, off the front lines around Mariupol, replacing them with regular military units. The move, according to Kyiv, was a routine rotation of troops that reflected the increased combat readiness of the country\u2019s regular military.\n\n\u201cThe task of the Ukrainian armed forces is to deter aggression of the enemy,\u201d Ukrainian General Staff Press Secretary Vladyslav Selezniov said Aug. 11, according to Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site.\n\n\u201cThe National Guard and the Ministry of Interior have their own tasks, which they perform on the second and third lines of defense,\u201d Selezniov added, according to the report. \u201cAt the moment, the Ukrainian armed forces are located along the entire line of defense.\u201d\n\nThree Ukrainian Marine battalions and one artillery division were sent to Mariupol to bolster the city\u2019s defenses as the volunteer units were withdrawn. Ukrainian Marines replaced the volunteer battalions in Shyrokyne. During the transition, Azov troops said they only had two hours to vacate their positions in Shyrokyne, which included a network of trenches from which they had been fighting for more than six months.\n\n\u201cThere was no handover at all,\u201d Vyniy said.\n\nPublic Pushback\n\nVolunteer units like the Azov Battalion played a key role in spring and summer 2014 when the advance of combined Russian-separatist forces put Ukraine\u2019s regular army on the defensive. And as the war has dragged on, the volunteer units have developed into some of Ukraine\u2019s most battle-hardened and well-trained fighting forces.\n\nAlong with government forces, the Azov Battalion successfully fought in June 2014 to take Mariupol back from separatist control. Since then, Azov soldiers have fought in near daily battles on the city\u2019s outskirts, repelling combined Russian-separatist attacks, including a tank battle in September 2014, and have endured a grinding, static trench and urban warfare battle for control of Shyrokyne.\n\nApis said officials in Kyiv claimed the recent withdrawal from Shyrokyne was due to high casualty rates among volunteer units. \u201cThey told us we had too many casualties,\u201d Apis said. \u201cBut our casualties have been lower than the regular army\u2019s.\u201d\n\nFighting has escalated along the front lines near Mariupol in the past several weeks, including an artillery attack on Aug. 26, which killed seven Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nOn Aug. 16, when combined Russian-separatist forces shelled the village of Sartana on Mariupol\u2019s periphery with 152-mm artillery, killing three civilians, Azov soldiers went on alert and waited for orders to join the fight.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to go to Sartana, but we had no orders,\u201d Vyniy said.\n\nOn Aug. 17, the Ukrainian news site UNIAN reported that the Donbas Battalion\u2014 another volunteer unit, which had been pulled out of Shyrokyne like the Azov Battalion\u2014had been redeployed near the line of contact outside Mariupol. Yet, despite the recent escalation, the 400 Azov soldiers remain at garrison in Urzuf.\n\nMotives\n\nThere is speculation in Ukrainian media reports and on social media that the decision to pull the volunteer units back from the front lines around Mariupol was politically motivated and part of a larger move to neutralize the various volunteer units.\n\nIn an April 2015 report for the Swedish Defense Research Agency, Margarete Klein wrote:\n\n\u201cVolunteer battalions represent both an opportunity and a potential risk for Ukraine\u2019s fragile statehood and democratization prospects. Particularly during the first months of ATO (Anti-Terrorist Operation), the volunteer organizations with their high fighting spirit contributed significantly to containing the separatists.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d Klein added, \u201cthere is still a real risk of volunteer formations becoming politicized or turning into private armies.\u201d\n\nThere is a growing sense of national frustration with the government in Kyiv due to its prosecution of the war in the Donbas, the country\u2019s flailing economy and the slow pace of pro-democracy and anti-corruption reforms.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center poll published June 10, only about a third (32 percent) of Ukrainian respondents said the Kyiv government was having a positive impact\u2014a 15 percent drop in one year\u2014and 59 percent of respondents said the central government was negatively affecting the country.\n\n\u201cIn addition to dissatisfaction with economic conditions, Ukrainians express little faith in some of their country\u2019s major institutions,\u201d the Pew report said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s volunteer battalions, conversely, enjoy broad public support.\n\nThe Kyiv International Institute of Sociology conducted a poll in December 2014, which found that volunteer battalions were the second most trusted institution in Ukraine\u2014only behind NGOs\u2014ranking ahead of the president, prime minister, regular military, media, parliament and even the church.\n\nIn Mariupol, the decision to pull the volunteer battalions out of Shyrokyne was unpopular, sparking a protest movement called \u201cMariupol is Ukraine,\u201d which has held multiple rallies in Kyiv and Mariupol pushing to return the volunteer battalions to the front lines. Many residents credit the volunteer battalions with preventing a combined Russian-separatist force breakthrough to seize back control of the city.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning everyone hated Azov because Russian media said we were killers, rapists and fascists,\u201d Apis said. \u201cBut now people in Mariupol support us, they ask for our help more than the police.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody in Azov now considers Mariupol their native city,\u201d Vyniy said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to just sit here and do nothing while it\u2019s being attacked.\u201d\n\nGarrison Life\n\nSouthwest of Mariupol, the grass- and sunflower-covered Ukrainian steppe, open and rolling like a blanket being shook in the wind, meets the Azov Sea. There are a series of small resort towns along the coast, nestled within sandy coves or along rocky points. The beaches are wide and the sand is a tan color. Out in the distance, the horizon is freckled with the silhouettes of freighters, many of which call to port at Mariupol, transporting steel from the city\u2019s factories or picking up grain brought by train from the country\u2019s interior.\n\nA fence cuts across the main beach in Mariupol, adjacent to the port. On one side are sunbathers. On the other side are mines and anti-personnel obstacles and barbed wire to defend against an amphibious invasion. It reminds one of images of Normandy in World War II.\n\nIn seaside towns like Melekyne, Yalta and Urzuf, it is harder to sense the war. Driving along the coastline one occasionally passes a concealed tank, a machine gun nest, or a minefield denoted with a skull and crossbones warning sign. But at the beaches, there are few reminders of the endless trench warfare an hour\u2019s drive to the east.\n\nThe setting of Azov\u2019s Urzuf base is tranquil. Brick walkways lined with Italian Cypress trees meander along a bluff overlooking the Sea of Azov. Below the base is a public beach where sunbathers are sprawled on the tan sand. There is a steady sea breeze, which kicks up small breakers just big enough to boogie board on.\n\nWithin the Azov compound, groups of soldiers linger inside wooden gazebos that line the bluff overlooking the sea. Many soldiers are tan and fit\u2014the result of garrison life at a place with a beach and a Crossfit gym.\n\nFor the Azov soldiers in Urzuf, the idyllic, seaside resort feeling of Urzuf is a contradiction that leaves many feeling restless. Like many combat soldiers, they enjoy time off from the front to rest and recuperate, but they also know the war is not over and don\u2019t like being benched from the fight.\n\n\u201cThe mood is not very good,\u201d said Valya, a 19-year-old from Urzuf who volunteered with Azov to be a combat medic.\n\n\u201cThe men are waiting to fight,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThere are no words,\u201d one Azov Battalion soldier responded when asked about unit morale. He sat on a bench in the shade, cradling his Kalashnikov, passing time chatting with three other soldiers.\n\n\u201cBut our role is very simple; we don\u2019t question orders,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are only soldiers.\u201d\n\nAn abandoned kindergarten adjacent to Yanukovych\u2019s former villa serves as the unit\u2019s dormitory. Male soldiers live six to a room and female soldiers (combat medics and support staff) mostly live two to a room. Outside the dorms, laundry and combat boots are drying in the sun.\n\nMost soldiers carry weapons. A few walk quickly through the compound with a notepad in hand. There will be a training exercise late in the evening in the unit\u2019s urban warfare simulation course. But they wait until the evening when it\u2019s cooler. Afternoons, therefore, are slow-paced.\n\n\u201cHere we are a family,\u201d Apis said. \u201cPeople understand what is at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to protect our country,\u201d said Anton, a 29-year-old Azov Battalion soldier who spent six months fighting in Shyrokyne. \u201cIt\u2019s not a civil war. There is the army of another country here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem to start World War III,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem is to stop it\u2014to prevent a nuclear war.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In August the Ukrainian government pulled all volunteer battalions off the front lines around Mariupol, replacing them with regular military units.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In August the Ukrainian government pulled all volunteer battalions off the front lines around Mariupol, replacing them with regular military units.", "title": "As War Escalates, Ukrainian Battalion Remains Sidelined", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SIDELINED_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-28T11:23:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JzHFgp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In August the Ukrainian government pulled all volunteer battalions off the front lines around Mariupol, replacing them with regular military units.", "title": "As War Escalates, Ukrainian Battalion Remains Sidelined", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SIDELINED_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-08-27T20:50:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-28T11:23:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Azov, Mariupol"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1961\"", "article_summary": "Many residents credit the volunteer battalions with preventing a combined Russian-separatist force breakthrough to seize back control of the city.\nAnd as the war has dragged on, the volunteer units have developed into some of Ukraine\u2019s most battle-hardened and well-trained fighting forces.\nURZUF, Ukraine\u2014The vehicle yard at the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Battalion\u2019s base here looks like the set of a Mad Max movie.\nFor the Azov soldiers in Urzuf, the idyllic, seaside resort feeling of Urzuf is a contradiction that leaves many feeling restless.\nApis said officials in Kyiv claimed the recent withdrawal from Shyrokyne was due to high casualty rates among volunteer units."}
