We are there for them. There are people with disabilities that cannot help themselves and that's why we are there for them,\u201d said Cynthia Paul.\n\nTwo board members were at the meeting Tuesday. However, no one from management was there.\n\nNews 4 reached out to the Anderson County Special Needs Board executive director for a comment, but have not heard back.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 23:53:21 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Liz Lohuis", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "Employees of an Upstate special needs agency are accusing management of making threats, mismanaging money, and lacking leadership.", "title": "Serious complaints made about managers of special needs agency", "url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/serious-complaints-made-about-managers-of-special-needs-agency/30689816", "image": "http://www.wyff4.com/image/view/-/30690010/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/1bgs6vz/-/ANDERSON-GRIEVANCE-MEETING-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/serious-complaints-made-about-managers-of-special-needs-agency/30689816", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wyff://content/article/30689816", "iphone": "wyff://content/article/30689816", "googleplay": "wyff://content/article/30689816"}, "name": {"ipad": "wyff", "iphone": "wyff", "googleplay": "wyff"}, "id": {"ipad": 505507641, "iphone": 505507641, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}}, "site": "@wyffnews4", "card": "app"}, "description": "Employees of an Upstate special needs agency are accusing management of making threats, mismanaging money, and lacking leadership.", "al": {"android": {"url": "wyff://content/article/30689816", "app_name": "wyff", "package": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}, "ios": {"url": "wyff://content/article/30689816", "app_store_id": 505507641, "app_name": "wyff"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 135671321180}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/LizLohuisWyff4"}, "keywords": "SPECIAL, NEEDS, BOARD, MANAGEMENT, GRIEVANCES, LIZ, LOHUIA", "google-site-verification": "LWpc590JPr9qDk05qHGWcq1nIo4PF7VlkN6wQmjiOb8", "news_keywords": "SPECIAL, NEEDS, BOARD, MANAGEMENT, GRIEVANCES, LIZ, LOHUIA"}, "article_summary": "News 4 reached out to the Anderson County Special Needs Board executive director for a comment, but have not heard back.\nAbout 30 current employees and nearly a dozen former employees spoke out for two hours, citing serious problems with management at the Anderson County Special Needs Board.\nOne employee said some of the special needs clients they serve are unable to access their own money.\nEmployees who attended the meeting said they've tried making formal complaints to management of the special needs board, but were retaliated against.\nEmployees of an Upstate special needs agency are accusing management of making threats, mismanaging money, and lacking leadership."}
