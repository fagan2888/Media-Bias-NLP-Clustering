(Photo: COURTESY OF MARC LOMURRO)\n\nTINTON FALLS \u2013 Alcohol, grief and the Internet \u2014 it\u2019s the perfect recipe for a social media blunder.\n\nMatt Reardon learned that the hard way, while surfing the web on the anniversary of his father\u2019s death. He said he was drinking tequila when he wrote an inflammatory Facebook comment about police brutality.\n\nHis post: \u201cDon\u2019t wanna get clipped while sitting in your squad car?? Don\u2019t be a (expletives deleted) pig who\u2019s looking to get killed...Everyone who goes out of their way to (expletive deleted) with other people should get executed in cold blood.\u201d\n\nSure enough, it unleashed the fire of online lynch mobs.\n\nBut it also landed the 29-year-old township man in jail for a week in late December on assault and disorderly conduct charges \u2014 charges based on language that an assignment judge later called \u201ctoo trivial\u201d to count as a threat.\n\n\u201cHe mentions nothing about the Tinton Falls Police Department. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about any New Jersey police,\u201d Judge Lisa Thornton told the prosecution in July. \u201cIf you were a good lawyer \u2014 and I\u2019ll give you a benefit of the doubt on this one \u2014 you would say that he doesn\u2019t even say he is going to threaten to hurt anybody.\u201d\n\nThornton dismissed the charges July 10, after Reardon\u2019s attorney, Richard Lomurro, filed a motion to appear. At most, she said, his message was \u201cyou reap what you sow.\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing the judge\u2019s decision, the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided not to appeal.\n\nBut the case still isn\u2019t over. Reardon and his attorney are still considering whether to sue authorities for wrongful arrest.\n\n\u2018True threats\u2019 online\n\nSo what constitutes a real threat on the Internet?\n\nThat question came to a head in Elonis v. United States, recently decided by the Supreme Court. The court overturned the conviction of a Pennsylvania man on charges that he threatened his estranged wife and an FBI agent, among others, in a series of Facebook posts Elonis characterized as rap lyrics.\n\nOne post, referring to his wife\u2019s protection from abuse order, said \u201cfold up that PFA and put it in your pocket, will it stop a .23 bullet?\u201d\n\n\u201c(In the amicus brief) we asked the court to be very careful about what\u2019s construed as or considered a true threat, particularly based on the way communication happens on the Internet,\u201d said Hanni Fakhoury, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who was involved in the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned the conviction based on the federal threat statute \u2014 not First Amendment speech protections. The government, the court said, had to prove Elonis intended to harm those people when he wrote the posts.\n\n\u201cIt was very narrowly focused on the specific federal statute,\u201d Fakhoury said. \u201cIt kind of left things unsettled.\u201d\n\nPolicing the Internet\n\nFakhoury said he hoped for a broader decision that would have extended free speech protections to even the most divisive and inflammatory threads on the Internet.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we have to be really careful on how we prosecute online-based speech is, you\u2019re bringing in the machinery of the criminal justice system, which could have terrible results,\u201d Fakhoury said.\n\nReardon, now 30, spent months fighting the terroristic threat and disorderly conduct charges. He said his post was clearly rhetorical. He also said the disorderly conduct charge was for him yelling \u201cwhat the (expletive)?\u201d and calling for his mother when he was arrested.\n\nHis ordeal began the night of Dec. 21, when Reardon found himself drinking tequila and watching graphic videos on YouTube of what appeared to be police brutality. His post then followed.\n\nTwo weeks had passed since a grand jury decided against indicting white New York Police officers in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black Staten Island man being arrested for selling loose cigarettes. That week, two NYPD patrolmen were gunned down by 28-year-old Ismayil Brinsley, who then killed himself. He had posted an image in social media of wings on a pig.\n\nA screenshot of Reardon\u2019s comment quickly went viral, sparking outrage from officers and supporters throughout the state.\n\nReardon was arrested the next day outside of his house, on charges that he wrote a terroristic threat and was being disorderly when approached by the arresting officer, according to the police report.\n\nSeveral calls and messages to the Tinton Falls Police Department went unreturned.\n\nReardon spent eight days in jail in lieu of $75,000 bail, including Christmas. Then a judge lowered the bail. He spent months fighting the charges.\n\n\u201cMy Facebook post was not meant to be, or could it be interpreted as a threat,\u201d he wrote in a motion to dismiss. \u201cEven taken out of context, the Facebook post did not state I would do anything or name anyone in particular.\u201d\n\nJudge Thornton agreed. At the court appearance in July, she said the prosecution was conflating two questions: \u201cShould police officers be upset?\u201d versus \u201cWas the comment that made police upset illegal?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe yelled, he took his hands off the hood of his car, and he turned to his mother, when the officer told him to face the hood of the car,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cThere was no attempt to prevent (an arrest), no flight, no intimidation.\u201d\n\nWith that, Thornton said she was dropping all charges.\n\nJoe Bahgat, a local media attorney following the case, said he didn\u2019t see how Reardon\u2019s comment could warrant the aggravated assault and terroristic threat charge.\n\n\u201cIf I were a cop, I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled with Reardon\u2019s comments, but the cop\u2019s reaction in this circumstance only made things worse,\u201d Bahgat wrote on his blog, Internet on Trial. \u201cIn fact, by unlawfully arresting a citizen for exercising his First Amendment rights, the cop essentially vindicated Reardon\u2019s words.\u201d\n\nAfter the case was dismissed, Lomurro told the Asbury Park Press the judge\u2019s decision emphasized that First Amendment rights should apply to social media networks such as Facebook.\n\n\"Although speech can be offensive, it is still protected and we can't allow people to be jailed for expressing an opinion when no crime has occurred,\" Lomurro said. \"This was a true victory for the First Amendment in its modern application.\"\n\nCheryl Dorsey, a retired officer and policing expert, said while she could see how officers would have perceived Reardon\u2019s comment as a threat, there are some who make questionable arrests to retaliate against civilians who disrespect authority.\n\nShe said that\u2019s a police officer\u2019s way of saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t get to go on social media and talk smack without there being a consequence,\u201d said Dorsey, a former Los Angeles Police Department sergeant.\n\nMonths after the arrest, Reardon still suffers the consequences. He said he lost his job as a drummer in an up-and-coming band and couldn\u2019t get work as a machinist.\n\n\u201cIn the past, my work ethic, experience and know-how spoke for itself,\u201d she said. \u201cNow the record of this arrest and that I was in jail scares employers, and they will never call me back.\u201d\n\nFor some experts, Reardon\u2019s experience shows how the Supreme Court could do more to ensure free speech protections on social media. The justices, in deciding the Elonis controversy, could have changed how millions of Facebook users, including law enforcement, understand free speech in the digital age.\n\n\u201cIt shows you the real problem with having an expansive definition of what qualifies as a threat,\u201d Fahkhoury said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we should be careful before we deploy the criminal justice system on people. That\u2019s kind of the larger debate we are having.\u201d\n\nSteph Solis: 732-643-4043; ssolis@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
