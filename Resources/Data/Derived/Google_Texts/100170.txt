WELCOME TO NOVEMBER -- MARK HALPERIN, JOHN HEILEMANN 'DOUBLE DOWN' in book out Tue. -- OBAMACARE FIRST 2 DAYS: 248 web enrollees -- McAULIFFE OUTSPENDS CUCCINELLI 25-to-1 on TV this week

SNEAK PEEK – GAME CHANGE II! “Double Down: Game Change 2012,” by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, out Tuesday from The Penguin Press – Chapter 3, “Obama’s List”: “Obama walked in to the State Dining Room … and there they were, two dozen aides and operatives crowded around a long oaken table … [David] Plouffe looked at the humongous assemblage and thought it was insane. … But Obama insisted on the big group … [For a later strategy session,] Obama strode into the Roosevelt Room, … to which the meetings had been relocated with a slightly (but only slightly) slimmed-down cast. … Obama talked about energy and climate change … immigration reform … poverty … Israel and Palestine … Guantanamo Bay … And he talked about gay marriage. … Taken in sum, Obama’s list was a revealing document. … Obama was saying he believed that over the past three years his progressive impulses had too often been trumped by the demands of pragmatism. … [Chief of Staff Bill] Daley thought … ‘Holy shit, we have a bunch of leakers here. I hope to God this doesn’t get out.’ …

“Obama exhaled heavily when he learned the news. He was stunned, then angry, then disappointed, then hurt. ‘I can’t believe this,’ Obama said. ‘This is exactly what I said couldn’t happen.’ Obama was in the Oval Office … and being told that his list had leaked. The details came from Plouffe and [Jim] Messina, who had learned that two authors [Halperin and Heilemann] … knew all about the extraordinary session six weeks earlier; they had the whole roster of Obama’s regrets in copious detail. ‘How could someone do this to me?’ Obama asked. ‘If I can’t be honest with you people, how can we keep having these meetings?’ … [T]he next session was scheduled to start in a few minutes … The group was assembling in the Roosevelt Room … Maybe they should just cancel the thing, shut it down? No, Obama said. I want to go in there and say my piece. … He walked into the room looking stern … and then laid into his team.

Story Continued Below

“When we started having these meetings, Obama said, I told you that I trusted everyone in this room. But now somebody has betrayed that trust. … [U]nless and until the person who did this comes to me, tells me they did this, and apologizes, these meetings are over. I’m gonna be in the Oval Office. When somebody is ready to come forward and own up to this, you know where to find me. With that, Obama stood up and walked out the door, leaving a crashing silence behind him.” No one did, and the inner circle shrunk markedly.

MORE NUGGETS from “Double Down”:

--Obama “and Michelle were both avid consumers of political commentary. Here habit was cable, and especially ‘Morning Joe.’ (She watched the show religiously while working out, then fired off agitated e-mails to [Valerie] Jarrett about what this or that talking head had said.) ”

--Dan “Pfeiffer was … droll, acerbic, faintly cynical, and whip smart. … Pfeiffer … pounded out a memo with various [options]. More off-the-record briefings … More outreach to liberal columnists, bloggers, and the talking heads at MSNBC. … ‘We could do all those things, but part of this is about strategic choices.,” Pfeiffer told Obama. We made a strategic choice that we were gonna portray you, because you are, as reasonable. But in today’s media environment, there is no caucus for reasonableness, with the possible exception of David Brooks. And there is no communications strategy that will make David Brooks and Paul Krugman like the same thing. So you’re gonna have to choose.’”

“Obama and Clinton convened on the first tee at Andrews … Obama intent on playing the game, getting up and down; Clinton cracking jokes and yakking, taking mulligan after mulligan. … When Clinton came off the course, he was asked by an aide how it went. Obama grimaced and replied, ‘I like him … in doses.’”

--“Until [the] Denver [debate debacle], Clinton had watched in wonder as Obama caught break after break. … Meanwhile, Romney’s ineptness staggered Clinton. After the release of the 47 percent video, he remarked to a friend that, while Mitt was a decent man, he was in the wrong line of work. (‘He really shouldn’t be speaking to people in public.’) As for Obama, Clinton trotted out for his pals the same line again and again: ‘He’s luckier than a dog with two dicks.’”

--In the staff hold room at Obama’s second debate camp, at the Kingsmill resort in Williamsburg, “The full transcript [of the camp’s first mock debate, in which Obama’s ‘emotional flatness from … Denver was back’] … became a source of gallows humor. As the clock ticked well past midnight, Favreau stagily read aloud some of Obama’s most dreadful answers. Soon his colleagues joined in, with [David] Axelrod, [Joel] Benenson, and Plouffe offering recitations and laughing deliriously over the absurdity and horror of the circumstances. … Every day, … the team had put Obama in front of a video monitor. Every day they explained what he needed to do to improve. Every day he said, ‘I got it.’ But apart from momentary flashes of adequacy, nothing had changed.”

--Robert “Barnett and others believed that Obama’s playbook needed to be stripped down more dramatically … Klain agreed and wanted to go further. In 1996, Democratic strategist Mark Penn had devised something called ‘debate-on-a-page’ for Gore in his VP face-off with Jack Kemp. … Klain … presented Obama with his debate-on-a-page: MUST REMEMBER 1. (Your) Speed Kills (Romney) 2. Upbeat and Positive in Tone 3. Passion for People and Plans 4. OTR [Off the Record] Mindset – Have Fun 5. Strong Sentences to Start and End 6. Engage the Audience 7. Don’t Chase Rabbits BEST HITS 1. 47% 2. Romney + China Outsourcing … 4. 9-11 Girl 5. Sketchy Deal … REBUTTAL CHEAT SHEET 1. Jobs – The 1 point plan … 8. Gridlock – Romney brings the lobbyist back 9. Benghazi – Taking offense.”

--“That the intervention had had some effect on Obama was immediately apparent … He brought a new energy and focus to his afternoon drills. … [H]e refused even brief breaks for a walk by the river. As the afternoon went on, the debate team concocted cutesy catchphrases to cue him at the slighted hint of backsliding. ‘Fast and hammy! Fast and hammy!’ Klain would say when his delivery was too lugubrious. ‘Punch him in the face!’ Karen Dunn chipped in when he missed a chance to cream Kerry-as-Mitt.” Amazon.com pre-order: $20.07 hardcover, $11.99 Kindle, $26.96 audiobook CD http://goo.gl/oxpGMU

VEEP FRENZY --N.Y. Times A15, with A1 tease, “Book Details Obama Aides’ Talks About Replacing Biden on 2012 Ticket,” by Jonathan Martin: “The idea of replacing Mr. Biden with Mrs. Clinton … was pushed by the chief of staff at the time, William M. Daley … In a phone interview on Thursday, Mr. Daley acknowledged that he had wanted to research what the move would have meant for Mr. Obama, whose popularity, in the fall of 2011, was at its lowest in his presidency to date. He called it simply ‘due diligence. … I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them … You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, ‘Holy Christ, what do we do?’” http://goo.gl/RpY1w8

--Daley pushed back on “CBS This Morning”: “Not for a moment was there a serious discussion or a belief that Joe Biden should be replaced. Period. That doesn’t mean issues were not looked at … This is a little bit of an overhype … Any research that was done confirmed the fact that this was not an issue that the voters cared about or thought that should be done, and the president, in my opinion, believed then, and I believe now, not for a moment would he have ever considered that.” –Tal Kopan

SIREN! MENDING FENCES – Secretary of State John Kerry admits some spying has “reached too far inappropriately” – Remarks via videoconference yesterday to the Open Government Partnership Annual Summit, in London, released by State last night: “There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening, in many ways, on an automatic pilot because the technology is there … We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we’ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans. I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process, but there’s an effort to try to gather information. And yes, in some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately. …

“[O]ur President … is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse. … Just the other day … there was news in the papers of 70 million people [French conversations] being listened to. No, they weren’t. It didn’t happen. There’s an enormous amount of exaggeration in this reporting from some reporters out there. What we’re trying to do is in a random way find ways of trying to learn if, in fact, there is a threat that we need to respond to. And in some cases, I acknowledge to you, as has the President, that some of these actions have reached too far, and we are going to make sure that does not happen in the future.” Transcript http://goo.gl/3UnYEo

CLICK DU JOUR – Bloomberg Businessweek cover shows a photo of President Obama, failing to load: “Crashed … One year – and one epic fail – into his second term, Barack Obama needs a reboot.” EZRA KLEIN has the cover essay, “How the iPod President Crashed”: “The disastrous launch of healthcare.gov … has dealt a devastating blow to Obama’s vision. In the months leading up to the Oct. 1 rollout of the site, the president rarely compared his signature policy achievement to Medicare or Social Security. Instead, he favored analogies to e-commerce sites such as Orbitz, Travelocity, and Expedia. Obamacare was supposed to be the model for a 21st century social program, not a replica of programs built in the 20th. Now Republicans are seizing on the breakdown of the health exchange to reinforce the idea that government can’t do anything right—particularly not anything of this size. …

“Even Obama’s allies acknowledge that the healthcare.gov debacle could do damage beyond the health-care system. … Obama and the people around him … must force the rest of the federal bureaucracy to change. The iPod didn’t negotiate with the other music players on the market—it ruthlessly outcompeted them. The Obama administration needs to set that process loose in government, too. That begins with procurement reform, but it won’t end until the White House is ready to take IT tasks away from agencies that can’t handle them effectively and create a centralized IT group … We live in an age when machines can learn. Can government?” See the cover. http://goo.gl/o9ZyL1 Read Ezra. http://goo.gl/NuP2RG

NEWS YOU CAN USE – “U.S. to allow expanded electronic device use on flights” – Reuters: “Mobile phone calls remain barred … But fliers will be free to keep smartphones, tablets and e-readers running in ‘airplane’ mode. … Passengers will be able to connect with an airline's WiFi network and can use Bluetooth accessories … A big winner from the change could be Gogo Inc, whose shares closed 4.5 percent higher. The company supplies Internet service to about 80 percent of U.S. aircraft. … [T]he current policy was put in place about 50 years ago.”

--“Airlines jockey for front of the gadget line,” by Kathryn A. Wolfe, with Scott Wong: “The FAA’s announcement that it’s loosening the restrictions on in-flight electronic devices served as a starting gun for the airlines, with JetBlue and Delta being the most aggressive. JetBlue predicted it may be able to start allowing its passengers to play music and games through all phases of flight the same day … Delta, which claimed to be the first airline to have its paperwork turned in to the FAA for approval, said it could allow its passengers to use their Kindles and iPads all flight as soon as [today]. American Airlines … said it plans to submit its paperwork on Friday for its mainline fleet, while its regional partners could have their flights approved by the end of the year.”

BUZZ –“Hartley Said to Be Top Candidate for U.S. Ambassador to France,” by Bloomberg’s Joe Sobczyk: “Jane Hartley, a fundraiser for President Obama and co-founder of the economic and political advisory firm Observatory Group LLC, is the leading candidate to be nominated as U.S. ambassador to France [and Monaco] … Hartley, 63, would replace Charles Rivkin, another Obama fundraiser who the president has nominated to become assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs … Hartley raised at least $500,000 for Obama's 2012 re- election campaign … [H]er husband, Ralph Schlosstein, [is CEO] of Evercore Partners … Avenue Capital Group LLC co-founder Marc Lasry had been the leading candidate for the Paris posting. He told clients of the distressed-debt firm in April that he would stay [in] New York.”

CONFIRMATION WAR – “Senate talks going nuclear,” by Burgess Everett, with John Bresnahan and Seung Min Kim: “Senate Republicans held together to block two of President Obama’s nominations to both the executive and judicial branches. The votes threatened to upend the relative peace that has taken hold in the Senate over the past few months since leaders agreed in July to not change the chamber’s rules by a majority vote — the ‘nuclear option’ — to make it harder for the minority to block executive nominations. Senate liberals — who have long pressed their leadership to rewrite the rules to allow nominations to pass with a simple majority — pointed to Thursday’s votes as yet another reason to eliminate 60-vote thresholds on procedural votes for nominees. The chamber voted 56-42 to block Rep. Mel Watt’s (D-N.C.) nomination to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency — a rare rebuke to a sitting lawmaker. Patricia Millett’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was stopped in a 55-38 vote. …

“[L]eadership is taking a wait-and-see approach before again throwing the Senate into a chaotic battle over the filibuster, which consumed the chamber in July. But there may even more pressure to consider filibuster reform in the coming weeks, when tough votes loom over Obama’s nominees to head the Federal Reserve, the Homeland Security Department as well as two additional D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judges. … The GOP blocked Watt’s nomination because they saw him as a political pick, rather than a housing policy expert. Republicans objected to Millett because they believe the court has a minimal workload and they were worried that Obama is trying to stack the 11-seat bench ideologically.” http://goo.gl/bcu1zn

TOP TALKER – “Obamacare enrollments got off to very slow start, documents show,” by Sharyl Attkisson on the “CBS Evening News”: “Early enrollment figures are contained in notes from twice-a-day ‘war room’ meetings convened within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after the website failed on Oct. 1. They were turned over in response to a document request from the House Oversight Committee. The website launched on a Tuesday. Publicly, the government said there were 4.7 million unique visits in the first 24 hours. But at a meeting Wednesday morning, the war room notes say ‘six enrollments have occurred so far.’ … By Wednesday afternoon, enrollments were up to ‘approximately 100.’

“By the end of Wednesday, the notes reflect ‘248 enrollments’ nationwide. The health care exchanges need to average 39,000 enrollees a day to meet the goal of seven million by March 1. The war room notes give a glimpse into some of the reasons customers had problems [including] ‘confusion with credit check information’ … The notes leave no doubt that some enrollment figures, which the administration has chosen to keep secret, are available. … Contractor ‘QSSI has a daily dashboard created every night.’ …

“[An HHS] spokesman suggested the numbers obtained by CBS News may not include all the different ways to enroll, such as paper applications. The spokesman also said that enrollment figures in Massachusetts' health care plan started off negligible but then skyrocketed as a deadline neared.” Video and documents http://goo.gl/kPLIKW

--MARKETING DOLLARS BEING HELD BACK -- Anna Palmer and Jonathan Allen: “There’s no point in an ad blitz directing people to sign up on a website that doesn’t work. And while advocacy groups say they had always planned to spend more money on the back end to boost enrollment in lagging states at the end of this year and early next year, … [t]he website bomb is more than just an inconvenience for the groups … The ad effort is an integral part of the plan to sign up enough people -- particularly the ‘young invincibles’ so critical to making the law’s exchanges a success … The pro-Obamacare interest groups have been holding back, according to White House and insurance industry sources … ‘There was definitely a pullback,’ said one health insurance company executive … The groups had also been planning to reserve some money so they could focus on states with lagging enrollment … But the combination of factors means there’s still a lot of more money than expected sitting on the sidelines …

“The Obama administration isn’t just leaving the PR campaign to third party groups. In July, HHS inked a $33 million contract with PR giant Weber Shandwick. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid had already signed a $3 million and $8 million contracts. Porter Novelli also has a $20 million contract with the agency.” http://goo.gl/1rwmKT

--TODD S. PURDUM, “The Obamacare sabotage campaign … calculated sabotage by Republicans at every step”: “[S]ome states refused to do anything at all to educate the public about the law. And congressional Republicans sent so many burdensome queries to local hospitals and nonprofits gearing up to help consumers … The conservative battle against the Affordable Care Act continues … in the courts. A federal district court judge in Washington last week denied the government’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by individuals and businesses from six states. The suit, coordinated by the Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges an IRS ruling that people can get tax credits to subsidize insurance in the federal-run exchanges, not just the state-based ones. Knocking out those subsidies would be a huge blow to the heart of Obamacare … Similar cases are pending in other states.” http://goo.gl/uvc5oj

TUESDAY’S RACES – “Liberal billionaires spend big in 2013 elections,” by Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman: “Democrats and liberal interest groups spent much of 2012 bemoaning an avalanche of outside spending from billionaires on the right, warning that ideological tycoons like the Koch brothers and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson could threaten the legitimacy of the American electoral system. … In the off-year campaigns of 2013, liberal and Democratic interests have enjoyed a decisive advantage in the billionaire spending bracket. Indeed, groups tied to just three liberal-leaning billionaires – New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, California investor Tom Steyer and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg – have spent well over $25 million this year pushing progressive candidates and causes. Their arrival on the political scene, at the same time as many conservative donors remain disheartened from the GOP’s 2012 defeat, represents a shift in power in the arena of big-money campaigns. …

“The left’s swift embrace of outside money is both disheartening to campaign finance reformers and maddening to Republicans, who argue that the media and political community hold wealthy progressives to a different standard than donors like the Kochs. Democratic strategist Chris Lehane, Steyer’s top adviser, predicted that more liberal super-donors would come forward over the next election cycle … [In Virginia,] Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC is on track to spend $3 million by Election Day targeting the Republican candidates for governor and attorney general on the issue of gun control. Steyer, a hedge fund executive, has spent millions through the group NextGen Climate Action on digital and turnout programs … FWD.us – which receives a majority of its funding from Zuckerberg – has put about $15 million into advocating for comprehensive immigration reform.” http://goo.gl/VNx5Ws

--AIR WAR – “McAuliffe seeks to win race that eluded him before,” by AP’s Philip Elliott in Harrisonburg, with Steve Szkotak in Richmond: Democrat Terry “McAuliffe … is outspending [Republican Ken] Cuccinelli by … 25-to-1 … on … TV … this week. … Outside groups, including Planned Parenthood, the labor unions AFSCME and the United Steelworkers, have stepped in with tons more … Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending more than $1 million on ads criticizing Cuccinelli's support for gun rights, and California billionaire Tom Steyer has spent more than $2.4 million on ads criticizing Cuccinelli's environmental record.”

MEDIAWATCH – BETSY OUT OF THE FISHBOWL -- Dylan Byers: “Betsy Rothstein … has resigned as editor of … [the media gossip website] Fishbowl DC. ‘Whether raging waters or smooth sailing, my 3 years at FishbowlDC have been the perfect storm. Onto new adventures. Stay tuned...,’ she tweeted … Rothstein told POLITICO she had ‘nothing but gratitude for mediabistro for letting me run FishbowlDC. Has been a ball … I need to go out to the desert and meditate for a while and see what you should do next’ ... Contributor Peter Ogburn also left the site on Thursday; Eddie Scarry, another writer, decamped to The Blaze months earlier. Chris Ariens, the vice president of Mediabistro, declined to comment. Under Rothstein, Fishbowl DC became a gossip hub for media's 20- and 30-somethings, many of whom visited the site fearing rather than hoping that they would see their names in print.”

--N.Y. Times Metro Editor Wendell Jamieson sends a “Watch Out, Albany” memo to the staff: “Our stellar Albany team of Jesse McKinley and Tom Kaplan is getting a thrilling addition as we move toward a big election year: Susanne Craig, now a star of BizDay, will become Albany bureau chief. Assembly mischief-makers and Senate backroom deal-makers, look out. Sue has covered Wall Street for The New York Times since 2010, investigating everything from rogue stockbrokers to power struggles inside Goldman's executive suite. She has also written for other sections of the paper: Earlier this year, for Sports, she spearheaded an investigation into judging conflicts at the Westminster Dog Show, and in 2011 she was on the scene for Metro when Tropical Storm Irene ripped through upstate New York.

“Prior to landing at The Times, Sue worked at The Wall Street Journal, where she covered Wall Street for more than a decade. During that time she was a lead reporter in a package of stories on the financial crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers that was a finalist for a 2009 Pulitzer. However, she is perhaps best known at The Journal for her investigation into gift-giving on Wall Street, a series of stories that culminated with an article on a lavish stock trader's bachelor party, complete with dwarf-tossing. When Sue came to me and expressed an infectious interest in covering Albany in all its ‘unvarnished’ glory, I could hardly believe my — or Metro's — good fortune. Her excitement in diving into this world of characters, and dubious dealing, and dysfunction, and sometimes even governing, reminded me just how fascinating it all really is. …

“But Metro's good fortune is BizDay's bittersweet day, so let me hand off for a moment to [Business Editor] Dean Murphy: … ‘It's World Series time, so forgive the sports analogy, but when Sue came to BizDay three years ago, she was what sports teams call a franchise hire. She proved that with her very first story, a Page 1 takeout on partners at Goldman Sachs being pushed from the bank's cherished inner circle .. [I]t is with great delight we await her dispatches from Albany. That will be a captivating spectator sport.’ Sue has also worked at The Globe and Mail and The Financial Post. A native of Canada, she is looking forward to being three hours closer to her homeland. Craig, McKinley and Kaplan are something akin to a dream team. It's going to be a big, hotly competitive year on Albany. … Sue starts … Jan. 1.”

SPORTS BLINK – COLLEGE BASKETBALL -- “Kentucky is No. 1 in preseason poll,” by AP Basketball Writer Jim O’Connell: “Kentucky and its roster full of high school All-Americas is the narrow choice over Michigan State in The Associated Press' preseason college basketball poll. The Wildcats, who finished last season with an NIT opening-round loss at Robert Morris, received 27 first-place votes and 1,546 points from the 65-member national media panel. The Spartans, who return four starters from the team that lost to Duke in the NCAA tournament's round of 16, snared 22 first-place votes and 1,543 points. … Defending national champion Louisville received 14 first-place votes and was third while Duke, which received the other two No. 1 votes, was fourth. Kansas was fifth and was followed by 6) Arizona and 7) Michigan.

“Oklahoma State and Syracuse tied for eighth and Florida rounded out the Top Ten. Ohio State was 11th and was followed by 12) North Carolina, 13) Memphis, 14) VCU, 15) Gonzaga, 16) Wichita State, 17) Marquette, 18) Connecticut, 19) Oregon and 20) Wisconsin. The last five ranked teams were 21) Notre Dame, 22) UCLA, 23) New Mexico, 24) Virginia and 25) Baylor. This is Kentucky's third preseason No. 1 and first since 1995-96 when the Wildcats won the national championship.” http://goo.gl/BsJfuo

--“SEASON OVERVIEW: Kentucky, Kansas, Duke in focus as season tips off,” by AP Basketball Writer Jim O’Connell: “John Calipari has been here before and it ended well. The last time the Kentucky coach had a freshman class this talented, the season ended with a national championship. The eight-man class … includes six McDonald's All-Americans … Kentucky's freshmen class features forward Julius Randle, considered a possible No. 1 pick in the 2014 NBA draft, identical twin guards Andrew and Aaron Harrison, and swingman James Young. … There will be other freshmen who could make an impact on the chase for the NCAA title. Andrew Wiggins has Kansas fans harking back to the days when Danny Manning led the Jayhawks to the national championship. Chicago native Jabari Parker will fit smoothly into Duke's offense which this season promises to be a lot more uptempo.”
