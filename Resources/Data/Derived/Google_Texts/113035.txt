With earnings season nearing the end, the following IBD 50 stocks have seen the biggest leaps forward in earnings per share on an annual basis.

Paycom

Paycom Software (PAYC) provides human resource and payroll applications to companies looking to take advantage of cloud computing.

The Oklahoma City-based company notched 150% EPS growth during the second quarter compared to a year earlier — 67% higher than analysts forecast. Revenue jumped 47% to $49 million.

Mostly small and midsize companies use Paycom’s software to manage payroll and human resources activity. It covers everything from hiring to retirement.

The Affordable Care Act has added more complexity, especially to health benefits processing. That’s put Paycom on a fast growth path as its cloud-based products help companies manage the changes under the health law.

Third-quarter revenue guidance was given in the range of $51 million to $52 million with full-year revenue range raised to $210 million to $212 million, up from the previous range of $203 million to $205 million.

Paycom shares have surged more than 40% so far this calendar year and the company has a Composite Rating of 97. Its record high of 41.58 was reached on Tuesday.

Tesoro

The collapse in crude oil prices has helped lower input costs for refiners like Tesoro (TSO), which grew its EPS by 172% compared to a year earlier.

According to a Barclays research note on Aug. 7, U.S. and global refining margins continued to march higher in Q2, significantly topping market expectations and building on an already impressive Q1.

And in the U.S. market, July margins were higher than even May, which is typically the strongest month.

Until Friday, San Antonio-based Tesoro had been trading above its 50-day average since July 1, and it has a Composite Rating of 83. The stock reached a record high of 110.74 on Aug. 13.

WisdomTree

WisdomTree Investments (WETF) is a New York-based exchange-traded fund with more than $60 billion in assets under management. It posted a 100% EPS gain in Q2 compared with Q2 of 2014.

Earlier this month, WisdomTree had its price target raised to 31 from 23 at Jefferies, which cited organic growth and operating profitability, with an expected interest rate hike and a strong macroeconomic background also contributing.

Its shares are up by roughly one-third so far this year and WisdomTree has a Composite Rating of 94. It fell below its 50-day average on Thursday, though still trades above its 200-day moving average. The fund hit a record high of 26.23 on Aug. 5.

One of the few remaining IBD 50 stocks that has yet to report is Ulta Beauty (ULTA). When results come out Thursday, analysts expect EPS to climb 19% to $1.12 with sales up 18% to $869.3 million.
