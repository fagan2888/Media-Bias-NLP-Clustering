The iPhone 5S release date rumor may have inadvertently been confirmed by the Apple employee calendar.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, the Apple iPhone 5S release date is rumored to be set for September 20.

Apple is already gearing up for the iPhone 5S release date by introducing an iPhone trade in program. The Apple iPhone 5S unveiling will take place on September 10 at some sort of special Apple event.

A leaked Apple employee calendar seems to confirm the Apple iPhone 5S release date in September because it restricts the amount of time off AppleCare employees can take from September 15 through September 28. This also happens to match the employee calendar vacation blackout dates being scheduled by major wireless carriers like T-Mobile.

So what new features will the Apple iPhone 5S release date bring us? Apple will be upgrading the iPhone lineup with iOS 7â€²s new interface and also Apple iTunes Radio. The latest Apple iPhone 5S and 6 rumors say Apple is expected to upgrade to a faster processor, improved retina display, NFC support, 4G, 802.11ac wireless networking, and a low-cost version of its popular iPhone line. Apple iPhone 6 and 5S rumors also say the iPhone 5S will incorporate fingerprint detection security measures since Apple purchased Authentec.

Are these new features enough to make you stand in line on the Apple iPhone 5S release date?
