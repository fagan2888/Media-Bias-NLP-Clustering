Not only do 54 percent of 18-29-year-olds disapprove of the president\u2019s job performance, but also 52 percent of 18-24-year-olds would recall him if given the chance.\n\nThat\u2019s headline news for a president who built a reputation for connecting with young people. More importantly, it\u2019s an indictment of his policies and his leadership.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the president\u2019s popularity has fallen at the very time ObamaCare has been in the news almost non-stop. And as anyone who\u2019s been awake the last few months knows, that news hasn\u2019t been good: canceled plans, sticker shock, a malfunctioning website.\n\nAccording to Harvard, Millennials have taken note: 57 percent disapprove of ObamaCare. A majority believe it will drive up costs.\n\nObamaCare is not kind to young people. Young, healthy Americans shopping for individual plans could spend more than twice as much as they would have before ObamaCare for the same coverage.\n\nAnd young people have no choice. Under ObamaCare, they must purchase insurance or pay a fine. Democrats are counting on young healthy Americans to subsidize older Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s what Millennials should come to expect from Democrats. They consistently advocate for borrowing more money to pay for things the country can\u2019t afford. It\u2019s younger Americans who will pay off that debt someday. And here again, they\u2019re subsidizing older Americans.\n\nYoung people have endured a lot in the Obama years, including record student loan debt and an 11.1 percent unemployment rate for 20-24-year-olds. Today, 18-34-year-olds account for almost half of all unemployed Americans. What has the president done for them?\n\nGood question.\n\nLast month, the White House held a \u201cyouth summit\u201d to talk to young people about ObamaCare and try to improve the administration\u2019s image. They tried to give the impression Millennials have a seat at the table in the Obama White House. But as College Republican National Committee Chair Alex Smith noted, an event for doling out pro-administration talking points isn\u2019t a seat at the table; it was more like Millennials were stuck at the \u201ckids\u2019 table.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not acceptable. It\u2019s not fair that Democrat policies are making life harder for Millennials and forcing them to spend more of their paychecks \u2014 if they have paychecks.\n\nMillennials need leaders that will give them every opportunity to succeed in life. Young people want to work; they want to live their lives. Too many of them don\u2019t have that chance in today\u2019s economy, which still looks too much like the economy of a few years ago.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t guarantee that everyone\u2019s outcomes will be the same, but we can guarantee that we won\u2019t force the Millennial generation to subsidize other generations more and more. We wouldn\u2019t get in their way; we\u2019d get out of their way \u2014 letting them get to work and get on with life.\n\nWe don\u2019t believe their lives need to be micromanaged from Washington, D.C. We believe in giving them the freedom to chart their own courses. But they won\u2019t have that freedom as long as Democrat policies keep them from good jobs and financial security.\n\nNow, it\u2019s no secret that Republicans didn\u2019t win the majority of young people\u2019s votes in the last election. We have work to do. One of the RNC\u2019s priorities is engaging more with young people and offering our ideas. It\u2019s not enough for them to reject President Obama and the Democrats; Republicans must stand as a viable option.\n\nThat is why we asking our young volunteers to focus on their own communities \u2014 having them work on their campuses and in their neighborhoods. Because we know that young people are tired of failed policies that promise more than they deliver. We are going to be leading candidates to events focused on young voters so that they can hear firsthand the issues on Millennials\u2019 minds \u2014 and so Millennials can hear our candidates\u2019 priorities. Young people have not heard enough about the party\u2019s positive vision for America. That changes now.\n\nThe 2014 midterms are less than a year away. Republicans will offer to young people an alternative to the status quo: more freedom to live their lives as they determine. We\u2019ll spend the next ten months sharing that message.\n\nReince Priebus is the chairman of the Republican National Committee.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Last month, a Harvard poll of Millennials had some pretty damning news for President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats.
