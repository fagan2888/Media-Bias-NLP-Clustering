Launched as a shell company, Atlas Mara raised $325 million in an IPO on the London Stock Exchange with a mission to build a pan-African bank.\n\nDiamond and Thakkar\u2019s vision for the bank, which has operations in five countries including Botswana and Zimbabwe, is to create \u201cthe premier financial services business in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nInitial investor response to Atlas Mara\u2019s plans was enthusiastic. Coco Ferguson, a partner at $50m East Africa-based investment group Maris Capital, said growth in sub-Saharan Africa had been stymied by local banks\u2019 limited interest in lending to small businesses: \u201cTypically, all loans need 100% asset or land backing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this new bank takes a different approach, it could unleash a whole new life for small businesses in Africa. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d\n\nWSJ Frontiers tracked down Atlas Mara\u2019s co-founders in Gaborone, Botswana, to find out more about their maiden deal.\n\nWSJ Frontiers: What most attracted you to ABC?\n\nDiamond: ABC is ahead of the curve in terms of both small business lending and consumer lending. We have a multi-country platform \u2026 and an outstanding management team with a track record of growth and innovation.\n\nWSJ Frontiers: How will your bank differ from others in the region?\n\nDiamond: The traditional banking model in sub-Saharan Africa has been to take deposits and invest them in domestic T-bills with interest rates in the 12-13-% range. That has not incentivized them to lend to businesses or consumers. We see this an opportunity to really be the bank for business.\n\nWSJ Frontiers: Who will be your main competitors?\n\nDiamond: There are some very strong global banks in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Standard Chartered, Barclays and Citi, as well as some very strong South African banks. Our whole secret is it\u2019s very concentrated and we are going to integrate the pieces and build a very strong financial services organization.\n\nThakkar: It is a pretty bold statement to say that we want to be the leading financial services organization on the continent, but when we say \u2018leading\u2019 we don\u2019t necessarily mean we want to be the biggest but the best, offering innovative services, tapping markets in a different way. We want to create something unique.\n\nWSJ Frontiers: What countries are you most excited about in Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nThakkar: Our strategy is more about looking at countries as part of regions rather than individually.\n\nWSJ Frontiers: Some markets put limits on foreign ownership. Will you still enter those markets?\n\nDiamond: We are looking for a controlling position. We feel welcomed by most governments and regulators but there are some jurisdictions that would not be high on our list because they are not prepared to have a major shareholder like Atlas Mara.\n\nWSJ Frontiers: Are you looking for other deals?\n\nThakkar: Absolutely, this is the beginning.\n\nDiamond: The beauty of having permanent equity, we are not subject to the timing of our investors. We would like to move as quickly as we can but if things take a little bit longer, that\u2019s okay with us.\n\nWrite to Neanda Salvaterra at neanda.salvaterra@wsj.com.\n\n\u2013Dan Keeler contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "WSJ Frontiers tracked down former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and Atlas Mara co-founder Ashish Thakkar in Gaborone, Botswana, to find out more about their $265 million African bank deal.", "title": "Q&A: Diamond and Thakkar Discuss Atlas Mara\u2019s $265m Bank Deal", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/04/02/qa-diamond-and-thakkar-discuss-atlas-maras-265m-bank-deal/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Q&A: Diamond and Thakkar Discuss Atlas Mara\u2019s $265m Bank Deal", "description": "WSJ Frontiers tracked down former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and Atlas Mara co-founder Ashish Thakkar in Gaborone, Botswana, to find out more about their $265 million African bank deal.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Neanda Salvaterra", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "WSJ Frontiers tracked down former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and Atlas Mara co-founder Ashish Thakkar in Gaborone, Botswana, to find out more about their $265 million African bank deal.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-04-02T17:05:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/04/02/qa-diamond-and-thakkar-discuss-atlas-maras-265m-bank-deal/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-374", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "WSJ Frontiers tracked down former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and Atlas Mara co-founder Ashish Thakkar in Gaborone, Botswana, to find out more about their $265 million African bank deal.", "title": "Q&A: Diamond and Thakkar Discuss Atlas Mara\u2019s $265m Bank Deal", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/04/02/qa-diamond-and-thakkar-discuss-atlas-maras-265m-bank-deal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-374", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-07T01:23:16-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2e5\"", "article_summary": "Diamond: The traditional banking model in sub-Saharan Africa has been to take deposits and invest them in domestic T-bills with interest rates in the 12-13-% range.\nI can\u2019t wait!\u201dWSJ Frontiers tracked down Atlas Mara\u2019s co-founders in Gaborone, Botswana, to find out more about their maiden deal.\nLaunched as a shell company, Atlas Mara raised $325 million in an IPO on the London Stock Exchange with a mission to build a pan-African bank.\n\u201cIf this new bank takes a different approach, it could unleash a whole new life for small businesses in Africa.\nDiamond: There are some very strong global banks in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Standard Chartered, Barclays and Citi, as well as some very strong South African banks."}
