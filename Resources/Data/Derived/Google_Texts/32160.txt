If you’ve tried to use that new credit card with the gold chip on it, you’ve probably been unsuccessful. Many retailers don’t appear ready. The ones I’ve visited say their chip-reading machines aren’t working yet — if they even have one at all.

Before the October 1 deadline goes into effect (that’s when Visa and other credit cards will stop taking responsibility for fraudulent non-chip-card purchases), the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce is hosting a session on Tuesday just for retailers and small businesses.

Experts from Visa and Colorado’s FirstBank will be there. It’s free to attend, but the chamber would like an RSVP:

Event: Chip Cards Coming: How Small Businesses Can Prepare for the Deadline

When: Tuesday, September 22, 2015 8:00 AM – 9:30 AM

Where: 1445 Market St. in Denver, CO 80202

More details: See Denver Chamber’s website

Are you a small business already using a chip-card reader or are you one who is wondering ‘What?’ Tell me about it.
