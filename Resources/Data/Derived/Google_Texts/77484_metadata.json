Jimmy Fallon\u2019s first guest of the evening was the extremely humorous comedian, Zach Galifianakis, who is starring in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). Zach and Jimmy Fallon were in a LOL skit called Excuses. His second guest was the beautiful and talented actress, Casey Wilson, from Marry Me. Comedian Andrew Orvedahl was his third guest.\n\nJimmy Fallon, the Tonight Show host, began the night with his monologue. He warmly welcomed his audience, who gave him a standing ovation, then he joked about people, events, and other items in the news. Some of his jokes included these:\n\n\u201cPresident Obama played his 200th round of golf yesterday. Democrats said \u2018You know what \u2014 he can do whatever he wants as long as he doesn\u2019t campaign for us.'\u201d\n\nFallon joked about ObamaCare and also said that \u201cA new poll has found that 58 percent of millennials would vote for Hillary Clinton for president, unless Urkel decided to run. My vice president \u2014 a Power Ranger.\u201d\n\nThen, Fallon said \u201cLast weekend, Mike Huckabee threatened to quit the GOP if the Republicans gave up the fight for gay marriage. I meant, he said he would play for the other team. Er, switch sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers are the most generous of tippers,\u201d Jimmy Fallon went on. \u201cLast week, I met an actress who dreamed of being a waitress.\u201d\n\n\u201cRunners in Kenya came in first, second and third in the Chicago marathon. It was the same guy lapping everybody,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Jimmy Fallon quipped, \u201ca new study says that kids who are born heavier are better in school. Or, as bullies call it,\u2019The Perfect Storm.'\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow night, Emma Stone and I will play Box of Lies. Sting, Miley Cyrus and Brad Pitt will be here later this week. But tonight, Zach Galifianakis is here! He does a great job as a dramatic actor in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). From Marry Me, actress Casey Wilson is here, and comedian Andrew Orvedahl,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nThen, Fallon did his Good News & Good News comedy bit. \u201cThere\u2019s a 100 percent chance of puppy love today,\u201d was one of the things news commentators said. They were all actual news broadcasters saying only good news items.\n\nWhen the Tonight Show returned from a break, Jimmy Fallon talked about everybody \u201cbeing so busy lately.\u201d He showed as an example, the Excuses skit with Zach. Zach told him \u201cI have to take my goldfish to a doctor. A shrink.\u201d They both kept making up crazy excuses as to why they could not get together and do something together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be right back with Zach Galifianakis, everybody!\u201d Jimmy Fallon said, and the Tonight Show went to another commercial break.\n\nWhen the show came back on, Jimmy Fallon welcomed his first guest, Zach Galifianakis, who stars opposite Michael Keaton in Birdman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you. I want to say congratulations \u2014 you had a baby since the last time I saw you. What has it been, a year? Is it a boy or a girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. We haven\u2019t named it. It has a number \u2014 one.\u201d Zach said.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your kid\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis name is Sheila. His nickname is One. Kids crave discipline \u2014 prenatal spanking is important. Two birds with one stone,\u201d Zach said.\n\n\u201cI have to say congratulations on Birdman. I saw you on the Red Carpet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live for the Red Carpet,\u201d Zach said. \u201cSomeone there asked me if I had lost weight. I said \u2018Yes \u2014 I\u2019m dying.'\u201d\n\nThey talked about the movie, Birdman, and how some of the shots were long, like maybe 15 minutes long. Fallon said \u201cThat\u2019s why I no longer want to act. If you screw up, that\u2019s 15 minutes gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis movie was shot in 30 days. Most movies are shot in four months. That\u2019s why this movie is my favorite ever,\u201d Zach said.\n\nZach then explained to Fallon the sort of character that Keaton plays, and how we get \u201cto see this weird breakdown that is playing inside of his head.\u201d\n\nEdward Norton is another actor in Birdman. Zach complimented his acting, also. Then, Jimmy Fallon showed a clip from Birdman. It looked pretty cool \u2014 Zach was quite dramatic in the video.\n\n\u201cCasey Wilson joins us next!\u201d Jimmy Fallon said, and the Tonight Show went to another commercial break.\n\nFallon introduced Casey after the break and showed a clip from Marry Me before Casey came out. She had insulted the guy\u2019s mother, who was about to propose to her, calling her the \u201cb\u201d word. His mother and other family members were hiding and heard every word that she said.\n\nCasey and Fallon talked about the fact that she had actually gotten married not too long ago. \u201cThe wedding went smoothly?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmooth-ish. I fell very hard on the dance room floor. I was kinda drunk. The next day, my husband had to wheel me around in a wheelchair. You are a hundred, immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was another famous couple getting married the same weekend,\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cYes, Kimye, however you want to say it,\u201d she said. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West had gotten married the same weekend that she and her husband had.\n\nShe had made up key chains and other interesting items and told Fallon about a self-portrait her father had made, that clues at Christmas led her to \u201cat the end of a rainbow.\u201d She had brought the painting with her, or a copy of it. She told Fallon her dad said that he \u201c\u2018used a coupon for $1,00 off.'\u201d It looked nice, but not $1,000 nice.\n\nFallon then introduced his third guest of the Tonight Show, comedian Andrew Orvedahl. \u201cI have been travelling so much I missed my daughter\u2019s pre-school graduation. It\u2019s not a real thing. Nobody\u2019s held back. When they graduate, they are still super-dumb,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cI got divorced last year. There\u2019s a weird phenomena where sometimes I forget and think \u2018I lost my wedding ring somewhere.\u2019 I did, in a conversation somewhere.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Andrew said \u201cI have bought some ice cube trays. The cashier asked me if I wanted to know a secret for how to get my kids to drink more water. She said \u2018Make Kool-Aid ice cubes and put it in their water.\u2019 That\u2019s like saying \u2018You have a hard time getting your kids to eat vegetables? Sprinkle some M&Ms over them.'\u201d\n\nHe said he bought a flask recently. He joked about how cool it was and how his friends asked for it to be passed around. But, if he had brought a fifth of Jack Daniels with him, people would probably say\u2019What\u2019s wrong with you? Get it together, you hobo!'\u201d\n\nWatching The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on a Monday night always helps ease the transition back to the work week and make it a bit easier.
