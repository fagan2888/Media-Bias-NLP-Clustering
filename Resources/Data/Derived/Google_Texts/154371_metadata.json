The lack of access to NHS treatment in many parts of England has led to a 'crisis' in care and a system that is 'unfit for purpose', they said (stock photograph)\n\nThe 400 dentists wrote to the Daily Telegraph to complain that they are stretched increasingly thinly and are struggling to meet ambitious targets to increase the numbers of patients treated.\n\nThey complained that it was hard to work amid tight constraints on budgets, and warned that millions of adults are ignorant of even the most basic dental hygiene.\n\n'Far from improving, the situation has worsened to such an extent that charity groups normally associated with providing dental care in Third World arenas now have to do so in England', they wrote.\n\n'While we applaud groups such as Dentaid, which volunteer such services, their role serves to demonstrate the lack of a proper national dental strategy and service.\n\n'When more than 90 per cent of all dental diseases can be prevented, it is also a disgrace that children aged under 10 in England are still more likely to be treated in hospital for rotten teeth than for any other medical reason.'\n\nNHS figures show that almost half the adult population of England (48 per cent) and a third (31 per cent) of children have not seen a dentist within two years.\n\nMohammed Khaliff, 16 (left), from Syria, suffers from dire dental problems common in Third World countries.
