But the process isn't over once QAPI has been implemented, Kramer said.\n\n\u201cIt's not something that you can sort of do for a window and then you're set, that would be a little bit like taking blood pressures once and saying \u2018Ok, we got it, we got all the blood pressures done and now we don't have to do it,'\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to continue to do those kinds of things.\u201d\n\nMany providers have been waiting for official QAPI guidelines from CMS. But since the process can help nursing centers reduce adverse events, decrease deficiencies and boost occupancy rate, experts said there aren't downsides to adopting QAPI now, even though the LTC regulation proposal may still be in the draft phase.\n\n\u201cThe worst that's going to happen is that you're going to have improved quality,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cNo use in waiting for something to get spelled out in some perfect regulatory language.\u201d\n\nDiscussions around QAPI integration should involve all department heads. But training the entire staff should be an incremental process, spread over the first three to six months of integration, to take into account varying levels of skill and comfort among employees, said Michael Lin, MPH, Ph.D, chief scientific officer at Providigm.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles for nursing centers using a technology intensive QAPI approach is computer proficiency,\u201d Lin said. \u201cJust as some people recognize there are nursing center employees who are not adept at typing, there are other employees who may not have much comfort looking at a computer screen to monitor and structure staff completion.\u201d\n\nFor multi-facility organizations of all sizes, Lin recommends synchronizing QAPI integration throughout the company.\n\nTo view an archived version of the webcast, sponsored by Medline, click here.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "description": "There's no better time for providers to tackle Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement, one of the hottest topics in long-term care, experts said during a McKnight's webcast on Wednesday.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "There's no better time for providers to tackle Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement, one of the hottest topics in long-term care, experts said during a McKnight's webcast on Wednesday.", "title": "Capitalize on QAPI now, experts say", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/capitalize-on-qapi-now-experts-say/article/436546/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/08/14/andrewkramer240x240_816889_816890.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's no better time for providers to tackle Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement, one of the hottest topics in long-term care, experts said during a McKnight's webcast on Wednesday.", "creator": "@Emmongan", "image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/08/14/andrewkramer240x240_816889_816890.jpg"}, "title": "Capitalize on QAPI now, experts say", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-09-02T23:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T17:26:37"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4b9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo use in waiting for something to get spelled out in some perfect regulatory language.\u201dDiscussions around QAPI integration should involve all department heads.\n\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles for nursing centers using a technology intensive QAPI approach is computer proficiency,\u201d Lin said.\nCapitalize on QAPI now, experts sayShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintKramer said providers shouldn't wait to integrate QAPIThere's no better time for providers to tackle Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement, one of the hottest topics in long-term care, experts said during a McKnight's webcast on Wednesday.\nIntegrating QAPI requires a four-step process, where facilities collect data, analyze and investigate the data, identify issues, make improvements and monitor performance.\n\u201cYou have to continue to do those kinds of things.\u201dMany providers have been waiting for official QAPI guidelines from CMS."}
