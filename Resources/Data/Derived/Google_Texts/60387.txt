Health insurance companies selling individual policies in Washington want to increase rates by an average of 13.5 percent next year.

The state’s considering whether to allow the surge. Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler’s disappointed the companies are seeking such a large increase, but understands their predicament.

“That hurts people. And I want to do everything I possibly can to make sure that we don’t see this in the future. But that said, it’s still part of the shakedown period, where insurers didn’t know what they should be charging.”

Kreidler thinks the insurers now have a better handle on their costs after a couple of years under the Affordable Care Act.

He claims if rates do increase, people in Washington who can’t afford them will benefit from a boost in government subsidies.

It’ll be Kreidler’s decision to grant or deny rate increase requests by insurers. He notes any determination he makes can be challenged in court.

“I’ve never had that happen in the past. I don’t want to start a trend. So I’ve got to be careful that where I push back on them, they’re going to recognize that that is the appropriate answer to the question, and it means not getting as much of a rate increase as they had proposed.”

Kreidler says despite the requested rate hikes, the Washington health care exchange is in good shape. He notes a large percentage of participants don’t even qualify for subsidies, meaning they’re choosing to work through the exchange.

Kreidler’s post as Washington Insurance Commissioner is a partisan position. He was elected as a Democrat.

The Affordable Care Act is a product of Democratic President Barak Obama’s administration. It became law with no Republican backing in Congress.
