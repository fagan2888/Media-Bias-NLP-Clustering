They also rank last in the nation in six categories: Scoring offense (9.6 points per game), scoring defense (46.8), total defense (547.0 yards per game), pass efficiency defense (172.46 rating), sacks allowed (5.13 per game) and turnover margin (minus-1.88 per game).\n\nTheir scoring average was almost five points worse than the 14.3 of next-to-last Eastern Michigan, though the Mustangs entered the night fresh off their best offensive performance of the season in a 38-28 loss to Tulsa.\n\nIn addition, SMU ranked 124th among the 125 FBS teams in takeaways (eight) and 123rd in total offense (276.3 yards per game).\n\nThe Mustangs do rank among the nation\u2019s top 95 in one category \u2014 net punting. Their average of 35.5 net yards per punt is 95th.\n\nWatson stays home\n\nUSF starting DT Elkino Watson was suspended indefinitely because of what the university called a violation of team rules. The 6-2, 291-pound senior did not make the trip.\n\nThe loss was a big blow to an already-shaky defense that entered Saturday allowing 423.4 yards per game. Watson leads USF\u2019s defensive linemen with 31 tackles and 61\u20442 tackles for loss.\n\nHe was replaced in the lineup by 6-2, 285-pound sophomore Derrick Calloway.\n\nNew QBs\n\nUSF wasn\u2019t the only team at Gerald J. Ford Stadium starting an inexperienced quarterback. SMU sophomore Matt Davis was making his second career start after a strong performance last week at Tulsa.\n\nDavis rang up 393 yards of total offense last week at Tulsa, including 181 yards and two touchdowns rushing.\n\nFreshman Quinton Flowers made his first start for USF on Saturday, becoming the Bulls\u2019 third starting quarterback in as many games and their fifth in Willie Taggart\u2019s 22 games as head coach.\n\nMore new blood\n\nFive players made their first career starts for USF. On offense, Flowers was joined as a new starter by senior WR Clinton Jones, while Calloway and freshman CBs Deatrick Nichols and Tajee Fullwood were in the defensive lineup for the first time.\n\nEjected \u2013 not\n\nWith 7:35 left in the second quarter, SMU safety A.J. Justice was called for targeting a defenseless player with a block on USF\u2019s Reshard Cliett during a punt return. The call came with a 15-yard penalty and an automatic ejection.\n\nBut after a replay showed Justice\u2019s block was made with a shoulder pad, rather than leading with the helmet, the call was overturned and Justice was allowed to remain in the game.\n\nFrigid\n\nThe game-time temperature at Ford Stadium was a chilly 43 degrees \u2014 the coldest for a USF game this season \u2013 with fog and a heavy mist.\n\nInspiration\n\nRafael Williams, who scored the first touchdown in USF history in 1997, was on the Bulls\u2019 sideline. Williams, who lives in the Dallas area, addressed the team Friday night.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 23:23:38 -0400", "Description": "DALLAS \u2014 South Florida has had its problems on both sides of the ball this season, but the Bulls entered Saturday night\u2019s game against SMU looking like a powerhouse compared to their oppo", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "DALLAS \u2014 South Florida has had its problems on both sides of the ball this season, but the Bulls entered Saturday night\u2019s game against SMU looking like a powerhouse compared to their oppo", "title": "USF notes: SMU among worst across the board", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/colleges/usf-bulls/smu-among-worst-across-the-board-20141115/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141115/ARTICLE/141119375/EP/1/1/EP-141119375.jpg", "height": 2659}, "updated_time": "2014-11-16T01:42:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "DALLAS \u2014 South Florida has had its problems on both sides of the ball this season, but the Bulls entered Saturday night\u2019s game against SMU looking like a powerhouse compared to their op", "title": "USF notes: SMU among worst across the board", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141115/ARTICLE/141119375/AR/0/AR-141119375.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-11-15T23:23:38Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T01:42:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "FrigidThe game-time temperature at Ford Stadium was a chilly 43 degrees \u2014 the coldest for a USF game this season \u2013 with fog and a heavy mist.\nIn addition, SMU ranked 124th among the 125 FBS teams in takeaways (eight) and 123rd in total offense (276.3 yards per game).\nDavis rang up 393 yards of total offense last week at Tulsa, including 181 yards and two touchdowns rushing.\nThe Mustangs entered their matchup with USF on a 10-game losing streak, the longest current streak in FBS.\nThe only winless team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, SMU came by that distinction honestly."}
