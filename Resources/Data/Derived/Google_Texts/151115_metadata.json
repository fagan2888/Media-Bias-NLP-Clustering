Compared to a control group that spent the same period in a naturally lit environment, these mice developed more complex nerve circuitry in the primary auditory cortex, the brain area that processes sounds. \"There is some level of interconnectedness of the senses in the brain that we are revealing here,\" Patrick Kanold, the paper's second lead author, explained.\n\nLee, Kanold, and colleagues theorize that the observed rewiring of mice\u2019s brains arises from a temporary increase in the brain\u2019s \u201cmalleability.\u201d This state, they say, is akin to a \u201ccritical period\u201d that occurs in our early youth, when our brains continuously adapts to the surrounding soundscape. As a result, entirely new nerve connections are formed.\n\nTemporary Blindness To Work Out Your Ears\n\nAlthough you are welcome to try the experiment on your own, it may take some more research before we can effectively improve our hearing by spending time in the dark. In an email to Medical Daily, Kanold said that the next step is to see how the mice\u2019s improvements can be mapped onto the human brain. After all, we\u2019re dealing with two rather different minds.\n\n\u201cNow we know that in mice it is possible to change the way sound is processed in the adult brain. That gives us hope that eventually there might be the potential for simple treatments for human central hearing problems,\u201d he said. \"We don't know how much time people would have to spend in the dark to permanently improve their hearing. But our study shows that it potentially may be possible to develop some crossmodal training exercises that will benefit hearing.\u201d\n\nSource: Petrus E, Isaiah A, Lee H, et al.
