Lovecraft, and it has featured words and imagery derived from Robert W. Chambers\u2018 story anthology \u201cThe King in Yellow.\u201d As a result, the show has opened up the worlds of weird fiction and cosmic horror to broader audiences.\n\nExecutive producer and writer Nic Pizzolatto, responding through email, commented to Speakeasy about some of the more ominous literary and philosophical influences on \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d as well as some of his favorite horror writers. Read the Q&A.\n\nSpeakeasy: If you could recommend any single work of weird fiction and/or horror to people, what would it be?\n\nPizzolatto: That\u2019s tough \u2014 on the one hand I want to name one of the blue-chip classics, and on the other I\u2019d like to give an endorsement to people who may not usually get enough attention. I mean, I\u2019d suggest Lovecraft or Poe, but everybody knows them already. More recently, I\u2019d point people in the direction of Thomas Ligotti, Laird Barron, John Langan, Simon Strantzas and others. For fans of the show who\u2019d like to see what contemporary voices have done with Chambers\u2019 \u201cKing in Yellow,\u201d I\u2019d point them toward Karl Edward Wagner\u2019s short story \u201cThe River of Night\u2019s Dreaming\u201d or the recent anthology \u201cA Season in Carcosa.\u201d\n\nWhen did you first hear of and read Ligotti?\n\nI first heard of Ligotti maybe six years ago, when Laird Barron\u2019s first collection alerted me to this whole world of new weird fiction that I hadn\u2019t known existed. I started looking around for the best contemporary stuff to read, and in any discussion of that kind, the name \u201cLigotti\u201d comes up first. I couldn\u2019t find any of his books in print, and their used prices were prohibitive for me at the time. But I located a couple at libraries, and his nightmare lyricism was enthralling and visionary.\n\nWhat work of his do you find the most influential? Are you more attracted to his fiction or his nonfictional writing? Have you read his nonfiction book, \u201cThe Conspiracy Against the Human Race\u201d?\n\nI read \u201cThe Conspiracy Against the Human Race\u201d and found it incredibly powerful writing. For me as a reader, it was less impactful as philosophy than as one writer\u2019s ultimate confessional: an absolute horror story, where the self is the monster. In episode one [of \"True Detective\"] there are two lines in particular (and it would have been nothing to re-word them) that were specifically phrased in such a way as to signal Ligotti admirers. Which, of course, you got.\n\nThe philosophy Cohle promotes in the show\u2019s earliest episodes is a kind of anti-natalist nihilism, and in that regard all cats should be unbagged: \u201cConfessions of an Antinatalist,\u201d \u201cNihil Unbound,\u201d \u201cIn the Dust of this Planet,\u201d \u201cBetter to Have Never Been,\u201d and lots of Cioran were all on the reading list. This is before I came out to Hollywood, but I knew that in my next work I would have a detective who was (or thought he was) a nihilist. I\u2019d already been reading E.M. Cioran for years and consider him one of my all-time favorite and, oddly, most nourishing writers. As an aphorist, Cioran has no rivals other than perhaps Nietzsche, and many of his philosophies are echoed by Ligotti. But Ligotti is far more disturbing than Cioran, who is actually very funny. In exploring these philosophies, nobody I\u2019ve read has expressed the idea of humanity as aberration more powerfully than Cioran and Ligotti.\n\nHow do you feel about the philosophy in general?\n\nTo answer your question about my personal views, I\u2019m about as far from a nihilist as you can get, though at times my personal philosophy would be deemed pessimistic. I would label it realist, though. Maybe beleaguered romantic. However, to openly confront the ideas of artists like Cioran and Ligotti, without defense, is to be riveted and increased by the power of their vision of the unspeakable, of annihilation at the most intimate level.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re talking about hard-boiled detectives, too, what could be more hardboiled than the worldview of Ligotti or Cioran? They make the grittiest of crime writers seem like dilettantes. Next to \u201cThe Conspiracy Against the Human Race,\u201d Mickey Spillane seems about as hard-boiled as bubble gum.\n\nI\u2019ve put off going into the philosophy Cohle espouses in the early episodes because I don\u2019t want people making assumptions about the character of Cohle, or the ultimate aim of this season. The totality of Cohle\u2019s character and the show\u2019s agenda won\u2019t be clear until the eighth episode has ended. It\u2019s also important to me that the mass audience doesn\u2019t need to know or engage these associations in order to enjoy the show. Likewise, I wouldn\u2019t want any viewers to assume we had some nihilistic agenda, or reduce Cohle to an anti-natalist or nihilist. Cohle is more complicated than that. As I\u2019ve said recently, Cohle may claim to be a nihilist, but an observation of him reveals otherwise. Far from \u201cnothing meaning anything\u201d to him, it\u2019s almost as though everything means too much to him. He\u2019s too passionate, too acutely sensitive, and he cares too much to be labeled a successful nihilist. And in his monologues, don\u2019t we detect a whiff of desperation akin to someone who protests too much? When Cohle speaks of the unspeakable, is it with the same illusory perspective as when Hart speaks about the importance of having rules and boundaries? Perhaps that is what Hart references when he tells Cohle in episode 3, \u201cYou sound panicked.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t lessen the potential validity of the ideas he expresses, and that is what I finally think is disturbing about the show so far. It\u2019s not the serial killer that\u2019s unsettling; television shows you far worse than that all the time. What unsettles are the aspects of being human which the show chooses to highlight. That this stuff is being delivered through actors as instantly amiable and comforting as Harrelson and McConaughey makes it doubly subversive. And then I think you\u2019ll find, as we go forward, the show keeps subverting its own subversions.\n\nNic Pizzolatto is also the author of the story collection \u201cBetween Here and the Yellow Sea\u201d and the novel \u201cGalveston,\u201d which was published in 2010 and is slated to be adapted into a film.\n\nBe sure to read Marshall Crook\u2019s recap of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d episode three here.\n\nFollow @michael_calia on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "\"True Detective\" executive producer and writer Nic Pizzolatto comments to Speakeasy about some of the more ominous literary and philosophical influences on the show and shares some of his favorite horror writers.", "title": "Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of \u2018True Detective\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/02/writer-nic-pizzolatto-on-thomas-ligotti-and-the-weird-secrets-of-true-detective/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BI289_truede_P_20140202075924.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of \u2018True Detective\u2019", "description": "\"True Detective\" executive producer and writer Nic Pizzolatto comments to Speakeasy about some of the more ominous literary and philosophical influences on the show and shares some of his favorite horror writers.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Michael Calia", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "\"True Detective\" executive producer and writer Nic Pizzolatto comments to Speakeasy about some of the more ominous literary and philosophical influences on the show and shares some of his favorite horror writers.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-02-02T13:00:51-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/02/writer-nic-pizzolatto-on-thomas-ligotti-and-the-weird-secrets-of-true-detective/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-79577", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "\"True Detective\" executive producer and writer Nic Pizzolatto comments to Speakeasy about some of the more ominous literary and philosophical influences on the show and shares some of his favorite horror writers.", "title": "Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of \u2018True Detective\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/02/writer-nic-pizzolatto-on-thomas-ligotti-and-the-weird-secrets-of-true-detective/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BI289_truede_P_20140202075924.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-79577", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-07T14:36:32-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddad6\"", "article_summary": "Executive producer and writer Nic Pizzolatto, responding through email, commented to Speakeasy about some of the more ominous literary and philosophical influences on \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d as well as some of his favorite horror writers.\nBe sure to read Marshall Crook\u2019s recap of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d episode three here.\nMore recently, I\u2019d point people in the direction of Thomas Ligotti, Laird Barron, John Langan, Simon Strantzas and others.\nAnd if we\u2019re talking about hard-boiled detectives, too, what could be more hardboiled than the worldview of Ligotti or Cioran?\nIn episode one [of \"True Detective\"] there are two lines in particular (and it would have been nothing to re-word them) that were specifically phrased in such a way as to signal Ligotti admirers."}
