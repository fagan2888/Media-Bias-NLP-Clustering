One Egyptian billionaire has offered a temporary solution: buy a deserted Mediterranean island for them.\n\nEgyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris has offered his own solution to help solve the growing migrant crisis. Sawiris wants to buy a Mediterranean Island to allow refugees a temporary shelter until a long-term solution can be found. Sawiris is considering approaching the governments of Greece and Italy to possibly buy an island to help migrants fleeing from conflict zones, like Syria.\n\nThe billionaire tweeted that he could \u201chost the migrants and provide jobs for them building their new country.\u201d It might be a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d he admitted, but said it could work \u201cuntil they can return to their countries??!!\u201d\n\nIn an interview with AFP, Sawiris said the plan is certainly feasible.\n\n\u201cYou have dozens of islands which are deserted and could accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees \u2026 [as] temporary shelters to house the people, then you start employing the people to build housing, schools, universities, hospitals,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if things improve, whoever wants to go back [to their country] goes back.\u201d\n\nSawiris\u2019 concern is that the migrants are treated with dignity as \u201chuman beings,\u201d not \u201clike cattle\u201d as they are now, he explained.\n\nRegardless of how feasible the billionaire\u2019s plan really is, it\u2019s clear that he wants to use his wealth to help people, which in and of itself is commendable, especially considering the Arab world\u2019s wealthiest nations are doing nothing to help Syria\u2019s refugees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Very generous. .05/26/2016 19:22:54PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Very generous.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Egyptian Billionaire Offers to Buy Mediterranean Island for Syrian Refugees", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/04/migrant-crisis-egyptian-billionaire-offers-to-buy-island-for-refugees-n2048165", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/74/2015-03-15T141934Z_1_LYNXMPEB2E0BN_RTROPTP_3_EGYPT-ECONOMY-INVESTMENT.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Very generous.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Egyptian Billionaire Offers to Buy Mediterranean Island for Syrian Refugees", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/04/migrant-crisis-egyptian-billionaire-offers-to-buy-island-for-refugees-n2048165", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/74/2015-03-15T141934Z_1_LYNXMPEB2E0BN_RTROPTP_3_EGYPT-ECONOMY-INVESTMENT.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Egyptian Billionaire Offers to Buy Mediterranean Island for Syrian Refugees , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One Egyptian billionaire has offered a temporary solution: buy a deserted Mediterranean island for them.\nSawiris wants to buy a Mediterranean Island to allow refugees a temporary shelter until a long-term solution can be found.\nSawiris is considering approaching the governments of Greece and Italy to possibly buy an island to help migrants fleeing from conflict zones, like Syria.\nEgyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris has offered his own solution to help solve the growing migrant crisis.\nWhat to do about Syria refugee crisis, which has overwhelmed the country\u2019s poorer neighbors like Jordan and Lebanon and caused a crisis in European countries?"}
