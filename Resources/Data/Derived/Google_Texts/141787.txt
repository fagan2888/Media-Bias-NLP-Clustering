LONDON (AP) — This little prince already knows how to mug for the camera.

With a sly grin and robust rosy cheeks, Prince George looks cheerful and self-assured — for a toddler — in pictures released Sunday.

His sleeveless sweater features Coldstream Guardsmen in bearskin hats and red tunics. The outfit was completed by black knee socks and shoes.

His fashion choice prompted the Sunday Times to call him, "Mummy's Little Soldier Prince." The Sunday Express chimed in with "Little Prince Charming."

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released the images of the third in line to the throne ahead of Christmas. The release is being seen as a 'thank you' note of sorts to Britain's vivacious media, which have so far allowed George to grow up largely free from intrusions.
