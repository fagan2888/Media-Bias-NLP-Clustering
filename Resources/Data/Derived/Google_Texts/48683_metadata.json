On TV, canned laughter erupted when Roseanne pulled out a chair and quipped, in her signature sweet snarl, \u201cHere, it\u2019s easier to squirm sitting down.\u201d In reality, my mother handed me \u201cGrowing Up: Adolescence, Body Changes, and Sex,\u201d and my boyfriend\u2019s pink-faced father tossed a paper bag containing the Kama Sutra onto his bed.\n\nOf course, that was the view from within a bubble of privilege. Not the kind borne of passport stamps and country club memberships, but of thinking that racial violence and religious intolerance are primarily subjects on an AP U.S. History exam. The sort of privilege that meant having only one limitation on my natural teenage brashness: the parameters of \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cuncool.\u201d\n\nFor my African-American peers, particularly male ones, \u201cthe talk\u201d referred to something far too serious for sitcoms. As Michaela Angela Davis explains, \u201cBlack mothers and fathers all over the country for generations have [had] \u2026 \u2018the talk\u2019 with their sons about what to do, and perhaps more critically, what not to do when encountering police.\u201d\n\nInteractions with law enforcement spur just one version of this warning. A teacher at my son\u2019s San Francisco preschool says her grown son learned early on to be aware of \u201cthe consequences of his clothing choices, hair style, behavior, tone of voice, size, and location in different neighborhoods coupled with his complexion.\u201d One day she pulled him aside as he headed out to the movies with a white female friend. She begged him to stay alert and careful. Like teenagers the world over, he scoffed.\n\nShe never knew how hard to push, torn between teaching her son to believe in his equality, and keeping him safe. She wanted him to feel proud of his heritage, but knew standing too tall could easily make him a target.\n\nA family friend of hers could write a book about it. Actually, he did. Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 New York Times bestseller and National Book Award winner \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d\u2014written as a letter to the author\u2019s teenage son\u2014is, in some sense, both an exquisitely reasoned, literary version of \u201cthe talk\u201d and a forceful rejection of the practice.\n\nBefore the attacks in Paris, I read a Facebook post by an acquaintance urging others to carry concealed weapons, because danger lurks everywhere these days, even in \u201ca safe neighborhood, white.\u201d A friend of hers chimed in: \u201cLook around, Whites are targets now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a god given right to defend your life,\u201d affirmed another. \u201cShoot to kill,\u201d a fourth person added, and then, \u201cwhite lives matter.\u201d\n\nThese statements appear almost civilized in comparison to more recent xenophobic rants. \u201cALL ragheads need to go, shot, or smeared with pig urine,\u201d posted one man. Another, hailing from Newport, Maine, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m going hunting fucking ragheads are no[t] welcome in my town.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first. Many speculate that is precisely what happened to three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill in February. In October, \u201cPatriots\u201d organized armed anti-Muslim rallies in more than 20 U.S. cities. And since Paris, an attacker threatened to kill an Uber driver in North Carolina, bullets were fired into the garage of a Muslim family in Florida, and a store owner in New York was beaten by a man who declared, \u201cI kill Muslims.\u201d Donald Trump stands by his proposal to bar all Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nAmericans are insulting, denigrating and assaulting other Americans simply for following the religious tradition of their families, and a major presidential candidate adds fuel to the fire. In response, another set of parents has increasingly been giving their own version of \u201cthe talk.\u201d\n\nA 14-year-old who attends a tony high school in the Bronx\u2014I\u2019ll use her first initial, B\u2014tells of her mother\u2019s recent about-face. For years the two have argued, B\u2019s mother urging her first-generation American daughter to be more observant, to fast during Ramadan, do Arabic work at home, and attend mosque. She hated seeing B slowly becoming less and less like her Moroccan family, and more like her classmates. \u201cYou should be proud to be a Muslim,\u201d she said.\n\nBut after Paris, in the car on the way to a meeting with other Islamic families\u2014a social event and evening of prayer and reflection much like those organized by my own Quaker Meeting\u2014B\u2019s mother said, \u201cYou need to watch who you tell about your religion. Don\u2019t say where we go and what we do, or they\u2019ll think we\u2019re part of ISIS.\u201d\n\nF, another Muslim American teenager and also a New Yorker, says her father told her \u201cto remain quiet, to stay low.\u201d \u201cHe said I can never say the word \u2018ISIS.\u2019 I can never argue about Islam with a non-Muslim, ever. He knows I\u2019m an open person and that I will speak up if I see or hear something that\u2019s not right. But he said I have to keep my disagreements to myself and allow other people to be ignorant no matter how much it hurts me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow ridiculous,\u201d F initially thought, but the fear in her father\u2019s eyes gave her pause. B was surprised too, but says, \u201cI guess I understand where my mom is coming from. People on my Facebook feed have been saying all sorts of stuff, like \u2018we need to get all the Muslims out of the U.S.,\u2019 and there was this meme with a picture of a Middle Eastern-looking man that just said, \u2018go to hell.\u2019\u201d These are words and images circulated by her teenage acquaintances, friends of friends and classmates.\n\nShortly after F and B received the talk, news broke of a Muslim girl at a nearby school being attacked by three boys who held her in a headlock, punching her while calling her \u201cISIS\u201d and removing her hijab.\n\nOf course white lives matter. That proposition has never been in question. It\u2019s black lives that we have devalued and dehumanized for so long that their worth to us, on college campuses and the streets, must be proven. American Christians\u2019 ability to believe in \u201cGod-given\u201d rights is not under assault. It\u2019s our national commitment to religious freedom that we have to recall and renew.\n\nUntil we do, some of our kids will live and speak without fear, free to be themselves as they pursue happiness. While others will receive \u201cthe talk.\u201d\n\nGail Cornwall is a former public school teacher and recovering lawyer who now works as a stay-at-home mom of three and writes about parenthood.
