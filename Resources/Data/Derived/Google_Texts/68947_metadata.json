The FDA is changing its regulations and will start requiring restaurants to list calorie content on menus. (Logan Newell/Special to the Daily News)</p>\n\nBy John Osborne\n\nSouthwest Florida restaurant franchisees are taking in stride a new U.S. Food and Drug requirement that food-selling outlets with more than 20 locations start listing calorie counts on their menus and menu boards.\n\nFood vendors have one year to comply with the FDA ruling, which also covers sales of food and beverages in such locations as convenience stores, bakeries and amusement parks.\n\nVending machine operators covered under the rule will have two years to comply with the FDA requirements, which stem from the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nTo help consumers understand the significance of the calorie information in the context of a total daily diet, menus and menu boards will also include the statement:\n\n\u201c2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary.\u201d\n\nMike Silverman, who owns seven Moe\u2019s Southwest Grill locations in Lee and Collier counties, with another coming to Naples this spring, said he didn\u2019t believe listing calorie counts would have a significant impact on his business.\n\n\u201cRight now, people can go online to see calorie counts and customize their orders, and our menu boards are magnetic, so it\u2019s no inconvenience at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be any problem for us.\u201d\n\nSilverman also isn\u2019t worried that customers will decide to go elsewhere once they see the calorie counts on his menus and menu boards.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of Moe\u2019s is that you can make your order as healthy as you want it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have free-range chicken and grass-fed beef and all the fresh produce you want, or you can be crazy and get the nachos with everything. It\u2019s entirely up to the customer.\u201d\n\nFrank Edwards, general manager of Culver\u2019s in Estero, said his establishment would need to purchase new menu boards through the restaurant chain\u2019s corporate office in Wisconsin. With new menu boards also required for the drive-thru, Edwards estimated that the cost would be \u201cin the hundreds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cost associated, and it\u2019s not cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, while Edwards said that listing calorie counts on the menu boards should make it simpler for customers concerned with watching their caloric intake, he doesn\u2019t think it will influence most people when it comes time to order.\n\n\u201cWhen people come to Culver\u2019s they\u2019re looking to indulge in something special,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it will be a deciding factor as to whether or not they order something.\u201d\n\nFDA officials say Americans eat and drink about one-third of their calories away from home, and that the new ruling would also require covered establishments to list calorie counts on certain alcoholic beverages.\n\n\u201cPeople today expect clear information about the products they consume,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg. \u201cMaking calorie information available on chain restaurant menus and vending machines is an important step for public health that will help consumers make informed choices for themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nThe new FDA rules also require covered establishments to provide written nutrition information about total calories, total fat, calories from fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein.\n\nSeasonal menu items offered for sale as temporary menu items, daily specials and condiments for general use are exempt from labeling requirements.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Most local eateries not fretting new calorie display mandates", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/business/most-local-eateries-not-fretting-new-calorie-display-mandates-ep-841652887-330706251.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/calories-2_11710215_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "The FDA announced last month that it would start requiring restaurants to start listing calorie counts on their menus and menu boards.", "title": "Most local eateries not fretting new calorie display mandates"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/calories-2_11710215_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Most local eateries not fretting new calorie display mandates", "description": "The FDA announced last month that it would start requiring restaurants to start listing calorie counts on their menus and menu boards.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ndn"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRight now, people can go online to see calorie counts and customize their orders, and our menu boards are magnetic, so it\u2019s no inconvenience at all,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be any problem for us.\u201dSilverman also isn\u2019t worried that customers will decide to go elsewhere once they see the calorie counts on his menus and menu boards.\nWith new menu boards also required for the drive-thru, Edwards estimated that the cost would be \u201cin the hundreds.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a cost associated, and it\u2019s not cheap,\u201d he said.\nThe FDA is changing its regulations and will start requiring restaurants to list calorie content on menus.\nIt\u2019s entirely up to the customer.\u201dFrank Edwards, general manager of Culver\u2019s in Estero, said his establishment would need to purchase new menu boards through the restaurant chain\u2019s corporate office in Wisconsin."}
