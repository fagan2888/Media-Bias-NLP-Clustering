I am one of them. After working 31 years in the warehouse and driving semis for Piggly Wiggly warehouse, putting a part of my wages into a pension fund, I have been notified that the pension fund is going to run out of money within 10 to 15 years.\n\nAfter hours of investigation, it seems as though this has happened for many reasons and many people are responsible. Unfortunately, if these cuts go through, the people who are going to be devastated are not the people who are at fault.\n\nIn 1982, following a lengthy probe, the Teamsters entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department to cede control of its retirement funds to a consortium of banks. The arrangement remains in force today.\n\nIn 2006-2007, prior to the 2008 market collapse, a named fiduciary to the Central States Pension Fund, Goldman Sachs was \u201cBetting Big\u201d that the real estate market would collapse. The big banks have paid out $251 billion in fines since 2008 for its misdeeds. Where is that money? It should go to the victims. In 1982, the U.S. government took our money from the mob and gave it to Wall Street. From one crook to another.\n\nThe federal government isn\u2019t any better. Money was taken out of my wages for Social Security benefits when I retire. That money is gone. All that\u2019s left are IOUs \u2014 IOUs that the government has no intention of paying back.\n\nIf these pension cuts go through, this is just the beginning. It will be like dominoes, and it won\u2019t stop until they take away Social Security.\n\nThe Wisconsin-Sheboygan Committee To Protect Pensions will meet at 10 a.m., Dec. 4, at the Schleswig Town Hall, 21935 Rockville Road, Kiel. This meeting is for retirees and active members. These cuts will affect everyone. If this isn\u2019t stopped, they can come back in a few years and take some more, including those older than 75.\n\nSteve Kupsch\n\nSheboygan\n\nKohler's tactics wrong\n\nWhen I moved to Sheboygan in 1965, families were just beginning to move back after fleeing during the violent Kohler strikes throughout the previous decade.\n\nFear and shock were still vivid in memories shared quietly, under the breath. I was such an optimist then \u2014 I certainly never expected to see what happened in 2010, essentially breaking the skilled workforce and limiting, for new hires, the potential to rise in the future. The economy was dire in 2010, and the lure of off-shoring \u2014 union-busting for the 21st century, really \u2014 darkened everyone\u2019s expectations.\n\nIt shocks me to see the company try to force the company\u2019s workers out of the middle class in 2010, and hold them there now. Kohler is not on life-support as a company and I begin to think it was a strategic lie to say so in 2010.\n\nI am a big user of Kohler arts and hospitality spin-offs, and I seem to have secured a place for myself in the middle class, but I have not forgotten that it is the community of Sheboygan that I love \u2014 and my own position in the world cannot be sustained at the expense of others. The company\u2019s position tells me they have abandoned this part of the American Dream and want to push the community down to assure their own position.\n\nAlready, it is getting hard for me to drive to shops and events I care for in Kohler, and I can live without them if the cost is aligning myself with corporate greed.\n\nKeep that in mind, Kohler Company, as you decide what is a \u201cfair offer.\u201d\n\nJulie Furman-Stodolka\n\nPlymouth", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "If cuts happen, people will be hurt", "og": {"site_name": "Sheboygan Press Media", "description": "If cuts happen, people will be hurt", "title": "Letters to the Editor: Nov. 30", "url": "http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/opinion/2015/11/29/letters-editor-nov-30/76376660/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sheboyganpress.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If cuts happen, people will be hurt", "title": "Letters to the Editor: Nov. 30", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16f70074208490b1b0d54c6be801b309fe4e568a/c=67-0-468-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/25/WIGroup/Sheboygan/635840537294282247-opinion---letterslogo.jpg", "creator": "@sheboyganpress", "site": "@sheboyganpress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=879193382", "fb": {"app_id": 140019942719126}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2107\"", "article_summary": "Letters to the Editor (Photo: GWM)If cuts happen, people will be hurtThousands of retirees have recently received letters that their pensions are going to be cut in half.\nKeep that in mind, Kohler Company, as you decide what is a \u201cfair offer.\u201dJulie Furman-StodolkaPlymouth\nIf these pension cuts go through, this is just the beginning.\nIn 2006-2007, prior to the 2008 market collapse, a named fiduciary to the Central States Pension Fund, Goldman Sachs was \u201cBetting Big\u201d that the real estate market would collapse.\nUnfortunately, if these cuts go through, the people who are going to be devastated are not the people who are at fault."}
