Since there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d playbook that ensures a secure future, each health care organization needs to experiment with innovative approaches that best address the unique and constant challenges in its markets.\n\nFor example, those pursuing risk contracts have to expect poor financial performance before the financial benefits emerge. Organizations need to invest heavily in nontraditional capabilities such as system-wide electronic records, care management, analytics and so forth before they earn margins from risk contracts. This investment makes for a high-stakes transition.\n\nThe waterfall approach\n\nTraditional strategy development in health care resembles the cumbersome and inflexible \u201cwaterfall\u201d approach used in product and software development before agile software and lean product development emerged. The waterfall approach results in upfront and often untested assumptions about future conditions that are distilled into a single, middle-of-the-road scenario. This most likely scenario then drives strategies and locks in investments for three to five years.\n\nThe waterfall approach does not allow for validating assumptions or making rapid adjustments to strategies as new information emerges. Nor does it employ the collective wisdom of everyone in the organization. The result is that many health care organizations are like large, lumbering ships with a captive crew, unable to change course quickly as conditions change.\n\nWorse yet, waterfall thinking can lead to costly failures. As with many projects, the opportunity to manage investments in strategies occurs early on, not later when most investments have already been committed.\n\nIs there a better approach to developing innovative strategies in response to constant change? The answer is yes. A more agile way to ensure the success of new strategies should include:\n\n\u2022 An organizational \u201ctrue north.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Four alternative and equally possible future scenarios.\n\n\u2022 An agile process for developing innovative strategies.\n\nTrue north\n\nHealth care organizations that are leaders in transformation often use a true north as a compass that guides their organization from their current condition to where they want to be and provides the foundation for their strategies. A powerful true north is a memorable and unique value proposition, summarizing what the organization stands for and how it differs from competitors.\n\nAn effective true north inspires physicians and employees to deliver better, safer and more affordable services while compelling patients to seek health services at that organization instead of a competitor. The Triple Aim \u2014 care better than we have ever seen, health better than we have ever known, cost we can all afford ... for every person, every time \u2014 should make for a compelling true north.\n\nRegrettably, most health care organizations don\u2019t have a clear and compelling value proposition. Of those organizations that do, many break their true north down into four or five dimensions. These dimensions drive their strategies and are measured through a balanced score card. ThedaCare in Wisconsin, for example, measures its true north on the basis of safety, quality, customer service, people and financial stewardship.\n\nThe use of a true north helps health care organizations stay focused on key priorities while ensuring alignment of the organization during execution. A true north also helps health care leaders think beyond the bottom line and balance sheet and, instead, focus on improving value from the customer's point of view.\n\nAlternative future scenarios\n\nWhile most strategies deal with current or likely opportunities and challenges, few strategies deal with the unexpected. Yet, effective techniques have been developed that can help health care organizations anticipate such emergencies. In his book The Living Company, Arie de Geus, former senior executive at Royal Dutch/Shell, describes the creation of multiple, equally possible scenarios to test the strength of strategies under different circumstances. Peter Schwartz describes this methodology in greater detail in his book The Art of the Long View.\n\nHumans are simply not good at anticipating and recognizing signs of emerging opportunities or challenges, as our ability to see around the corner is limited. By creating four equally plausible scenarios with a mix of challenges and opportunities, health care leaders can help their organizations prepare for unexpected events. If they define four scenarios, health care leaders are less likely to concentrate solely on the middle ground, and they reduce the threat of judgment bias and groupthink.\n\nIf you believe this approach sounds academic, consider how 9/11 and the economic crisis in 2008 were anticipated by so few, yet had profound, global and long-lasting consequences. Then recall the many new, disruptive entrants in the health care marketplace, such as CVS, American Well (a telehealth-based primary care provider) and others that compete for patients based on convenience, access and cost. It pays to think more creatively about what might become reality in the not-too-distant future.\n\nInstead of thinking about scenarios as \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201cmost likely\u201d or \u201cpessimistic,\u201d the best scenarios are not defined by some subjective value statement but by some type of future. For example, the four scenarios could be based on the following titles and plots:\n\n\u2022 \u201cChurn\u201d: significant change in health care but no progress.\n\n\u2022 \u201cDusk\u201d: steady decline in viability due to external drivers and internal constraints.\n\n\u2022 \u201cDawn\u201d: new growth opportunities emerging.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe unthinkable\u201d: external drivers posing sudden and existential challenges.\n\nKey drivers of scenarios include:\n\n\u2022 Demographics of the population(s) served.\n\n\u2022 Consumer behavior.\n\n\u2022 Payer strategies.\n\n\u2022 Employer initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Competition, new entrants and substitutes for health care services.\n\n\u2022 Medical, information and communication technology.\n\n\u2022 Economics and legislation (local and national).\n\n\u2022 Global politics and economics (e.g., conflict, instability, energy supply, transportation).\n\n\u2022 Mother Nature (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, droughts, rising temperatures, rising sea levels).\n\nFour such future scenarios, each briefly describing a mix of appropriate and plausible events \u2014 good and bad \u2014 in the form of brief narratives, may help health care leaders think more creatively and offer a fresh perspective about possible future conditions. Scenarios can facilitate the development of truly effective and innovative strategies. In addition, scenarios can help test the robustness of strategies, as they provide the minimum requirements for success under different circumstances.\n\nThe A3 process\n\nMuch has been written about \"Lean\" as a management and operating system to improve organizational performance. In addition, lean process and product development is emerging as an efficient, effective and agile way to design, build and test complex, high-quality products. However, there has not been much discussion about combining LPPD with Lean\u2019s A3 process \u2014 pioneered at Toyota \u2014 to develop strategies. Such a combination could result in an even more effective approach for developing and testing innovative strategies before committing to their full deployment.\n\nThe advantage of applying some of LPPD\u2019s principles within the A3 process is that this approach would enable organizations to create strategies with a higher probability of success. In particular, applying LPPD\u2019s concurrent design and testing principles (as described below) would enable health care leaders to converge on the best strategy for each opportunity or threat more effectively while gaining valuable insights along the way.\n\nThe A3 process for developing innovative strategies uses the scientific method, a.k.a. the plan-do-study-adjust method, in a structured format. During the A3 process, health care leaders refine answers to the following questions in an iterative way as new information and insights emerge over time:\n\nWhat are the opportunities and challenges facing the organization? Use your organization\u2019s true north and four equally possible future scenarios as the starting point.\n\nWhat goals, targets or outcomes are required by the organization?\n\nWhat is the cause of the opportunity or challenge that best shows cause and effect?\n\nWhat are the possible strategies to achieve the desired outcome(s)? Develop at least nine strategies or counter measures to ensure maximum creativity. The first three and most obvious possible solutions usually emerge quickly, but getting to the last three possible solutions often requires outside-the-box thinking, and these may lead to truly innovative strategies.\n\nHow will you decide which strategies to propose for each opportunity or threat? Consider using LPPD\u2019s concurrent design and testing principles for the selection process:\n\n\u2022 Define the key requirements regarding customer needs and expectations, as well as the organization\u2019s business needs, capabilities and limitations.\n\n\u2022 Select two or three alternative strategies from the nine alternatives that best address customers\u2019 and the organization\u2019s requirements.\n\n\u2022 Develop, test and refine these alternative strategies simultaneously and in an iterative manner to learn what works best and to converge your focus toward the best strategy.\n\n\u2022 Select the best strategy at the last possible moment to take advantage of the most current knowledge.\n\nThen ask:\n\n\u2022 How will you get agreement from all stakeholders?\n\n\u2022 How will you implement the strategy?\n\n\u2022 How will you know if your strategies work?\n\n\u2022 What issues do you anticipate, and how will you address those in your implementation plan?\n\n\u2022 How will you and the organization learn from the testing and implementation of the strategy, and how will lessons learned be shared with everyone in the organization?\n\nThe A3 process requires intense collaboration between key stakeholders before opportunities and challenges are fully understood and strategies agreed to by all. It also enables continuous adjustments as new developments or new information emerge. Finally, the A3 process enables testing of key assumptions and expectations through pilots, before committing more resources to the selected strategies. It takes wishful thinking and other biases out of the process and enables the organization to learn how to better deal with complex challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe A3 report, a document that answers the questions listed above, should be reviewed periodically after the implementation of a strategy is complete. This review will ensure that adjustments can be made quickly and that new developments don\u2019t undo good work.\n\nGetting started\n\nIt takes courage and creativity for health care leaders to lead their organizations through a time of great uncertainty. Unfortunately, the transition from waterfall strategic planning to a more agile process of strategy development will not happen overnight. This transition should be treated as an organizational learning process.\n\nFirst, create a true north through an iterative process that yields the best description of where the health care organization wants to go. Next, experiment with creating four different future scenarios. This, too, will take some time before the team feels comfortable creating meaningful scenarios appropriate for the organization. Finally, learn to apply the A3 strategy development process to one or two opportunities or challenges before adopting it for the most important facing the organization.\n\nLearning to use the A3 process will enable health care leaders and their organizations to prepare for opportunities and challenges in an agile, adaptive and innovative manner. Thus, strategy development becomes an organizational learning process, and organizational learning becomes a key strategy for success.\n\nPaul Schilstra, M.S., is the president and founder of primeASCENT LLC in Ellicott City, Md.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care organizations face a great deal of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity and therefore must address a dizzying number of opportunities and challenges.
