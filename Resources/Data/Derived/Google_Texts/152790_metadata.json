David Vitter\u2019s crusade against congressional health care benefits will continue this week, this time with help from a presidential hopeful.\n\nThe Lousisiana Republican is expected to introduce \u201cNo Exemptions\u201d legislation to combat the employer contribution for lawmakers, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is expected to copy the language and try to insert it as an amendment into the highway funding bill the Senate is set to consider this week.\n\nCruz and Vitter have vigorously opposed the government contribution to congressional health care under the Affordable Care Act, calling it a \u201cWashington exemption.\u201d Lawmakers and their staffs were able to maintain that contribution as the result of a 2013 Office of Personnel Management ruling that House and Senate employees could participate in the D.C. Small Business Health Option Program, rather than enroll on the individual exchanges.\n\n\"The very people who wrote the law \u2014 Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats \u2014 wanted out of it. And this Administration was only too happy to oblige,\" Cruz said in a statement Monday. \"Today, the taxpayers subsidize their platinum plans while millions of Americans across this country have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, and are facing skyrocketing premiums,\" Cruz continued. \"Yet members of Congress retain their illegal exemptions from Obamacare, and it\u2019s time to end the Washington favors that have gone on for far too long.\"\n\nCruz offering the amendment to the long-term transportation bill would be a move sure to bring more contention to the process.\n\nAnother GOP presidential hopeful, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has already signaled he wants an amendment vote this week to block federal dollars from flowing to Planned Parenthood, and the must-pass measure is also lining up as the vehicle for reviving the Export-Import Bank.\n\nAside from presidential politics, there may be a good reason for Cruz to take charge this time.\n\nUnlike the many times Vitter sought to get votes on amendments related to what he calls the \"Washington exemption\" from the reach of the Affordable Care Act, the highway bill is a measure on which the Louisiana Republican has played a significant role. He's a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chairman of the subpanel with federal-aid highways in its jurisdiction.\n\nBut Vitter made no reference to potentially complicating the highway bill in a statement Monday. Instead, he touted a 73-page report on his investigation into \u201cCongress\u2019 fraudulent Obamacare subsidy.\u201d\n\nVitter contends Congress should not have been allowed to enroll in the small business exchange, since it is, by definition, not a small business under D.C. law since Congress employs more than 50 people. The question of Congress\u2019 characterization as a small business in the exchange was the subject of a recent taxpayer lawsuit, but the suit was dismissed when a D.C. Superior Court judge ruled congressional staff could enroll in the exchange.\n\nStill, Vitter is looking for answers, even after a failed attempt to subpoena the D.C. government over the issue. He listed a series of questions at the end of his report, including which members of Congress met with the White House to discuss the OPM rule.\n\nRelated: Republicans Vote Against Vitter\u2019s Obamacare Subpoena\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
