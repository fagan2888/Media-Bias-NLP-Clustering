SHERMAN, Texas -- Sherman got a visit Wednesday from its new United States Congressman.

John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, is a first-year U.S. Congressman, serving as the 4th district representative. He's been on the job for 6 weeks in Washington.

Ratcliffe met with Sherman Mayor Cary Wacker, Grayson County Commissioner Phyllis James, and other county officials while he visited Sherman's city hall, Texas Instruments and local restaurants.

Ratcliffe said he's working in Washington to repeal the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. He's co-sponsored bill, HR 596, that would repeal the ACA and replace it with, "Credible Market Based Alternatives."

"You know we didn't have a perfect health care system before so there are certain things we need to address," he said. "It's not enough to just say that we need to repeal Obama care. "
