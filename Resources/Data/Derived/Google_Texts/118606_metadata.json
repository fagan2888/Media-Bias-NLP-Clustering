The sheer gall of John Boehner suddenly pretending to be a champion in the struggle against income inequality is, for want of a better word, staggering.\n\nCheck it out:\n\nCLAIM: \u201cToday, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again.\u201d (President Obama, State of the Union Address, January 20, 2015) SOTU FACT: All the growth the president is taking credit for tonight has done nothing to boost middle-class families. Income equality has gotten worse on his watch.\n\nYes. You just saw Boehner blame Obama for the rich getting richer at our expense.\n\nFACT: President Obama has been attacking rising income inequality for his entire presidency.\n\nFACT: Income inequality would almost certainly be worse today if we had a Republican president, according to an \u201cexclusive analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, conducted at the request of The Washington Post\u201d in July 2014, \u201cthat compared today\u2019s income distribution with what it would look like if President George W. Bush\u2019s tax policies were still in place.\u201d\n\nWhen Obama attacked income inequality before the 2010 midterms, Politico reported, the 1 percent \u201cfreaked out\u201d and \u201cappear[ed] to be having a collective meltdown.\u201d\n\nThis obvious point aside, let\u2019s look at three big problems with Boehner\u2019s \u201cfact-checking\u201d:\n\nBoehner\u2019s \u201cSOTU fact\u201d doesn\u2019t address what Obama said. It is a straw-man argument. Obama did not say income inequality is not a problem. In fact, he spent much of his SOTU addressing income inequality;\n\nSecond, what Obama did say IS true: wages are rising again. As Reuters put it last night, \u201cit is true that earnings are rising.\u201d And yes, Reuters qualifies that statement by adding \u201cmultiple government surveys suggest income growth remains much slower than before the 2007-09 recession,\u201d but the point needs to be made that the GOP caused the recession and Obama has spent much of his presidency turning the economy around. Any growth at all is near-miraculous, considering where we were when he took office. But even if wages were not rising, Boehner did not fact-check this point;\n\nIncome Inequality is a serious problem precisely because of John Boehner\u2019s own party, which favors tax breaks for the rich and corporations and tax hikes for the Middle Class. President Obama wants to lift people into the Middle Class. Boehner refuses to create Middle Class jobs. It was just the Sunday that Paul Ryan again called for tax hikes for the Middle Class.\n\nAnd on Monday, Democrats unveiled a plan to give the Middle Class a $2,000 tax cut. None other than John Boehner, who last night accused President Obama of failing to help the Middle Class, shot it down, saying it\u2019s \u201cthe last thing we need.\u201d\n\nBoehner\u2019s SOTU fact actually indicts his own party. If we fact-check Boehner\u2019s fact-checking, we find that Republicans have repeatedly accused President Obama of \u201cclass warfare\u201d when he has tried to help the Middle Class, including as recently as the occasion of Obama\u2019s proposal on Saturday for tax cuts for the Middle Class and tax hikes for the rich.\n\nIn July 2013, Fox News\u2019 senior network political analyst Brit Hume, attacked President Obama for having an irrational fixation on income inequality. Forging ahead, in December of that year, President Obama doubled down by declaring that income inequality is \u201cthe defining challenge of our time.\u201d\n\nYet after six years of attacking Obama\u2019s every attempt to help the Middle Class, here we have John Boehner attacking President Obama for not being fixated enough on income inequality. Really?\n\nHere are a couple of facts for you:\n\nFACT: Healthcare reform, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is itself an attack on income inequality. The Republican response has seen John Boehner himself oversee literally dozens of attempts to repeal Obamacare.\n\nFACT: The number of attempted repeals of Obamacare are greater than the number of permanent jobs that will be created by the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\nBoehner\u2019s official response to last night\u2019s SOTU was to claim,\n\nThe State of the Union is a chance to start anew, but all the president offered tonight is more taxes, more government, and more of the same approach that has failed middle-class families. These aren\u2019t just the wrong policies, they\u2019re the wrong priorities: growing Washington\u2019s bureaucracy instead of America\u2019s economy.\n\nMore taxes. Like Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to hike taxes on the Middle Class?\n\nSo what we have here is a House which has for six years stymied every attempt by President Obama and the Democrats to help the Middle Class. Apparently, raising Middle Class taxes somehow helps the Middle Class and Obama\u2019s plan to cut Middle Class taxes hurts the Middle Class, and Obama\u2019s plan to tax the rich \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 hurts the Middle Class and Republican plans to cut taxes for the rich \u2013 again, bizarrely \u2013 helps the Middle Class.\n\nIf this kind of math makes sense to you, then perhaps trickle-down economics makes sense to you as well. The rest of us aren\u2019t into water sports, thank you very much.\n\nThe Speaker of the House did not address Obama\u2019s point about wages increasing for the simple reason that wages are starting to rise again, and President Obama has been a champion of increasing the minimum wage while Boehner has been staunchly against any such move, to the extent that he has said he would rather kill himself that vote for a minimum wage hike.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Invoking suicide in opposition to raising wages makes it kind of hard to criticize Obama\u2019s statement directly.\n\nBecause Boehner could not dispute that fact then, he chose instead to pose as a champion of the Middle Class and blamed the president for the very income inequality his own party \u2013 and he himself \u2013 has repeatedly championed.\n\nThe sad fact of Republican fact-checking is that their fact-checking needs to be fact-checked, and this was never more true last night. Boehner\u2019s alleged fact-checking is appallingly dishonest, misleading, and grotesquely hypocritical.
