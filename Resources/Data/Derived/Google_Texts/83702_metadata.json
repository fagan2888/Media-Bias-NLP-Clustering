Particularly if you make it past your 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nAfter analyzing interviews with 1,656 married American adults ages 57-85, researchers found the expected: Those in the first throes of the passion years had sex more frequently than those whose wedded years had piled up, their sexual edginess sandpapered by life.\n\nBut then researchers also found the unexpected: While most long-married individuals reported steady declines in sexual activity, those who passed the 50-year wedded mark began to report a slight increase in their sex lives.\n\nAnd notably, frequency in the sex lives of long-married couples continued to improve. In the study, published in The Archives of Sexual Behavior, researchers noted \u201cthat an individual married for 50 years will have somewhat less sex than an individual married for 65 years.\u201d\n\nThe analysis is based on data from the 2005-06 National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, for which investigators interviewed older adults about many aspects of their well-being. Even when this study\u2019s authors accounted for factors such as age, health, race, gender, employment and relationship satisfaction, the warm glow after the 50-year marriage mark, although flickering, was steadier than that of those in marriages of shorter duration.\n\nThe researchers are sociologists at Louisiana State University, Florida State University and Baylor University.\n\n\u201cSexual frequency doesn\u2019t return to two to three times a month, but it moves in that direction,\u201d said Samuel Stroope, lead author and an assistant professor of sociology at LSU.\n\nThere are limits to the conclusions that can be drawn from the research.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether being married causes you to have more sex or having more sex causes you to stay married longer,\u201d said Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist and professor of human development at Cornell not involved in this study.\n\nLinda J. Waite, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago and the principal investigator for the 2005-06 National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, the data set used in the current study, expressed caution. \u201cThere are small numbers at those ages,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little dangerous to interpret it too much.\u201d\n\nBut the finding that some long-married couples continue to have sex decade after decade was not news to Jennie B., an 82-year-old widow in upstate New York. She married her first and only husband, Peter, in 1956, when they were in their mid-20s. The couple, married 47 years, remained sexually active until he had quintuple heart bypass surgery two years before his death in 2003.\n\n\u201cOnce a month, maybe?\u201d said Jennie B., who asked that her last name not be used for reasons of privacy. \u201cI wasn\u2019t counting. It happened when it happened. Intercourse was not as meaningful as other things, although we continued to have sex.\u201d\n\nIn this snapshot study of older adults, some were not having sex at all. And a few were even having sex daily. But in the main, the study looked at trends.\n\nThe average older adult who had been married for a year had a 65 percent chance of having sex two to three times a month or more. At 25 years of marriage, the likelihood of that frequency dropped to 40 percent. If the marriage lasted 50 years, the likelihood was 35 percent.\n\nBut if the marriage \u2014 and the life span \u2014 of the older adults continued, at 65 years of being together, the chance of having sex with that frequency was 42 percent.\n\nLong-timers accumulate what Stroope calls \u201crelationship capital\u201d: In good marriages, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re building up something, accumulating experience and knowledge about your intimate partner over time that builds on itself.\u201d\n\nAnd so, as adults age, their social circles shrink, they know time is limited, they look around and what do they see? Each other.\n\n\u201cThey place intimacy as a high priority,\u201d said Pillemer. \u201cMany people told me that you don\u2019t notice the physical differences in a long marriage. The person still seems the same to you.\u201d\n\nFor Jennie B., the meaning of intimacy and sexual activity evolved and deepened over her long marriage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an intimacy that comes later that is staggeringly wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hold hands with this person you love and adore, and somehow it\u2019s just as passionate as having sex at an earlier age. There is such a sense of connection and intimacy that grows out of a long relationship, that touch carries with it the weight of so many memories. And many are sexual.\u201d\n\nIndeed what she misses most as a widow, she says, is holding hands.\n\n\u201cAnd people say, \u2018We\u2019ll hold your hand.\u2019 But that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/hfaging03.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0077\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou can hold hands with this person you love and adore, and somehow it\u2019s just as passionate as having sex at an earlier age.\nAnd a few were even having sex daily.\nIntercourse was not as meaningful as other things, although we continued to have sex.\u201dIn this snapshot study of older adults, some were not having sex at all.\nThe average older adult who had been married for a year had a 65 percent chance of having sex two to three times a month or more.\nBut if the marriage \u2014 and the life span \u2014 of the older adults continued, at 65 years of being together, the chance of having sex with that frequency was 42 percent."}
