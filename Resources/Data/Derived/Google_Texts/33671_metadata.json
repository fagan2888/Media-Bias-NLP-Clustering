MT @stephenfhayes: Admin tell CNN\u2019s this is an \u2018uncontested arrival\u2019 not necessarily \u2018an invasion\u2019 & that this distinction is \u2018key.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Kasparov has voiced his opinions on the Ukraine crisis via twitter frequently over the last week, drawing comparisons between Putin\u2019s Russia and Nazi Germany.\n\nSEE ALSO: Putin goes to parliament, makes case for military in Ukraine\n\n\u201cSo far, the Kremlin & Kremlin stooges in Ukraine are following that same 1938 script. Talk of \u2018protection,\u2019 \u2018peace,\u2019 \u2018self-determination,\u2019\u201d he tweeted on Thursday.\n\nA few minutes later he added, \u201cPutin has little choice but to act in Ukraine. Dictators, without legitimacy of elections, must regularly show their power.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasparov has also used social media to urge the U.S. and other western powers to intervene in Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday he tweeted: \u201cWest will have to act on Ukraine eventually. Question is how long, as price will keep going up. Post-Syria credibility is very low.\u201d\n\nAnd on Friday, he continued the commentary with criticism of President Obama\u2019s strategy, tweeting: \u201cChurchill on Obama: \u2018decided to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent,\u2019\u201d he tweeted on Friday, and added, \u201cThere are always a million reasons for inaction, countless rationalizations for helplessness. Being resolute doesn\u2019t require excuses.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasparov was born in the Soviet Union and became the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former World Chess champion and political activist, Garry Kasparov, took to social media to express his outrage over Obama administrator's assessment of Russia's presence in the Ukraine as a \"uncontested arrival.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Former World Chess champion and political activist, Garry Kasparov, took to social media to express his outrage over Obama administrator\u2019s assessment of Russia\u2019s presence in the Ukraine as a \u201cuncontested arrival.\u201d", "title": "Chess champion Garry Kasparov blasts Obama admin. reaction to Russian military move", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/1/chess-champion-garry-kasparov-blasts-obama-admin-r/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2007/12/04/WT200710112040049V2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2007/12/04/WT200710112040049V2.jpg", "description": "Former World Chess champion and political activist, Garry Kasparov, took to social media to express his outrage over Obama administrator's assessment of Russia's presence in the Ukraine as a \"uncontes", "card": "summary", "title": "Chess champion Garry Kasparov blasts Obama admin. reaction to Russian"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Garry Kasparov, Ukraine, Putin"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda626\"", "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: Putin goes to parliament, makes case for military in Ukraine\u201cSo far, the Kremlin & Kremlin stooges in Ukraine are following that same 1938 script.\nFormer World Chess champion and political activist, Garry Kasparov, took to social media to express his outrage over Obama administrator\u2019s assessment of Russia\u2019s presence in the Ukraine as a \u201cuncontested arrival.\u201dHe tweeted on Friday: \u201cWHAT?!\nBeing resolute doesn\u2019t require excuses.\u201dMr. Kasparov was born in the Soviet Union and became the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22.\nDictators, without legitimacy of elections, must regularly show their power.\u201dMr. Kasparov has also used social media to urge the U.S. and other western powers to intervene in Ukraine.\nA few minutes later he added, \u201cPutin has little choice but to act in Ukraine."}
