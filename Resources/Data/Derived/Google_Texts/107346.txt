Four Kentuckians recently made super-size contributions to the Republican National Committee through a new joint fundraising committee called Kentucky Republican Leadership Fund.

The Kentucky Republican Leadership Fund was registered with the Federal Election Commission in May as a group that will raise contributions for the RNC and the Republican Party of Kentucky. The only official of the new committee listed in FEC documents is Caleb Crosby, identified as treasurer and custodian of records.

Crosby is also treasurer of the super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership which is raising big contributions - largely from out-of-state donors - to finance an independent advertising campaign opposing Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes' campaign for the U.S. Senate.

The Kentucky Republican Leadership Fund reported to the FEC it got these four contributions in the May-June period:

Jess Correll, Stanford, president of First Southern National Bank, $42,400

Marion Forcht, Corbin, Forcht Group executive, $32,400

Terry E. Forcht, Corbin, chief executive of Forcht Group, $32,400

David A. Jones, Louisville, retired, $32,400.

The report shows that the new committee sent nearly all of this money ($126,490) to the Republican National Committee. It gave $9,760 to the Republican Party of Kentucky. It paid $1,350 to Crosby's CFC Strategies for "compliance consulting," and had a $2,000 balance as of June 30.
