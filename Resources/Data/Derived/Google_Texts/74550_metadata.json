The improved outlook for Europe increased the appeal of risky assets like stocks.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year note recorded its largest one-session gain in two weeks, TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.88% closing 8.1 basis points higher at 2.083%, according to data from Tradeweb.\n\nThe yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.27% was up 3.6 basis points to 0.662%. The yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.49% added 8.5 basis points to 2.685%.\n\nThe 10-year yield closed higher on Friday, snapping three days of declines and clinching its largest one-month yield gain since June 2013.\n\nBond yields move inversely to prices.\n\nNew corporate issuance also weighed on Treasury prices Monday, Tucci said. Pharmaceutical company Actavis announced $20 billion in new debt Monday, which could draw investors away from the sovereign debt market.\n\nBond investors are looking ahead to Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for February, with a focus on average hourly earnings data, wrote David Keeble, head of interest-rate strategy at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. Analysts polled by MarketWatch expect the report to show the U.S. economy added 238,000 new jobs in February.\n\nEuropean debt yields moved higher Monday, with the yield on the 10-year bund TMBMKDE-10Y, +0.00% closing 2.9 basis points higher at 0.357%, ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Investors expect the ECB to announce its first purchase of 60-billion euros in private and public debt at a news conference following the meeting.\n\nThe ECB is also expected to release revised economic-growth forecasts, which could further rattle bond markets, as signs of renewed growth could undermine demand for \u201csafe\u201d assets like sovereign debt.\n\n\u201cWith a new set of economic forecasts, there is an added kick to this week\u2019s ECB meeting, in part because it is the first time in a while that some forecasts, particularly growth, would have to be raised,\u201d Keeble wrote in a research note.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Treasury yields inch higher Monday after a widely watched measure of core inflation rose in-line with analysts\u2019 expectations.", "creator": "@jsadinolfi", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT046_econ_p_ZG_20140828132139.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Joseph Adinolfi", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Treasury yields inch higher Monday after a widely watched measure of core inflation rose in-line with analysts\u2019 expectations.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-tick-up-as-core-inflation-rises-2015-03-02", "author": "Joseph Adinolfi", "parsely-title": "Treasury yields rise as core inflation meets expectations", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-02T16:03:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Treasury yields inch higher Monday after a widely watched measure of core inflation rose in-line with analysts\u2019 expectations.", "title": "Treasury yields rise as core inflation meets expectations", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-tick-up-as-core-inflation-rises-2015-03-02", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT046_econ_p_ZG_20140828132139.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT046_econ_p_ZG_20140828132139.jpg"}, "article.id": "DA81121E-C0D6-11E4-B3E1-DC209EB1340C", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf52e\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK (MarketWatch) \u2014 Treasury yields closed higher Monday after a measure of U.S. core inflation met expectations, and gauges of manufacturing activity in Europe delivered a positive surprise.\nEuropean debt yields moved higher Monday, with the yield on the 10-year bund TMBMKDE-10Y, +0.00% closing 2.9 basis points higher at 0.357%, ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting.\nThe yield on the 10-year note recorded its largest one-session gain in two weeks, TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.88% closing 8.1 basis points higher at 2.083%, according to data from Tradeweb.\nThe yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.27% was up 3.6 basis points to 0.662%.\nThe yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.49% added 8.5 basis points to 2.685%."}
