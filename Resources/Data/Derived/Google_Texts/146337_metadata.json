I wish them congratulations, they won the election, but there was no wave of approval for anybody. There was an ebbing, an ebb tide, for us.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPress * to unmute: \u201cOn a conference call with members last Thursday, just two days after the election, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said Democrats need to \u2018rethink\u2019 their message after a number of young people voted for Sen.-elect Cory Gardner, a Republican, over Sen. Mark Udall, a Democrat. Pelosi cut her off, sources on the call said.\u201d The California Democrat explained to my colleagues that the Democratic message is good but the party needs to do more to engage voters. And she brushed off suggestions that her caucus needs new leadership. http://goo.gl/OtuEGT | Full transcript of the interview: http://goo.gl/3tw6nr\n\nMore unrest: Emma Dumain of Roll Call has members like Democratic No. 3 Jim Clyburn and recently reelected Patrick Murphy asking questions. Clyburn: \u201cA couple of weeks before the election, my travels around the country, in and out of these congressional districts, led me to the conclusion that our message, or a lack thereof, was causing a problem.\u201d Murphy: \u201cYou got some younger, newer members who kind of want to be set free and don\u2019t want to be tied down as much ...They want to talk about the things that got them elected in the first place.\u201d http://goo.gl/3CxT0k\n\nWHY GOP THINKS DEM LEADERS ARE STICKING AROUND -- Per John Feehery on WSJ: \u201c1. President Obama gets the blame, not them \u2026 2. They bring the money \u2026 3. They are simpatico with the majority of their minority \u2026 4. Nobody wants to challenge them.\u201d http://goo.gl/sZ9xxG\n\nLEADERSHIP RACES TO SHAPE UP: In the Senate, we are basically looking at races for the DSCC and NRSC chairmanship as the main event with no movement at the top (unless something crazy happens). But there\u2019s a couple interesting leadership elections over on the House side, per The Hill\u2019s Scott Wong. \u201cIt\u2019s now a two-way race between Reps. Mick Mulvaney (S.C.) and Bill Flores (Texas) for the RSC gavel \u2026 In the contest for the No. 5 job in leadership, Rep. Luke Messer (Ind.) is the favorite after getting an early start this past summer. However, a GOP source familiar with the contest said Rep. Tom Reed (N.Y.) is \u2018getting some traction.\u2019 Rep. Rob Woodall (Ga.) is also running.\u201d http://goo.gl/T5zHR9\n\nAP CALLS IT FOR SULLIVAN -- Mark Begich won\u2019t concede: Here we are coming back for the lame duck and races are still being called. As of the middle of the night, Dan Sullivan was up about 8,100 votes and the incumbent Democrat refused to admit defeat. Begich campaign manager \u201cSusanne Fleek-Green, said in a statement that Begich believes every vote deserves to be counted and will follow the Division of Elections as it continues toward a final count.\u201d AP: http://goo.gl/spvujN\n\nU.S., CHINA INK EMISSIONS AGREEMENT: \u201cU.S. officials said the commitments by the world's two biggest carbon polluters came after months of backroom negotiations and would set the tone for a global climate control pact, but experts said the limits did not break significant new ground \u2026 \u2018If the United States is going to continue to lead the world in addressing global challenges, then we have to have the second largest economy and the most populous nation on Earth as our partner,\u2019 Obama said.\u201d Reuters: http://goo.gl/gvmAjW\u2019\n\nMcConnell fired up: \u201c\u2018Our economy can\u2019t take the president\u2019s ideological war on coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,\u2019 McConnell said in a statement minutes after the White House announced the bilateral deal.\u201d The Hill: http://goo.gl/pHnCTF\n\nPressing issue: Gotta highlight the great work of Josh Gerstein in Beijing, who sinks his teeth into the odd dynamic at a joint presser with President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u201cWhen a New York Times reporter posed a series of questions to both Obama and Xi, the U.S. president responded to the queries directed to him, but the Chinese president initially failed to respond to the questions put to him about the U.S. pivot to Asia and about refusal of residence permits for U.S. journalists working in China \u2026 after several minutes of broad strokes on the U.S.-China relationship, Xi returned to the questions from Times reporter Mark Landler. \u2018 Media outlets need to obey China\u2019s laws and regulations,\u2019 Xi said.\u201d Makes covering Capitol Hill look pretty enticing, if I do say so. http://goo.gl/woIHVz\n\n** A message from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and FairReform.com: America needs comprehensive tax reform \u2013 to protect American employers and American jobs. Learn more at FairReform.com . **\n\nHere it is: The lame duck. Welcome to the Huddle, your play-by-play guide to everything Capitol Hill. I was pleasantly surprised to get some \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d out of Metallica last night at the Concert for Valor, so it\u2019s hard to be mad on this Wednesday morning. Please send tips to beverett@politico.com and follow along on Twitter @burgessev.\n\nTODAY IN CONGRESS \u2013The first day back from a long recess and a triumphant election for Republicans.\n\nIn the House: New members will arrive on the Hill in the morning and begin to get acclimated to the madness of Capitol Hill that us old salts take for granted. At 5 p.m. there will a reception in Cannon for House members of both the 113th and 114th Congress. Oh yeah, and the House meets at 2 p.m. and suspension votes are scheduled for 6:30 p.m.\n\nIn the Senate: GOP Leader Mitch McConnell will welcome new GOP senators at 10 a.m. in his office, with a photo-op and maybe some shouted and ignored questions from reporters. The Senate convenes at 2 p.m. and will take a pair of procedural votes at 5:30 p.m. on two judges.\n\nAROUND THE HILL \u2013 Reps. Jim McGovern, Pete King and Earl Blumenauer will hold a presser on transit tax benefits at 10 p.m. on the House Triangle. At 2 p.m., Congressional Hispanic Caucus members will talk about executive immigration action.\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S MOST-CLICKED: Y\u2019all like your morning pictures, huh? Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cRob Portman plays dress-up\u201d drew the most Huddle eyeballs. Here\u2019s a photo of Paul Ryan trying to steal Portman\u2019s swagger in a North Face jacket: http://goo.gl/KJ0LWL\n\nTRIAL BALLOON POPPED: Sen. Patrick Leahy WILL NOT challenge Sen. Barbara Mikulski for the top Democratic slot on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Manu reports. That makes the caucus far more stable heading into this week\u2019s organizational meetings and avoids any intra party turf battles. http://goo.gl/8bKn2Q\n\nSpeaking of Approps: Today the committee will hold a hearing at 2 p.m. on Ebola. The Bold name witnesses: HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson.\n\nDEADLINE DRAMA -- GOP Congress warns on Iran: As Obama and Iranian leaders hurtle toward a Nov. 24 deadline for a broad nuclear agreement, there\u2019s another key date waiting in the wings: January, of course, when the GOP takes over the Senate. \u201cSenate Republicans don\u2019t plan to wait until they take power in January to rattle the nuclear talks. On Thursday, a day after returning to Washington, they will seek a vote on legislation requiring that Congress approve any deal. Democrats, who still control the Senate, are likely to quash the move. But it\u2019s an early illustration of Republican plans to confound the president\u2019s nuclear diplomacy.\u201d New super duper senior foreign correspondent Michael Crowley and yours truly: http://goo.gl/Nl5Vdj\n\nKEYSTONE AND LANDRIEU? The Senate is never really in town until we start talking about procedural possibilities. Voila, they are back today and gums are flapping over whether approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline is possible before Sen. Mary Landrieu's Dec. 6 run-off. My story with Elana Schor: \u201cSenate Democrats are signaling that there will be an open amendment process that could allow Keystone approval to be attached to either an Internet sales tax bill next week or the defense authorization bill after Thanksgiving \u2026 Keystone could even come up in a standalone bill if Landrieu or another senator receives unanimous consent to move forward. Although those requests typically get blocked, Democrats say the post-election Senate is a new world.\u201d http://goo.gl/vI6cbv\n\nLet\u2019s face it, she could use it: Bloomberg\u2019s Michael Bender and Annie Linskey survey the airwaves and it\u2019s not pretty for the incumbent. \u201cDemocratic Senator Mary Landrieu's re-election race is truly running out of air: She's responsible for a mere 4 percent of all TV spots in the week-old Louisiana runoff. Republican challenger Bill Cassidy and his friends paid for 96 percent of the spots that have run so far.\u201d http://goo.gl/0M9Hbl\n\nDEVINE INTERVENTION FOR SANDERS: Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to send signals that he\u2019s serious about launching a run for president, bringing on former Gore/Kerry/Dukakis aide Tad Devine if decides to take the plunge. \u201cIf he runs, I\u2019m going to help him,\u201d Devine told Robert Costa. \u201cHe is not only a longtime client but a friend. I believe he could deliver an enormously powerful message that the country is waiting to hear right now and do it in a way that succeeds.\u201d http://goo.gl/8OiNtq\n\nCLINTON, INC.: Bill and Hillary Clinton went hard for the Democrats during the midterms, but that work didn\u2019t come cheap, reports Buzzfeed\u2019s Ruby Cramer. \u201cWhen the Clintons travel, they fly private. This year, their airfare cost candidates at least $699,000, available state and federal campaign finance reports show \u2026 the $699,000 figure is the first comprehensive estimate that establishes the scope of the costs associated with using the Clintons as surrogates. By the time the rest of the filings come in, the number will likely exceed $1 million.\u201d http://goo.gl/14JQec\n\nKING GETS INTO IT WITH FOX HOSTS -- \u2018It has to do with having insurance, man\u2019: Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, tussled with \u201cFox and Friends\u201d yesterday morning after they sprang a video clip of Jonathan Gruber talking about voter ignorance and the Affordable Care Act. The hosts piled on King when he talked about how having insurance saved his life from cancer (\u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201d) and King shot back that it seemed the Fox hosts preferred to keep people off insurance (\u201cAre you that cruel?\u201d). Mediaite\u2019s got the video and the transcript: http://goo.gl/M8y1uS\n\nCRUZ SAVES AMERICA -- In coloring book form: Shout-out to @timkmak for flagging this one down. There\u2019s a new coloring book featuring Sen. Ted Cruz doing things like wrestling the snakes of Obamacare and riding a bald eagle that is pretty necessary viewing on a Wednesday morning. http://goo.gl/FHvRmR\n\nCruz \u201cfighting for all citizens of America\u201d: http://goo.gl/06ak8K\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S TRIVIA WINNER \u2013 Lucas White was the first to answer that John McCain will be the longest-serving senator to succeed a member of his own party (Barry Goldwater).\n\nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 I\u2019ll take today\u2019s question: Been a lot of talk about President Obama wielding his veto pen next year, but he\u2019s done so twice already to little fanfare. One was a stop-gap defense spending bill, but what was the other bill and why did Obama veto it?\n\nThe first person to correctly answer gets a mention in the next day\u2019s Huddle.

This record is a result of the three-tier system established in the wake of Prohibition.\n\nThe 21st Amendment, gives states the primary authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution and sale of beverage alcohol. As Congress works to make the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) solvent, it is imperative that state laws concerning direct to consumer shipping of wine, beer and spirits be respected.\n\nWSWA opposes legislation that permits USPS to circumnavigate current federal and state laws by shipping beverage alcohol as part of mail delivery. http://www.wswa.org/facts-data **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Here it is: The lame duck Congress.", "title": "POLITICO Huddle", "url": "http://www.politico.com/huddle/1114/huddle16060.html", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Here it is: The lame duck Congress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa6f\"", "article_summary": "President Obama gets the blame, not them \u2026 2.\nEmail me at beverett@politico.comGET HUDDLE emailed to your Blackberry, iPhone or other mobile device each morning.\nIn the Senate: GOP Leader Mitch McConnell will welcome new GOP senators at 10 a.m. in his office, with a photo-op and maybe some shouted and ignored questions from reporters.\nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 I\u2019ll take today\u2019s question: Been a lot of talk about President Obama wielding his veto pen next year, but he\u2019s done so twice already to little fanfare.\nThe first person to correctly answer gets a mention in the next day\u2019s Huddle."}
