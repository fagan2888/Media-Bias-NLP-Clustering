What would a Cruz-Paul primary battle mean for the election? Will they split constitutionalists? Can either man win the nomination? How will the establishment GOP react to them?\n\nFor our March cover story, Blaze White House correspondent Fred Lucas digs into what a potential Cruz vs. Paul throwdown could look like and impact small-government conservatives\u2019 efforts to take back both the Republican Party and the White House from progressives.\n\nEvery issue of TheBlaze Magazine contains exclusive content not found anywhere else \u2014 online or in print.

Ted Cruz, Texas, and Rand Paul, Ky., are in only their first terms in the upper chamber of Congress given the stature they\u2019ve attained. It could be because enough Americans desire a return to liberty and are seeking a leader unafraid to articulate those values. It could be both are good fighters and know how to rally Americans.\n\nWhatever the case, Cruz\u2014named the third most influential person of 2013 in one survey\u2014earned the option to wear an \u201cI told you so\u201d button following the Obamacare debacle, while Paul\u2014the president\u2019s polar opposite\u2014somehow managed to influence Obama administration policy.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nPaul even attended an East Room event in January where President Obama announced five new \u201cPromise Zones\u201d for regions with some of the most sluggish economies in the nation, which included the southeastern region of Paul\u2019s home state of Kentucky. The Obama proposal was\u2014believe it or not\u2014a left-wing variation on the \u201cEconomic Freedom Zones\u201d that Paul had proposed as part of a tax-slashing package for struggling regions a month earlier.\n\nVisiting the White House for a president he has so frequently excoriated may have seemed to put Paul into the belly of the beast. But during his press gaggle in front of the West Wing stakeout area, Paul uttered unexpected words for a potential GOP primary candidate, referring to Obama: \u201cI am supportive of his motives and what he\u2019s trying to do.\u201d That comment was of course narrowly targeted at Obama\u2019s \u201cPromise Zones,\u201d which, Paul added, did not go far enough with tax breaks and included too many federal grants that typically fail to spur growth.\n\nA week before the White House event, where one reporter snickered that the senator was \u201cmeasuring the drapes,\u201d Paul had filed a lawsuit to stop the National Security Agency spying program. Not surprisingly, the questioning soon turned to that direction. \u201cThis is a fundamental misconception I think sometimes of the president on a lot of things,\u201d Paul said. He said the president seems to think \u201cdue process can be performed with flash cards, a PowerPoint presentation and a bunch of NSA attorneys. That\u2019s not due process either. It\u2019s also true of the FISA court. That\u2019s not due process. A fundamental part of due process is you find truth through an adversarial process. You have to have people on both sides.\u201d\n\nHe further said that those so gung-ho for \u201cfrontier justice\u201d against fugitive leaker Edward Snowden should be just as interested in justice for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, whom Paul said committed perjury when the DNI told a Senate committee that the government was not gathering data on Americans.\n\nThe next day, Paul\u2019s Senate colleague Ted Cruz\u2014also likely vying for the 2016 GOP nomination\u2014was back in his home state speaking at the Texas Public Policy Foundation gathering in Austin, which might be just as much the belly of the beast considering the Austin area\u2019s leftward tilt. \u2026\n\n\u2026 In this case, he was speaking to a friendly crowd and had a stern warning about the Obama administration: \u201cOf all the bad things to have happened, I think one of the most dangerous is the consistent pattern of lawlessness from this president and this administration.\u201d He later added, \u201cIf you care about liberty, an imperial president who defies his constitutional obligation to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed\u2019 is an extraordinary threat to the liberty of this country.\u201d\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nWith his credentials of Harvard Law School and a string of successful Supreme Court arguments, the Left has difficulty trying to mock and intimidate Cruz from shining the light on threats to freedom. At the Austin event, Cruz focused on the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration, drug policy and Obamacare exemptions, saying, \u201cIf we have a system where the president can pick and choose which laws to follow at utter whim and discretion, then the whole rest of our constitutional structure becomes superfluous. That\u2019s dangerous. That is seriously dangerous.\u201d\n\nBIG CHANGES IN LITTLE TIME\n\nSo much has changed since 2011 when Paul was the leader of the Tea Party Caucus in the Senate and a national figure after the watershed 2010 elections.\n\nTwo years later, one of the few bright spots out of the disastrous 2012 election was Cruz\u2019s Senate victory. Before the end of his first year in office, he was the driving force behind the effort to defund and delay Obamacare that prompted a 16-day partial government shutdown and became the Right\u2019s most beloved senator, the Left\u2019s most hated and a presidential front-runner\u2014at least for a while.\n\nJust as so much changed in the two-year interval from 2011 to 2013, it\u2019s unknowable how much will change by 2016. What is near certain is that, of all the potential GOP presidential aspirants, none carries the banner of constitutional conservatism like Paul and Cruz.\n\nThere is some\u2014though not major\u2014philosophical daylight between the two men. Paul wasn\u2019t keen on Cruz\u2019s government shutdown strategy. Cruz doesn\u2019t home in on auditing the Federal Reserve and some of the other stereotypical libertarian views that make Paul an unconventional conservative. But it is Paul and Cruz who, among potential 2016 contenders, are the biggest challengers to a Republican establishment that has shown both an eagerness to compromise with the Obama administration and a seeming disdain for grassroots supporters\u2014particularly Tea Partiers\u2014who elected them.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nIn fact, both Paul and Cruz have demonstrated the ability to defeat the GOP establishment.\n\n[...]\n\nPARTING WAYS\n\nLast fall, Senate Democrats rejected the House Republican spending plan that funded the government while delaying the funding of Obamacare for a year. Not surprisingly, the media joined Democrats in blaming Republicans for the shutdown.\n\nPaul foresaw which way the blame game would go and said a shutdown would be a \u201cdumb idea,\u201d effectively breaking from what had become the conservative trifecta of Paul, Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Cruz and Lee believed the GOP must do whatever was necessary to keep a horrendous law from taking effect. \u2026 Paul ultimately supported the Cruz-Lee effort, but not wholeheartedly.\n\nHad the effort been made a month later\u2014when it was clear millions would lose their existing health insurance and the HealthCare.gov site was a dud\u2014it\u2019s quite likely Republicans would have coalesced and Democrats would have collapsed under public pressure. \u2026\n\nThe initial Washington thinking at the time was that defunding Obamacare was a no-win strategy and that Republicans shouldn\u2019t take an unnecessary beating in public opinion polls. But because of Cruz, many Republicans believe that history\u2014and voters\u2014will see them as the party that stood against the law. In November 2014, few Americans will even remember there was a two-week shutdown. But every American will be aware of exploding health-care costs, friends and family losing their insurance and the mandates that apply to all Americans except those with the right political connections.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nA greater divide between Cruz and Paul might come on the immigration reform issue. Both senators voted against the massive Gang of Eight comprehensive bill to bestow legal status on some 11 million illegal aliens. But while Cruz\u2014one of two Hispanic Republicans in the Senate\u2014was against the measure from day one, Paul was initially open to the idea. \u2026\n\n[...]\n\nNEITHER MAN SELLING OUT\n\nTo be clear, the Republican establishment wishes neither senator was around. But these two public friends are apparently becoming more competitive and reaching out to potential supporters.\n\nThe New York Times gleefully reported that, while meeting with big GOP donors in New York, Cruz stressed the Kentucky senator is unelectable because he\u2019ll never escape the shadow of his father who was untenable to many Republican voters.\n\nFurther, if the Times report is to be believed, Paul has in jest adopted the language of Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, calling Cruz \u201cthe chief of the wacko birds.\u201d Meanwhile, Paul has also cozied up to big donors and grown closer to Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads super PAC in Washington.\n\nNeither a brewing rivalry nor reaching out to establishment donors should alarm Tea Party conservatives. Only one of them can be president and that takes money. It would be unnatural if they weren\u2019t trying to outflank each other. They\u2019re not on the verge of selling out. To the contrary, though they occasionally differ in tactics, Cruz and Paul are to trying to keep their party honest.\n\n[...]\n\nPOTENTIAL ELECTORAL DRAWBACKS\n\nLike any presidential candidate, both men have targets on their backs and issues that will be magnified in the presidential microscope.\n\nThe Canadian-born Cruz will face inevitable challenges from left-wing birthers. \u2026\n\n\u2026 If Cruz declares his candidacy, there will be lawsuits challenging his eligibility. If he becomes president, legal challenges will flood in, and it might prompt the Supreme Court to finally make a determination.\n\nPaul had a dust up in 2013 where critics charged plagiarism, the term bandied about by Politico, BuzzFeed and MSNBC, who all reported that some of Paul\u2019s writings and speeches contained unattributed information that came nearly verbatim from Forbes magazine, The Week magazine, Wikipedia and studies from the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute.\n\n[...]\n\nFinally, both Paul and Cruz\u2014despite being guardians of the Constitution\u2014are still \u2026\n\n********************\n\nGet the full report on the potential Constitutionalist Thunderdome and much more in TheBlaze Magazine.\n\nWe\u2019ve got full analysis of Cruz\u2019s \u201cbirther problem,\u201d Paul\u2019s alleged plagiarism, the personal history of both men, the history of electing senators to the highest office in the land, who\u2019s got plans and eyes on any potential Paul-Cruz fallout, and lots more in the March issue of TheBlaze magazine\u2014which you can get for FREE.\n\nClick here to get a FREE digital version today!\n\nFollow Chris Field (@ChrisMField) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz and Rand Paul sit atop the list of 2016 White House hopefuls for many libertarian and conservative voters.
