Fleet Feet Sarasota has launched a fall "Ton of Fun" weight loss initiative as a means to keep Sarasota on the Florida Department of Health's "Healthy Weight Community Champion" list and promote a healthy lifestyle for Southwest Floridians.

Starting Sept. 15, participants will work toward losing a collective 2,000 pounds during a 12-week period as part of a program that will be held at other Fleet Feet locations across the country. Coach Whitney Bartlett will run the program, which includes nutritions tips, recipes, access to a registered dietician, free workouts, private weigh-ins and Facebook group, and e-new updates, as well as prize incentives for participants as they reach weight loss goals.

The cost is $50 per person. Fleet Feet Sarasota is located at 1830 S. Osprey Ave / Southside Village.

Advanced registration is required on or before Sept. 12, 2014 and can be done on-line at www.fleetfeetsarasota.com or in-store at Fleet Feet Sarasota, 1830 S. Osprey. For more information, contact Coach Whitney Bartlett at training@fleetfeetsarasota.com or call 941-894-3338.
