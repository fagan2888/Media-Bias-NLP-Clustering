ATLANTA (AP) — Hawks guard Kyle Korver is done for the NBA playoffs because of an ankle injury, dealing another blow to a team that already trails Cleveland 2-0 in the Eastern Conference final.

The Hawks announced Saturday that Korver has a severe high right ankle sprain. A foot and ankle specialist will determine the best court of treatment, but he definitely won’t play again in the postseason.

Korver rolled his right ankle during a scramble for a loose ball late in the third quarter of Game 2 Friday night. He hobbled off the court, went straight to the locker room and didn’t return.

The 34-year-old Korver was selected for his first All-Star Game this season and became Atlanta’s top 3-point threat. But he struggled to get open looks in the playoffs.
