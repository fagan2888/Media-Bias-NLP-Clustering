Unfortunately for the team, that came only in the form of the 1993 film \u201cThe Sandlot,\u201d which was shown on the ballpark\u2019s giant scoreboard screen after the Rockies\u2019 13-5 loss to the Minnesota Twins.\n\nA sandlot team is exactly what the Rockies (40-55) looked too much like in their final game before the all-star break. Not only were the Rockies routed Sunday, they dropped their seventh series in the past eight. If recent history is a guide, fans don\u2019t have a lot to look forward to after the break. Since 2010, the Rockies have more than doubled the number of games back of first place they were at the break to where they finished at season\u2019s end.\n\nBut, hey, they\u2019re still a half game ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks for last place in the National League West.\n\n\u201cUm \u2026 not very good,\u201d Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado said when asked to sum up his team\u2019s first half. \u201cObviously, it wasn\u2019t what we wanted. We make it a lot harder on ourselves, that\u2019s for sure. But we\u2019ve got a second half, and we\u2019ve got some guys coming back, so we\u2019ve just got to keep playing hard and try to get wins.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Minnesota Twins 13, Colorado Rockies 5\n\nThe return of left-hander Brett Anderson to the Rockies\u2019 rotation for the first time since April 12 didn\u2019t go well.\n\nThe Twins scored five runs on seven hits in the first inning Sunday and pounded out a season-high 18 hits overall.\n\n\u201cNot many positives about the outing. \u2026 My stuff was terrible, pretty much,\u201d said Anderson (0-3, 4.95 ERA). \u201cAfter the first inning, I battled and tried to give us a chance to win. I can only feel good about staying healthy, and just have to put this one behind me and go on to the next one.\u201d\n\nBrian Dozier hit two home runs for the Twins in the final two innings, turning a relatively close game into a rout.\n\nTo his credit, Anderson settled down and allowed only one run over the next four innings. He might have been in line for a victory if the Rockies could have hit a little better in the clutch.\n\nThe Rockies cut their 5-0 deficit to 5-4 by the second inning. In the third, they had runners at first and third with one out and Corey Dickerson at the plate. But Dickerson hit a short flyball to left field that failed to bring in Justin Morneau, and Wilin Rosario let struggling Twins starter Phil Hughes off the hook by striking out.\n\nIn the fourth, Carlos Gonzalez was up with the tying run on second and two outs. He swung and missed on strike three, but the ball got past Twins catcher Kurt Suzuki. That seemed to give Gonzalez enough time to reach first safely. But Suzuki made a quick recovery and barely beat Gonzalez with the throw. The play withstood a video review.\n\nThings started to go sideways for good in the fifth inning, when Trevor Plouffe tripled to right-center and came home on DJ LeMahieu\u2019s throwing error. That lifted Minnesota\u2019s lead to 6-4. The throw to Arenado was on target, but the ball hit Plouffe in the hand and skittered into the dugout.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why baseball is the best game in the world, and the worst game in the world. It\u2019s a game of inches,\u201d Anderson said of the key Twins run.\n\nRockies manager Walt Weiss did his best to sound optimistic about the team\u2019s second half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to get a breather here,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWhen the second half starts, we have to play with a sense of urgency. I was hoping we could get this series going into the break. Didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies head into All-Star break with another loss, a 13-5 rout to Twins", "title": "Rockies head into All-Star break with another loss, a 13-5 rout to Twins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/13/rockies-head-into-all-star-break-with-another-loss-a-13-5-rout-to-twins/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713_051656_anderson.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713_051656_anderson.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T17:59:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:31:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf4c\"", "article_summary": "But, hey, they\u2019re still a half game ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks for last place in the National League West.\n\u201cWhen the second half starts, we have to play with a sense of urgency.\nA sandlot team is exactly what the Rockies (40-55) looked too much like in their final game before the all-star break.\nRockies manager Walt Weiss did his best to sound optimistic about the team\u2019s second half.\nThe Rockies cut their 5-0 deficit to 5-4 by the second inning."}
