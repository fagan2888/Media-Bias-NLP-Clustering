— An Angier man was charged with first-degree murder Sunday after he allegedly stabbed a man at a Fuquay-Varina home.

Wake County sheriff’s responded shortly after 4 a.m. Sunday to an assault call at 1815 Holland Road, where they found Leobardo Sol Garcia, 30, of Angier, dead.

Deputies and state troopers later arrested Jose Luis Tovar Balencia, 38, of 124 Kay Lane, in the case.

Authorities haven't offered a motive for the stabbing or said how the two men might have known each other.

A spokesman for the Wake County Sheriff's Office declined to comment on the case.
