My prediction is that, if Donald Trump should win the whole megillah (which is not impossible, considering that Hillary Clinton\u2019s flaws as a candidate are arguably greater than his), many of those backing him now will come to regret their support.\n\nThat\u2019s because he\u2019s only an opportunistic Republican, and not a conservative at all. He has a long record of supporting liberal causes, he treats women according to the standard set by the Kennedys, Eliot Spitzer and Bill Clinton, and he glories in having no discretion about his speech.\n\nYou want Howard Stern for president, you can have him. I say, no thanks.\n\nTrump\u2019s shock-jock taxonomy is raw populism unfettered by restraints on government power. His chief political talent is to know what is on the public\u2019s mind and express it in the most exploitive way possible.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s populism appears to have found the perfect moment. He met an electorate looking for someone just like him.\n\nAs David Frum, a centrist, noted in the most recent issue of The Atlantic, \u201cThe angriest and most pessimistic people in America are the people we used to call Middle Americans. \u2026 You can measure their pessimism in polls that ask about their expectations for their lives \u2013 and for those of their children.\u201d\n\nTheir discontent is both wide and deep, he said: \u201cWhite Middle Americans express heavy mistrust of every institution in American society: not only government, but corporations, unions, even the political party they typically vote for \u2013 the Republican Party of Romney, Ryan and McConnell, which they despise as a sad crew of weaklings and sellouts. They are pissed off. And when Donald Trump came along, they were the people who told the pollsters, \u2018That\u2019s my guy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYes, these Americans\u2019 concerns are real, lasting and substantial, on issues ranging from Obamacare to immigration, and including terrorism, taxation and the \u201crecovery\u201d that never reached them. The Republican-approved let\u2019s-give-leftists-everything-they-want omnibus budget bill was the last straw for many.\n\nBut we are nearly through the second term of a president who is the epitome of narcissistic self-centeredness, a man openly hostile to the historic American enterprise and willing to utterly ignore the law to advance his aims.\n\nWe cannot afford to elect another such person, even if he is presently couching his goals in contrasting political terms.\n\nYes, any potential alternative on the right is flawed. So what? Perfection is a chimera, but love of country is an absolute requirement. We need a president who has America\u2019s best interests at heart, and time is growing short to select one.\n\nI don\u2019t have a particular favorite to recommend (in truth, most of my top choices have already dropped out, but acceptable alternatives remain). However, nominating Trump would be a terrible mistake for our nation \u2013 and that would be true whether he wins or loses.\n\nAt this point, I wouldn\u2019t blame some readers for saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve slammed the Republicans\u2019 leader, but you haven\u2019t listed any of Hillary Clinton\u2019s many flaws. How come? Do you want her to win?\u201d\n\nHardly. But it\u2019s not entirely certain she\u2019s going to be the Democrats\u2019 nominee. The FBI is still checking out her emails, where two labeled \u201cTop Secret\u201d just appeared.\n\nAnd even if what comes out of that is ignored or suppressed, the fact remains that she is a rigid leftist who spins falsehoods on any day the sun rises in the east. But she is also a stiff on the stump, and a woman who thinks her sex is her principal qualification for the presidency.\n\nAs it happens, she\u2019s probably right about that last point. And the protection the major media have given her so far may fade in the glare of the coming national campaign.\n\nSo think hard about who should occupy the Oval Office when the economy really goes belly up, or a terrorist nuke explodes, or China decides it wants Taiwan, or Iran\u2019s ayatollahs act to expedite Allah\u2019s plan for the return of the 12th Imam.\n\nAs the saying goes, history doesn\u2019t always repeat itself. Sometimes, it just yells, \u201cI told you so, you idiot!\u201d and belts you with a club.\n\nI fear history is winding up a hefty backswing as 2016 leaves the starting gate, and neither of the two leading candidates is anywhere close to being capable of handling the job they\u2019re seeking.\n\nIndeed, no single person, or even political party, can \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nDo you want to know who can? Go to your bathroom and look in the mirror. You\u2019ll see the only solution there is.\n\nM.D. Harmon, a retired journalist and military officer, is a freelance writer and speaker.
