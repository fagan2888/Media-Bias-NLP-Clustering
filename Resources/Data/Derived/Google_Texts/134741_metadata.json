No matter who was on the court for the Spurs.\n\n\u201cWe are the only team in the NBA to beat Golden State and San Antonio (in the same season), which is kind of amazing,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they rested most of their starters, we still beat them.\u201d\n\nA bit later in the press conference\u2026 \u201cI give our guys credit; they did a great job of getting on track tonight. The last three games we got away from who we are and to play this way against San Antonio couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt the Nuggets have put together some of the weirdest notes and stats this season, both good and bad. Shake it all out and it displays the up-and-down characteristics of a team still learning how to win consistently, and beyond that, adhere to the detailed items each night that go into winning games.\n\n\u2013 As Malone mentioned, they are the only team to date to have beaten both Golden State and San Antonio this season.\n\n\u2013 The season in W/L streaks: 5-5, then 6-18, then 11-14, then 10-10 (through Friday\u2019s game).\n\n\u2013 15-25 on the road, which is an improvement over last season\u2019s road record.\n\n\u2013 18-22 at home, which means they can only tie last season\u2019s home record.\n\n\u2013 13-32 vs. playoff teams, better than last season\u2019s 11-34.\n\n\u2013 13-29 vs. +.500 teams; 20-18 vs. sub .500 teams.\n\n\u2013 15-15 vs. the East (11-19 last season).\n\n\u2013 18-32 vs. West, one game off of last season\u2019s 19 wins vs. West opponents.\n\n\u2013 22-32 (.407) pre-All Star.\n\n\u2013 11-15 (.423) post-All Star.\n\n\u2013 30-24 when scoring over 100 points.\n\n\u2013 3-23 when scoring under 100 points.\n\n\u2013 By month: 1-1 (October), 5-11 (November), 6-9 (December), 6-9 (January), 5-7 (February), 9-8 (March), 1-2 (April).\n\nAs far as pairing Nurkic and Jokic together, this is how the numbers shook out: They combined for 29 points and 24 rebounds. Nurkic scored a career-high 21 points. The duo spent 27 minutes on the court at the same time and the Nuggets were good when they were on it.\n\nDenver scored 57 points in that time and were a plus-17 with the Nurkic/Jokic combo on the court, which is more important to Malone when he evaluates their play. San Antonio scored just 40 points when the duo was on the court and shot just 32.6 percent from the field. The Nuggets grabbed 31 rebounds when they were on the court, good for fourth-most of any of the team\u2019s two-man combos on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI loved it. It was a really good look,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThe thing about having them together on the floor, they are both very skilled, they both play away from the basket with their back to the basket, they\u2019re very good passers and they make everyone around them better. Defensively, Nurkic has a great presence. Nikola has length. I was really encouraged by what I saw.\u201d\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "So what's the value in Friday's 102-98 win over San Antonio?
