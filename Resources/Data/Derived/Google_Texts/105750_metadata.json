These are the creators. The innovators. They rarely stop thinking. The only question is: What are they thinking about?\n\nIn a normal market, the entrepreneurs wake up every morning and ask themselves: How can I make costs lower, quality higher, and access to my product better today?\n\nBut in a bureaucratic system \u2013 where revenues are determined not by customer satisfaction, but by complicated payment formulas \u2013 they tend to wake up and ask: How can I get more money out of the payment formulas today?\n\nIn the Medicare Advantage program you can find both types of entrepreneurship.\n\nImagine that UnitedHealth care or Humana or Cigna discovered away to cut health care costs in half \u2013 with no reduction in quality or in access to care. The stock price of the company that made this discovery would go through the roof. Right? Not quite. Under rules imposed by the Obama administration, the company would be forced to give virtually all of its newfound profit back to Medicare.\n\nHere\u2019s why. Under the \u201cMedical Loss Ratio\u201d requirement, a health plan is required to spend at least 85 percent of its premium income on health care. Let\u2019s say a health plan was doing that. After the discovery of a way to cut those costs in half, it would be spending only 42.5 percent of premium income on health care. Not only would the health plan be forced to give all of its savings back to Medicare, it could actually be fined and kicked out of the Medicare Advantage program for spending so little!\n\nWith those incentives in place, do you think any of the MA plans are going to be discovering ways to realize huge cost savings anytime soon?\n\nEntrepreneurs Cut Costs\n\nHere is what the heath plans are doing instead. Increasingly, they are contracting with independent doctor associations, typically managed by entrepreneurs. There is no medical loss ratio rule governing these entities. If they find a way to cut health care costs in half they can take the savings right to the bank. Not only that, they can actually share the savings with the health plan that farmed out the business to them \u2013 and Medicare doesn\u2019t get any of that.\n\nIn other words, if Cigna finds a way to cuts health care costs in half and does so, it has to give all the profit back to Medicare. But if Cigna contracts with a doctor association that cuts costs in half, nothing is returned to Medicare. Moreover, nothing is returned to Medicare even if the doctor\u2019s group shares the profits 50/50 with Cigna.\n\nNow with those incentives in place, where do you think entrepreneurs are finding ways to cut costs?\n\nIndependent doctor associations running Medicare Advantage plans are the only place in all of Medicare were you can find significant cost control, significant quality improvement, and better access to care. Everything else has been a failure.\n\nWhat about Accountable Care Organizations? Even Zeke Emanuel, the White House doctor and early cheerleader who helped give us ACOs, now admits they are not controlling costs.\n\nWhat about the millions of dollars that have been spent on pilot programs and demonstrations projects in an effort to find better ways of practicing medicine? Three separate Congressional Budget Office reports have concluded that none of this is working, or at least not working very well.\n\nWhat about pay for performance, especially penalizing hospitals for their readmissions? Turns out that more than two-thirds of the improvement is the result of gaming the system \u2013 hospitals classifying return trips as \u201cobservation\u201d stays and \u201cemergency room visits\u201d rather than \u201creadmissions.\u201d\n\nJohn Goodman (johngoodman@goodmaninstitute.org) is a senior fellow at the Independent Institute.
