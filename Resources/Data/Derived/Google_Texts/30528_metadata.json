Apparently, no one told that to One Direction, whose five members have been spending the better part of the past week shuttling to Vegas after a three-night residency at Los Angeles\u2019 Rose Bowl. A long week of celebrating (Niall Horan turned 21 at midnight on Sept. 13) and mysterious injuries (Liam Payne sported a bandaged hand) culminated in 1D\u2019s opening performance at the iHeartRadio Music Festival\u2019s second and final night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Payne himself said shortly after the band performed its newly minted signature hit \u201cStory Of My Life,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for too long. We lost all our money, it\u2019s all gone. Harry\u2019s not old enough to be here -- we need someone to escort him back.\u201d\n\nEd Sheeran Brings Out Macklemore | Calvin Harris Plays 'Blame' | PHOTOS: iHeartRadio 2014\n\nPayne\u2019s unexplained hand mishap aside, One Direction\u2019s 15-minute set was an abbreviated preview of its top-grossing Where We Are summer stadium tour, complete with videos of the band globe-trotting the many markets they\u2019ve traveled via green screen. They even kicked off with their perpetual tour-opener \u201cMidnight Memories,\u201d an appropriately stadium-sized guitar stomper, with miniature bursts of fireworks scattered throughout.\n\n\n\nAnd though the band announced the late September release of next single \u201cSteal My Girl,\u201d a preview of November\u2019s Four album, and recently released another new track \u201cFireproof\u201d for 24 hours, 1D kept things strictly to the hits. That included last summer\u2019s rousing \u201cBest Song Ever\u201d and debut hit \u201cWhat Makes You Beautiful,\u201d which brought out the sentimentalist in Payne. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together as a band now just over four years, and on behalf of all the boys, thank you, iHeart, for knowing all the words and singing along,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Many frequent visitors to Vegas say that 48 hours is more than enough time for a trip to Sin City.
