But beyond any specific policy, Republican voters\u2019 No. 1 wish was for cooperation between the warring tribes of Washington, where gridlock drove much of the voter backlash at the polls this year.\n\n\u201cI want to see cooperation and getting things done,\u201d said Howard Urband, 83, of Lakewood, Colo., who voted for Cory Gardner, the Republican whose win over Senator Mark Udall helped flip the chamber. \u201cThings are hanging fire that haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201d\n\nIn a pre-election poll by Gallup that asked voters the most important thing they wanted from their representatives in Congress, the second-most-cited answer was for politicians to work together to end gridlock. (No. 1 was listening to the people.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike the Republicans of 1994, who won a House majority by uniting behind the Contract With America, or the Tea Party wave of 2010, which sought to cut government and the deficit, the Republican wave of 2014 was not stirred by candidates with a to-do list.\n\nOn Wednesday, in a news conference at the White House, Mr. Obama threw the ball into the court of the new congressional majorities. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to them putting forward a very specific agenda in terms of what they\u2019d like to accomplish,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Tony Reiss, who works in public relations in Sioux Falls, S.D., had his way, completing the Keystone XL pipeline \u2014 which would carry Canadian oil to the Gulf of Mexico, running through South Dakota on the way \u2014 would be a top priority. \u201cA lot of county officials and schools are wanting it for better tax revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe absolutely need Keystone.\u201d\n\nIn West Virginia \u2014 where Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, won an open Senate seat long held by a Democrat \u2014 Tom Hannigan, 57, a financial adviser in Charleston, called on Congress to stop environmental regulations that he said cost jobs.\n\n\u201cThey have to do something with the E.P.A.,\u201d he said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nImmigration reform was also on voters\u2019 minds, though there was disagreement over whether to deport workers who are in the country illegally or offer them a path to legal status. Geography seemed to influence views.\n\n\u201cIn this state, we\u2019ve got a whole lot of Hispanics,\u201d said Mr. Urband of Colorado. \u201cThey\u2019re illegal, but their children were born here. And there\u2019s no sense in talking about deporting people. That\u2019s stupid. I mean, they\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe need to have a rational route to citizenship and that sort of thing. Which, maybe, can come. I think.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot so Brad Gillian, 50, a construction engineer for a wireless company who lives in Putnam County, W.Va. \u201cHell, no, we shouldn\u2019t have amnesty for illegal immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is getting out of hand.\u201d He urged Congress to erect a border fence \u201cand use it.\u201d\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act, there was more unanimity. Although some Republicans said they would keep parts of it, like the provision that forbids discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, there was strong support for a broad repeal.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFix it,\u201d said Annette Stovall of North Little Rock, Ark. \u201cI mean, I know they can\u2019t roll it back. There\u2019s maybe one or two good items in it, but over all, just to toss a blanket out there to basically try to cover everybody is impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need it completely repealed,\u201d said Dr. Maria Stys, a cardiologist in Sioux Falls who immigrated from Poland in 1992. She said that in Poland, patients had few choices about doctors and often faced long waits for treatment. \u201cWe need competitive health care,\u201d she said, adding that under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cI had a flashback that I was going back to what I was running from.\u201d\n\nIn Raleigh, N.C., Chris Carlino, 26, a commercial real estate investor who voted for Thom Tillis to replace Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat, said he wanted Republicans to repeal the health care law. \u201cYoung people who go out and get jobs are fiscally conservative, but more socially open-minded than the boomers,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Republican voters did not have a wish list for Congress. They expressed anger at the president and said they wanted the new Senate majority to change the direction of the country, a version of the free-floating insecurity that drove many voters on Election Day even as economic indicators rose.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the Republicans do as long as they do something,\u201d said Jimmy Kyzer, 75, who was at a produce market in Sherwood, Ark. \u201cBut get rid of what we\u2019ve got in there.\u201d Pressed for his ideal Republican agenda, he said, \u201cWhatever it takes to get this country back on its feet, and it\u2019s going to take a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to cut him off,\u201d Mr. Kyzer said, referring to the president. \u201cJust like dropping the curtain. Cut it off. Get rid of him and everything he\u2019s got in mind to do. And if they can do that in this country, all of the people will go back to work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was a sense, though, that the voters who gave Republicans a great victory this week would not wait forever for results.\n\nRon Moses, 65, a small-business owner from a Denver suburb who voted for Mr. Gardner, said he hoped for a new birth of cooperation in Washington. It is in the congressional majority\u2019s best interest, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are going to be up for re-election in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are at risk of losing the Senate again in two years. I think they recognize that they\u2019re going to have a two-year window, and the only administration they\u2019re going to have to work with is the Obama administration.\u201d", "article_metadata":
