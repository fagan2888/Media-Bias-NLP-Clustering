But how each one of the front-runners addresses coverage and cost is critical.\n\nMost of our out-of-control health care spending is unseen by the average voter.\n\nAll too often, health care policy is determined in an ivory tower where cost issues aren\u2019t meaningfully addressed. It\u2019s crucial to do so, however, because our budgetary problems in government stem largely from an unfettered rise in health care costs, which have trickled down to the larger economy.\n\nMany of my own peers need to be reminded that it\u2019s not Department of Defense costs have that blown up our budget deficit \u2014 it is health care. Medicare and Medicaid spending are going up at a radical rate compared to inflation, government-stated or not.\n\nHow bad is this?\n\nDuring fiscal year 2005, for example, we spent a total of $652 billion on Medicare and Medicaid combined. In fiscal year 2015, we spent a total of $1.297 trillion, or close to double \u2014 10 years later.\n\nThis was not mostly centered on Medicare \u2014 meaning, spending on retirees. It was across-the-board spending for all age groups served. Medicaid went from $182 billion to $349 billion, which was a growth rate that far exceeded inflation.\n\nIt is interesting, however, that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton is playing entirely to their base on health care issues.\n\n\n\nTrump on Health Care\n\nDonald Trump has made it clear that he strongly supports a compassionate health care system. \u201cYou can call it whatever you want. We\u2019re going to take care of people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has also pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare with a system based on free-market principles such as open competition by providers and insurers. The price transparency he espouses has already led to lower prices in places like the Surgery Center of Oklahoma. He believes nationwide implementation would result in marked cost savings.\n\nAs with most Democrats, Clinton does not include as a health care \u201ccost\u201d what the government gives away in \u201cfree stuff\u201d paid for by our tax dollars.\n\nAnother key cost-saving measure for Trump is lowering drug costs. He is pushing for Americans to pay the lowest negotiated rate that any of the other 33 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development pay. This is crucial \u2014 and if it happens, it should result in hundreds of billions of dollars in savings to federal and state budgets as well as consumers and private insurers, if enacted within a year.\n\nClinton on Health Care\n\nHillary Clinton strongly defends Obamacare, but rejects the holy grail of her left-wing critics who are demanding a government-run, single-payer system. The closest she has come is her pledge to support a \u201cpublic option\u201d as part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which she has said she will make even more generous than it is today. That includes covering what she deftly refers to as \u201cfamilies, regardless of immigration status.\u201d\n\nShe would allow illegal aliens to \u201cbuy into\u201d the ACA exchanges. It is unclear whether that means they would also get the tax credit subsidies funded with the income taxes paid by citizens and others residing lawfully in the United States.\n\nIf we are not going to adopt \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d as Bernie Sanders calls it, and we\u2019re not going to leave people completely on their own \u2014 what are the real and meaningful differences between Trump and Clinton?\n\nIt Comes Down to Money\n\nWhen you cut through the rhetoric, there is only one real difference \u2014 and it comes down to costs. Actually, it comes down to how costs are defined, as well as how much pharmaceutical costs will continue to drain our health care dollar.\n\nIn essence, Clinton seems to define health care \"costs\" as what we all pay directly for health care at the point of purchase \u2014 the cash that actually comes out of our pockets, or doesn't come out of our pockets (for those who receive largely or fully subsidized government health care through Medicare or Medicaid). Yes, even Medicare is largely a freebie \u2014 a welfare program.\n\nThe Medicare premiums and taxes paid by workers and their employers cover only about 30 percent of the program's real costs.\n\nMedicare premiums and taxes paid by workers and their employers cover only about 30 percent of the program's real costs.\n\nAs with most Democrats, Clinton does not include as a health care \"cost\" what the government gives away in \"free stuff\" paid for by our tax dollars. She also doesn't seem to consider it a \"cost\" of health care if your employer has to pay more for your health insurance package \u2014 silently taking the same dollars out of your paycheck, leaving you with stagnant wages or reduced employment opportunities. As with most other \"progressive\" economic policies, Clinton and other Democrats focus only on what is \"seen\" \u2013 not on the \"unseen.\"\n\nShe does give lip service to drug costs, but suggests a \"fig leaf\" \u2014 let Medicare \"negotiate drug prices.\" But the American pharmaceutical industry and Congress are too corrupt to make negotiation work.\n\nWe need a simple rule to apply to all Americans no matter what insurance they have. No one can charge Americans more for any prescription drug than the lowest price charged in any developed country, as Trump has espoused.\n\nAs with the famous iceberg that sunk the Titanic, most of our out-of-control health care spending is unseen by the average voter, even by \"high information\" voters.\n\nThe real costs are still there under the surface. Even if your personal taxes don't immediately go up, they show up in higher deficits and increased taxes on American businesses that reduce our economic growth, cash wages, job opportunities, and global competitiveness.\n\nDr. Ramin Oskoui, a cardiologist in the Washington, D.C., area, is CEO of Foxhall Cardiology PC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No viable presidential candidate would adopt a platform that doesn't call for enhancing the quality or quantity of medical care in the United States.\u00a0But h", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LifeZette", "description": "No viable presidential candidate would adopt a platform that doesn\u2019t call for enhancing the quality or quantity of medical care in the United States.\u00a0But how each one of the front-runners addresses coverage and cost is critical.
