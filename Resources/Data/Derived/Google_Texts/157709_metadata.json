Mike Lee (R-Utah) and others at the \u201cFix Up DC\u201d Day of Service rally on Capitol Hill, co-sponsored by FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots.\n\nAttendees were asked by organizers to bring their \u201crakes, gloves, and trash bags\u201d to pick up trash that has gone uncollected on the Mall since the government shutdown began on October 1.\n\nThe rally was symbolic of the American people working for their country from the bottom up in their communities rather than from the top down to make things work, FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe said.\n\nAttendees came from as far away as Washington state and Florida. Reps. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and Steve King (R-Iowa), who have been big names in the fight against Obamacare also attended but did not speak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I think it\u2019s an honor to be here at the Mall and to serve our country,\u201d Beck told Red Alert Politics in an exclusive comment. \u201cBeyond that I think that Republicans are on the verge of implosion because they have given up on all of their principles and values except for a few.\u201d\n\nBeck had particularly tough language during his earlier speech for Senate Minority Whip Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). The senator battled with FreedomWorks recently, accusing the group of engaging in \u201cRepublican on Republican violence \u2026 to raise money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a virtual one-party system,\u201d Beck said during his earlier speech at the rally, holding up Cornyn\u2019s cooperation with Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada) to pass a bill paying death benefits to families of fallen military service members as an example of his point.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid named it the \u2018John Cornyn bill,\u2019\u201d Beck continued. \u201cSince when do Harry Reid and the Democrats give credit for something that important to a Republican when it\u2019s a one-party system. They\u2019re gaming the system, but it\u2019s all coming undone.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats pushed to force a vote on a Senate-passed bill to reopen the government without concessions to Republican demands on Obamacare at the same time the tea partiers were holding their rally. Several Republican House members in attendance left the rally to cast their votes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change our system of laws and give the government back to you the people who own it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAt the end of the day we see that nothing has really changed in the last couple of centuries \u2013 at least in the sense that we were subject to a large, distant national government.\n\n\u201cOne that taxes us too much. One that regulates us oppressively. One that operates so far from the people that it\u2019s slow to respond to their needs.\u201d\n\nLee joked that the framers of the Constitution had given Congress many powers including the power to back state-sanctioned piracy on the high seas, but regulating health care was not among those powers. The senator described the closure of open-air monuments and memorials such as those on the Mall during the government shutdown as \u201cpolitical warfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of these days \u2026 I\u2019m going to be a pirate and get all of you to join me,\u201d Lee said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A crowd of several hundred tea partiers braved a soggy Saturday morning in Washington, D.C. to hear talk show host Glenn Beck, Sen.
