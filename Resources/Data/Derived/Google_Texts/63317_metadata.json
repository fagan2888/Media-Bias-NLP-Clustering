I told the guys just to get some work in if they want,\u201d Kerr said, unable to stop himself from smiling before he got to the end of the sentence.\n\nAmong those who won\u2019t be laughing is the Warriors\u2019 next opponent, which will have to figure out how to stop Stephen Curry and Co. from scoring in bunches, as they did in their convincing four-game sweep of burgeoning young All-Star Anthony Davis and the upstart New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nNow Golden State awaits the winner of the Memphis-Portland matchup. Memphis leads the series 3-0.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Warriors came through with their most complete performance of the first-round, building a 13-point lead at halftime, widening it to 24 late in the third quarter and squelching the Pelicans\u2019 desperate, last-gasp bid in the fourth quarter, 109-98.\n\nCurry scored against anyone the Pelicans sent out to guard him, including 6-foot-10 Anthony Davis, in the clinching game. He also hit 6 of 8 3s he put up to finish with 39 points.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t scoring, he had plenty of help from Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\n\nCurry averaged 33.8 points during the series, while Thompson averaged 25 points and Green, 15.8.\n\n\u201cYou play great defense and all of a sudden it looks like they\u2019re throwing up a shot, but it goes in,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. Hats off to them. They made incredible shots through the course of the series. We tried our best to stay attached to them, but they did a great job. Some of it was us and some of it was them hitting tough shots.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Bogut made it hard on any Pelican player trying to score inside, blocking eight shots in the series and altering many more.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re built to win a championship. They\u2019re probably the most complete team that we faced, them and San Antonio,\u201d Pelicans coach Monty Williams said. \u201cI had to watch games that they lost just to see what teams did against them because you just don\u2019t see it when they\u2019re winning games. You\u2019re like, \u2018Where\u2019s the weakness?\u2019 So to me, they just don\u2019t have many weaknesses, if any. Obviously they\u2019re well coached and they have great players.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Warriors confident after sweep of Pelicans", "title": "Warriors confident after sweep of Pelicans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Warriors confident after sweep of Pelicans", "title": "Warriors confident after sweep of Pelicans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/26/warriors_confident_after_sweep_of_pelicans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/warriors-pelicans-basketball.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Warriors confident after sweep of Pelicans", "title": "Warriors confident after sweep of Pelicans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/warriors-pelicans-basketball.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brett Martel", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce906\"", "article_summary": "Curry scored against anyone the Pelicans sent out to guard him, including 6-foot-10 Anthony Davis, in the clinching game.\nThey\u2019re probably the most complete team that we faced, them and San Antonio,\u201d Pelicans coach Monty Williams said.\nCurry averaged 33.8 points during the series, while Thompson averaged 25 points and Green, 15.8.\nAmong those who won\u2019t be laughing is the Warriors\u2019 next opponent, which will have to figure out how to stop Stephen Curry and Co. from scoring in bunches, as they did in their convincing four-game sweep of burgeoning young All-Star Anthony Davis and the upstart New Orleans Pelicans.\n\u201cYou play great defense and all of a sudden it looks like they\u2019re throwing up a shot, but it goes in,\u201d Davis said."}
