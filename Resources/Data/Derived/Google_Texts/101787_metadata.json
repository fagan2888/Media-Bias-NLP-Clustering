In the digital age, using laptops, or \u201cnotebooks,\u201d to transcribe lectures has become common practice, but can typing electronic, copious notes be harmful to academic performance? According to a recent study in a forthcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science, using pen and paper, not laptops, to take notes boosts memory and the ability to retain and understand concepts.\n\nIn this world there are two types of people: those who insist on handwriting and those who insist on typing to take notes. Note-taking is a practical way to acquire and retain information while saving time and effort. However, with the advancement in modern technology, note-taking is changing, and for many, brings up the question over which medium to use to take notes.\n\nThose who handwrite notes claim it provides flexibility and control, with the ability to include various formats and annotations often limited by word processing formats. Typing notes, however, eliminates the possibility of losing the notes and handouts while providing organization and clear legibility. As the trend of bringing laptops to class continually increases \u2014 with more than 50 percent of college students reporting use in class at least once a week \u2014 researchers want to see if this positively or negatively affects cognitive processing, compared to handwriting notes.\n\nTo explore which medium is beneficial for note-taking, two psychological scientists, Pam Mueller of Princeton and Daniel Oppenheimer, a team of researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, decided to test the effects handwriting or typing notes had on students\u2019 learning abilities in a series of two experiments.\n\nIn the first study, a cohort of college students were asked to listen to the same lectures and employ their usual note-taking strategy to transcribe important information. The participants were then tested on the material covered in the lecture half an hour later. Mueller and Oppenheimer were interested in observing the students\u2019 ability to recall facts and concepts, providing a deeper understanding of the topic.\n\nThe findings revealed while both groups memorized the same number of facts from the lectures, the laptop users performed far worse when they were tested on ideas. \u201cThe students using laptops were in fact more likely to take copious notes, which can be beneficial to learning,\u201d the Association for Psychological Science (APS) reported. \u201cBut they were also more likely to take verbatim notes, and this 'mindless transcription' appeared to cancel out the benefits.\u201d\n\nThe first experiment tested both groups of note-takers exactly half an hour after the lecture, which left them without the opportunity to review. The psychological scientists decided to explore this concept further and conducted a second experiment in which these students would be given a week to review for the exam. The participants would be tested on simple facts as well as concepts, inferences, and applications of the material.\n\nEven after a week of review, the students who took notes in longhand were found to do significantly better than the other students in the experiment, including the fleet typists \u2014 those who transcribed the lectures. The researchers were surprised to find that even after some of the laptop users were explicitly told to not transcribe the lectures word-for-word, they still typed verbatim notes, which lead to a lower quality of learning. \u201cApparently there is something about typing that leads to mindless processing. And there is something about ink and paper that prompts students to go beyond merely hearing and recording new information\u2026\u201d according to the APS blog post.\n\nThe results of the two experiments suggest that taking notes with a pen and paper, rather than a laptop, leads to higher quality learning, as writing is a better strategy to store and internalize ideas in the long haul. Writing by hand strengthens the learning process, while typing can impair it. A similar study published in Intech found writing by hand allows the brain to receive feedback from a person\u2019s motor actions, and this specific feedback is different than those received when touching and typing on a keyboard. The movements involved when handwriting, \u201cleave a motor memory in the sensorimotor part of the brain,\u201d which helps the person recognize letters and establish a connection between reading and writing. The researchers believe since writing by hand takes longer than typing on a keyboard, the temporal aspect may influence the learning process.\n\nOverall, it seems those who type their notes may potentially be at risk for \u201cmindless processing.\u201d The old fashioned note taking method of pen and paper boosts memory and the ability to understand concepts and facts. Perhaps pen and paper will become more prevalent in college classrooms again, as laptops may be given the boot when it comes to enhancing cognitive processes.\n\nSources:\n\nWray Herbert.
