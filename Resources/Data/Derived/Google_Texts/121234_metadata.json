The legislation gives public school districts freedom to use innovative methods outside of state regulations, much like charter schools.\n\nDistricts of Innovation are still under regulatory authority of the State Board of Education and must meet the same achievement requirements as other school districts.\n\nCorinth\u2019s plan, called \u201cForward First,\u201d was approved by the State Board of Education Thursday during the board\u2019s meeting.\n\nGulfport School District and Vicksburg-Warren School District were approved at the meeting.\n\nThe plan will build on the district\u2019s eMerge initiative, which was introduced three years ago.\n\nAs part of eMerge, the district introduced the Cambridge International Program and partnered with Alcorn and Prentiss county schools in the creation of an Early Learning Collaborative for pre-kindergarten-aged children.\n\nThe Cambridge International Program provides curriculum in various subjects with a focus on promoting critical thinking, in-depth analysis and strong writing skills.\n\nAt the end of each course, students take a rigorous Cambridge Exam.\n\n\u201cForward First\u201d proposes adopting a modified school calendar where students attend quarters and have three-week breaks between them.\n\nDuring those three-week breaks, the district will host remediation enrichment sessions for students who need extra help.\n\nThe district has developed a set of courses with Northeast Mississippi Community College that would allow students in grades 10-12 to earn up to 33 hours prior to leaving Corinth High School.\n\nChildress hopes to allow students to earn course credit by demonstrated mastery.\n\nA wider variety of diploma options are another part of the district\u2019s plan.\n\nAll of the district\u2019s libraries will become \u201cdigital communication learning centers\u201d for a more creative and collaborative environment with technology available for students to use.\n\nChildress said the school\u2019s libraries should reflect the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIt should be a different place,\u201d Childress said. \u201cWe\u2019re buying a lot of books that are never checked out and might not ever get checked out.\u201d\n\nA Center for Innovation will be created, possibly from an old school building, Childress said. The facility will house career tech programs and other spaces.\n\nMore blended and experiential learning will be implemented in kindergarten through sixth-grade classes.\n\nThe plan includes the creation of a new accountability system and replacing the Mississippi Assessment Program, the current state test, with Cambridge International Exams.\n\nChildress said Corinth teachers currently keep up with both sets of standards and tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for our teachers to teach one program and do what they need to do in teaching standards,\u201d Childress said.\n\nCompensation for teachers will also change.\n\nChildress said the district is looking at moving to a differentiated career pathways and performance incentives model.\n\nIn this model, the district would offer effective teachers a performance-based retention bonus and teachers\u2019 roles and salaries would be determined by which career pathway they are in \u2013 professional teacher or master teacher.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend the time and effort to train those teachers you want to retain them if they\u2019re effective,\u201d Childress said.\n\nSome things will be implemented in the upcoming 2016-17 school year, while others will have to be phased in over time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of different pieces in place, but Districts of Innovation allowed us to pull it together into one package,\u201d Childress said. \u201cWe think we have an aggressive plan, and we think we can make a difference in the lives of children.\u201d\n\nemma.crawford@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @emcrawfordkent", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Emma Crawford Kent Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Corinth School District will be the first public school district in Northeast Mississippi to become a District of Innovation.
