The Tigers finished the regular season 16-3. ( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )\n\nThen-senior Neiko Paolino during the 2015 Ca\u00f1on City baseball season.

Coach Tim Ritter and his baseball crew rolled with few hiccups.\n\nThe reason, though, was that the Tigers played very few competitive teams. It didn't take the Colorado Springs Metro League newcomers long to see why not much love is given to the CSML come playoff seeding time.\n\nThe Tigers opened the season with 17-0 and 12-0 victories against league foe Woodland Park. It was only a sign of things to come. Ca\u00f1on City won its league games by a combined score of 165-29, and the Woodland Park team they demolished wasn't even near the bottom of the league standings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We know they're a team that we're better than ... and it's a hard game to get up for to be perfectly honest,\" Ritter after they beat the Mitchell Marauders 13-3 during the season. \"I'm not sure we were as sharp as we should've been.\"\n\nAsk anyone who coached, or played for, the team and they'll quickly tell you that the weak schedule didn't help the team at all. In regular-season, non-league games, Ca\u00f1on City was 2-3 with losses to No. 14 Pueblo East, No. 2 Montrose and a Centaurus team that missed the playoffs.\n\nAs a result of the shiny but hollow 16-3 regular season, the Tigers drew a No. 18 seed in the 32-team playoffs. That pitted them against the defending state champion Green Mountain Rams that bolstered the fourth best pitching staff in the state.\n\nThe Tigers lost 8-7 in extra innings. (The Rams won six straight one-run games in the playoffs before winning the state title game 4-0 to repeat as champions.)\n\nBrandon Hopper: 719-276-7644, hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29309105/no-7-tigers-post-16-3-record-before", "modificationDate": "2015-12-25T09:23:26-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/1224/20151224__25drTOP10-sports-7~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "The Tigers had very little resistance in last year's regular season.
