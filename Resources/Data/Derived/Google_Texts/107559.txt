Critics of Obamacare who claim the law may end up screwing the people it aims to help might turn out to be right.

In a funny coincidence, the telephone number designed to assist people looking for more information on the health care law can actually be made out to spell an abrasive insult.

That’s because the 1-800-318-2596 Obamacare hotline created by the White House nearly spells out 1-800-F1--KYO on a telephone keypad.

The news was first reported by Hot Air, a conservative news website.

Callers, however, won’t actually reach the Obamacare hotline simply by dialing 1-800-F1--KYO, because the “1” on keypads in the U.S. doesn’t correspond to any letters. The unfortunate coincidence only exists as a result of the letter-less “1” falling between the “3” (F) and the “8” (U) in the phone number.

But for those in search of something racier than just information on the new law, another option that closely resembles the hotline may provide what they’re looking for.

Dialing the similar 1-800-F--KYOU (1-800-382-5968), without the letter-less “1” and with another “8” (at the end), connects callers with a sex hotline.

The President’s new health care law has come under great criticism in the weeks leading up to its partial implementation on Tuesday. House Republicans have insisted that any resolution to keep the federal government funded must be tied to measures that defund or delay Obamacare, which they say will harm the economy.

The federal health exchanges created by the law nevertheless went into effect Tuesday. But their debut was plagued nationwide by computer and log-in glitches as well as crippling processing delays, after the websites set up for insurance seekers couldn’t handle the overwhelming demand.
