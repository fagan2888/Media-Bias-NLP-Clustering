The Short Story:

· Sophomore guard Marcus Foster led three Wildcats in double figures with 17 points, as Kansas State outlasted Washburn, 68-56, in its lone exhibition game before 12,391 fans at Bramlage Coliseum on Sunday afternoon.

· Juniors Justin Edwards (14) and Stephen Hurt (12) also scored in double figures for K-State.

· K-State played Sunday’s exhibition without four players due to injury, including senior Nino Williams, junior D.J. Johnson, sophomore Wesley Iwundu and freshman Malek Harris.

How It Happened:

· The Wildcats came out the gate firing, opening the game on a 12-1 run. Foster and Nigel Johnson combined for three 3-pointers, while senior Thomas Gipson and Edwards pitched in a free throw and layup, respectively. Also starting for the ‘Cats was Jevon Thomas, who racked up the Wildcats’ first five assists of the game – he would go onto finish with a game-high eight dimes on the afternoon.

· Back-and-forth action soon followed with the Ichabods pulling to within three, 14-11, at the 10:45 mark. The ‘Cats would respond though, sparking a 10-0 run thanks to contributions from Foster, Edwards, Johnson and Gipson. The run helped K-State to a 32-22 lead at halftime.

· Scoring only five points in the first six minutes of the second half, newcomers Tre Harris and Hurt along with Johnson extended K-State’s lead to 45-32 with just under 12 minutes left in the game. Hurt, who transferred from Northwest Florida Junior College last year, dazzled in his debut, finishing the afternoon with 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting to go along with three rebounds and two blocks.

· From there, the Ichabods would never get closer than eight points with K-State matching Washburn basket-for-basket. In fact, after extending their lead to 54-44 with 6:09 remaining thanks to an Edwards’ layup, the Wildcats closed out the game scoring 14 points to Washburn’s 12.

Beyond the Boxscore:

· K-State is now 56-18 (.756) all-time in exhibition play, including 38-9 at Bramlage Coliseum.

· The Wildcats have now won 16 consecutive exhibition games dating back to 2004.

· K-State is 4-0 in exhibition play under head coach Bruce Weber.

· K-State is now 5-0 vs. Washburn in exhibition play.

· In addition to Edwards and Hurt, three other players made their first appearances in a Wildcat uniform, including sophomore Brandon Bolden and freshmen Tre Harris and Mason Schoen.

Quotable:

· “We cannot have as many turnovers,” said head coach Bruce Weber on where the team needs to get better heading into Friday’s opener. “We have to rebound better, and just to make an improvement. We had some good possessions. I have talked with the guys about maturity all along. Part of maturity is when you get up 10, or 12, now you get a couple of stops and you come down and work them, break the game open. Every time we got up 10 or 12, I thought we tried to make plays on our own. Then we did not get back to the intensity on defense that kept allowing them back in the game. I hope we get better at that.”
