He patiently used the pig whip to try to goad his pig toward the orange cone at the other end of the enclosure, but the pig instead began rooting in the dirt at the edge of the pen.\n\nIt took 1 minute and 56 seconds for Taylor to successfully nudge the pig forward, around the cone and back to the gate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we went with corn and beans instead of hogs,\u201d Taylor said later, referring to his family\u2019s farm in rural Shawnee County.\n\nHonorary 4-H Queen Diana Hutchison did much better, urging her pig through the ordeal in just 38 seconds.\n\nHutchison said her kids were involved in 4-H and showed pigs \u2014 possibly, she admitted, giving her an edge.\n\n\u201cI knew a bit about how it acts or won\u2019t act,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just the luck of the draw. If it doesn\u2019t want to move, you\u2019re not moving it.\u201d\n\nRecently crowned 4-H Queen Chelsey Johnston learned that too. Her first attempt stalled, and the second pig she tried to show also refused to cooperate.\n\n4-H King Scott Rak did better, coming in a close second to Hutchison at just 42 seconds. Rak, 16, shows dogs as a member of the Deer Trail 4-H Club, and also participates in painting, photography and public speaking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been around pigs,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers participating in the show were The Topeka Capital-Journal\u2019s Ellen Fike, who finished in 1:53; Shawnee County Register of Deeds Becky Nioce, at 1:19; and Honorary 4-H King Charlene Patton, at 1:07.\n\nBlythe, who owns three of the pigs used in the show, said they tend to behave better when he shows them.\n\n\u201cI got champion with my York(shire) and my Hamp(shire), reserve champion with my other York, and third overall,\u201d he said.\n\nBlythe is a member of the Dover 4-H Club.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Samantha Foster", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Twelve-year-old Will Blythe walked quickly beside one of his prize pigs Saturday afternoon, tapping its sides gently with a pig whip as he guided it down to the end of the pen in Domer Livestock Arena and back.", "title": "Local celebrities take a turn at showing swine at county fair", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-07-26/local-celebrities-take-turn-showing-swine-county-fair", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13566941.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Twelve-year-old Will Blythe walked quickly beside one of his prize pigs Saturday afternoon, tapping its sides gently with a pig whip as he guided it down to the end of the pen in Domer Livestock Arena and back.But as a handful of local celebrities found out after Blythe\u2019s demonstration at the start of the Shawnee County Fair\u2019s celebrity swine show, a no-stakes contest, pigs have minds of their own."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd122\"", "article_summary": "Blythe, who owns three of the pigs used in the show, said they tend to behave better when he shows them.\nBut as a handful of local celebrities found out after Blythe\u2019s demonstration at the start of the Shawnee County Fair\u2019s celebrity swine show, a no-stakes contest, pigs have minds of their own.\nIt took 1 minute and 56 seconds for Taylor to successfully nudge the pig forward, around the cone and back to the gate.\nHonorary 4-H Queen Diana Hutchison did much better, urging her pig through the ordeal in just 38 seconds.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we went with corn and beans instead of hogs,\u201d Taylor said later, referring to his family\u2019s farm in rural Shawnee County."}
