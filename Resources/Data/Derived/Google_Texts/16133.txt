The government’s health insurance website for the Affordable Care Act, HealthCare.gov, is passing along consumer info to outside firms that focus on advertising and analyzing data for performance and marketing, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.

When a user applies for coverage on the website, outside data firms are sent information about the person, including age, income, zip code, smoking habits, pregnancy status, and more.

The information can also include a computer’s IP address, which could lead to identifying a person’s name or address. It’s not clear what other information may be accessible.

The AP report came as President Obama planned to announce new initiative during Tuesday’s State of the Union address to protect personal data online against hackers.

The government said the information being disseminated by HealthCare.gov is being used to analyze and improve the consumer experience, and outside firms are not allowed to use the data for their own interests. Third parties that are able to access the data include Google, Twitter, and many online advertising providers.

The AP reported that there is no evidence the personal data has been misused, but it raises specific concerns regarding online privacy. Google and other companies tailor ads to users’ interests based on previous internet activity that has been tracked on a computer or mobile device.

Although, Obama spokesman Aaron Albright said outside vendors “are prohibited from using information from these tools on HealthCare.gov for their companies’ purposes.”
