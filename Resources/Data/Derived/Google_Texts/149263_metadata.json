Idaho\u2019s governor is appealing a lower court decision striking down that state\u2019s marriage ban.\n\nMeanwhile, gay marriage foes in Hawaii are arguing to keep the legal case in that state alive in hopes that the U.S. Supreme Court someday will rule against gay marriage. The state legalized gay marriage last year.\n\nA look at some of the couples who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits:\n\nIDAHO:\n\nIn Idaho, four same-sex couples sued to overturn the state\u2019s ban and to compel Idaho to recognize marriages performed in other states.\n\nThe couples, all women, argue they are denied rights and subject to different tax rules than are applied to families of married couples.\n\nTwo couples in the lawsuit were legally married in other states: Sue Latta and Traci Ehlers, married in 2008 in California, and Lori and Sharene Watsen, married in 2011 in New York.\n\nBoth couples have children but Idaho does not recognize either marriage, which compelled Lori Watsen to obtain power of attorney to legally consent to medical treatment for her son.\n\nThe two other couples named in the lawsuit are seeking to wed in Idaho. Shelia Robertson and Andrea Altmayer were denied marriage licenses in Boise. So were Amber Beirle and Rachael Robertson.\n\nThe couples were planning on marrying when Idaho\u2019s gay marriage ban was originally lifted by a federal district court in May. But before they could tie the knot, the court\u2019s ruling was put on hold pending a 9th Circuit ruling.\n\nNEVADA:\n\nEight couples have sued in Nevada seeking similar outcomes as those sought in Idaho.\n\nBeverly Sevcik, 76, and Mary Baranovich, 78, of Carson City, have been together almost 43 years, and raised three children in Seattle before moving to Nevada in 2003. The retired bookkeepers have four grandchildren.\n\nAntioco Carrillo, 47, and Theodore \u201cTheo\u201d Small, 46, live in Las Vegas. They\u2019ve been a couple since 2006. Carrillo heads a nonprofit HIV/AIDS advocacy group. Small is a teacher.\n\nKaren Goody, 53, and Karen Vibe, 40, live in Reno and have been engaged since December 2005. Goody is a medical supply sales agent. Vibe teaches music and is a Reno Philharmonic Orchestra percussionist.\n\nFletcher Whitwell, 39, and Greg Flamer, 42, live in Las Vegas with their 3-year-old daughter and 7-month-old son. Whitwell and Flamer have been together for more than 16 years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "title": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "title": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/hawaii_idaho_nevada_gay_couples_in_legal_cases/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/gay-marriage-nevada.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "title": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/gay-marriage-nevada.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada gay couples in legal cases", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, gay marriage foes in Hawaii are arguing to keep the legal case in that state alive in hopes that the U.S. Supreme Court someday will rule against gay marriage.\nCircuit Court of Appeals is set to hear arguments Monday on gay marriage cases from Hawaii, Idaho and Nevada.\nGay couples in Nevada seek to overturn a lower court ruling upholding the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban.\nThe couples, all women, argue they are denied rights and subject to different tax rules than are applied to families of married couples.\nThe couples were planning on marrying when Idaho\u2019s gay marriage ban was originally lifted by a federal district court in May."}
