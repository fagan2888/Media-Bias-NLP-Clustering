Food companies \u2014 in particular, the pizza industry \u2014 had campaigned against it, saying it was onerous and in many cases served no purpose, as most Americans order pies over the phone and not in a restaurant, where they would see a menu. A measure in the House sought to delay compliance by a year.\n\nOn Thursday, the agency announced that it had done just that to give companies more time to comply. Critics said the delay was not a fatal blow, but was worrisome, as it would give the restaurant and grocery industries more time to lobby against the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for the restaurant lobbyists,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cFood companies must be hoping that if they can delay menu labeling long enough, it will just go away.\u201d\n\nBut the delay may be more about bureaucracy than industry influence. Many who supported the rule said that the agency had yet to issue a crucial guidance document that would help the industry understand how to carry it out, and that with less than six months to go before the original deadline, there was a risk that the rule would create chaos. Some of its strongest backers, including Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, had called on the agency to delay it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichael R. Taylor, the deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at the F.D.A., said in a statement that the rule\u2019s new implementation date would be Dec. 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cThe F.D.A. agrees additional time is necessary for the agency to provide further clarifying guidance to help facilitate efficient compliance across all covered businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Taylor said that the decision to extend the deadline came after \u201cextensive dialogue\u201d with restaurants, grocery stores and other businesses that would be affected, and that the agency planned to issue detailed draft guidance in August to help establishments comply with the rule.\n\nMenu labeling became law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, and the F.D.A. issued a proposal for how it should be carried out the next year. But the final rule was delayed for three years, due in part to fierce opposition from some national chains, including pizza restaurants and movie theaters.\n\nWhen the agency finally announced the rule last year, it was stronger and more sweeping than consumer advocates were expecting, covering food in vending machines and amusement parks, as well as certain prepared foods in supermarkets. The rule applied to food establishments with 20 or more outlets, from fast-food chains like KFC and Subway to sit-down restaurants like Applebee\u2019s and The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nLynn Liddle, an executive vice president at Domino\u2019s and chairwoman of the American Pizza Community, an industry group, said in a statement that the final rule had \u201cserious deficiencies,\u201d and that the trade group, which has lobbied vigorously against the rule, was putting its hopes in a House bill, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, which it says would allow restaurants that take most of their orders online or by phone to label menus online rather than in stores. Another provision of the bill would limit coverage of the rule to establishments with more than half their revenue coming from prepared foods.\n\nMargo Wootan, the director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that provision amounted to a loophole that would exempt supermarkets, convenience stores and movie theaters from having to provide calorie information to their customers for their prepared foods. She said a sponsor of the bill had promised to remove it.\n\nThe requirement applies to prepared foods \u2014 for example in salad bars or hot food bars in grocery and convenience stores \u2014 that are intended to feed one person. A sandwich or a salad would fall into this category, but not bulk items like loaves of bread or a rotisserie chicken.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rule also covers alcoholic beverages. Beverages served in food establishments that are on menus and menu boards would be included, but a mixed drink at a bar would not, F.D.A. officials said last year.\n\nDawn Sweeney, the chief executive of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement, \u201cThis standard makes good sense for the industry and our customers,\u201d adding that \u201csome of our members are ready to implement menu labeling while others still need more time.\u201d\n\nDaren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it was not surprising that the implementation date for the rule had been extended, as grocery stores and convenience stores \u2014 establishments that he argued were not intended by Congress to be included \u2014 were probably struggling to comply as their products were less standardized than those at chain restaurants.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150709113319, "twitter": {"description": "The Food and Drug Administration announced it had pushed back its menu labeling rule by a year to give companies more time to comply.", "title": "F.D.A.
