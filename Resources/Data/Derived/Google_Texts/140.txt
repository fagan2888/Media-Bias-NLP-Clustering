Dozens of area firefighters got up close and personal with a 6,000-acre wildfire in Pawnee County on Thursday.

But one of them documented his time in the belly of the beast.

Lucas Andrews, of the Drumright Fire Department, used a GoPro camera on his gear to capture the moments he rode across rugged terrain to get water to flames near Old Highway 64 south of Cleveland.

For regular folks, it's a rare look into the risk rural firefighters take on every call. And as you can see from this short video by Andrews, the fire is so intense that it turns purple as it rages.



Officials still are monitoring hot spots and flare-ups between Terlton and Cleveland and pockets of heavy smoke remain in the area on Friday.

Given the wind speed was averaging 45 mph during the height of the fire, the amount of damage incurred is much lower than it could have been, the emergency manager said.

Pawnee County officials say six homes and 6,000 acres burned. About 100 homes were in danger and evacuated on Thursday, according to emergency manager Mark Randell.

There have been no injuries reported from county residents, and the only setbacks were a couple of minor injuries to firefighters, Randell said.



Several fire departments responded with mutual aid in the fire fight, and the massive team effort was led by the North 48 Volunteer Fire Department. The Oklahoma Forestry Service added relief by dropping nearly 60,000 gallons of water from an aerial tanker.
