The Capitals lost for just the third time in 11 games.\n\n\u201cI thought we started off a little slow,\u201d Washington coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t sharp, and they forced us not to be sharp.\u201d\n\nClaude Giroux and Wayne Simmonds also had goals for Philadelphia, which began the day trailing Boston by four points for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Philadelphia was 13 points out of the playoff race Jan. 16 but has clawed its way back with 20 points in its last 13 games.\n\n\u201cWe want to be accountable for ourselves and play for our teammates and that\u2019s what we did [today],\u201d Giroux said. \u201cWe played for each other. We played smart and that\u2019s how we want to play.\u201d\n\nDel Zotto scored with 4 minutes, 13 seconds left, beating Braden Holtby on the glove side with a wrist shot from the left circle. Jakub Voracek set up the goal with a cross-ice pass. Voracek, who entered the game tied for fourth in the league in points, matched his career-high with his 62nd point.\n\n\u201cThis team is very tight, they get along great and they love each other,\u201d Flyers coach Craig Berube said. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t transfer onto the ice, but they trust each other, for sure.\u201d\n\nSimmonds extended his career-best points streak to eight games when he put the Flyers up, 2-0, 1:34 into the second period. Mark Streit\u2019s shot from the point was saved by Holtby and bounced into the air and behind him. Looking like a batter, Simmonds knocked the puck out of the air into the goal.\n\nBut Washington rebounded with two goals and the teams entered the third period tied at 2-2. Wilson shot under Rob Zepp\u2019s pads from close range after a cross-ice pass from John Carlson with 14:37 left, and Ward tied it with a turnaround slap shot from the left circle that went high over Zepp with 4:38 remaining.\n\nHoltby stoned Ryan White on a breakaway with one and a half minutes left in the second to keep the game tied.\n\nBoth teams had their chances in the third before Del Zotto\u2019s goal. Philadelphia\u2019s best chance came with 12 and a half minutes left when Holtby denied Giroux with his right pad from just in front of the crease.\n\nWashington had three really good opportunities, with Ward\u2019s miss on a breakaway after Simmonds\u2018 turnover with seven minutes left their best.\n\n\u201cWe had chances and just missed it,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt was back and forth, we just couldn\u2019t capitalize at the end.\u201d\n\nGiroux ended a 10-game goal-scoring skid with his 17th of the season on the power play 4:39 into the contest. Philadelphia went on the man-advantage when Jay Beagle tripped Giroux, and the Flyers\u2019 captain made Washington pay.\n\nWith Simmonds screening Holtby, Giroux fired a wrister from above the left circle between Holtby\u2019s pads to give Philadelphia a 1-0 lead.\n\n\u201cIt felt great,\u201d Giroux said. \u201cYou want to be able to contribute and help the team win.\u201d\n\nAlex Ovechkin nearly tied it with nine minutes left in the period, but his wrist shot from the right circle caromed off the left post.\n\nBerube bypassed veteran Ray Emery in favor of Zepp, a 33-year-old rookie who had 21 saves a day after stopping 20 shots in a 3-2 shootout win over the league-leading Nashville Predators.\n\nThe coach said \u201ca gut feeling\u201d kept Zepp, who was playing in just his eighth career game, in the lineup on Sunday. Both he and Emery are filling in for starter Steve Mason, who missed his seventh game because of a knee injury.\n\nWashington left wing Jason Chimera knocked Flyers winger Zac Rinaldo down with a one-punch uppercut during a second-period fight.\n\nRinaldo was playing his second consecutive game after missing the previous 10 \u2014 eight of which were because of suspension for an illegal hit on the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2019 Kris Letang.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Del Zotto scored late in the third period Sunday to lift Philadelphia to a 3-2 victory over the Capitals, whose four-game winning streak ended and who lost for just the third time in 11 games.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Del Zotto scored late in the third period Sunday to lift Philadelphia to a 3-2 victory over the Capitals, whose four-game winning streak ended and who lost for just the third time in 11 games.", "title": "Michael Del Zotto\u2019s third-period goal helps Flyers halt Capitals\u2019 win streak", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/22/michael-del-zottos-third-period-goal-helps-flyers-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/AP232187751097.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/AP232187751097.jpg", "description": "Del Zotto scored late in the third period Sunday to lift Philadelphia to a 3-2 victory over the Capitals, whose four-game winning streak ended and who lost for just the third time in 11 games.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Michael Del Zotto\u2019s third-period goal helps Flyers halt Capitals"}, "Author": "Aaron Bracy", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington, Philadelphia, Wayne Simmonds, Michael Del Zotto"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30d4\"", "article_summary": "Washington left wing Jason Chimera knocked Flyers winger Zac Rinaldo down with a one-punch uppercut during a second-period fight.\nHoltby stoned Ryan White on a breakaway with one and a half minutes left in the second to keep the game tied.\nVoracek, who entered the game tied for fourth in the league in points, matched his career-high with his 62nd point.\nMichael Del Zotto scored late in the third period Sunday, lifting Philadelphia to a 3-2 victory over the Washington Capitals.\nWashington had three really good opportunities, with Ward\u2019s miss on a breakaway after Simmonds\u2018 turnover with seven minutes left their best."}
