She will report to Shelby Grad.\n\nThe Texas Tribune focuses on investigative, policy and political reporting. Brandi has worked at the news site since it launched in 2009.

The ACLU of Texas named her legislative reporter of the year in 2007 for her reporting on immigration.\n\nA native of Alliance, Neb., she has a degree in history from the University of Texas, where she was managing editor of the Daily Texan.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming her to Los Angeles.\n\n==\n\nFrom Washington Bureau Chief David Lauter:\n\nI\u2019m extremely happy to announce that Amy Fiscus will be joining us as an editor.\n\nAmy comes to us from the AP, where she has won a reputation among both reporters and fellow editors for intelligence, dexterity with copy and keen news judgment. As an editor on AP\u2019s East region desk, Amy directed significant enterprise on subjects such as the Affordable Care Act while also working on some of the biggest breaking news stories of the past few years, including coordinating on-site coverage of the Newtown school shooting. In between those assignments, she edited the manuscript for \u201cEnemies Within,\u201d Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo\u2019s book on the problematic record of the N.Y. Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit.\n\n\u201cReporters enjoy working for her. Everyone likes her. Who the hell says that about an editor?\u201d said one of her colleagues when asked recently to assess Amy\u2019s work.\n\nBefore working at AP, Amy was an editor at the Charlotte Observer. She\u2019s a graduate of the University of Missouri journalism school. She\u2019ll start Aug. 18.\n\n==\n\nFrom Business Editor Kimi Yoshino:\n\nI\u2019m pleased to announce that Melody Petersen, an award-winning investigative reporter, is joining the Business staff to cover Southern California\u2019s far-flung aerospace industry. Nearly all the nation\u2019s big aerospace companies have major facilities in the Southland \u2013 not to mention upstarts like SpaceX, drone makers like AeroVironment and the ancillary space businesses around Mojave.\n\nMelody has spent her career reporting and explaining complicated topics. At the Orange County Register, she was a Loeb Award finalist this year for her story about a $22-million capital appreciation bond that cost taxpayers $280 million. Previously, she covered the pharmaceuticals business at the New York Times and wrote an investigative book on the drug industry, \u201cOur Daily Meds.\u201d She also worked at the Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News, where she won a Loeb Award for an investigative series about a California power company.\n\nHer past editors describe her as \u201ca pro\u201d who can \u201cdo anything.\u201d Being a certified public accountant doesn\u2019t hurt either. Melody has a master\u2019s in journalism from the University of Maryland in College Park and a bachelor\u2019s of business administration degree in accounting from the University of Iowa. She starts Aug. 26.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Staff news: Brandi Grissom, Amy Fiscus, Melody Petersen join L.A.
