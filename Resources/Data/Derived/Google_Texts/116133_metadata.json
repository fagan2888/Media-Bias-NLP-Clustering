The site had garnered 100,000 trial members in limited markets, with CEO Marc Lore claiming repeat buying rates exceeded 50 percent during months of beta testing.\n\nShoppers hunting for bargains already have the option of going to Amazon, Walmart, Costco or any of a host of other online or brick-and-mortar retailers. So why should you care about Jet.com?\n\nRelated: Amazon\u2019s Prime Concern\u2014A New Online Blitz by Walmart\n\nFor one thing, Jet claims to have the cheapest prices anywhere on the Web, including Amazon, without requiring bulk purchases like Costco. For another, the company\u2019s growth plan calls for a massive $100 million marketing blitz \u2014 so you\u2019ll probably be seeing Jet.com ads before long.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the newest company trying to shake up retail \u2014 and generating plenty of buzz in the process:\n\nHow Does Jet.com Work?\n\nCustomers have to sign up for a $50 annual membership. Members then get access to low prices merchandise \u2014 some 10 million products ranging from beauty products to electronics and appliances to home d\u00e9cor. The company provides free shipping on orders of at least $35, and on returns. For orders under $35, there is a $5.99 shipping fee.\n\nStarting today, anyone can sign up for a free 90-day trial membership. In addition, after testing the membership, Jet has promised that being a member will save the average consumer $150 per year. If an individual doesn\u2019t find this to be the case, Jet will refund the difference between the amount the individual saved and the membership fee.\n\nThat Sounds a Lot Like Amazon Prime. What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nOnce a customer has signed up for membership, Jet says its prices will be about 10 percent to 15 percent cheaper than anywhere else online. To make the point clear, it will compare its price with Amazon\u2019s on all its product pages. In addition, individual items become less expensive as shoppers add more products to their carts.\n\nAnother key aspect of Jet that the company hopes will set it apart from other sites are the partnerships it has inked with retailers such as Macy\u2019s, Barnes & Nobles and NewEgg. Those deals allow the company to avoid spending money to build its own warehouses and inventory. And the referral fees the companies pay Jet.com for items it sells will reportedly get passed along to consumers as \u201cJet Cash\u201d discounts.\n\nIs This Business Going to Last?\n\nCEO Lore has said the company won\u2019t make any money from the products it sells \u2014 its profits will come entirely from membership fees, meaning that the company will be losing money unless or until it grows to a sizable membership base. Consumerist.com calls the company \u201ceither the future of retail or a doomed wacky scheme.\u201d But the company has intrigued investors enough to have raised $225 million in capital and, according to The Wall Street Journal, is in talks to raise more funds at a valuation as high as $3 billion.\n\nRelated: 10 Biggest Tech Flops of the Century\u200b\u200b\n\nLore at least has a track record that should buy the company some time. He co-founded Quidsi, the company that ran Diapers.com, and then sold the business to Amazon in 2010 for a reported $545 million. Lore worked at Amazon for a while before developing Jet. He hopes to have 15 million paying members by 2020, bringing in $750 million annually in membership fees and $20 billion in sales.\n\nIf he can get there, Lore may well have a huge success on his hands. If he can\u2019t, well, at least shoppers might have gotten some bargains along the way.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Startup e-retailer Jet.com, which promises to revolutionize online shopping, launched", "title": "The Latest Threat to Amazon and Walmart Is Jet.com", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/21/Latest-Threat-Amazon-and-Walmart-Jetcom", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03142014_Amazon_Prime.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/21/Latest-Threat-Amazon-and-Walmart-Jetcom", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03142014_Amazon_Prime.jpeg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Startup e-retailer Jet.com, which promises to revolutionize online shopping, launched", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In addition, after testing the membership, Jet has promised that being a member will save the average consumer $150 per year.\nMembers then get access to low prices merchandise \u2014 some 10 million products ranging from beauty products to electronics and appliances to home d\u00e9cor.\nShoppers hunting for bargains already have the option of going to Amazon, Walmart, Costco or any of a host of other online or brick-and-mortar retailers.\nFor another, the company\u2019s growth plan calls for a massive $100 million marketing blitz \u2014 so you\u2019ll probably be seeing Jet.com ads before long.\nHe co-founded Quidsi, the company that ran Diapers.com, and then sold the business to Amazon in 2010 for a reported $545 million."}
