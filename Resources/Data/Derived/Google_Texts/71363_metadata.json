He's entertainer of the last three decades ... he's King George, and I couldn't be happier with how this night turned out.\"\n\nThere were some fresh faces at the podium, too.\n\nKacey Musgraves was named new artist of the year, while Florida Georgia Line nabbed duo of the year and single of the year for the summertime smash \"Cruise.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED CMA hosts riff on Obamacare Replay More Videos ...

My parents were losing it. ... This is kind of like a night you have in your daydreams where it's like everyone you love is there. It just was unreal, honestly.\"\n\nThe 47th Annual CMA Awards opened with a musical number that parodied a real-life \"feud,\" pitting the Zac Brown Band's frontman against supporters of chart topper Luke Bryan -- reportedly because Brown had criticized Bryan's latest single in a radio interview.\n\nBut even before the show started, Bryan told CNN, \"Zac and I saw each other backstage, and we hugged, and it's not that way ... so it's all good. No big feud. Me and Zac -- we may have a collaboration coming one of these days. You never know.\"\n\nIn their sixth year as hosts, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood got some laughs with a skit that mocked Obamacare. The pair pretended to be trying to sign up for the health care program before launching into a new take on the George Strait classic \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\n\"Obamacare by morning,\" they sang. \"Why's this taking so long? I'm going to end up with hemorrhoids/If I sit here 'til dawn.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, Nashville's golden couple, have a big night at the CMA Awards.
