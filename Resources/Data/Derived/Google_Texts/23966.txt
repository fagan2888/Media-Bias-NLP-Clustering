Republican Jeb Bush spending time at the Aiken GOP luncheon at Newberry Hall.

During his visit, he talked about the importance the Palmetto state plays in the Presidential race.

"It will influence March 1st, which I think they're calling the SEC primary. It's hugely important. It always has been in Republican primary politics and you'll see me here a lot because of that."

This is the second stop in South Carolina in two days for the former Florida Governor.

He spent time talking about the health of the nation and how the Affordable Care Act needs to change.

"If every dollar people make don't go to take home pay it goes to higher premiums and higher deductables. It's running in place and that's exactly where we are are today in spite of Obamcare," he said.

Bush visited Spartanburg Tuesday and talked about community leadership, education, national security, and Donald Trump.

Today, he said Trump does not have his phone number and he would not give it to him.
