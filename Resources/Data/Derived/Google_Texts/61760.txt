Cory Booker says...

Hazing and sexual assault in our schools is absolutely intolerable.

I’m a cosponsor of legislation to require schools – both K-12 and higher education institutions – that receive federal funds to adopt codes of conduct that prohibit bullying and harassment.

The Federal government, which provides significant funding for many districts, should use its funding levers to incentivize schools to draft strict policies and to ensure those policies are enforced.
