I see it two ways \u2014 dusty, light and classic, or vibrant, \u2018statement\u2019 and sharp,\u201d says Boston-based designer Taniya Nayak. \u201cThe former adds subtle whispers of elegance, while the latter turns up the volume in a space.\u201d\n\nEddie Ross, East Coast editor for Better Homes & Gardens, is another fan.\n\n\u201cPink is back, and it\u2019s all grown up. Paired with stronger hues like navy, chocolate or gray, pink looks sophisticated and surprising,\u201d he says.\n\nRoss suggests several ways to incorporate the color for different effects: \u201cWhen you cover a sofa or chair in a light pink, it acts like a neutral. Swap out throw pillows for a completely different look. Light pink bedding looks great with just about any skin tone. Light pink linen mats in simple white frames with black-and-white photos look crisp.\u201d\n\nHis favorite pink paint shades include Devine Color\u2019s Devine Poodle \u2014 \u201cgreat on dining room chairs in a lustrous high gloss\u201d; Benjamin Moore\u2019s subtle Affinity Proposal for walls; Farrow & Ball\u2019s Blushes \u2014 \u201ca strong pink that would be stunning on a ceiling paired with cream and gray.\u201d\n\nValspar\u2019s Rosario Ridge and Universe Quartz Pink are two others to consider. Sherwin-Williams\u2019 Spun Sugar and Malted Milk are as tasty-looking as their names, as are Peach Parfait and Fruit Shake from Benjamin-Moore.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to get out the painting props, try an infusion of pink furniture. CB2\u2019s Vapor chair is Lucite-tinged pink (acrylic\u2019s a strong trend in furniture this season, so this piece gives extra style bang for the buck). And the retailer\u2019s City Slicker table resembles a big chunk of neon-pink bubblegum. A fun piece like this is a great way to play with the color.\n\nSan Francisco designer Tineke Triggs likes to add a deep pink desk to a home office, or a crushed-berry ceiling to a bedroom. She pairs them with other bold colors like crisp white and egg yolk, or soft tans and grays.\n\nYou can combine pink accessories with contemporary pieces, or add a hint of surprise in a roomful of rustic, traditional or industrial elements. Pink looks great next to reflective and textured materials such as mirrors, metallics and velvets, but also alongside linen, burlap, weathered pine or rattan.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to shop the kids\u2019 furniture stores: Pottery Barn Kids has a pretty pink Moroccan floor pouf and a smart pink metal side table that would add punch to a den or master bedroom. Land of Nod\u2019s got a playful rag rug, a preppy blush-and-cream striped flatweave, and a sophisticated, hand-tufted floral rug in pastel pink.\n\nLamps Plus stocks some pink lighting that includes Robert Abbey\u2019s rectangular Schiaparelli Pink ceramic table lamp with a Lucite base, and Ovo\u2019s glass lamp in elegant fuchsia.\n\nCrate & Barrel\u2019s Clara chair is covered in a gentle watercolor floral that brings springy gardens to mind. Aaron Probyn\u2019s porcelain dinnerware collection in a dreamy blush, also at the retailer, is pretty without being precious.\n\nHomegoods has well-priced pieces like an elegant, damask-printed accent chair with nail-head trim, and a chic, crocodile-embossed ceramic vase, as well as storage boxes and hand-carved picture frames in shades of pink.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Think pink!
