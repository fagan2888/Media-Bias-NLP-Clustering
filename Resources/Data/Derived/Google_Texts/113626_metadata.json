Blizzard pummels the Northeast\n\nA massive blizzard swept through the Northeast on Thursday night, dumping a foot of snow on some regions and forcing thousands of flight cancellations.

Sunni militants gain ground in key Iraqi cities\n\nTwo of Iraq's most strategically important cities, Fallujah and Ramadi, have been overwhelmed by Sunni rebels with ties to al Qaeda. The Iraqi government has rushed troops to the area to quell the violence as the extremists set fire to police stations and freed prisoners.

Study finds emergency room visits increase with coverage\n\nA new study has found that expanding health-care coverage may not reduce the number of emergency room visits. The research, which looked at Oregon's 2008 Medicaid expansion, showed a 40 percent increase in ER visits among low-income adults recently insured. The findings appear to undercut the argument that expanding coverage would decrease medical costs because more people can see primary care doctors. Under the Affordable Care Act, 25 states and the District of Columbia have extended Medicaid coverage to adults who earn less than 133 percent of the federal poverty line.
