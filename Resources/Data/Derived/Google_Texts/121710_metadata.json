According to a source in the room, Ryan used graphs and charts to lay out the options, stressing that the House doesn\u2019t need to approve a budget and that the sky won\u2019t fall if the appropriations process isn\u2019t completed. But he and members across the spectrum of the GOP conference have called for a return to \u201cregular order\u201d in the House, and completing a budget would be the first step in that process.\n\nThere are other benefits to the House passing a budget, namely reconciliation, an arcane budgetary process that allows certain legislation to pass the Senate without being subject to a 60-vote filibuster. Republicans used that tactic earlier this year to force President Obama to veto a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. With a budget this year, repealing Obamacare could again be on the table using reconciliation, and if a Republican is elected president, it would be likely their swiftest route to repealing the law in 2017.\n\nYet many conservatives, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, have stressed in recent weeks that they have major concerns over the debt and deficit and prefer to draft a budget reflecting lower spending priorities. When the budget deal negotiated by former Speaker John Boehner to raise spending by $80 billion over two years passed last fall, the majority of Republicans voted against it. Conservatives argue that they shouldn\u2019t be expected to now support a number in the budget that they voted against just a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThis idea that whatever the number is we\u2019ve got to follow it, we have never done that, are you kidding me?\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said Thursday. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we keep coming back to a pretty common-sense thing: Write a Republican budget that reflects the security threats that we face, does the right thing for defense, but also understands the debt situation that we have.\"\n\nRep. Dave Brat, a Freedom Caucus member who sits on the Budget Committee, said he could be persuaded to vote for the higher number, but only if there were written agreements to make major cuts in entitlement spending to make up the difference. He argued that with entitlement spending in the trillions of dollars, offsetting $30 billion shouldn\u2019t be a Herculean task.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t find $30 billion it\u2019s an embarrassment, it\u2019s a mathematical embarrassment,\u201d Brat told RCP.\n\nConversely, moderates and other conference members who have often clashed with the Freedom Caucus argue that a deal was reached and the spending levels that were signed into law should be honored. California Rep. Devin Nunes said that either option that doesn\u2019t stick to the approved spending level would result in a failed appropriations process and require an omnibus spending bill (an approach that is universally reviled) or a continuing resolution that maintains current spending.\n\n\u201cYou can spend a lot of time here doing appropriations bills in the House and they make you feel good, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not going to go into law, it\u2019s not going to have an impact at all,\u201d Nunes said. He added his preference that the conference work toward accomplishments that \u201cmatter versus waste the whole year.\"\n\nRyan\u2019s current position is one Boehner consistently found himself in \u2013 hoping to move forward on funding the government while dealing with conservatives frustrated by the proposals and able to prevent a majority of Republicans from agreeing. But both sides do agree that the process and the relationships between leadership and conservatives are vastly improved this time around.\n\nFor one thing, Ryan has considerably better relations with the Freedom Caucus than Boehner did. A majority of them voted for his speakership and they have praised both his policy vision for Republicans and the changes he has made regarding process. Ryan meets weekly with members across the ideological spectrum, and Jordan and Rep. Mick Mulvaney, another Freedom Caucus leader, are regular attendees.\n\nRyan also met with a group of Freedom Caucus members over beer in his office last week for several hours to discuss the budget and has held meetings with members of the Budget Committee and other Republicans. He\u2019s mostly been listening to where lawmakers stand rather than trying to push members in one direction or another. Ryan has called it a \u201cfamily conversation\u201d and stressed that it\u2019s early in the budget discussions since the deadline to pass one \u2013 should the House redo the Boehner-negotiated agreement -- isn\u2019t until mid-April. He\u2019s also emphasized that he\u2019s not the \u201cdictator\u201d or \u201cmicromanager\u201d of the House, and said during the meeting Friday morning that he wouldn\u2019t jam a decision down members\u2019 throats.\n\n\u201cI want to get [the appropriations process] back up and running,\u201d the Wisconsin congressman said Thursday at his weekly press conference. \u201cBut our members are going to make this decision together.\u201d\n\nConservatives have noticed and praised the outreach.\n\n\u201cI think the outreach has been very good by Speaker Ryan and the rest of leadership,\u201d Rep. Raul Labrador, a Freedom Caucus leader, said Thursday. \u201c[Budget Chairman] Tom Price, I think, has been a champion coming to us and discussing the issue with us. So a lot of kudos to them for reaching out.\u201d\n\nBut Labrador stressed that conservatives are firm in their position on the spending levels, arguing that while Republican budgets consistently balance after 10 years, they are \u201cstill kicking the can down the road.\u201d\n\nEven if there isn\u2019t a meeting of the minds on the budget \u2013 and the one approved last fall remains in place -- there isn\u2019t much worry that the fractured nature of the Boehner era will return. Labrador gave a one word response when asked if he had any concerns about that: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAsked to elaborate, the Idaho lawmaker said, \u201cI think that Paul Ryan is an adult and I think he understands that we\u2019re going to have our position, he\u2019s going to have his position, and if we don\u2019t agree on this issue, we may agree on some other issue in the future.\"\n\nRep. Cynthia Lummis, another Freedom Caucus member, agreed that conservatives and leadership would be able to stay on the same page overall if not on the budget, arguing that Ryan\u2019s past work pushing fiscal conservatism created a certain amount of trust.\n\n\u201cI am betting the farm on Paul Ryan and any minor disagreements are not going to alter my confidence in betting the farm\u201d on him, Lummis told RCP.\n\nThe path forward is unclear, and Friday\u2019s meeting was mostly an opening salvo as Republicans try to determine a solution. It\u2019s also uncertain whether there\u2019s enough opposition to the current spending level to pass a budget, but if the Freedom Caucus voted unanimously, it could prevent one from passing. An 80 percent vote from the group is needed to draft an official position and while there hasn\u2019t yet been a vote on a budget position, Jordan said the group is \u201clooking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nPrice, the budget chairman, said his plan remains to mark up and pass the budget out of his committee by the end of the month. With a full week off for Presidents\u2019 Day, Republicans will have some time back in their districts to weigh their options.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans are in a budget bind.\nIn a meeting of the entire GOP conference Friday morning, Speaker Paul Ryan laid out three approval options for how the group can move forward: a budget that...", "title": "House Conservatives Push for Lower Budget Numbers | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/02/12/house_conservatives_push_for_lower_budget_numbers_129653.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/345908_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "House Republicans are in a budget bind.\nIn a meeting of the entire GOP conference Friday morning, Speaker Paul Ryan laid out three approval options for how the group can move forward: a budget that...", "title": "House Conservatives Push for Lower Budget Numbers | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "House Conservatives Push for Lower Budget Numbers | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "TOM PRICE,Cynthia Lummis,devin nunes,Raul Labrador,dave brat,Jim Jordan,Paul Ryan,Freedom Caucus,budget,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2630\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans are in a budget bind.\nYet many conservatives, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, have stressed in recent weeks that they have major concerns over the debt and deficit and prefer to draft a budget reflecting lower spending priorities.\nFor one thing, Ryan has considerably better relations with the Freedom Caucus than Boehner did.\nRyan meets weekly with members across the ideological spectrum, and Jordan and Rep.
