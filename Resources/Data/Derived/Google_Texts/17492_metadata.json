(Photo: Russ DeSantis, Correspondent)\n\nThere were plenty of things Sheilah Proctor didn't expect in the immediate aftermath of superstorm Sandy.\n\nShe didn't expect the home that's been in her family for 40 years would be inundated with about 5 feet of water and mud and would be uninhabitable for more than a year.\n\nAnd she didn't think that businesses would take such advantage of her family's plight \u2014 one charging 10 times the actual cost to do the electrical work needed for the home.\n\n\"I thought people would be a little more honest,\" she said.\n\nIt wasn't until Proctor met \"an angel God sent\" that her family \u2014 her mother, Pearl; brother, Phillip; and her young children \u2014 was able to finally get back home last month.\n\nProctor reached out to Catholic Charities Disaster Response Program last October after her family ran out of money while trying to pay the mortgage and utilities on its Joline Avenue house and a contractor hired to complete repairs made matters worse by removing a load-bearing wall.\n\nCatholic Charities enlisted the Monmouth County Long Term Recovery Group, Lutheran Social Ministries, Brethren Disaster Ministries and the American Red Cross to help the Proctors.\n\nIn all, the menagerie of nonprofit groups helped restore the critical wall, replace damaged drywall, replace carpeting, paint the home and replace furniture.\n\nAnd in April, the Proctors were able to return home.\n\n\"My children feel home and secure again,\" Proctor said.\n\n\"It's good to know there are so many honest people willing to give of themselves. You really could feel they were so sincere.\"\n\nWhere you can get help\n\nOrganizations still providing assistance:\n\n\u2022 211; resource for financial assistance, housing, legal assistance and transportation; www.nj211.org/hurricane.cfm\n\n\u2022 A Future with Hope; disaster case management; 732-359-1012\n\n\u2022 Affordable Housing Alliance; housing assistance; housingall.org\n\n\u2022 Catholic Charities' Disaster Response Program; disaster case management; 800-652-2080, DisasterResponse@cctrenton.org\n\n\u2022 Children's Home Society; counseling, housing, employment, clothing, household goods; 1433 Hooper Ave., #340, Toms River; 732-557-5037\n\n\u2022 Church of Grace and Peace; clothing, food pantry; 1563 Old Freehold Road, Toms River; 732-349-1550\n\n\u2022 Community Health Law Project; legal services; 44 Washington St., Toms River; 732-349-6714\n\n\u2022 Coastal Habitat for Humanity; Sandy-related home repair for residents in sections of Monmouth County; Felix Acevedo, 732-974-2422, ext. 1, CoastalHabitat.org\n\n\u2022 Family Promise; homelessness relief for southern Ocean County; 609-994-3317\n\n\u2022 FoodBank of Monmouth & Ocean Counties; distributes food to agencies throughout Ocean and Monmouth counties and provides assistance applying for food stamps; www.foodbankmoc.org\n\n\u2022 Foundation to Save the Jersey Shore; rebuild homes and businesses, appliance assistance; www.savethejerseyshore.org\n\n\u2022 Gap Funding Initiative; possible additional financial assistance to those on RREM Pathway C; 1-800-645-5182\n\n\u2022 Habitat for Humanity in Monmouth County; Sandy-related home repair; www.habitatmon-mouth.org, 732-728-0441\n\n\u2022 Habitat for Humanity (Ocean County); rebuilding, disaster training, thrift store, mitigation; 800-422-4828\n\n\u2022 Hometown Heroes; leads the Restore the Shore Hurricane Sandy relief campaign; www.usahometownheroes.org; 732-473-9400\n\n\u2022 Lunch Break; provides hot meals in the soup kitchen, groceries and clothing to those in need; lunchbreak.org, 732-747-8577\n\n\u2022 Monmouth County Long Term Recovery Group; mcltrg.org, 848-206-2550\n\n\u2022 New Jersey Small Business Development Center at Brookdale Community College; providing assistance to small business that were impacted by Sandy; 765 Newman Springs Road, ATEC 111, Lincroft; 732-842-8685, www.mosbdc.com\n\n\u2022 Ocean County Department of Consumer Affairs; investigates, mediates and enforces the Consumer Fraud Act; 732-929-2105\n\n\u2022 Ocean County Long Term Recovery Group; oceancountyltrg.org; 732-569-3484\n\n\u2022 Ocean-Monmouth Legal Services; free legal assistance to those impacted by Sandy; www.lsnj.org/omls\n\n\u2022 Operation HOPE \u2014 HOPE Coalition America; provides disaster and financial recovery assistance to those impacted by Sandy in Ocean and Monmouth counties, 270 Chambers Bridge Road, Brick; 732-451-2068\n\n\u2022 Statewide Sandy Fraud Working Group; investigation and prosecution of civil and criminal fraud related to Sandy and the disaster recovery process; 855-726-3939; www.nj.gov/oag/ca/stopsandyfraud/index.htm\n\n\u2022 Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey; will have funds available July 1 to screen Sandy survivors in Monmouth and Ocean counties for behavioral health; www.vnahg.org; 732-777-6333\n\n\u2022 The Sandy Homeowner Renter Assistance Program, or SHRAP, offers six months of assistance up to $15,000.\n\nResidents in Ocean County can apply through OCEAN Inc., accepting applications at these locations:\n\n\u2022 Ocean County Southern Service Center, 179 S.
