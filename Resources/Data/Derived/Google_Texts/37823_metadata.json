For another third we have no idea. And that\u2019s only from the list of chemicals the fracking industry provided voluntarily. That\u2019s according to an analysis by William Stringfellow of Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, reported in Chemistry World. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is the practice of injecting fluid at high pressure into the earth, which breaks up oil- and gas-filled rock formations that is then extracted to the surface. The contents and makeup of that fluid have been a subject of controversy, largely because drilling companies are able to keep what\u2019s in it a secret, and because the fluid has been known to leak and spill on a regular basis. Stringfellow mostly used FracFocus\u2019 voluntary registry of 250 fracking chemicals provided by the industry to check against existing toxicology information. He found that about 10 percent of the chemicals are known to be hazardous \u201cin terms of mammalian or aquatic toxicology,\u201d Stringfellow said at the a meeting of the American Chemical Society. But for almost a third of those 250 chemicals, there\u2019s no publicly available information on their toxicity to humans or other life. And that\u2019s not even counting the chemicals that the industry can simply choose to keep a secret. FracFocus was in the news last week when drilling companies came under scrutiny for injecting diesel fuel into the earth to frack oil and gas, something for which they are supposed to have a permit. When that came to light, many companies simply went back and removed past mentions of injecting diesel. Pressure is growing for companies to stop concealing the chemical mixtures they use for fracking. The companies Baker Hughes and Schlumberger chose to disclose their entire fracking formulas, and other companies may follow suit. \u201cIndustry knows what its problem compounds are, and they\u2019re trying to replace those,\u201d Stringfellow said. And until then, they\u2019re likely to keep their formulas a secret.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nFor those wanting to attend Friday\u2019s public hearing in Lee County, it will run from 5:00 p.m. \u2013 9:00 p.m. at the Wicker Center, 1801 Nash Street, Sanford.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9cb\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s more from Andrew Breiner\u2019s story:At least 10 percent of the contents of fracking fluid injected into the earth is toxic.\nStringfellow mostly used FracFocus\u2019 voluntary registry of 250 fracking chemicals provided by the industry to check against existing toxicology information.\nAnd that\u2019s only from the list of chemicals the fracking industry provided voluntarily.\nThe hearing at the Wicker Center in Sanford comes amid new worries about the waste water produced by hydraulic fracturing.\nThe companies Baker Hughes and Schlumberger chose to disclose their entire fracking formulas, and other companies may follow suit."}
