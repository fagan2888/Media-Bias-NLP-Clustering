Jim Moran (D., Va.) announced his retirement Wednesday morning, ending a career in Congress marked by anti-Israel remarks and violent outbursts, according to National Review.\n\nMoran said in 2007 that the pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee was \u201cthe most powerful lobby\u201d that pushed for the Iraq War \u201csince the beginning,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they represent the mainstream of American Jewish thinking at all, but because they are so well organized,\u201d Moran said about AIPAC. \u201cAnd their members are extraordinarily powerful\u2014most of them are quite wealthy\u2014they have been able to exert power.\u201d\n\nThe congressman also took a shot at the late Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during a speech to the American Muslim Council in 2001. Moran said in his address that Sharon was \u201cprobably seeking a warrant from President Bush to kill at will with weapons we have paid for.\u201d\n\nAside from his numerous anti-Israel remarks, Moran\u2019s violent temper has also tainted his reputation in Washington. Moran, a former boxer, allegedly \u201csucker-punched\u201d Rep. Duke Cunningham (R., Calif.) during a debate on the House floor about sending troops to Bosnia in 1995.\n\nMoran was involved in at least three assault cases from 2000-2001. His wife filed charges against him in June 2000 alleging that he shoved her during a confrontation; police dropped the case due to lack of evidence. Later that year, Moran angrily carried an 8 year-old boy from a parking lot into a recreation center. Moran said that the boy had \u201cthreatened to take his keys by pretending to have a gun.\u201d\n\nAfter Moran\u2019s divorce, two female friends of Moran showed up at his house on his birthday in May 2001. According to Moran\u2019s office the two women \u201cwere surprised by each other\u201d and another altercation ensued. Moran then took one of the women \u201cby the arm, trying to get her out of the house.\u201d\n\nMoran had to be physically restrained by his staff to keep him from scuffling with Tea Party protestors in 2010, Politico reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not protecting him from you, we\u2019re protecting you from him,\u201d a staffer told the crowd.\n\nViolence appears to run in the family, as Moran\u2019s son pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend outside of a Washington, D.C., bar in late 2012.\n\nMoran managed to be reelected by big margins for several decades in spite of all his controversies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
