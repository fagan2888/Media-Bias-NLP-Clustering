Capital Markets, who shared his insights in a recent Motley Fool report.\n\nThe case for UnitedHealth\n\nFueled by increasing adoption of Medicare plans and growing Medicaid enrollment, UnitedHealth's revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 grew to $32.76 billion, up from the $30.62 billion in revenue it reported for the same period of last year. In addition, the insurer's Medicare business improved 4 percent and its community and state business increased by 34 percent.\n\nAlthough those are impressive numbers, with uncertainty still surrounding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it hasn't been all smooth sailing for UnitedHealth. For instance, in November, after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging the legality of subsidies under the PPACA in states that did not establish their own insurance exchanges, shares of UnitedHealth fell by 2.7 percent.\n\nEven with the uncertainty, UnitedHealth investors still have reason to expect the insurer's earnings in 2015 to outpace this year, according to Mr. Campbell, as UnitedHealth is participating in 23 PPACA health insurance exchanges during the current enrollment period and will continue to benefit from its Medicare and Medicaid businesses.\n\nThe case for Molina Healthcare\n\nMolina Healthcare has greatly benefitted from Medicaid enrollment significantly increasing in its biggest markets, according to Mr. Campbell. Through Medicaid expansion, Molina Healthcare added more than 314,000 members, including 82,200 in the third quarter of this year.\n\nDue to the surge in Medicaid enrollment, Molina Healthcare recorded $2.45 billion in revenue in the third quarter of this year, up from $1.69 billion in revenue in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, the managed care company's net income grew from $7.57 million in the third quarter of last year to $16.12 million in the third quarter of 2014, with net income per share of $0.83.\n\nThe year ahead\n\nAlthough analysts expect UnitedHealth's earnings per share to grow by 8.7 percent in 2015, they believe Molina Healthcare's earnings per share will increase by 106 percent, which is largely based on the predictable revenue path and profit growth Molina Healthcare offers, according to Mr. Campbell.\n\nWhile UnitedHealth did significantly benefit from its Medicaid business in the past year, the insurer has other businesses which \"water down Medicaid's impact on its overall results,\" said Mr. Campbell. However, with the vast majority of Molina Healthcare's business coming from running state and community Medicaid programs, it doesn't have the same issue of watered down results.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Campbell believes speculative investors might see Molina Healthcare as a more attractive investment, since UnitedHealth just decided to fully participate in the PPACA exchanges this year, and it is still unclear how the insurer's participation will \"play out.\"\n\nMore articles on insurers:\n\nUnitedHealth projects double-digit earnings growth\n\nWellPoint changes name to Anthem\n\nAnthem, Managed Health Services of Indiana and MDwise score Indiana Medicaid contract\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
