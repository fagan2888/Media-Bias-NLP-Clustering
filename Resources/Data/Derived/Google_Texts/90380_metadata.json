These tunes, which trigger positive memories and produce warm feelings, tend to be hits from our adolescence and early adulthood. You never forget what was playing when you enjoyed your first kiss.\n\nBut here\u2019s a surprise: We respond with similar pleasure to the much older songs that served as background music to our parents\u2019 first kiss. And possibly their parents\u2019 as well.\n\nNewly published research suggests musical nostalgia is a multigenerational phenomenon. It seems the songs we love aren\u2019t just the ones we discovered, but also the ones our parents enjoyed, and presumably played in the home.\n\nSo if you think \u201880s music is great and \u201890s music is crap, that may simply reflect the year of your birth, and your parents\u2019 birth. (Sixties pop may be its own special case, as we\u2019ll explore shortly.)\n\nIn the journal Psychological Science, Cornell University psychologist Carol Lynne Krumhansl and Justin Adam Zupnick of the University of California-Santa Cruz describe a study featuring 62 young adults (average age 20).\n\nParticipants listened to a series of 11 music clips, each of which featured the two top songs from each year during a five-year period (starting with 1955-59 and concluding with 2005-09). The recordings ranged from Bill Haley\u2019s Rock Around the Clock and Elvis Presley\u2019s Heartbreak Hotel to Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga\u2019s Poker Face.\n\nThey were asked if they recognized and liked the songs, what emotions the songs evoked, and whether the songs triggered personal memories. If so, they were asked whether the memories involved their parents, peers, or listening alone.\n\nNot surprisingly, the most recent music evoked the strongest responses. However, participants also expressed increased recognition and enjoyment of songs from two earlier periods: The late 1960s and the early 1980s. Oddly, \u201cthese participants exhibited something like a \u2018reminiscence bump\u2019 for music released in two time periods before they were born,\u201d the researchers write.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests that musical nostalgia is a multigenerational phenomenon", "title": "Study: Deep down, we love our parents\u2019 music", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests that musical nostalgia is a multigenerational phenomenon", "title": "Study: Deep down, we love our parents\u2019 music", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/07/study_deep_down_people_probably_love_their_parents_music_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_145664183.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests that musical nostalgia is a multigenerational phenomenon", "title": "Study: Deep down, we love our parents\u2019 music", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_145664183.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Memory, Music, Nostalgia, Pacific Standard, pop songs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Pretty much everyone has a soft spot for particular pop songs from the past, however cheesy they may seem today.\nTopics: Memory, Music, Nostalgia, Pacific Standard, pop songs, Life News, Entertainment NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nSo if you think \u201880s music is great and \u201890s music is crap, that may simply reflect the year of your birth, and your parents\u2019 birth.\nBut here\u2019s a surprise: We respond with similar pleasure to the much older songs that served as background music to our parents\u2019 first kiss.\nIt seems the songs we love aren\u2019t just the ones we discovered, but also the ones our parents enjoyed, and presumably played in the home."}
