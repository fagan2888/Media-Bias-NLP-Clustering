Getty Images\n\nMost people probably assume that when they aren't competing, Olympians spend the rest of their waking time practicing, working out and consuming protein shakes.\n\nBut it turns out the members of Team USA have hobbies like any other red-blooded American\u2014assuming that red-blooded American is incredibly sporty. The Journal combed through the online profiles of 170 U.S. Olympians and compiled the most commonly listed hobbies. Most of the results were what you would expect of an athlete, with activities such as biking, hiking and soccer recording high levels of popularity. Of the 10 most common hobbies, only reading, fishing and golfing can be described as leisurely activity.\n\nOn the more extreme side, skier Erik Fisher cliff jumps, and snowboarder Nick Baumgartner participates in demolition derbies\u2014presumably because the Olympics are just not dangerous enough.\n\nThere are also a few oddballs. Curler Debbie McCormick likes to watch \"The Price Is Right\" in her down time. Snowboarder Karly Shorr plays the ukulele, and figure skater Ashley Wagner plays laser tag. Snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington? Her main interest off the mountain is collecting fridge magnets.\n\n\u2014Ryan Wallerson", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-02-12T00:21:00.000Z", "article.section": "Sports", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "A look at some of Team USA's most common\u2014and weirdest\u2014hobbies; Ashley Wagner likes laser tag, and Kaitlyn Farrington collects magnets.", "title": "Commissariat of Calculation: The Hobbies of Team USA", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AA967_CC1_G_20140211224619.jpg", "alt": "Team USA's odd hobbies: Ashley Wagner likes laser tag, and Kaitlyn Farrington collects magnets.", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AA967_CC1_D_20140211224619.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303874504579377284184619114&headline=Team%20USA%26apos%3Bs%20odd%20hobbies%3A%20Ashley%20Wagner%20likes%20laser%20tag%2C%20and%20Kaitlyn%20Farrington%20collects%20magnets.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579377284184619114"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "ashley wagner,olympian hobbies,olympics main,sochi,sochi 2014,sochi olympics,team usa,political,general news,living,lifestyle,olympics,snowboarding,soccer,sports,recreation,winter sports,routine general news", "news_keywords": "ashley wagner,olympian hobbies,olympics main,sochi,sochi 2014,sochi olympics,team usa,political,general news,living", "article.headline": "Team USA's odd hobbies: Ashley Wagner likes laser tag, and Kaitlyn Farrington collects magnets.", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AA967_CC1_E_20140211224619.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AA967_CC1_D_20140211224619.jpg"}}, "description": "A look at some of Team USA's most common\u2014and weirdest\u2014hobbies; Ashley Wagner likes laser tag, and Kaitlyn Farrington collects magnets.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303874504579377284184619114&headline=Team%20USA%26apos%3Bs%20odd%20hobbies%3A%20Ashley%20Wagner%20likes%20laser%20tag%2C%20and%20Kaitlyn%20Farrington%20collects%20magnets.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579377284184619114", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Sports", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "A look at some of Team USA's most common\u2014and weirdest\u2014hobbies; Ashley Wagner likes laser tag, and Kaitlyn Farrington collects magnets.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-12T00:21:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-55cd", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"embed_count": 1, "image_count": 1, "word_count": 183, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A look at some of Team USA's most common\u2014and weirdest\u2014hobbies; Ashley Wagner likes laser tag, and Kaitlyn Farrington collects magnets.", "title": "Commissariat of Calculation: The Hobbies of Team USA", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579377284184619114", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AA967_CC1_G_20140211224619.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Commissariat of Calculation: The Hobbies of Team USA", "article.type": "2014 Winter Olympics", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303874504579377284184619114", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-12T00:21:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4b1\"", "article_summary": "But it turns out the members of Team USA have hobbies like any other red-blooded American\u2014assuming that red-blooded American is incredibly sporty.\nENLARGE Team USA luger Kate Hansen lists dancing as a hobby.\nThe Journal combed through the online profiles of 170 U.S. Olympians and compiled the most commonly listed hobbies.\nOf the 10 most common hobbies, only reading, fishing and golfing can be described as leisurely activity.\nGetty ImagesMost people probably assume that when they aren't competing, Olympians spend the rest of their waking time practicing, working out and consuming protein shakes."}
