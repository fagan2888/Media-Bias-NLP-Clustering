Secondary loan prices are languishing at four-year lows as China\u2019s economic slowdown, low oil prices and interest rate increases boost uncertainty and volatility.\n\nThe average bid on the SMi 100 composite of most actively-traded loans was 96.25 on Wednesday after trading at 100 in April 2015. This is encouraging investors to buy discounted loans in the secondary market rather than buying new primary loans at face value.\n\n\u201cThe seismic change is that investors do not feel as desperate or compelled to buy new issues,\u201d said Jeff Cohen, head of U.S. Loan Capital Markets at Credit Suisse. \u201cThey\u2019re comfortable sitting on the sidelines and maybe think the market could even get a little cheaper. They\u2019re going to be highly selective.\u201d\n\nDifficult market conditions are prompting bankers to ask for more flexibility on deal structure as well as pricing when underwriting new loans. Arrangers now need the ability to widen Original Issue Discounts (OIDs) on new loans to around 90% of face value, wider than around 97%, which was standard six months ago.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m underwriting a deal today, I\u2019m going to have covenants on anything with some cyclicality or a small deal,\u201d a second senior investment banker said.\n\nArranging banks need more flexibility when it comes to pricing and the ability to add covenants and prohibit the ability to raise additional debt through incremental baskets and make restricted payments, the second senior banker said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t assume the market will stay the same or be better,\u201d said a second banker. \u201cWe simply have to have more flexibility in our underwriting versus what we were providing to issuers last year at this time.\u201d\n\nInvestors have been able to win further concessions in other deals, including extending call protection or requiring companies to use more money from excess cash to pay down debt and more changes are surfacing.\n\nBusiness technology provider Endurance International Group increased annual amortizing repayments to 2% from 1% on a US$735m term loan backing its acquisition of online marketing firm Constant Contact this week, which will accelerate repayment.\n\nAdding financial covenants and accelerating amortizing repayments is still fairly rare and currently reserved for low-rated issuers, the second banker said, adding that covenants could become more prevalent than they currently are if the market continues to flounder.\n\n\u201cFor a normal non-cyclical credit we are not going to go back to covenants and restrictive terms and conditions,\u201d the first banker said. \u201cAt least not yet.\u201d\n\n(Editing By Tessa Walsh and Michelle Sierra; Additional reporting by Lynn Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/04/Investors-ask-extra-covenants-US-leveraged-loan-pricing-rises", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worried investors are calling for tighter terms and conditions on", "title": "Investors ask for extra covenants as U.S. leveraged loan pricing rises"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/04/Investors-ask-extra-covenants-US-leveraged-loan-pricing-rises", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worried investors are calling for tighter terms and conditions on", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Extra covenants were added this week to an US$865m leveraged loan which backed Mattress Firm Holding\u2019s purchase of rival mattress company Sleepy\u2019s.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t assume the market will stay the same or be better,\u201d said a second banker.\nInvestors are able to demand extra covenants for the first time in many years.\nThis is encouraging investors to buy discounted loans in the secondary market rather than buying new primary loans at face value.\n\u201cFor a normal non-cyclical credit we are not going to go back to covenants and restrictive terms and conditions,\u201d the first banker said."}
