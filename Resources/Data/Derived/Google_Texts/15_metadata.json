Exhibit A, of course, is the now-debunked UVA fraternity gang-rape hoax concocted in the disturbed minds of Rolling Stone reporter and radical feminist Sabrina Rubin Erdely, along with some love-struck, not-really-gang-raped coed.\n\nSalon.com\u2019s Valerie Tarico is in the same camp. She is the anti-Christian gift that keeps on giving. She hates Christ. She hates men. And she hates the women who love them.\n\nA year ago I wrote a column featuring Tarico\u2019s claim that Christianity was \u201cgoing down,\u201d a tired fantasy the pagan left has trotted out annually since the year 0001.\n\nWell, just before Christmas Tarico one-upped herself. The liberal impulse to conjoin the illegitimate twins of Christ hating with man hating evidently proved more than she could bear. In a Dec. 21 Salon screed headlined, \u201cWhy rape is so intrinsic to religion,\u201d Tarico gratuitously, and despicably, asserts that God raped Mary.\n\n\u201cPowerful gods and demi-gods impregnating human women \u2013 it\u2019s a common theme in the history of religion, and it\u2019s more than a little rapey,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cThe impregnation process may be a \u2018ravishing\u2019 or seduction or some kind of titillating but nonsexual procreative penetration,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn order to create the illusion that she is comprehensively \u201canti-religion,\u201d rather than fundamentally anti-Christian, Tarico then pays lip service to a number of mythological stories involving Zeus, Jupiter, Buddha and others, before finally zeroing in on the true targets of her sniping: Christ, Mary and God the Father.\n\n\u201cThough the earliest Christians had a competing story,\u201d she writes, \u201cin the Gospel of Luke, the Virgin Mary gets pregnant when the spirit of the Lord comes upon her and the power of the Most High overshadows her. \u2026\n\n\u201cMary assents after being not asked but told by a powerful supernatural being what is going to happen to her, \u2018Behold the bond slave of the Lord: be it done to me \u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cWho needs consent, freely given? If he\u2019s a god, she\u2019s got to want it, right? That is how the stories play out.\n\n\u201cWhether or not the delectable young thing puts up a protest, whether or not seduction requires deception, whether or not the woman already has a husband or love, whether or not she is physically forced, the basic assumption is that the union between a god and a woman is overwhelming in an orgasmic way, not a bloody, head-bashed-against-the-ground kind of way. And afterwards? Well, what woman wouldn\u2019t want to be pregnant with the son or daughter of a god?\u201d\n\nAfter a few disjointed paragraphs suggesting that the biblical account of Christ\u2019s conception really \u201croots all the way back to evolutionary biology\u201d and men\u2019s need to \u201cmaximize their genes,\u201d Tarico blends together nicely her hateful feminist representation of God, the divine rapist, with a more temporal, down to earth bout of good ol\u2019 fashioned man-bashing.\n\n\u201cPowerful men not only want to control the valuable commodity of female fertility, they should. Gods ordain it and model it. And they prescribe punishments for those \u2013 especially females \u2013 who violate the proper order of things,\u201d she asserts.\n\nAnd then the train wreck goes completely off the rails.\n\n\u201cWithin a society that treats female sexuality as a male possession [snicker], the only consent that can be violated is the consent of a woman\u2019s owner, the man with the rights to her reproductive capacity \u2013 typically her father, fianc\u00e9, or husband [double snicker]. Many Christians are surprised when told that nowhere in the Bible, either Old Testament or New, does any writer say that a woman\u2019s consent is necessary or even desirable before sex.\n\n\u201cThis omission is more than regrettable, it is tragic,\u201d she bellows.\n\nThe not-so-thinly-veiled implication here is that Christianity and, by extension, Christians, especially Christian men, not only fails to condemn rape, but that it actually encourages it. To say that this notion strains credulity is generous. In that the Bible is abundantly clear in both the Old and New Testaments that sexual behavior is only permissible and moral within the loving bonds of natural male-female marriage, it is absurd to suggest, as does Tarico, that the Holy Scriptures somehow condone rape. Let alone Christ\u2019s central admonition that we \u201cdo unto others\u201d as we would have them do unto us. Such rubbish betrays this woman\u2019s visceral animus toward Christianity.\n\nTarico then goes on to make up, whole cloth, a bunch more crap.\n\n\u201cBut even closer to home for many is the shocking prevalence on college campuses and in society at large of sexual manipulation and coercion perpetrated by males who otherwise seem morally intact. One can\u2019t help but notice that a large number of high profile cases involve high status males: fraternity members, a famous actor, a radio host, small town football stars and big league professional athletes \u2013 men, in other words, who think they are gods.\u201d\n\nUm, actually, Val, one can \u201chelp but notice\u201d \u201ca large number of high profile\u201d rape cases. Because, though rape certainly does occur and is always insidious when it does, such high profile cases are isolated, rare and, quite frequently, ultimately debunked (e.g., Duke Lacrosse, UVA, et. al.).\n\nMoreover, and as University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Harlan Reynolds recently pointed out in USA Today, \u201cIn fact, rape on college campuses is \u2013 like rape everywhere else in America \u2013 plummeting in frequency.\u201d\n\nEven so, left-wing extremists like Valerie Tarico never let the facts get in the way of a good false narrative.\n\nThis very angry, hurting-on-the-inside woman then closes her fictional missive with a man-thumping, God-hating twofer: \u201cConvinced of their own deific qualities, it just follows that the object of their [men's] attentions has gotta want it \u2013 and if she doesn\u2019t, well, that\u2019s fine too, because when a god wants a woman, consent isn\u2019t really part of the story.\u201d\n\nOther than truth, the only thing being raped here are the minds of those who consent to read Valerie Tarico\u2019s propagandist twaddle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the secular lefts latest windmills at which to tilt is Americas fanciful rape culture. .05/27/2016 7:50:36AM EST.", "author": "Matt Barber", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "One of the secular lefts latest windmills at which to tilt is Americas fanciful rape culture.", "title": "- Anti-Christian Activist: God Raped Mary", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2015/01/05/antichristian-activist-god-raped-mary-n1938582", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/220/647cc2d3-c9fc-4b1a-8179-3d00ab68814a.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "One of the secular lefts latest windmills at which to tilt is Americas fanciful rape culture.", "title": "- Anti-Christian Activist: God Raped Mary", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2015/01/05/antichristian-activist-god-raped-mary-n1938582", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/220/647cc2d3-c9fc-4b1a-8179-3d00ab68814a.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Anti-Christian Activist: God Raped Mary, Matt Barber, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In a Dec. 21 Salon screed headlined, \u201cWhy rape is so intrinsic to religion,\u201d Tarico gratuitously, and despicably, asserts that God raped Mary.\nThe liberal impulse to conjoin the illegitimate twins of Christ hating with man hating evidently proved more than she could bear.\n\u201cThe impregnation process may be a \u2018ravishing\u2019 or seduction or some kind of titillating but nonsexual procreative penetration,\u201d she adds.\nBecause, though rape certainly does occur and is always insidious when it does, such high profile cases are isolated, rare and, quite frequently, ultimately debunked (e.g., Duke Lacrosse, UVA, et.\nShe is the anti-Christian gift that keeps on giving."}
