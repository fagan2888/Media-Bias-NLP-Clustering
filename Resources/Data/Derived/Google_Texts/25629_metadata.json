Greg Marino/H&M\n\nTo the stylish set headed to Coachella this weekend: don\u2019t worry if you forget to pack your crop top. H&M will be selling not one but two belly-baring shirts on the festival grounds, plus a fringe-lined robe and a pair of floral flared pants.\n\nThe fast fashion retailer has saved seven pieces from its H&M Loves Coachella capsule collection exclusively for its on-site pop-up shop open to the thousands of festivalgoers. The garments range in price from $24.95 to $149.\n\nRead More: Coachella Is Next in Brand Frenzy for Music Festival Fans\n\n\u201cCoachella has become one of the most fashionable festivals in the world,\u201d says Daniel Kulle, president of H&M North America. \u201cWe want to be where our customers are.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Coachella, held at the Empire Polo Club in southern California has become as much about fashion as it is about music.

The retailer created its first festival capsule collection, called H&M Loves Coachella, and released it to 350 of its North American stores in March as a way to broaden and prolong its festival partnership. The push makes sense, given the spend-readiness of festival attendees. Nearly 8 in 10 festivalgoers purchased something to prepare for a festival, according to Live Nation\u2019s Festival Report. Two thirds bought clothing, while half bought shoes.\n\nRead More: Listen to a 12 Hour Mix of 160 Coachella Artists\n\nAnd when festivalgoers flock to the desert this weekend for the start of Coachella, a handful of exclusive pieces await. It is not the expected festival sartorial fare of oversized concert T-shirts and baseball caps. In fact, none of it even says Coachella. Instead, the pieces are on-trend looks for summer, including a pair of white lace shorts and a matching crop top. By purchasing the clothing, Mr. Kulle says, \u201cyou\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m here.\u2019\u201d\n\nTake a look at the exclusive festival pieces from H&M below and share your thoughts in the comments\n\nH&M designs sold exclusively at Coachella this year Greg Marino/H&M\n\nBeaded crop top by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&M\n\nLace Beach Coverup by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&M\n\nFloral Robe by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&M\n\nBeaded shorts by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&M", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Festival goers will be able to spruce up their wardrobe in between listening to music.", "title": "H&M Launching Pop Up at Coachella: See the Pieces (Exclusive)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/04/08/hm-launching-pop-up-at-coachella-see-the-pieces-exclusive/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HT655_This04_G_20150407113535.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "H&M Launching Pop Up at Coachella: See the Pieces (Exclusive)", "description": "Festival goers will be able to spruce up their wardrobe in between listening to music.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Elizabeth Holmes", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Festival goers will be able to spruce up their wardrobe in between listening to music.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-08T14:30:30-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/04/08/hm-launching-pop-up-at-coachella-see-the-pieces-exclusive/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-87856", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Festival goers will be able to spruce up their wardrobe in between listening to music.", "title": "H&M Launching Pop Up at Coachella: See the Pieces (Exclusive)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/04/08/hm-launching-pop-up-at-coachella-see-the-pieces-exclusive/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HT655_This04_G_20150407113535.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-87856", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-08T15:22:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb171\"", "article_summary": "By purchasing the clothing, Mr. Kulle says, \u201cyou\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m here.\u2019\u201dTake a look at the exclusive festival pieces from H&M below and share your thoughts in the commentsH&M designs sold exclusively at Coachella this year Greg Marino/H&MBeaded crop top by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&MLace Beach Coverup by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&MFloral Robe by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&MBeaded shorts by H&M to be sold exclusively at Coachella H&M\nH&M design sold exclusively at the Coachella festival this year.\nThe fast fashion retailer has saved seven pieces from its H&M Loves Coachella capsule collection exclusively for its on-site pop-up shop open to the thousands of festivalgoers.\nRead More: Listen to a 12 Hour Mix of 160 Coachella ArtistsAnd when festivalgoers flock to the desert this weekend for the start of Coachella, a handful of exclusive pieces await.\nGreg Marino/H&MTo the stylish set headed to Coachella this weekend: don\u2019t worry if you forget to pack your crop top."}
