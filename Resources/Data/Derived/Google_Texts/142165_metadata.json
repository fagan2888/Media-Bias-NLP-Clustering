Andy Harris said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he wanted us to solve this problem as Americans; he wanted to solve it as Democrats versus Republicans.\u201d\n\nHarris, Maryland\u2019s sole Republican congressman, faulted the president for making a \u201cstraw man\u201d attempt to unilaterally expand federal background checks in gun sales through heightened firearm licensing requirements and more FBI staff to process applications.\n\nSpeaking during a monthly \u201cConversations With Conservatives\u201d panel on Capitol Hill, Harris noted that despite Maryland\u2019s stringent gun laws, including a seven-day waiting period following a background check, 2015 marked Baltimore\u2019s deadliest year relative to its population.\n\nThe city saw the highest per capita homicide rate in its history, with 344 murders. Guns were used in nearly 90 percent of them.\n\n\u201cBackground checks don\u2019t solve the problem\u2014they don\u2019t solve it in Maryland, they don\u2019t solve it in Chicago, and they didn\u2019t solve it in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Harris said.\n\nInstead, he said, the Obama administration should work with Congress to fix the nation\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d mental health system.\n\nObama\u2019s executive actions, detailed in an emotional speech Tuesday at the White House, include a $500 million request to increase access to mental health care.\n\nBut Harris said the White House\u2019s approach just \u201cthrows more money\u201d at the problem, rather than structurally reforming how mental health care is delivered in the U.S.\n\n>>> Psychologist Congressman Prescribes Mental Health Fix for Mass Shootings\n\nRep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., who worked as a psychologist for three decades before coming to Washington, is moving a bill to overhaul the mental health care system. Murphy criticized the president for legislating from the executive branch and said Obama should instead support the reforms in his legislation.\n\n\u201cThere is a big difference between funding \u2018mental health programs\u2019 and enacting reforms addressing serious mental illness,\u201d Murphy said Tuesday in a formal statement. \u201cMore money into our disastrously failed and antiquated system will only result in more lives lost.\u201d\n\nHarris said if Obama truly wanted to solve the nation\u2019s mental health issues, he would encourage Democrats to sign on to Murphy\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cI would hope the president doesn\u2019t just want this to be a soap box issue and actually wants to solve the problem,\u201d Harris said.\n\n>>> The Facts Behind 4 of Obama\u2019s Claims on Guns", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
