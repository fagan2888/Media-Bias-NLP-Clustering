George R.R. Martin, the only mortal who can tell us the fate of Westeros, is stepping away from HBO’s upcoming season of “Game of Thrones.” Although he has written an episode for every season of the hit show thus far, in an interview with Vulture, the writer said he won’t pen any scripts for season five “because I have this book to finish.”

The book he is referring to, of course, is “The Winds of Winter,” the eagerly anticipated sixth installment of the “Song of Ice and Fire” series upon which “Game of Thrones” is based. Martin’s book editor hoped it would be out “reasonably soon” a few months ago, but sitting out the entire season’s development suggests there’s still a little while until there’s a publication date. It’s nice to know, however, that Martin is prioritizing the book, as the show is currently expected to outpace the seven-book series (Season 5 includes material from Martin’s fourth and fifth books, “A Feast for Crows” and “A Dance with Dragons”).
