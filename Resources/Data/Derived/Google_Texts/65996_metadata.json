Deductibles are a specific dollar amount you\u2019re required to contribute each year toward certain covered medical expenses.\u201cIf you\u2019re healthy and rarely see the doctor, chances are that you won\u2019t have to pay your full deductible this year, but make sure that you can afford your deductible in case of a serious illness or injury,\u201d McLean said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have money in the bank to cover your deductible, tuck away a bit each month until you do.\u201dDeductibles are still quite costly, so consumers should be prepared to start saving for them. They range from $1,000 a year for gold plans, $2,000 to $3,000 for silver plans to $5,000 to $6,000 for bronze plans, said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, Calif. non-profit organization focusing on national health issues. Consumers tend to just look at the cost of the monthly premium when they are choosing a plan, but need to determine if they can pay for the deductible, she said.\u201cThese are still very high deductible plans,\u201d Pollitz said. \u201cYou are buying health insurance in case you get sick. You need to take into account the cost sharing you might have to pay. It doesn\u2019t take much to incur a four figure medical bill.\u201dIf you are receiving subsidies for your plan, you will need to reconcile them on your federal tax return next year . Consumers who were approved for government subsidies to help cover their monthly health insurance premiums need to keep in mind that the subsidies you receive this year are based on your estimated income for this year. If you earn more than expected, you could potentially have to pay back some of those subsidies when you complete your federal tax return for the year, McLean said.Since more than 85% of Americans will qualify for some financial assistance for their plan, if your salary increases, it is best to adjust your estimate soon. This way you don\u2019t wind up owing too much money when you file for taxes, because you will have to pay back the subsidies, Pollitz said. Even if you make too much money to qualify for a subsidy right now, it is crucial to purchase health insurance, because if you currently have coverage and you wind up making less money, you can qualify for a subsidy, she said.\u201cWhen in doubt, it is a good idea to buy insurance,\u201d Pollitz said. The tax penalty is also increasing each year for people who don\u2019t purchase a plan. In 2015, the penalty is 2% of your income or $325 for each adult, and in 2016 it increase to 2.5% of your income or $695 per adult.Check to see how much your out-of-pocket maximum amount is since it can be quite high, said Hector De La Torre, executive director for Transamerica Center for Health Studies, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit group. This is the most you will pay during a policy period before your health insurance begins to pay 100% of the allowed amount.\u201cThis limit never includes your premium or balance-billed charges,\u201d he said. \u201cSome health insurance plans don\u2019t count all of your co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance payments or out-of-network payments toward this limit.\u201d\n\n--Written by Ellen Chang for MainStreet", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Navigating the rules of your new health insurance plan to figure out the coverage and costs can be daunting.", "author": "Ellen Chang", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Navigating the rules of your new health insurance plan to figure out the coverage and costs can be daunting.", "title": "What to Know About Your New Health Insurance Plan and Coverage", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/what-to-know-about-your-new-health-insurance-plan-and-coverage", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancepolicy-0106.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancepolicy-0106.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "HMO, PPO, deductible, copayment, subsidy, health insurance, open enrollment", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "open enrollment", "published_time": "2015-01-09T09:53Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611359"}, "date": "2015-01-09T09:53Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13005462, "twitter": {"description": "Navigating the rules of your new health insurance plan to figure out the coverage and costs can be daunting.", "title": "What to Know About Your New Health Insurance Plan and Coverage", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/what-to-know-about-your-new-health-insurance-plan-and-coverage", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancepolicy-0106.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancepolicy-0106.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "HMO, PPO, deductible, copayment, subsidy, health insurance, open enrollment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd5cb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSome health insurance plans don\u2019t count all of your co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance payments or out-of-network payments toward this limit.\u201d--Written by Ellen Chang for MainStreet\n\u201cYou are buying health insurance in case you get sick.\nThis is the most you will pay during a policy period before your health insurance begins to pay 100% of the allowed amount.\u201cThis limit never includes your premium or balance-billed charges,\u201d he said.\nConsumers who were approved for government subsidies to help cover their monthly health insurance premiums need to keep in mind that the subsidies you receive this year are based on your estimated income for this year.\nEven if you make too much money to qualify for a subsidy right now, it is crucial to purchase health insurance, because if you currently have coverage and you wind up making less money, you can qualify for a subsidy, she said.\u201cWhen in doubt, it is a good idea to buy insurance,\u201d Pollitz said."}
