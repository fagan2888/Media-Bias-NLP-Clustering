Circuit to overturn the rules, saying the EPA\u2019s tightened standards for ozone emissions are unworkable and will be a major pain to businesses already struggling to comply with rules issued in the previous decade.\n\nIt joins cases on immigration, Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive policies and several other lawsuits against the EPA, all of which are winding their way through the courts and will serve as either an endorsement or rebuke of President Obama\u2019s expansive use of executive authority to try to force through his agenda.\n\n\u201cA lot of the Obama legacy is in the hands of the courts,\u201d said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBecause of the congressional dysfunction, President Obama has expanded the use of executive orders, and many of these issues are now under litigation.\u201d\n\nImmigration has emerged as the biggest of the fights. Mr. Obama claimed powers last year to grant a deportation amnesty, work permits and Social Security cards to more than 5 million illegal immigrants without the approval of Congress. The policy has been halted by an appeals court, which said Mr. Obama was breaking immigration laws with his expansive claim of power.\n\nThe president\u2019s attorneys are seeking a speedy review in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt looks almost certain that the Supreme Court will take the immigration case,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nAlso on immigration, Mr. Obama has asked an appeals court to overrule a lower-court judge who said immigration agents were mistreating children caught at the border by putting them in dormitory-style detention facilities with their parents.\n\nOn Obamacare, a federal judge has allowed a lawsuit by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to go forward. The lawsuit says Mr. Obama spent money that Congress specifically zeroed out of the annual budget \u2014 a strike at Capitol Hill\u2019s power of the purse.\n\nNext to come could be challenges to detaining terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. Mr. Obama could claim powers to close the detention facility despite legislation passed by Congress \u2014 and signed by the president himself \u2014 specifically forbidding it.\n\nAsked at his year-end press conference whether he believes he has the authority to transfer Guantanamo detainees unilaterally, the president said he would give Congress one more chance to heed his will.\n\n\u201cAs I said \u2014 and I think you\u2019ve seen me on a whole bunch of issues like immigration \u2014 I\u2019m not going to be forward-leaning on what I can do without Congress before I\u2019ve tested what I can do with Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nBut nowhere has the president been as active as on the environment, where previous rulings affirmed broad jurisdiction for the EPA.\n\nThe ozone lawsuit challenges EPA rules announced in October lowering the amount of allowable ground-level ozone, a common air pollutant, from 75 parts per billion to 70. The EPA says reducing the level will result in fewer premature deaths, fewer missed work and school days, and fewer asthma attacks.\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers also denounced the EPA rules Wednesday and said it would join the litigation.\n\nOther recently announced lawsuits over EPA actions include challenges from states and groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute to the agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan, the first national set of limits on carbon pollution from power plants.\n\nMore than a dozen states have won a halt to the EPA\u2019s Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, rules, designed to give the federal government a say in land-use and permitting decisions across millions of acres.\n\nMr. Shapiro said it\u2019s notable that parties like states, and not just industry groups, are suing over actions from the EPA, warranting more attention from the courts. In 2009, Congress rejected a cap-and-trade scheme for power plants akin to what the EPA proposed in October.\n\n\u201cThe EPA has really stretched itself and pushed itself to the limit,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.\n\nAlden Abbott, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said that although some high-profile issues are tied up in courts, many of Mr. Obama\u2019s actions will hinge on what the next president does with them and that a Republican president could have the opportunity to reverse things.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cThere can be a couple of court decisions, but a lot really depends on the nature of the new president as to how these executive actions turn out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's ground-level ozone standards, marking yet another Obama administration policy likely to be decided in the courts rather than on Capitol Hill.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ground-level ozone standards, marking yet another Obama administration policy likely to be decided in the courts rather than on Capitol Hill.", "title": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce challenging new EPA ozone standard in court", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/23/us-chamber-of-commerce-challenging-new-epa-ozone-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/23/Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/23/Obama.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's ground-level ozone standards, marking yet another Obama administration policy likely to be", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce challenging new EPA ozone standard in court"}, "Author": "David Sherfinski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Environmental Protection Agency"}, "article_summary": "The ozone lawsuit challenges EPA rules announced in October lowering the amount of allowable ground-level ozone, a common air pollutant, from 75 parts per billion to 70.\nThe National Association of Manufacturers also denounced the EPA rules Wednesday and said it would join the litigation.\nThe policy has been halted by an appeals court, which said Mr. Obama was breaking immigration laws with his expansive claim of power.\nThe Chamber said it was joining other business groups to ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.\n\u201cBecause of the congressional dysfunction, President Obama has expanded the use of executive orders, and many of these issues are now under litigation.\u201dImmigration has emerged as the biggest of the fights."}
