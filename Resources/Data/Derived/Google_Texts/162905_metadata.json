Burwell looming, the healthcare reform conversation has focused on the fate of federal subsidies for insurance premiums initiated by the Affordable Care Act,\" he said Thursday. \"However, this puts the focus on the symptoms of our ailing healthcare system and ignores the root cause.\"\n\n\"It is vitally important that we first address the primary driver of unaffordable premiums under Obamacare \u2014 onerous insurance regulations,\" he added.\n\nSo far, House GOP leaders haven't tipped their hand on exactly how they would respond. But on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, indicated that Republicans would be looking for ways to provide \"peace of mind\" to people who lose subsidies, and said the GOP wants to increase choices for people instead of protecting Obamacare.\n\n\"[T]he plan we're working on will focus on protecting the American people \u2014 offering new choices for quality, affordable healthcare \u2014 not protecting this failed law,\" he said. \"Yesterday, we had a constructive meeting with our members, and received good feedback that'll help inform us as we continue to develop our plan.\"\n\nGosar's bill would eliminate key Obamacare insurance requirements, and follows a recommendation put out by the Heritage Foundation in May.\n\nOne of these requirements prevents insurers from charging older people more than three times the premiums of younger people.\n\nAnother mandate requires insurers to cover a wide range of \"essential health benefits,\" which Heritage says has increased insurance premiums by an average of 9 percent. A third mandate sets minimum amounts that plans must pay for covered services, another factor that Heritage says has led to higher insurance rates.\n\nAll of these mandates would be eliminated in Gosar's bill, and Gosar said those changes would save younger people 44 percent in their premiums, and would save people close to retirement 7 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of House Republicans thinks that if the Supreme Court strips federal Obamacare subsidies from the more than 30 states using the federal insurance exchange, Congress should respond by exempting those states from some of the toughest Affordable Care Act mandates.\nThe idea from Rep.
