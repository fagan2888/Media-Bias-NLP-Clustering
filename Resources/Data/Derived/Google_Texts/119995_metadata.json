The Forum on Graduate Rights, a non-university-affiliated student group at MU, organized the rally.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page. Screen Name or Email Password Forgot?

Wolfe resigned Monday after a month of students calling for his removal and saying he had been negligent in dealing with race issues on campus.\n\nMU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin on Monday also said he would resign from his position. Loftin will transition to a research role with MU on Jan. 1.\n\nEric Scott, a graduate student with the Forum on Graduate Rights, said Wolfe\u2019s and Loftin\u2019s resignations were not enough.\n\n\u201cA few personnel changes does not change the fundamental problems of this university,\u201d Scott told the crowd. \u201cTomorrow, we need to wake up, and we need to keep working.\u201d\n\nTimothy Love, a graduate student in the English department, spoke during the rally and called for more diversity and inclusion curriculum.\n\nMU officials in October said incoming students will be required to complete diversity and inclusion training starting in January. Loftin said in an interview last month the training likely would involve an online module.\n\nLove said there should be a mandatory course where students receive a grade.\n\n\u201cWe must make an interdisciplinary, bipartisan effort to address racial injustice\u201d and \u201cto elevate compassion and empathy,\u201d Love said. \u201cCompassion and empathy should be part of our curriculum.\u201d\n\nScott said the Forum on Graduate Rights is obligated to stand up for the rights of all of its constituents, adding that Concerned Student 1950 includes several graduate students.\n\n\u201cWe want to point out the intersections between these different problems\u201d on campus, Scott said. \u201cWhile we certainly have lots of problems with the racial climate, there are problems with ableism, with sexism, with homophobia. We want to be sure we\u2019re addressing the needs of all of those communities.\u201d\n\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights formed in August after MU told graduate students it could no longer subsidize health insurance premiums because of an IRS interpretation of the Affordable Care Act. That decision later was revoked, and the group has since advocated for other graduate student benefits, including increased stipends and on-campus child care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"site": "@columbiatribune", "image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/32/4328bb0c-5451-576e-9956-1fc44f28c36c/56436f7539ba8.image.jpg?resize=800%2C533"}, "description": "University of Missouri graduate students held a rally and silent march through Jesse Hall on Tuesday to show support for the Concerned Student 1950 movement and to push for change.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MU graduate students rally to support Concerned Student 1950 movement"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "University of Missouri graduate students held a rally and silent march through Jesse Hall on Tuesday to show support for the Concerned Student 1950 movement and to push for change.", "title": "MU graduate students rally to support Concerned Student 1950 movement", "url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/education/mu-graduate-students-rally-to-support-concerned-student-movement/article_3e0fe92e-a158-5de6-8e5b-8676646dccdb.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/32/4328bb0c-5451-576e-9956-1fc44f28c36c/56436f7539ba8.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C666", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "university of missouri,concerned student 1950,graduate students,rally,jesse hall,activism,forum on graduate rights,tim wolfe,r. bowen loftin,race at mu", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "University of Missouri graduate students held a rally and silent march through Jesse Hall on Tuesday to show support for the Concerned Student 1950 movement and to push for change."}, "article_summary": "Eric Scott, a graduate student with the Forum on Graduate Rights, said Wolfe\u2019s and Loftin\u2019s resignations were not enough.\nThat decision later was revoked, and the group has since advocated for other graduate student benefits, including increased stipends and on-campus child care.\nUniversity of Missouri graduate students held a rally and silent march through Jesse Hall on Tuesday to show support for the Concerned Student 1950 movement and to push for change.\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights, a non-university-affiliated student group at MU, organized the rally.\n\u201cCompassion and empathy should be part of our curriculum.\u201dScott said the Forum on Graduate Rights is obligated to stand up for the rights of all of its constituents, adding that Concerned Student 1950 includes several graduate students."}
