And that federal money has seen significant reductions. From fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013, across all programs, Public Health lost about $25 million in federal money. And that drop has continued.\n\nThe state budget recently delivered good news for Georgia public health: an overall increase in funding.\n\nBut behind those numbers are other numbers that have alarmed public health officials.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the overall budget for the Department of Public Health comes from federal grants. And that federal money has seen significant reductions.\n\nFrom fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013, across all programs, Public Health lost about $25 million in federal money. And that drop has continued.\n\nAlmost all Health and Human Services and Homeland Security grants have been cut, said Dr. Patrick O\u2019Neal, director of health protection for the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to see ongoing [federal] cuts,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Neal told GHN in a recent interview. \u201cIt keeps us up at night.\u201d\n\nAll states have suffered federal reductions to public health programs, according to the American Public Health Association.\n\nBut some states, such as Georgia, that are much more dependent on federal dollars have been hit hardest.\n\nO\u2019Neal says state programs affected include those for emergency preparedness, immunizations, laboratory services, epidemiology, disease surveillance and health promotion.\n\nThe federal budget cuts began about four years ago, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. The budget deal struck last year moderated these reductions somewhat, but eventually \u201cwe go back to fairly draconian cuts,\u2019\u2019 Benjamin told GHN on Friday.\n\nThe nation has lost about 42,000 jobs in government public health over the last five years as a result of reductions in federal and local spending, Benjamin added.\n\nThe impact has hit vaccinations, infrastructure for local health departments, programs targeting chronic diseases, and research projects, he said.\n\nPublic health departments have become less able to respond quickly to outbreaks of food-borne illness, he said.\n\nWhat about the future impact of federal reductions?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pessimistic about it,\u2019\u2019 Benjamin said.\n\n\u201cPublic health folks are not very good at yelling and screaming,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just suck it up and do the job.\u201d\n\nFears about HIV patients\n\nDespite some gains from the Affordable Care Act, Benjamin said, \u201cyou\u2019ll still need a very robust public health system. Medical doctors don\u2019t do restaurant inspections, air quality tests.\u201d\n\nPublic health officials are the responders to infectious disease outbreaks, he added, and oversee safety for all citizens, such as protecting water quality.\n\n\u201cPublic health is for everybody; it\u2019s not just for the underserved,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\nIn recent years, the individual states\u2019 budget actions \u2013 partly a result of the recession \u2013 haven\u2019t helped the situation. From fiscal 2008 to 2012, the median per capita state spending on public health decreased from $33.71 to $27.40. This represents a cut of more than $1.15 billion, based on the states\u2019 total combined budgets from those years, according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health.\n\nIn Georgia, the creation of the Department of Public Health helped stanch that bleeding, along with the agency\u2019s strong leadership.\n\nBut O\u2019Neal notes that as federal budget cuts occur, public health employees\u2019 benefits costs keep rising.\n\nThe CDC recently removed about $3.7 million in HIV prevention funding from the state, and transferred that amount plus $800,000 to Fulton County\u2019s health department. That switch was intended to focus more resources on where the disease is hitting hardest, in metro Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe certainly have had some complaints from rural counties, but overall I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a tremendous impact,\u201d O\u2019Neal said.\n\nYet he added that he is worried about federal funding for HIV/AIDS, which comes through the Ryan White program.\n\n(White was a young Indiana hemophiliac who contracted HIV through a transfusion and became a symbol of the national AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. He died in 1990.)\n\nThe money from the program, among other things, funds the ADAP program \u2013 providing prescription drug assistance and other help for people with HIV. At one time, Georgia had the longest waiting list for the ADAP program in the United States, but eliminated that waiting list in 2012.\n\nJeff Graham of Georgia Equality said that with the state not expanding its Medicaid program, the majority of Georgians with HIV will remain reliant on Ryan White funding for their medical care. Under the ACA, states get extra federal funding for expanding Medicaid to cover more low-income people, but Gov. Nathan Deal and legislative leaders say it would still be too expensive for Georgia.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to say what will happen three or four years down the road,\u201d Graham said. \u201cShould Congress begin to shift funds from Ryan White to other programs or cut Ryan White funding, then the state would be expected to fill that gap.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile the state has had a commitment to stable funding for its share of ADAP, it is extremely unlikely that they would come up with the tens of millions needed to replace Ryan White funds.\u201d\n\nSee more at: http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2014/04/drop-federal-funds-squeezes-public-health/#sthash.Z8MevJCL.dpuf", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Federal Funds Drop Squeezes Public Health", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "About 70 percent of the overall budget for the Department of Public Health comes from federal grants.
