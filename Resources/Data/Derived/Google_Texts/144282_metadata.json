Only one in seven Mexican new mothers breastfeed their children, making their rates one of the lowest in Latin America. Baby formulas will still be available to be purchased in shops and also can be supplied by a doctor\u2019s request. This isn\u2019t the first time that Mexico has tried to encourage more breastfeeding.\n\nMillions of people in the country live in poverty and consume water that is contaminated. The best way for children in Mexico to receive nutrients that they need is from breastfeeding. The issue of poverty has to do also with women who are in the workplace. Many Mexican businesses do not allow women to nurse or pump, making it difficult for women to give vital nutrients to their children.\n\nEarlier in 2015, Mexico City began a campaign to boost the image of nursing mothers. Unfortunately, the idea received a lot of backlash when the advertisement featured women with perfectly toned bodies posing without tops to promote breastfeeding. The breasts were covered but with captions that stated that women shouldn\u2019t turn their backs on their babies. Rather, they should give their babies their breasts to nurse. The backlash was from mothers who didn\u2019t want to be known as bad mothers if they aren\u2019t breastfeeding or can\u2019t breastfeed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age and can potentially continue up to 2 years of age or beyond. Children in countries like Mexico who have a high poverty rate have a higher rate of death for children. Feeding children through nursing early on has a positive effect and can help save lives in developing nations like Mexico.\n\nCurrently, only the Dominican Republic has a lower rate of breastfeeding than Mexico, which fell from 22 percent in 2006 to 14 percent in 2012, according to a Health Department survey. The government\u2019s actions may help raise those rates and by extension, would be focusing on the state of public health in the region.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mexico, focusing, public, health, encouraging, breastfeeding, and, banning, free, baby, formula", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mexican authorities have banned free baby formula from being given out at hospitals.", "title": "Mexico Bans Free Baby Formula In Favor Of Breastfeeding", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mexico-focusing-public-health-encouraging-breastfeeding-and-banning-free-baby-formula-347764", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/13/shutterstock261838457.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mexican authorities have banned free baby formula from being given out at hospitals.", "title": "Mexico Bans Free Baby Formula In Favor Of Breastfeeding", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mexico-focusing-public-health-encouraging-breastfeeding-and-banning-free-baby-formula-347764", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/13/shutterstock261838457.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/13/shutterstock261838457.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-13T15:39:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-13T15:39:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mexican authorities have banned free baby formula from being given out at hospitals."}, "article_summary": "The effort is to increase breastfeeding rates, which are dangerously low.\nChildren in countries like Mexico who have a high poverty rate have a higher rate of death for children.\nOnly one in seven Mexican new mothers breastfeed their children, making their rates one of the lowest in Latin America.\nThe government\u2019s actions may help raise those rates and by extension, would be focusing on the state of public health in the region.\nThe best way for children in Mexico to receive nutrients that they need is from breastfeeding."}
