India Witches Killed — Five women suspected of witchcraft were killed in India, in the state of Jharkhand, Indian police announced Saturday.

Several people were arrested in connection with the murder in a village, about 45 km from the state capital Ranchi. “The Villagers used sticks and sharp weapons to beat and kill women,” according to local police. “They blamed the victims for the misfortune in the village and the fact that many people are sick.”

The death of a baby earlier this week is also blamed by the villagers on the women killed, said Arun Kumar Singh, an inspector of police in Ranchi.

About 50 people were arrested in connection with the attacks. A large number of police officers were deployed in the village to prevent any outbreak of violence.

The Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Raghubar Das, denounced the act, saying that in the “era of knowledge” such an incident was “unfortunate” and that society should think about it.

Superstitious beliefs are still very strong in several parts of India and have motivated other attacks on women in the state of Jharkhand. From 2000 to 2012, about 2100 people, mostly women, have been killed in India on suspicion of practicing witchcraft, according to national data.
