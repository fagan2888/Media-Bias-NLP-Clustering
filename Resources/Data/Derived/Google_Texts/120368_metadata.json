It was a natural move for her to chronicle her treatment and raise awareness about cancer. Her documentary about her experience won awards. But after attending support groups for cancer patients, she realized a key audience wasn\u2019t getting the message: Latinos. Relatively few were getting treatment or support services. So she set out to help low-income Spanish-speaking cancer victims in need of help.\n\nShe first volunteered with the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, educating Latina women about breast cancer. But she wanted to do more. In September 2003 she founded Latinas Contra Cancer (Latinas Against Cancer), an organization aimed at educating and providing services to low-income Spanish speakers. The issue is critical in the Latino community, Duron says. Cancer is now the leading cause of death among Hispanic Americans, overtaking heart disease, which is still the top killer of whites and African Americans in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\n\n\nOne key reason for the high cancer rate is cultural. Among Hispanics, cancer is still a taboo topic, so they are less likely to get advance cancer screening. Economic barriers are also a challenges\u2014one-third have no health care coverage. \u201cI had access to good health insurance and knew how to research treatments,\u201d says Duron, who has been healthy since she finished treatments in 2000. \u201cSo many Hispanics don\u2019t have the advantages I did.\u201d To help meet these needs, LCC runs cancer education workshops, as well as provides Spanish-language support groups, home visits, phone counseling and help navigating treatment and insurance\n\nAfter launching LCC, Duron continued to work weekdays and evenings, while still maintaining her full-time weekend news anchor job. One of her first moves was to organize a fundraiser\u2014using her news anchor connections, she persuaded local politicians and VIPs to attend by giving them awards. She also sought out regional grants from organizations focused on cancer issues, like the Komen Foundation.\n\n\u201cAs we showed success, we were able to attract others to support us,\u201d says Duron. She recruited local investors and persuaded a businessman to donate a small office space for $250 a month in a good neighborhood in San Francisco. \u201cI was determined to make sure we had a good image,\u201d say Duron. \u201cYou always have to look like you\u2019re a good investment. We don\u2019t operate like a nonprofit with its hand out. We operate like a business.\u201d\n\nLast year she retired from the TV business at age 66 and now devotes all her time to LCC as its CEO and executive director. \u201cI spent 13 years doing two jobs. It\u2019s a pleasure to focus all on my energy on this,\u201d says Duron. Her organization has a $450,000 annual operating budget and nine part-time workers, up from $150,000 and two part-timers its first year and has so far raised more than $2 million. \u201cIt\u2019s still a small organization and we work hard for every dime,\u201d says Duron.\n\nEven so, she is seeking to extend LCC\u2019s services nationally, so it doesn\u2019t just rely on local funding. To bring more recognition to the group, she sits on several national non-profit boards. In 2008 she started the first National Latino Cancer Summit, which brings together health care providers, researchers and community-based agencies. Duron also lobbies on national issues, such as extending Affordable Care Act insurance to more immigrants and including more minority women in cancer research.\n\nSince embarking on her second career, Duron no longer makes a six-figure salary\u2014as executive director of LCC, she earns about $50,000 a year and often uses her own money to cover expenses such as travel for work. But thanks to her pension, savings and Social Security, she still enjoys a comfortable lifestyle, she says\u2014despite living in the expensive Bay Area.\n\nAs for her former life as a broadcaster, she doesn\u2019t miss it. \u201cI had a successful career. I was ready for my next act,\u201d says Duron. \u201cYou need the ganas, the determination and will power to make something like this a success\u2014but this is what I was meant to do.\u201d\n\nYsabel Duron is a Purpose Prize winner.
