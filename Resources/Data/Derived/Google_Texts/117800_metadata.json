Louie Gohmert said Friday on Newsmax TV's \"America's Forum.\"\"In the last 24 hours, the administration has already capitulated on almost every important term and now says they're not going to require verification of what Iran has,\" he said.\"How could you ever have any kind of deal on nuclear talks if you can't even find out where they are at any given time? It's just outrageous. Having met with our allies in the Middle East, they're concerned about the U.S. being trustworthy. If you recall last year, there was a point where Egypt and Saudi Arabia joined forces to have a bombing run in Libya without telling the United States. They know they can't trust us.\"Watch Newsmax TV now onandGet Newsmax TV on your cable system \u2014 Click Here Now\n\nWhile the announcement by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid that he will not seek re-election is celebrated by Republicans, Gohmert says it further diminishes any leverage Reid may have had in trying to convince the president not to go forward with the Iranian deal.\"Now he's going to be a lame duck. They know he's not going to be there and he's going to have even less leverage,\" said Gohmert. \"He's going to be less consequential even if he takes a hardline. One of the problems with Congress is that Democrats will not stand up to Obama. They don't do that anymore.\"Gohmert also expressed disgust over reports that the Pentagon in February quietly declassified a 1987 document containing details about Israel's nuclear deterrence capabilities, further evidence, he said, that the U.S. under Obama is not a trustworthy ally.\"It's outrageous,\" he said. \"The fact that they covered up the information about France, Germany and Italy, makes it very clear this is very personal against Israel, this was done to hurt Israel and this was done to try to back them off and look at the timing. Apparently, the Pentagon quietly declassified this on Feb. 12.\"Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to speak to Congress on Feb. 11, that got moved to March 3 and there were continued pushes by the White House and other groups pushing to have him back off and not come at all. Not only does he not back off, they reschedule for March 3 and the Pentagon quietly declassifies this 397-page report that is just unconscionable. If you'll do this to an ally, you'll do it to anybody.\"According to the Weekly Standard , the report is the first time Israel's nuclear program has ever been \"officially and publicly referenced by the U.S. authorities.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Rep.
