Kelaher, who donned a white smock for the occasion. Kelaher, Councilmen Maurice B. \"Mo\" Hill Jr. and Al Manforti, and Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., were among the aspiring artists who took turns painting panels of the mural Monday.\n\nElizabeth Paseler, winner of $10,000 for her mural design from the Jay and Linda Grunin Foundation, gives Mayor Thomas F.

On Monday, she supervised MacArthur and Kelaher as they painted their panels in the Ocean County Library's Discovery Room.\n\nThe public is invited to paint panels of the mural on Wednesdays, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Thursdays, from 5 to 8 p.m.; and Saturdays, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. There will be no painting this weekend because of the Memorial Day holiday.\n\n\"I'll be able to take my grandchildren and say, 'See those two bricks over there? Your Pop Pop did that,' \" the mayor said.\n\nHe joked that he had difficulty \"staying in the lines.\" Later the officials painted their names on the side of Nancy's, which will be whitewashed before the actual mural is installed.\n\nThe new mural, which is expected to be completed in time for the Harvest Arts Festival Oct. 17, will be the third mural to be installed in the downtown. One was painted last year on the wall of Simply Skin on West Water Street.\n\nAnd another mural on the alley that connects Main Street with the Irons Street parking lot depicts Toms River's history.\n\nToms River Councilman Maurice B. \u201cMo\u201d Hill Jr. (left), Rep.

The wall will be whitewashed before the mural panels are installed.
