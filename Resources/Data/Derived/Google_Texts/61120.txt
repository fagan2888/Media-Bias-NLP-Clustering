Meridian Community College held its summer commencement ceremony Friday afternoon at the Temple Theater.

Over 125 students graduated with degrees ranging from Business and Office Technology to Surgical Technology. MCC President Dr. Scott Elliott was on hand this afternoon to award the students their degrees and recognize them for their achievements throughout their time at MCC.

Earlier during the day, about two dozen of those graduates walked across the Temple Stage to accept their nurse's pin after they completed the Practical Nursing Program. The program is a one year certificate program at MCC, where students learn basic nursing skills and how to care for patients in clinical agencies.
