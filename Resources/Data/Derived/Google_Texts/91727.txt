Obamacare has made a big difference in California.

A new fact sheet from the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research shows 13.6 percent of Californians were uninsured in 2014.

That’s a new low.

The report shows over the last two years, an increasing number of Californians have bought a policy on their own or enrolled in Medi-Cal. One in four Californians now have Medi-Cal coverage.

Shana Alex Charles, the center's director of health insurance studies, said Obamacare has been a smash hit.

“The point was to offer an insurance product that people would be able to afford, would be able to sign up for, whether it’s free Medicaid expansion, or subsidized private plans, and it’s working," Charles said.

The UCLA report also reveals that just over half of all Californians continue to get health coverage from their employer.
