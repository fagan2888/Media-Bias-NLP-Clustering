You do it in a game, it usually costs you something important. It costs you a drive, costs you field position. I am in to treating practice like a game, so I am not a fan of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brandon Marshall \u2014 LB, not WR \u2014 gets 1st chance to sub Danny Trevathan", "title": "Brandon Marshall \u2014 LB, not WR \u2014 gets 1st chance to sub Danny Trevathan", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/12/brandon-marshall-lb-not-wr-gets-1st-chance-to-sub-danny-trevathan/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140812__BroncosLBs081214p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140812__BroncosLBs081214p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T15:19:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:18:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9473\"", "article_summary": "WATCH: Brandon Marshall talks to The Press BoxHe wouldn\u2019t be the first Brandon Marshall to start for the Broncos.\nThe Broncos\u2019 new Brandon Marshall has a chance of becoming a nickel linebacker and special teams player in Trevathan\u2019s absence.\nNot That Brandon Marshall.\nLast September, the Broncos signed Brandon Marshall to their practice squad.\nThe Broncos had a receiver named Brandon Marshall."}
