So it\u2019s worth asking whether the workplace one day might become the main channel through which to sell voluntary benefits into the middle market.\n\nWith life insurance sales generally flat, selling life through the voluntary benefits channel is an idea worth mulling over.\n\n\u201cVoluntary benefits \u2014 protection products bought by employees through the workplace at their expense \u2014 might not (yet) be a household term, but they are catching on among U.S. households,\u201d Brian DeMaster, senior executive for Accenture Insurance, wrote in a blog post.\n\nVoluntary benefits - which include critical illness coverage, long-term care, accident, long-term disability (LTD), short-term disability (STD), dental, life, vision, and accidental death and disability - have been very popular of late.\n\nVoluntary sales for all products last year reached $6.6 billion, up 10 percent from $6.0 billion in 2012, according to Eastbridge Consulting.\n\nThe most popular voluntary benefit in 2013 was life insurance, which recorded sales of $1.88 billion, up 22 percent compared to 2012, according to Eastbridge.\n\nLife insurance also extended its market share to 28 percent of all voluntary benefits sales, up 3 percentage points from a year earlier, Eastbridge reported.\n\nIt is the fifth consecutive year during which life insurance led voluntary benefits sales.\n\nLife insurance sales through the voluntary benefits channel still represents a fraction of the $2.9 trillion in new life insurance bought by Americans in 2012, according to the American Council of Life Insurers, so voluntary benefits won\u2019t displace other sales channels for the moment.\n\nEastbridge research director Ginger Bates said growth of voluntary benefits is taking place because voluntary products \u201cmeet the employees\u2019 particular needs, are easy to purchase at work through payroll deduction and they are affordable.\u201d\n\nAny benefit that hopes to gain traction in the middle market has to be affordable, Bates said.\n\nPaid for 100 percent by the employee through a payroll deduction, voluntary benefits are offered in addition to the shared benefits for which the employer and the employee contribute toward the premium.\n\nEmployers find offering voluntary benefits attractive since they don\u2019t contribute to premiums and elect to make voluntary benefits available to workers at the discretion of the employer.\n\nEmployees like the benefits as they allow workers to supplement coverage they already have, and are eligible to buy the coverage through group rates.\n\nAlthough the bulk of life insurance is sold through agents and financial advisors, there\u2019s no doubt that voluntary benefits received a big boost from the Affordable Care Act, voluntary benefit market analysts said.\n\nQuestions and the uncertainty surrounding health reform steered people into the voluntary benefit market, DeMaster wrote.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) will undoubtedly stimulate the voluntary benefits marketplace, as employees add options besides healthcare coverage as part of a thoughtfully designed and tightly integrated program of employee benefits,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the life insurance category, term insurance accounted for 76 percent of new business annualized premium (NBAP) in 2013, up 4 percentage points from 2012, Eastbridge said. Sales growth of term life in 2013 outpaced sales growth of universal life and whole life.\n\nTotal sales of voluntary disability insurance were $1.36 billion last year, up 8 percent over 2012, with short-term disability (STD) accounting for 68 percent of total disability sales and long-term disability (LTD) accounting for the rest.\n\nIn 2013, life insurance made up 28 percent of all voluntary sales, disability 21 percent, accident 12 percent, and hospital indemnity/supplemental medical 8 percent.\n\nThe remaining 31 percent share of the voluntary market is divided among dental, cancer, critical illness, vision, and accidental death and disability lines, Bates also said.\n\nEastbridge, which tracks sales of insurance and benefit in the voluntary market for more than 60 carriers active in the voluntary market, releases the numbers every year in its \u201cU.S. Worksite/Voluntary Sales Report.\u201d\n\nA separate report published earlier this year by LIMRA found that new annualized premium of voluntary benefits bought at the worksite reached $4.3 billion in 2013, a 9 percent increase over 2012.\n\nCarriers and brokers report future sales of voluntary benefits are projected to increase despite all the changes brought on by health care reform and private health care exchanges, according to Bonnie Brazzell, Eastbridge vice president.\n\nAn index measuring the confidence of insurance carriers, brokers and advisors serving the voluntary benefits industry hit a record of 102.9 at the end of last year, up 3.9 points from year-end 2012, Eastbridge said.\n\nCyril Tuohy is a writer based in Pennsylvania.
