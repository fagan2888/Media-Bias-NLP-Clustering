Thursday, guard Nate Robinson was added to the group.\n\nRobinson, rehabbing a torn anterior cruciate ligament, said he is still on track to be ready for training camp. He\u2019s not doing any basketball-related activities now other than some shooting on the side. He anticipates that changing this summer.\n\n\u201cHopefully August,\u201d Robinson said of his return. \u201cI\u2019m trying to sway the doctors to give me a little more leeway.\u201d\n\nRobinson smiled while saying that. He knows speeding up the timeline on his rehab process probably won\u2019t happen, and he\u2019s fine with that. When he returns, he wants to be back to fully with no restrictions, and though the 5-foot-9 mighty mite is revved up and ready to go right now, he also wants to have no setbacks.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s just, I can\u2019t really wait to play,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\n\nRobinson, who last played Jan. 29, is one of three Denver players dealing with ACL injuries. J.J. Hickson and Danilo Gallinari are the others.\n\nFootnotes. The Nuggets conducted their latest pre-draft workouts Thursday, putting Clemson forward K.J. Daniels and Delaware forward Davon Usher through the paces. Earlier in the week, the Nuggets traveled to see Michigan guard Nik Stauskas and Creighton forward Doug McDermott, a three-time consensus All-American. \u2026 The Nuggets might have one more workout before the NBA draft next Thursday.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets guard Nate Robinson on track for training camp", "title": "Denver Nuggets guard Nate Robinson on track for training camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/19/denver-nuggets-guard-nate-robinson-on-track-for-training-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__robinsonp1.jpg", "height": 539}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__robinsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T16:58:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:47:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce98\"", "article_summary": "The collection of Nuggets at Pepsi Center during pre-draft workouts has grown by the session the past two weeks.\nRobinson, rehabbing a torn anterior cruciate ligament, said he is still on track to be ready for training camp.\nThursday, guard Nate Robinson was added to the group.\nThe Nuggets conducted their latest pre-draft workouts Thursday, putting Clemson forward K.J.\nEarlier in the week, the Nuggets traveled to see Michigan guard Nik Stauskas and Creighton forward Doug McDermott, a three-time consensus All-American."}
