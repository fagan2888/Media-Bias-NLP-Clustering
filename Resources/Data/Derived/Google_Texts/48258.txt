Corn, in the U.S., is kind of a big deal: Nearly a third of our farmland is devoted to growing it, and we contribute nearly 40 percent of the global supply. The $67 billion industry touches nearly everything, Brooke Barton, the author of a new Ceres report, explains: “It is fed to the cattle that become Big Mac. It is in the ethanol that goes into the gasoline we buy. It’s in the snack foods that we buy, even in some of the plastics in the products we buy. It is in laundry detergents. It’s everywhere.”

It’s also a major environmental scourge, requiring more water to grow than any other crop and accounting for about half of our fertilizer use. And those inefficiencies, coupled with the effects of climate change, could mean big trouble for big corn.

Ceres, a coalition of investor and environmental groups, warns that high temperatures and water shortages associated with climate change are putting U.S. corn production at risk; all the more reason, it says, for investors to push for a move toward more sustainable growing practices.
