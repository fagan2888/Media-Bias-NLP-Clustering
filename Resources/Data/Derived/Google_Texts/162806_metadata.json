The organization convened a coalition that sent a letter with 180 signatures to Congress on Thursday urging lawmakers to pass the Healthy Families Act.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to happen overnight, but with your help we\u2019re going to continue to build support in Congress and we\u2019re going to get this done for millions of Americans across the country,\u201d Murray said.\n\nThe Healthy Families Act, which Murray and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) introduced in February, would allow workers to earn up to seven paid sick days a year, which they could use to care for family members or address personal medical needs.\n\nOut of 185 countries and territories in the world surveyed by the International Labor Organization, the United States is one of only two that does not offer paid maternity leave; Papua New Guinea is the other.\n\nPresident Obama signed an executive memorandum in January in an effort to push lawmakers to bring the U.S. in line with the rest of the world. The order gave federal employees access to six weeks of paid parental leave by allowing them to advance their sick time.\n\n\"Paid sick days laws are or will soon be in place in 21 places across the country and 81 percent of voters say they want lawmakers to consider new laws like paid sick days,\u201d the National Partnership for Women & Families said in a statement. \u201cIt is past time for action at the federal level.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Democratic senator wants Republican support on her Healthy Families Act.", "description": "The Democratic senator wants Republican support on her Healthy Families Act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Democratic senator wants Republican support on her Healthy Families Act.", "title": "Murray launches new push for paid leave", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/healthcare/239904-sen-murray-launches-new-push-for-paid-sick-leave", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/murraypatty_022415gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/healthcare/239904-sen-murray-launches-new-push-for-paid-sick-leave", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-23T16:42-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Employment compensation, Labor, Leave, Sick leave, Parental leave, Patty Murray, Presidency of Barack Obama, Rosa DeLauro, Management, Social Issues, Politics,Patty Murray,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-23T16:42:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/healthcare/239904-sen-murray-launches-new-push-for-paid-sick-leave", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Democratic senator wants Republican support on her Healthy Families Act.", "card": "summary", "title": "Murray launches new push for paid leave"}, "dcterms.title": "Murray launches new push for paid leave"}, "article_summary": "The order gave federal employees access to six weeks of paid parental leave by allowing them to advance their sick time.\n\"Paid sick days laws are or will soon be in place in 21 places across the country and 81 percent of voters say they want lawmakers to consider new laws like paid sick days,\u201d the National Partnership for Women & Families said in a statement.\nThe Healthy Families Act, which Murray and Rep.
