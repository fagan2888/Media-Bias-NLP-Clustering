(Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nClay had applied for health insurance on the federal marketplace last month. She had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, was unemployed and didn\u2019t have any income. She was told that she appeared to qualify for Medicaid and that her application would be forwarded to New Jersey officials for processing.\n\nWhen New Jersey resident Jacqueline Clay contacted me Monday, she was panicked and desperate.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t hear anything back.\n\nA couple weeks later, Clay, 59, accepted a part-time job at a soup kitchen that will pay her about $26,000 next year, enough to disqualify her from Medicaid. So, as any responsible citizen would, she set out to update her application so she could choose a private insurance plan with a subsidy on HealthCare.gov, which handles enrollment for New Jersey and 35 other states.\n\nThat\u2019s when she hit a wall.\n\nClay called the toll-free number for HealthCare.gov and was told by a customer service representative that she would have to contact the New Jersey Department of Human Services, which runs the Medicaid program known as New Jersey Family Care. She called the state agency and was told they had no record of her application.\n\nThis went on for days. \u201cIt was back and forth,\u201d Clay explained.\n\nWith the looming Dec. 23 deadline to select a plan starting on Jan. 1, Clay felt she could wait no longer.\n\n\u201cI am in limbo and with my cancer diagnosis am really afraid that I will not be able to have medical coverage as of January 1,\u201d Clay wrote me. \u201cI have had little treatment because I currently have no insurance and wanted to start more treatment in January.\u201d\n\nShe concluded: \u201cI want everyone to know the big mess that is now occurring in New Jersey. I cannot be the only person who needs to make changes \u2026 but unable to do so.\u201d\n\nWith Clay\u2019s permission, I forwarded her email on to a federal spokeswoman, who asked a representative to get in touch with Clay. Separately, Clay called the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius seeking help.\n\nClay was finally told to create a new email address and fill out a new application, and that would enable her to enroll in a private plan for Jan. 1. It appears to have worked.\n\nBut her experience raises two bigger, more troubling questions: 1) What should consumers do if they can\u2019t get the help they need on HealthCare.gov; and 2) Is there a problem with applications for Medicaid on HealthCare.gov?\n\n\u201cEverybody isn\u2019t like me,\u201d Clay told me yesterday. \u201cI was going to put on my clothes and go to Washington and speak to Obama if I had to. There are people out here who don\u2019t have the time, the wherewithal, the energy to do that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Clay can\u2019t be the only one experiencing this problem. Federal officials encourage consumers to ask for a supervisor if a customer service representative on the toll-free line cannot resolve their problem. Clay did this and didn\u2019t get the help she needed.\n\nBut the bigger problem may be those who signed up for Medicaid on HealthCare.gov thinking they would have coverage beginning Jan. 1.\n\nThe Record newspaper in New Jersey reported today that state officials said about 25,000 poor people who applied for Medicaid on HealthCare.gov won\u2019t be enrolled because the information the state received from the federal government is \u201cunusable.\u201d\n\nTheir applications can\u2019t be pro\u00adcessed, and they can\u2019t yet be enrolled for coverage that is supposed to begin next year, said Nicole Brossoie, assistant commissioner of the state Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid. It is yet another problem in the disastrous rollout of the federal marketplace for people who want to sign up for health insurance. After assurances that the federal website would automatically send enrollment information to the state for those who qualify for Medicaid, New Jersey officials discovered this week that the state and the federal computer systems don\u2019t communicate smoothly. Worse, people who think they enrolled successfully in Medicaid likely have no idea that, in fact, their applications are in limbo. New Jersey Medicaid \u201cis working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to receive a usable file as soon as possible,\u201d Brossoie said late Thursday afternoon. She did not offer any timetable for resolving the problem.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency is working with the state.\n\nClay said she had health insurance her entire adult life until she was let go in April from her job as a benefit manager for a medical company. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on unemployment, you really can\u2019t afford to get COBRA,\u201d a program that allows employees to pay for coverage from their former employers.\n\nClay said she is happy with the plan she chose on the exchange, which will cost her about $300 a month after a subsidy \u2014 and she feels grateful to be able to get insurance with a pre-existing condition, something the Affordable Care Act guarantees.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t wish what happened to her on others. \u201cThis has been a harrowing experience, having to hear that you have cancer and it\u2019s in the lymph nodes,\u201d she said, \u201cthen to have to fight with the government to get what they said I\u2019m entitled to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been just awful.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein\u2019s \u201cHealthy buzz\u201d blog.
