Much of that consolidation has included large hospital companies purchasing smaller providers as well as physician groups.\n\nStill, many doctors prefer the independence of a physician group, said Walton, although they could still benefit from the know-how of a company with more experience managing population health.\n\n\u201cHealthways offers physician organizations like mine a unique opportunity to not have to consolidate with major health care systems that have hospitals and outpatient surgery centers and all that other overhead,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so unique. It\u2019s the first of its kind in the country. It\u2019s not going to be the last, I don\u2019t think.\u201d\n\nHealthways thinks about its population health management tools in three groups \u2014 those that help manage people who are sick, those that try to mitigate risky lifestyle behaviors such as smoking, and, finally, those that encourage healthy people to stay well.\n\n\u201cThe important thing about this is these physicians have come together with us because they want to be an instrument for transforming the way that care is delivered,\u201d said Bob Porter, Healthways\u2019 Health System and Physician Group Market president. \u201cJust trying to negotiate different rates is only passing the pain around.\u201d\n\nPorter says Genesis can be a powerful partner because physicians can truly influence patient behavior.\n\nGenesis and Healthways also will partner with an accountable care organization called Genesis Accountable Physician Network, which is based in Dallas and formed in 2013. \u201cAs GAPN developed plans and processes to coordinate the care of Medicare and future commercial patient populations, we came to realize that we needed a partner with the critical assets, expertise and experience in delivering proven value,\u201d Walton said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe selected Healthways because of its unparalleled leadership and outcomes in the well-being improvement space and because it is one of the few companies offering a truly complete set of capabilities for effectively managing population health.\u201d\n\nReach Shelley DuBois at 615-259-8241 and on Twitter @shelleydubois.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2014/06/18/healthways-forms-new-health-care-partnership-texas/10814535/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Franklin-based Healthways has formed a partnership with a Texas physician group.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Franklin-based Healthways has formed a partnership with a Texas physician group.", "title": "Healthways forms new health care partnership in Texas", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2014/06/18/healthways-forms-new-health-care-partnership-texas/10814535/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Franklin-based Healthways has formed a partnership with a Texas physician group.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg", "title": "Healthways forms new health care partnership in Texas", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2e7a85b4bd063ace2090d89aef4eda2bd238488/c=530-0-1591-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a558841cd04604e9c406ed906d857f468d720123/c=354-0-1769-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/783f79c3c51247259b4a1260c31b76e17fb630a5/c=118-0-2005-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98e708b1a7434219c8813e5d7127d62cc2e72c14/c=0-110-2122-1304&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-18T18:43:36-05:00", "shorthed": "Healthways forms new health care partnership in Texas", "articleid": 10814535, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff08101970c9b392424972bf0f5861a9adca4d8f/c=0-110-2122-1304/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffc67a26470f393546dbef23c1b70abee17b3153/c=663-0-1459-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/18/178640464.jpg"}, "author": "Shelley DuBois", "title": "Healthways forms new health care partnership in Texas", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html;
