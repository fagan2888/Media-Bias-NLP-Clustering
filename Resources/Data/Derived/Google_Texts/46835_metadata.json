Cuddy to 60 day DL Chris Martin optioned. Wilton Lopez up. \u2014 Patrick Saunders (@psaundersdp) June 21, 2014\n\nThe Rockies really did select the contract of right-handed reliever Wilton Lopez Saturday, and he will be back in their bullpen against the Brewers.\n\nThe 30-year-old Lopez, he of the incredible rising sinkerball, is on the Rockies\u2019 25-man (and 40-man) roster for the second time this season. He was on the opening-day roster but was designated for assignment after appearing in just four games, allowing eight runs in 6 1/3 innings. That\u2019s an ERA of 11.37, for those of you calculating at home.\n\nWhy bring up Lopez?\n\n\u201cI lot of it has to do with where we are at right now with our pitching staff,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe have been pretty taxed and we feel like we needed another guy who could give us multiple innings out there. That\u2019s why we brought \u2018Lopey\u2019 back. He\u2019s a durable guy who can give us innings.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies have a number of young starters filling holes in their reeling rotation, and Weiss said the Rockies want to protect them.\n\nIn 20 games for Triple-A Colorado Springs, Lopez was 0-2 with a 4.54 ERA.\n\nThe other moves by the Rockies Saturday: The team placed Michael Cuddyer (broken left shoulder) on the 60-day disabled, freeing up a spot on the 40-man roster for Lopez. The club also optioned right-handed reliever Chris Martin and outfielder-first baseman Kyle Parker to Triple-A. Those moves freed up spaced on the 25-man roster for Lopez and lefty Christian Friedrich, who starts Saturday\u2019s game against the Brewers.\n\nOther pregame notes of note:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Carlos Gonzalez,Christian Bergman,Walt Weiss,Wilton Lopez", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "That was no Twitter typo, the Rockies really did select the contract of right-handed reliever Wilton Lopez Saturday and put him back in their bullpen.", "title": "Rockies' Wilton Lopez, cut earlier this season, is back in bullpen", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/06/21/rockies-wilton-lopez-cut-earlier-season-back-bullpen/17913/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/06/2WILTON-LOPEZ-495x278.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "That was no Twitter typo, the Rockies really did select the contract of right-handed reliever Wilton Lopez Saturday and put him back in their bullpen.", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Wilton Lopez, cut earlier this season, back in bullpen", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/06/21/rockies-wilton-lopez-cut-earlier-season-back-bullpen/17913/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/06/2WILTON-LOPEZ-495x278.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "That was no Twitter typo, the Rockies really did select the contract of right-handed reliever Wilton Lopez Saturday and put him back in their bullpen."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0e9\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Patrick Saunders (@psaundersdp) June 21, 2014The Rockies really did select the contract of right-handed reliever Wilton Lopez Saturday, and he will be back in their bullpen against the Brewers.\n#Rockies moves.\nWilton Lopez up.\nThe 30-year-old Lopez, he of the incredible rising sinkerball, is on the Rockies\u2019 25-man (and 40-man) roster for the second time this season.\nThose moves freed up spaced on the 25-man roster for Lopez and lefty Christian Friedrich, who starts Saturday\u2019s game against the Brewers."}
