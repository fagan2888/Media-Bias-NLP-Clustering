(AP) \u2014 So, it turns out you don\u2019t have to be nominated to become the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nSeriously.\n\nAt least for now.\n\nThat\u2019s one rules oddity that became clear last week as the 168 members of the Republican National Committee and top party functionaries met in beachside splendor to discuss the GOP\u2019s messy search for a consensus presidential candidate. Three months from now, the 2,472 delegates to the party\u2019s nominating convention in Cleveland will have to decide whether to recast that or other bylaws that will help decide who becomes GOP standard-bearer in the November elections.\n\nSome impressions from last week\u2019s RNC meetings:\n\nI HEREBY NOMINATE \u2026\n\nIn a background briefing for reporters, GOP officials shed light on a curious anomaly.\n\nUnder current rules, the party conducts an initial roll call to formally place in nomination those vying to become the GOP presidential candidate. But you don\u2019t have to be among the competitors nominated to receive delegates\u2019 votes when the convention holds its next ballot \u2014 or ballots \u2014 to choose the party\u2019s actual nominee.\n\nOf the GOP\u2019s existing 42 rules, the most discussed is 40(b). It says that to be among those nominated, candidates must submit certificates showing support by a majority of delegates from at least eight states.\n\nYet the aides also noted that there\u2019s another rule \u2014 16(a)(2). It says that during voting to select a final nominee, the votes of delegates required by their states to support a specific candidate must be tallied for that person. GOP officials said that is true even if that candidate failed to be formally nominated in the initial roll call.\n\n\u201cUnbound\u201d delegates \u2014 150 to 200 in the first ballot, many more in later ballots \u2014 can also vote for whoever they want, whether that contender has been formally nominated or not.\n\nDoes this open the door for an outsider candidate elbowing aside frontrunners Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and capturing the nomination? Perhaps.\n\nWhy does the GOP have rule 40(b) at all?\n\nIt was approved at the 2012 convention, controlled by that year\u2019s candidate, Mitt Romney. The rule was aimed at preventing supporters of rival Ron Paul from sapping up valuable television time with a raucous nominating speech, a potential embarrassment to the front-runner.\n\n___\n\nWILL THE RULES CHANGE IN CLEVELAND?\n\nYes, and reshaping those conflicting nominating rules is one likely example.\n\nThe RNC will recommend rules changes just before the summer convention begins, but those are only suggestions. The rules in Cleveland will be whatever the delegates vote to approve.\n\nSince most delegates will be committed to Trump and Cruz, those men will also have a major say in shaping the convention bylaws as their campaigns and others jockey for advantage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP nomination rules: A loophole here, a loophole there", "author": "Alan Fram", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "GOP nomination rules: A loophole here, a loophole there", "title": "GOP nomination rules: A loophole here, a loophole there", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/23/gop_nomination_rules_a_loophole_here_a_loophole_there/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/gop-2016-notebook.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP nomination rules: A loophole here, a loophole there", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/gop-2016-notebook.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "GOP nomination rules: A loophole here, a loophole there", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "GOP nomination rules: A loophole here, a loophole there", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Under current rules, the party conducts an initial roll call to formally place in nomination those vying to become the GOP presidential candidate.\nYes, and reshaping those conflicting nominating rules is one likely example.\nGOP officials said that is true even if that candidate failed to be formally nominated in the initial roll call.\nThe RNC will recommend rules changes just before the summer convention begins, but those are only suggestions.\nSome impressions from last week\u2019s RNC meetings:I HEREBY NOMINATE \u2026In a background briefing for reporters, GOP officials shed light on a curious anomaly."}
