House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the Republican-controlled Senate on Friday for blocking action on Obamacare, tax reform and more while representatives are working hard to push conservative measures through."The latest metric shows this is the second-most productive Congress of any Republican in the majority," the California Republican told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" co-host Martha MacCallum, "but what's stopping us is the Senate."The House has two bills on the floor that could affect Planned Parenthood and the abortion services it provides, McCarthy said, at the same time many in the Senate are arguing about whether to shut down the government rather than provide further funding for the controversial organization."Anyone who watches those videos, they are horrific," he said of a series of undercover sting videos that show monetary deals for aborted fetuses being conducted."They are aborting live babies for profit," said McCarthy, echoing statements made by GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina during Wednesday night's CNN debates. "Why would anyone want to spend tax dollars for that?"The bills under discussion include one that will require that medical professionals treat a baby that survives an abortion the same as they would a prematurely-born baby, he said.The other puts a moratorium on funding while an investigation is conducted into the claims made on the videos, after which the funding would be taken away from Planned Parenthood and awarded to other women's health providers.And as for shutting down the government, it's members of the Senate, not the House who call for that, said McCarthy."We all watched 'When Mr. Smith goes to Washington,'" said McCarthy. "We learned what a filibuster is. Today that's not the case. In the Senate you have to have 60 votes, not a majority. That's not in the Constitution; that's a rule."
