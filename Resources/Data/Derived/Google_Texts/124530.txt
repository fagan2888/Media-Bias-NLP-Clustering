Well, if you ask Forbes, they’re worth enough to rank as the 11th-most valuable NFL franchise in 2014, up from No. 13 in the previous year’s rankings.

Forbes placed the team’s value at $1.45 billion for this past year, up 25 percent increase over the previous year, with $301 million in revenue for 2013 and $31 million in operating income.

In Forbes’ 2013 list of NFL team values, based on finances in 2012, the Broncos were worth about $1.16 billion, with a revenue of $283 million and an operating income of $31.7 million.

But after a season in which they made it to the Super Bowl and posted numerous NFL records, and, as Forbes reports, consolidated and refinanced $112 million of debt for Sports Authority Field at Mile High “at a significantly lower interest rate and more favorable terms,” the team’s value shot up quite a bit.

In July, using the previous year’s valuation for the team, Forbes ranked the Broncos as the 25th most valuable sports franchise, shortly after Sports Illustrated and Fortune ranked quarterback Peyton Manning as the fifth-highest paid American athlete.



Forbes’ 2014 NFL franchise valuations comes days after the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers finalized their $2 billion sale to former Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer, and during the Buffalo Bills’ continued struggle to draw bids of more than $1 billion.

But don’t be fooled: The average NFL team is worth $1.43 billion, Forbes says, up 23 percent over the past year and the most since the magazine began tracking team finances 17 years ago.

The Dallas Cowboys, for the eighth straight year, was ranked No. 1 on Forbes’ 2014 list, with a value of $3.2 billion, second to only European soccer club Real Madrid ($3.4 billion). The Cowboys had the league’s highest revenue ($560 million) and operating income ($245.7 million) over the past year, all while making it to the playoffs just three times in the last decade.

The New England Patriots ($2.6 billion), Washington Redskins ($2.4 billion), New York Giants ($2.1 billion) and Houston Texans ($1.85 billion) round out the top five on Forbes’ 2014 list.

The least valuable team this past year? The St. Louis Rams, owned by Denver billionaire Stan Kroenke. They’re worth $930 million, according to Forbes, down three spots from the previous year, even though their value increased 8 percent and their revenue increased 4 percent.
