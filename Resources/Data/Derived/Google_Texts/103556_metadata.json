I\u2019ll be on KFAN at 4:30 p.m. CT.\n\nIf you want to read a little about what the Wild has been up to since beating Colorado, 3-zip, Saturday, check out this story.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Wild walks into an arena with a division championship banner already hanging. Saturday in Denver, the Wild spoiled that Central Division title party for the Avs in their home opener. The Ducks have their Pacific Division title banner up in the air already as they finally play a home game after a 3-1 road swing to open the year.\n\n\u201cIn the end, no matter how great it feels to win the division against the teams that are in our division, if you don\u2019t go further than that, nobody cares,\" said Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau. \"It is saying something you won it, but we want no fanfare with that. Hopefully there will be a bigger banner there some time in the next year.\u201d\n\nAs expected, Darcy Kuemper in goal, Keith Ballard and Matt Dumba will be the third pair and the fourth line will be Matt Cooke-Ryan Carter-Jason Zucker with Justin Fontaine making his season debut on the second line. Nate Prosser and Christian Folin are expected to play Sunday in L.A., perhaps with Niklas Backstrom in goal. That's all subject to change.\n\nOn Fontaine playing with Vanek and Koivu, coach Mike Yeo said, \"We\u2019re hoping to see that line click. We\u2019re hoping to see that line create a lot of 5-on-5. They got the one big goal when we spotted Zuck up there, but then after that, the rest of the game they were pretty quiet. I want to see those guys be a threat every time that they\u2019re on the ice and when they\u2019re not on the attack that they\u2019re defending the right way.\"\n\nIn Game 3 of the first round against Colorado, Kyle Brodziak was scratched for the first time in his Wild career. Despite two quality games on the fourth line to start this year, Brodziak\u2019s first scratch of this season will come in Game 3.\n\n\"We\u2019re a deeper team,\" Yeo said. \"We\u2019ve had some healthy guys out of the lineup already and this is the lineup we\u2019re going with tonight. The one thing we want to create is we want the idea that guys are pushing each other, and so obviously we have that right now.\n\n\"Actually I haven\u2019t been disappointed with his games at all. It\u2019s just a matter of where other guys fit right now and we\u2019re happy with a lot of other people\u2019s games, so the message is pretty simple: Work hard today and get ready for the next one.\"\n\nSaid Brodziak, \"I understand it\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s a long year and you\u2019ve just got to stay positive and keep trying to build your game up as much as you can. When you get a chance to get back in, you\u2019ve got to make the most of it.\n\n\"When you have a team that\u2019s as deep as we are up front, it is going to create higher competition amongst the team and that\u2019s never a bad thing when you have guys that all want to accomplish the same thing and contribute and be a part of it. As much as everybody else there\u2019s a competition that comes along with it and that should be a good thing for the group.\"\n\n\n\nCarter, who won a Stanley Cup in 2007 with the Ducks (see that story here), will center the fourth line.\n\nAs I wrote in this story here, Clayton Stoner is excited to face the Wild tonight. Dany Heatley won\u2019t play because of a groin strain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be hurt. I felt real good in training camp and preseason and I\u2019m just trying to get healthy again,\u201d Heatley said.\n\nHeatley said it was a freak, innocent thing and disappointed because he showed immediate chemistry on the Ducks\u2019 first line with Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry in the preseason.\n\n\u201cPerry is one of the best goal scorers in the league, and Getz is the best center or definitely right up there. He looks to pass a lot and that\u2019s good for a shooter.\u201d\n\nOn his three-year Wild career, Heatley said, \u201cUps and downs. The first year there I thought was a decent year. The lockout year was a weird year, kind of struggled with some injuries and the same thing in the third year.\u201d\n\nIn the playoffs, Heatley was scratched the first two games. He drew in Game 3 of the first round and finished with a goal, five assists and a team-best plus-6 in 11 games. His saucer helped set up Nino Niederreiter\u2019s Game 7 OT winner in Denver.\n\n\u201cIt was fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was obviously a tough start to the playoffs, but once I got into the lineup, it was fun playing with those guys. I think I left on a pretty good note.\u201d\n\nYeo on Heatley: \"I really enjoyed coaching Heater. You always know a little bit about the player coming there, and when you have the chance to coach them, especially players like that, you end up appreciating them so much more. First off, you get to know the human being and what kind of person they are and what kind of teammate they are. \u2026 It was a real pleasure for me.\"\n\nBoudreau again raved about the Wild, its players, what Thomas Vanek adds to the team and all of the Wild\u2019s young kids, especially Charlie Coyle and Erik Haula.\n\nOh, also Kuemper.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll go 82 games without giving up a goal,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re licking our chops to be the first team that scores on him. We just want to come out and play hard and hopefully it\u2019s good enough to win. We love to play in front of our home crowd, so hopefully the guys aren\u2019t too preoccupied with it and play a little bit like they were on the road.\u201d\n\nRikard Rakell is the Ducks\u2019 scratch tonight. Emerson Etem takes Patrick Maroon\u2019s slot on the first line. Frederik Andersen starts. And Chris Wagner, the Player of the Week in the AHL, will make his NHL debut.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "UPDATED.", "title": "Wild will try to spoil Anaheim's home opener; Lineup updates", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/russo-wild-will-try-to-spoil-anaheim-s-home-opener/279592052/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141299741952526.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141299741952526.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "UPDATED.", "title": "Wild will try to spoil Anaheim's home opener; Lineup updates", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/russo-wild-will-try-to-spoil-anaheim-s-home-opener/279592052/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141299741952526.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141299741952526.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "UPDATED."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06a4\"", "article_summary": "Saturday in Denver, the Wild spoiled that Central Division title party for the Avs in their home opener.\nFor the second straight game, the Wild walks into an arena with a division championship banner already hanging.\nHe looks to pass a lot and that\u2019s good for a shooter.\u201dOn his three-year Wild career, Heatley said, \u201cUps and downs.\nfrom Anaheim, where the Wild finally dusts off its road whites and plays a game again at 9 p.m. CT (FSN, KFAN).\nIn Game 3 of the first round against Colorado, Kyle Brodziak was scratched for the first time in his Wild career."}
