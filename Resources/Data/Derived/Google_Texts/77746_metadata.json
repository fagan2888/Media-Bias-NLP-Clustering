Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Republican challenger Ed Gillespie honed their attacks on each other during a sharp, wide-ranging debate Tuesday evening, Oct. 7.\n\nWhile the candidates mostly avoided headline-making confrontations, they drew stark distinctions between their visions of the nation\u2019s future, staking out familiar ground on politically-polarizing issues such as same-sex marriage, immigration, abortion and the health care crisis.\n\nThe debate, sponsored jointly by NBC4 and the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce, was held in the two-story auditorium of Capitol One\u2019s headquarters in McLean.\n\nBoth candidates quickly established their pro-business positions, vowing to clear the way for greater economic opportunities for Virginians.\n\n\u201cI want future generations to have the same opportunities that I've had. My grandfather was an immigrant janitor. My parents never went to college. And I got to be counselor to the President of the United States of America,\u201d Gillespie said in his one-minute opening remarks, taking a familiar swipe at Warner by adding that he \u201cfeared we're losing that kind of economic opportunity and upward mobility as a result of the Obama/Warner policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy policies will ease the squeeze on hardworking Virginians and make it easier for them [and] for the unemployed to find work \u2026. Under the Obama/Warner policy, for every net job created in Virginia two people have gone onto food stamps. There are 65,000 more women living in poverty today. And 250,000 of us will have our health care plans cancelled as a result of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, which the senator still supports,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nIN HIS OPENING STATEMENT, Warner positioned himself as the moderate, bi-partisan problem solver who will help break the paralyzing gridlock in Washington. The former governor is seeking another term in Washington, where he said he had a record of working with other lawmakers to push forward pragmatic, \u201csensible\u201d solutions to challenges like health care costs, crushing student debt, the nation\u2019s immigration crisis, and its slow economic recovery from the 2008 recession.\n\n\u201cYou know what, on every major piece of legislation I work on I start with a Republican partner \u2026 I'm so proud that I've got actually more former Republican legislators supporting me this campaign than when I first ran.\u201d\n\nChuck Todd of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d the debate\u2019s moderator, addressed the first question to Gillespie, noting the day\u2019s breaking news of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to review the case on gay marriage.\n\n\u201cIt is now legal here in the commonwealth of Virginia. You personally oppose gay marriage. Are you comfortable? Can you accept this decision by the Supreme Court not to act?\u201d\n\nGillespie said it was a matter for the state, not the federal government.\n\n\u201cI love people and respect them for who they are. I believe we are all created in the image and likeness of God. And as you noted, in my faith, marriage is between one man and one woman \u2026,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nHe added that same-sex marriage \u201cis the law in Virginia today. And \u2014 as I do not believe that \u2014 a federal law \u2026 is the proper approach, then of course I accept the ruling of \u2026 the decision by the Supreme Court not to take up this decision of the circuit court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI support marriage equality,\u201d Warner said, when it was his turn to address the question. \u201cI think it is appropriate that we live in a commonwealth that doesn't discriminate.\u201d\n\nDebate panelists included Aaron Gilchrist and Julie Carey of NBC4 and Karen Tumulty of The Washington Post, who each asked the candidates two questions.\n\nCarey asked Warner if he thought U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine was wrong when he sought to constrain the president\u2019s unilateral power to make war.\n\n\u201cYour own colleague, Sen. Tim Kaine, has said, quote \u2018You don't ask people to sacrifice their lives until the nation has debated and committed to the mission.\u2019 Is he wrong about that?\u201d\n\nWarner said he agreed with Kaine, and also said it was an example of his difference with the president.\n\n\u201cThis is where I differ where the president,\u201d Warner said. \u201cI believe that we need a more forceful response against Syria and Iraq. I think it is very important that we also \u2026 I've been calling since early March for stronger actions against Mr. Putin in Russia.\u201d\n\nWarner and Gillespie repeatedly went back and forth on the \u201c97 percent question.\u201d A prominent theme in Gillespie\u2019s campaign has been hammering home the statistic that Warner voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cMy opponent's whole campaign has been pretty much based on this bogus charge, the 97 percent charge,\u201d Warner said after Gilchrist asked both candidates to list how they differed from the President. \u201cI mean, independent political analysts have called it both misleading and not reflective of my record. The National Journal which still does a review of all the votes, not just a subsection, ranks me right in the sensible center.\u201d\n\nGillespie responded that while \u201cSenator Warner's press releases are very bipartisan \u2026 his floor votes are very party line \u2026 While he just said he supported the Keystone XL Pipeline, on two different occasions when there was an opportunity to move forward with (the Keystone XL Pipeline), Senator Warner voted to block that from moving forward.\u201d\n\nWarner replied that those votes were \u201cmostly procedural votes \u2026 What he didn't say as well is when I voted against off-shore drilling is because there was no proceeds coming back to Virginia.\u201d\n\nTumulty, a former Time Magazine writer, kicked off a spirited debate on immigration reform and the DREAM act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act.)\n\nSupporters argue the latest version of the bipartisan legislation would produce a variety of social and economic benefits, while critics contend that it would reward illegal immigration and encourage more of it, inviting fraud and shielding gang members from deportation.\n\nShe asked the question to Gillespie first.\n\n\u201cA moment ago you spoke quite passionately about your own family's story as an example of the kind of opportunity this country has offered immigrants,\u201d Tumulty said. \u201c Back in April, Mark Herring, the attorney general of Virginia declared that undocumented, qualified immigrants who grew up in Virginia, who graduated from high school in the commonwealth could qualify for in-state tuition at universities and colleges in Virginia. Do you agree with this policy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand it,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cIt's a state policy. I'm running for the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nGillespie went on to say that the U.S. \u201cshould have a means by which we can issue fresh visas to people who are here if they have, you know, not violated any other laws beside our immigration law.\u201d\n\nBut he also said any legislative approach begins with securing our borders.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have a porous southern border today is not just an immigration concern, it is a national security concern with the growing threat if ISIS or ISIL. And it is a public health threat and a public safety threat with the growing concerns about Ebola .\u2026\u201d\n\nWarner said he agreed the immigration system is broken.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, the Senate actually put together a bipartisan plan that would do that \u2026 It more than doubles border security,\u201d Warner said.\n\nWarner said the bipartisan bill dealt with the question about special work visas, and other immigration reform issues.\n\n\u201cHow do we make sure we have those tech workers that graduate from George Mason or Virginia Tech, they don't have to go home, and they simply have to go to Canada for those high-paying jobs now because (Canada) fixed their immigration system .\u2026\u201d\n\nIN THE MOST CONTENTIOUS MOMENT of the debate, Warner castigated Gillespie for withdrawing his support of the bill.\n\n\u201cRemarkable thing, this bill was supported by 68 senators \u2026 Was it perfect? Maybe not. But we got nothing back from the House. And what I find curious is back when this bill was being debated my opponent, Ed, wrote and said that this bill was both good policy and good politics. Now he said on the campaign trail that he's against the comprehensive Senate immigration reform bill. And I just wonder what's changed? Did the policy change or the politics changed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing changed on my end,\u201d Gillespie shot back. \u201cAnd it's, you know, PolitiFact, which you cited earlier, looked at my position on immigration reform and said it's been entirely consistent. And it has been.\u201d\n\nIn the past month, several polls have come out showing that support for Gillespie is growing, although Warner still has a commanding lead. A survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, which came out the same day as the debate, showed likely voters favoring Warner by 12 points on the day of the debate. Gillespie noted his growing support in a brief post-debate Q&A with reporters.\n\n\u201cI feel real momentum ... the race is narrowing,\u201d Gillespie said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2014/oct/16/warner-gillespie-clash-us-senate-debate/", "type": "article", "title": "Warner, Gillespie Clash in U.S. Senate Debate"}, "description": "In front of an audience of Northern Virginia business leaders, U.S. Sen.
