Scott Walker, calling them \u201cradicals on a national stage\u201d and asking, \u201cIf you had the chance to stop the next rising star of the right wing, would you do it, or would you let it slip away?\u201d\n\nThe video cites Schuette\u2019s support for a Michigan law barring same-sex couples from adopting children, his support for lawsuits to deny women insurance coverage for contraceptives, his opposition to tax credits for low-income families under the Affordable Care Act and his spearheading a law that made it more difficult to sue pharmaceutical companies when their products harm people as proof that he is a radical right winger who must be stopped.\n\n\n\nRelevant text:\n\n\u201cHe went to court to stop foster kids from being adopted by gay parents because he believed they\u2019d be better off as orphans.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchuette vigorously opposed a federal lawsuit by couple April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse challenging Michigan\u2019s 2004 Marriage Amendment, which defined marriage as \u201cthe union of one man and one woman.\u201d Because Michigan law allows only married couples or single people to adopt, DeBoer and Rowse contend that Michigan\u2019s same-sex marriage ban prevented them from adopting the three special needs children they had been raising together and thus violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n\nSchuette argued that the purpose of the Michigan Marriage Amendment was \u201cto promote procreation in a manner to encourage stable families.\u201d To support his case, his staff called expert witnesses who claimed children raised by heterosexual couples fare better than those raised by same-sex couples.\n\nU.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman rejected that assertion as \u201ca fringe viewpoint that is rejected by the vast majority of their colleagues across a variety of social science fields.\u201d Friedman declared the Michigan Marriage Amendment unconstitutional, a ruling that has been put on hold pending Schuette\u2019s appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\nDeBoer and Rowse said they decided to challenge Michigan\u2019s law after narrowly avoiding an auto accident and realizing that if one of them had been killed, the other could not legally claim parental rights over all three children. Initially, they filed a legal challenge to the state\u2019s adoption law, but, at Friedman\u2019s urging, amended it to directly take on the Michigan Marriage Amendment.\n\n\n\nThere is no record that Schuette ever said he believed that children would be \u201cbetter off as orphans,\u201d rather than being raised by a same-sex couple. But in court papers, Schuette favorably cited a Florida case which suggested it was better for children to remain in foster care rather than be placed in a family that was not \u201coptimal,\u201d i.e., heterosexual. John Keig, Totten\u2019s campaign manager, also argues that in fighting the same-sex lawsuit and calling his expert witnesses, Schuette was sending the message that \u201cthese kids would be better off as orphans.\u201d The language is jarring, but defensible.\n\n\u201cSchuette was the first attorney general in the nation to join a far right-wing effort to deny women coverage for contraceptives.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchuette is an outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act, including a section requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage for their employees. He filed a friend of the court brief supporting a lawsuit by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty challenging that section as it applied to religious organizations. Schuette called the provision \u201ca radical attack on the First Amendment that cannot stand,\u201d adding that \u201cwe cannot compromise religious liberty.\u201d\n\nMark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, said Schuette was the first state attorney general in the nation to support the case, and Schuette\u2019s spokeswoman said he would encourage other attorneys general to file similar friend of the court briefs.\n\nTruth Squad will leave it to pundits to debate whether the Becket Fund, created to protect \u201creligious liberty\u201d from governmental intrusion, is right wing or \u201cfar right wing,\u201d as the ad declares. Where the ad arguably goes too far is in making a blanket statement that Schuette wants to deny women coverage for contraceptives. His arguments to date have focused on supporting organizations or companies that have a bona fide religious objection to playing a role in providing coverage for some or all contraceptives. The record does not appear to support the assertion that Schuette is opposed to requiring other businesses (i.e., those with no religious objection) from providing such coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his law that makes Michigan the only state in the nation where you can\u2019t take drug companies to court if you\u2019re harmed by one of their drugs.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a state senator in 1995, Schuette sponsored a bill that became a law protecting pharmaceutical companies from product liability lawsuits if the drug in question had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. He chaired the Senate Committee on Economic Development, International Trade and Regulatory Affairs, to which the bill was referred, and he spoke at length urging his colleagues to pass it. He also served on a House and Senate a conference committee that worked out a final version of the law. Though a federal appeals court recently carved out a narrow exception, Michigan\u2019s drug immunity law remains intact.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s been called a \u2018destructive radical\u2019 for his fight to cut tax credits that save some Michigan families up to $5,000 a year in health care costs.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn February, Schuette filed a brief in support of a lawsuit challenging tax credits to help low-income people afford health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the subsidies could only be provided in states that set up their own health insurance exchanges. That same day, another appeals court in Virginia reached the opposite conclusion, leaving the issue unresolved, possibly until the U.S. Supreme Court settles it.\n\nThe uncertainty, meanwhile, leaves the status of tax credits for thousands of Michigan residents unresolved, because Michigan is one of 36 states that did not create their own health insurance exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the average tax subsidy in 2014 for each person who bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act would be $4,700.\n\nThus, Totten\u2019s claim that the lawsuit supported by Schuette could cost \u201csome Michigan families up to $5,000 a year in health care costs\u201d is close to the mark. Jim Anderson, news editor for the Iron Mountain Daily News, called Schuette \u201ca destructive radical\u201d in a blog on the newspaper\u2019s Web site for supporting the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nThe call: Warning\n\nThe ad, for the most part, sticks to the record on Schuette\u2019s legislative and legal record, with some political name-calling thrown in. It gets a warning for its assertions on contraceptives, which could be interpreted as painting too broad a brush.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "center-for-michigan,truth-squad", "title": "Truth Squad issues warning on ad attacking AG Schuette", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Truth Squad issues warning on ad attacking AG Schuette\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/truth_squad_issues_warning_on_1.html\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13763262\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-29T12:33:35Z\", \"author\": \"The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine\", \"tags\": [\"@mlive-news\",\"@mlive-river\",\"center-for-michigan\",\"truth-squad\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.mlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_mlive.gif", "description": "Democratic challenger Mark Totten takes the gloves off and sets them on fire in painting Bill Schuette as a right-wing zealot.", "card": "summary", "site": "@mlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, August 29, 2014,  8:33 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"\", \"author_name\": \"aj-Jones\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine\", \"author_id\": \"10053881\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Michigan Politics & Elections\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "Democratic challenger Mark Totten takes the gloves off and sets them on fire in painting Bill Schuette as a right-wing zealot.", "title": "Truth Squad issues warning on ad attacking AG Schuette", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/truth_squad_issues_warning_on_1.html", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_mlive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, August 29, 2014,  8:33 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Democratic challenger Mark Totten takes the gloves off and sets them on fire in painting Bill Schuette as a right-wing zealot."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd257a\"", "article_summary": "Initially, they filed a legal challenge to the state\u2019s adoption law, but, at Friedman\u2019s urging, amended it to directly take on the Michigan Marriage Amendment.\nThus, Totten\u2019s claim that the lawsuit supported by Schuette could cost \u201csome Michigan families up to $5,000 a year in health care costs\u201d is close to the mark.\nWhere the ad arguably goes too far is in making a blanket statement that Schuette wants to deny women coverage for contraceptives.\nIt gets a warning for its assertions on contraceptives, which could be interpreted as painting too broad a brush.\nThe call: WarningThe ad, for the most part, sticks to the record on Schuette\u2019s legislative and legal record, with some political name-calling thrown in."}
