She added that studies from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Indigenous Languages (NIIL) show that the main reason why indigenous languages disappear, or are in danger of doing so, is because in each generation fewer and fewer of the children speak those languages.\n\n\u201cWe need bilingual children only in that way can we preserve their languages,\u201d she added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indigenous children in Mexico can now learn their mother tongues with specialized computer games.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/21/saving-native-languages-and-culture-mexico-computer-games-156961", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/computer_programs_-_thinkstock.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Saving Native Languages and Culture in Mexico With Computer Games"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Saving Native Languages and Culture in Mexico With Computer Games"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/21/saving-native-languages-and-culture-mexico-computer-games-156961", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-21T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native Languages, Indigenous Peoples, Matilde Hernandez, Victor Franco Language and Culture Lab, Center for Investigations and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology, Dr. Frida Villavicencio, National Institute of Indigenous Languages, Rick Kearns", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Saving Native Languages and Culture in Mexico With Computer Games"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee32\"", "article_summary": "Indigenous children in Mexico can now learn their mother tongues with specialized computer games, helping to prevent the further loss of those languages across the country.\n\u201cThree years ago, before we employed these materials, we were on the verge of seeing our children lose our Native languages,\u201d asserted Matilde Hernandez, a teacher in Zitacuaro, Michoacan.\nShe added that studies from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Indigenous Languages (NIIL) show that the main reason why indigenous languages disappear, or are in danger of doing so, is because in each generation fewer and fewer of the children speak those languages.\n\u201cWe need bilingual children only in that way can we preserve their languages,\u201d she added.\n\u201cNow they are speaking and singing in Mazahua as if that had never happened,\u201d Hernandez said, referring to computer software that provides games and lessons in most of the linguistic families of the country including Mazahua, Chinanteco, Nahuatl of Puebla, Tzeltal, Mixteco, Zapateco, Chatino and others."}
