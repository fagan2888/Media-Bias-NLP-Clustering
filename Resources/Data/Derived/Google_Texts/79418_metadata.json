The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid and created public insurance marketplaces, resulting in millions of individuals and family members with pent-up healthcare needs obtaining coverage. The most recent estimates from HHS show 11.3 million people have signed up for a health plan on the state and federal exchanges so far for 2016.\n\nIn 2015, healthcare added 474,700 jobs compared with 259,200 jobs the year prior, according to preliminary seasonally adjusted figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The 2015 total is more than the 410,000 jobs healthcare created in 2014 and 2013 combined.The increased hiring figures bode well for those pursuing healthcare employment as well as for the broader economy, but it also raises red flags about whether the sector is doing enough to control costs.\u201cThe only way to see these increasing job numbers is to see more spending in healthcare,\u201d Northwestern University health economist Craig Garthwaite told Modern Healthcare last month. \u201cIt does very much suggest we are not doing a good job of bending the cost curve.\u201dFor the month of December, the number of healthcare employees grew by 39,400. Hospitals remained a hiring force, adding 12,300 people in December. Hospital employment increased by 172,200 people in 2015, and nearly 5 million people now work in a hospital even though there's been a greater emphasis of shifting care to other healthcare settings.Doctors offices, outpatient centers and other ambulatory healthcare sites added 23,400 jobs last month, while nursing homes and residential-care facilities added 3,700.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The healthcare industry added almost a half million people to its payrolls in 2015, by far the highest annual total since President Barack Obama entered office and passed his landmark healthcare reform law.", "title": "Healthcare adds 474,700 jobs in 2015", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The healthcare industry added almost a half million people to its payrolls in 2015, by far the highest annual total since President Barack Obama entered office and passed his landmark healthcare reform law.", "title": "Healthcare adds 474,700 jobs in 2015", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160108/NEWS/160109901", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160108/NEWS/160109901/AR/0/AR-160109901.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The healthcare industry added almost a half million people to its payrolls in 2015, by far the highest annual total since President Barack Obama entered office and passed his landmark healthcare reform law.", "title": "Healthcare adds 474,700 jobs in 2015", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160108/NEWS/160109901/AR/0/AR-160109901.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160108/NEWS/160109901", "published_at": "2016-01-08", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160108/NEWS/160109901/AR/0/AR-160109901.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In 2015, healthcare added 474,700 jobs compared with 259,200 jobs the year prior, according to preliminary seasonally adjusted figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid and created public insurance marketplaces, resulting in millions of individuals and family members with pent-up healthcare needs obtaining coverage.\n\u201cIt does very much suggest we are not doing a good job of bending the cost curve.\u201dFor the month of December, the number of healthcare employees grew by 39,400.\nThe most recent estimates from HHS show 11.3 million people have signed up for a health plan on the state and federal exchanges so far for 2016.\nHospitals remained a hiring force, adding 12,300 people in December."}
