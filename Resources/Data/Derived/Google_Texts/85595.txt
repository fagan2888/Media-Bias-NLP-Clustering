Close to 80 fluffy bunnies are on their way from the SPCA of Texas to groups in California and Houston where they will be put up for adoption.

The mini-rexes, holland lops and lion heads were rescued over the summer from cruel conditions in Indiana where they were being kept one on top of the other in small rooms, said Maura Davies, a spokeswoman for the organization.

Since then, the Indiana House Rabbit Society in Indianapolis has been working to rehabilitate the rabbits to ready them for adoption. They arrived Sunday morning at the Russell H. Perry Animal Care Center in McKinney, which is acting as a hub.

From there they will be relocated to several animal welfare groups including the Houston SPCA, WildRescue, Inc., San Diego House Rabbit Society, Too Many Bunnies (California), Bunny Buddies (Houston), Citizens for Animal Protection (CAP of Houston) and will be put up for adoption. WildRescue, Inc. coordinated the transfer of the rabbits to the various groups.

“A lot of people are looking for rabbits around Easter … but Easter is not a good time to add a spur of the moment pet” unless you’ve been thinking about it for a while and have researched their needs, Davies said.

“They require different care from dog or cats. They are a lot more fragile and have dietary restrictions.”

Ten of the rabbits will stay at the SPCA of Texas. They will become available to hop into a forever home in the coming days and weeks. Visit www.spca.org to find them.
