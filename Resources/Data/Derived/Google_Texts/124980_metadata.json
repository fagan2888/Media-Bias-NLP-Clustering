The guy who launched his career sporting a fake Jamaican accent and who in later years became famed for tantric sex stories and the lute playing. The man who \u201c30 Rock\u201d once convincingly described as living on Tan Penis Island. If you do a Google search for his name and \u201cpretentious\u201d you will get nearly 200,000 results. So how did a guy worth roughly $306 million, a man who recently put his seven-bedroom, 8,500-square-foot London home on the market, turn out to be so grounded? In a conversation this weekend with the Mail, the Grammy winner spoke proudly of his six children \u2013 aged 37 to 18 \u2014 from his two marriages, and how they won\u2019t be counting on the royalties from his old hits to make themselves rich. Reflecting on aging, the 62-year-old said, \u201cI have a story still to tell and part of that is I am facing the end of my life.\u201d And he said he has told his children, \u201cThere won\u2019t be much money left because we are spending it! We have a lot of commitments. What comes in we spend, and there isn\u2019t much left. I certainly don\u2019t want to leave them trust funds that are albatrosses round their necks. They have to work. All my kids know that and they rarely ask me for anything, which I really respect and appreciate. Obviously,\u201d he added, \u201d if they were in trouble I would help them, but I\u2019ve never really had to do that. They have this work ethic that makes them want to succeed on their own merit. People make assumptions, that they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth, but they have not been given a lot.\u201d As they Mail story notes, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson \u2014 the daughter of a conservative MP and an heiress \u2013 has similarly said, \u201cI am determined that my children should have no financial security. It ruins people not having to earn money.\u201d\n\nThough you might think that expecting one\u2019s adult children to earn their own keep would be a good thing, the headlines regarding Sting\u2019s revelation were far from flattering. Gawker declared this weekend that \u201cSting is stingy,\u201d the Detroit Free Press reported, \u201cSting to his kids: Earn your own money!\u201d and Time grimly announced that Sting had said \u201cMy Kids Aren\u2019t Getting Any of My Money.\u201d\n\nHis stance is certainly a sharp contrast to the glut of parents currently bankrolling the gentrification of your neighborhood with the fancy new condos they\u2019re buying their adult children. It\u2019s a far step away from Johnny Depp, who often pulls down $50 million in a single year and says, \u201cI have to. I mean, it\u2019s not for me. Do you know what I mean? At this point, it\u2019s for my kids. It\u2019s ridiculous, yeah, yeah. But ultimately is it for me? No. No. It\u2019s for the kids.\u201d It\u2019s his money to earn and spend, but let it be noted that Johnny Depp\u2019s kids apparently need superhuman amounts of funding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Grammy winner won't let his children be trust fund babies", "title": "Sting finally does something cool", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Grammy winner won't let his children be trust fund babies", "title": "Sting finally does something cool", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/23/sting_finally_does_something_cool/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sting.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Grammy winner won't let his children be trust fund babies", "title": "Sting finally does something cool", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sting.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affluenza, Johnny Depp, Sting, Wealth", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41af\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s ridiculous, yeah, yeah.\nTopics: Affluenza, Johnny Depp, Sting, Wealth, Life NewsWith a single revelation tailor made to destroy our 35 years of mocking him as a stuffy twit, it turns out Sting is pretty cool.\nAll my kids know that and they rarely ask me for anything, which I really respect and appreciate.\nYou know, that Sting.\nIt\u2019s for the kids.\u201d It\u2019s his money to earn and spend, but let it be noted that Johnny Depp\u2019s kids apparently need superhuman amounts of funding."}
