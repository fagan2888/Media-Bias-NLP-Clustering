Even this early in my medical career, I had a close colleague fall victim to suicide, a loss that deeply affected our medical community.\n\nI recently spoke with an attending physician about the culture of stoicism among doctors and how it affects our profession\u2019s ability to seek necessary treatment. She remarked that those who seek help face more than social stigma.\n\nAny form a physician fills out for further training, professional licensing or hospital privileges invariably includes some variation of the question, \u201cHave you ever been treated for a psychiatric disorder?\u201d\n\nAn open discussion of the vulnerabilities that put physicians at risk is a start at reversing the myth of the invincible physician. But until the professional consequences of seeking psychiatric treatment are lifted, physicians will often choose to forgo seeking help and face the devastating consequences.\n\nPAUL WILSON\n\nWest Lafayette, Ind., Sept. 9, 2014\n\nThe writer is a student at the Indiana University School of Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140914194404, "twitter": {"description": "A medical student discusses the reason many such doctors forgo psychiatric treatment.", "title": "Doctors Under Stress", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/opinion/doctors-under-stress.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003111033"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/opinion/doctors-under-stress.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003111033", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/opinion/doctors-under-stress.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Doctors Under Stress", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 14, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Suicides and Suicide Attempts,Doctors", "news_keywords": "Doctor", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A medical student discusses the reason many such doctors forgo psychiatric treatment.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A medical student discusses the reason many such doctors forgo psychiatric treatment.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-09-15", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Doctors", "published": "2014-09-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "lweb15docs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140915032704, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/opinion/doctors-under-stress.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A medical student discusses the reason many such doctors forgo psychiatric treatment.", "title": "Doctors Under Stress"}, "pdate": 20140914, "des": "Doctors", "articleid": 100000003111033, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Doctors Under Stress", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "To the Editor:\u201cWhy Do Doctors Commit Suicide?,\u201d by Pranay Sinha (Op-Ed, Sept. 5), poignantly examined the private afflictions that physicians face.\nI recently spoke with an attending physician about the culture of stoicism among doctors and how it affects our profession\u2019s ability to seek necessary treatment.\nBut until the professional consequences of seeking psychiatric treatment are lifted, physicians will often choose to forgo seeking help and face the devastating consequences.\nPAUL WILSONWest Lafayette, Ind., Sept. 9, 2014The writer is a student at the Indiana University School of Medicine.\nShe remarked that those who seek help face more than social stigma."}
