The Catholic university has 2,500 students, 80% of whom qualify for Pell grants.\n\nMcGuire\u2019s column, first published on the Huffington Post and reprinted on The Washington Post, addresses one of the hot debates in higher education.\n\nFor business students the debate is a source of two areas of interest: the education angle, but also the business angle.\n\nMcGuire first notes what has been pointed by many different media outlets \u2013 most of the school officials invited to this month\u2019s White House Summit on College Opportunity represented elite institutions. Only 2% of the universities represented at the summit have a student body where 70% of the students are using Pell grants, which McGuire wrote is \u201cthe best measure of low income students.\u201d Additionally, she noted that 89% of the schools at the summit have a student body where half the students are using Pell grants.\n\nEducation, at least in theory, remains an area that is supposed to be a true meritocracy. The ideal is that good students should have a chance at higher education without their economic status being a consideration.\n\nThe question that undermatching raises, however, is what university they should attend to get that education.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, McGuire is concerned that programs asking high school counselors to focus more on encouraging the best students to go to elite institutions will come at the expense of \u201cless prestigious colleges that do a very good job serving low income students.\u201d\n\nMcGuire also noted that such a focus also fails to consider that a low-income student may prefer attending a local college or university for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with education itself, such as wanting to be near family or work.\n\nThere are also issues about the research itself. McGuire noted that students are placed into the \u201chigh-achieving\u201d category based partly on SAT scores. Many students do not do well on standardized tests, she argued, and also that students who are good in one area might not be so good in other areas.\n\n\u201cThe good writers sometimes don\u2019t get it about algebra, and the math wizards can be clueless about commas,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe also questioned whether graduation rates and financial resources are proper indicators to assess the quality of a college. Graduation rates really only measure admissions risk and \u201cbrand loyalty,\u201d McGuire wrote, noting that elite universities have huge pools of applicants from which they can choose the few who have the best chance at being successful students. Smaller schools cannot be as selective. She also argued in her column that all schools who serve poorer students need better \u201cresources\u201d (in other words, money) and not just the elite schools.\n\nGet Free Updates!
