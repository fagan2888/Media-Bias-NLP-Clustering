Passengers at Dallas Love Field were briefly evacuated around lunchtime Saturday after a fire alarm went off inside the terminal .

Authorities said the alarm was activated in the basement but appeared to be a false alarm. No smoke or fire was found. Travelers were soon allowed back inside after going through security again.

Love Field spokesman Jose Torres said just before 12:30 p.m. that the terminal was back to normal. Love Field’s website lists only a handful of delays Saturday afternoon. It’s unclear if any of those delays were due to the evacuation.
