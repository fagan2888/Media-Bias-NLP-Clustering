Do you ever daydream about living in The White House? How would you decorate it? What would you change?

For me, the dream of living in the White House is always accompanied by crazy notions of what I would change about it. Giant ball pits, puppy rooms, private movie theatres, one’s mind can really wander! You’d be surprised yourself if you knew the changes the White House has already gone through.

The Rug Seller created these interesting infographics to highlight how the interior design styles have evolved over the decades – as well as tying in key, historic pieces. How best for each President to leave their own footprint on the House than to pave the way with a new rug:

As you’ll see by our infographic rugs are far more than functional flooring coverings that give comfort underfoot. Although they do just that, they’re also used to make a statement and what better place to make a visual statement than the White House? It is common practice that each President is allocated their own renovation budget to enable him to add his mark, so to speak, on interior design aspects. Many choose, or their 1st lady does, a new design for the rug in this famous room during their time in the Oval Office. The rug itself is one subtle method of letting the world have a visual representation behind their ideologies reflecting the era and personality of each President while they are in office.
