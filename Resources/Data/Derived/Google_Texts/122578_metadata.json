That was the premise of Megyn Kelly's now infamous question to Trump in which she queried how someone who had called women \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals\" would fare against the potential first female president. When Trump responded by attacking Kelly herself and seemed to suggest that she asked him tough debate questions because she was on her period, the pundits were SO SURE that he could never win with women. But guess what. He is. In the last three contests, Trump has been the top candidate for Republican women topping his nearest rival in Nevada by 18 points. And here's the thing, it's actually not crazy for Republican women to support Trump. If you put Trump's offensive personal attacks on women to the side, he is actually the best Republican candidate on women's health issues (although admittedly it's a low bar!).\n\nOn Planned Parenthood, Trump is better than his opponents. Thanks to doctored videos filmed by now-indicted antiabortion activists, Washington Republicans including the senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida have led a baseless witch hunt against the women's health organization and even considered shutting down the government in an effort to deny Planned Parenthood federal funds. Cruz and Rubio were among the Republican cosponsors of legislation to defund the organization with Cruz leading the shutdown threat. Even the allegedly moderate and reasonable Ohio Gov. John Kasich has gone along with these efforts, recently signing a bill in his home state that would defund the organization. Amazingly however, Trump has defended Planned Parenthood repeatedly in debates, has told Sean Hannity \"they do good things,\" and explained the \"very good work\" that Planned Parenthood does to Chuck Todd. Trump's decision to defend Planned Parenthood's non-abortion work certainly defies the Republican elite orthodoxy but may find some support among Republican women. After all, one in five American women have visited a Planned Parenthood in their life\u2014and Planned Parenthood enjoys a much higher approval rating than the Republican Party itself.\n\nOn Obamacare, Trump is better(ish) than his opponents. President Obama and democratic lawmakers designed the Affordable Care Act to improve women's health. From illegalizing charging women more for insurance to making birth control free to mandating a baseline of care that includes preventive care like mammograms, Obamacare is a big step forward on women's health that Republicans are chomping at the bit to tear apart. Well, all of the Republicans, except one. With Trump and Obamacare, it's complicated. He actually shocked conservatives by supporting the Obamacare mandate, one of the most controversial parts of the law, before backing down and echoing the Republicans' calls to repeal it. Trump has made a concerted effort though to distinguish himself from his Republican opponents telling the audience at a CNN Town Hall: \"So here's where I am a little different. I don't want people dying in the streets,\" a sentiment echoing others he's made about his commitment to health care for all. So how will he keep people from \"dying in the streets?\" Trump has kept the specifics fuzzy but has suggested the federal government may cover the costs of those who can't afford the private insurance price tag. Look, I'm not saying Trump's terrific here. But at least he's left some wiggle room on Obamacare and seems committed in principle to universal coverage with federal government involvement\u2014that DOES set him apart from his conservative rivals.\n\nAnd on that most controversial of women's health issues, abortion, Trump is also the most moderate of the top three contenders. Both Rubio and Cruz believe that a woman should be forced to bear the baby of her rapist. Trump also describes himself as pro-life (after years of defining himself as pro-choice) but unlike the others he supports exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. If the next president has a Supreme Court pick, Trump's moderation on abortion may just keep a majority on the court for upholding abortion as a right.\n\nTrump's more moderate stances on women's health are a throwback to a different time in the Republican party when there was actually room for pro-choice views. So far, Republican women (and men) seem perfectly comfortable with a universal-health-care-backing, abortion-exceptions-supporting, pro-Planned Parenthood candidate. Of course, this all assumes that we are taking Trump at his word which well\u2026this IS the man who continues to insist that thousands of people celebrated in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks. Obviously, if women's health is your issue, you would be 1000 times better off picking Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, in my opinion, but for Republican women, consider the alternative. I think I too would take my chances with Trump's flip-floppy squishiness over the certain extremism of Rubio and Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump was never supposed to be able to win with women.
