PHILADELPHIA — Sophomore attacker Matt Rambo had four goals and two assists to help Maryland edge Johns Hopkins 12-11 in the NCAA lacrosse semifinal Saturday.

Rambo, who equaled his career high for goals and assists, snapped a 10-10 tie when he scored on a spin move with 9:59 left. He added another goal with 7:24 to play for the Terrapins (15-3), who will meet Denver (16-2) in Monday’s title game.

Johns Hopkins’ Shack Stanwick cut it to 12-11 with 1:13 left and hit the side of the goal on a point-blank chance with 50 seconds left. Terps keeper Kyle Bernlohr stopped a blast by Joel Tinney in the final 10 seconds.

Jay Carlson scored three goals for Maryland, which avenged an April 25 loss to Johns Hopkins.

The Terps, making their third championship-game appearance in five years, have not won a title since 1975.
