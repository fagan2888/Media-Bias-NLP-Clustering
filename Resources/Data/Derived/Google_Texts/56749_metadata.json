(Photo: Gerald Herbert / AP)\n\nTucked away in toy boxes across the nation are stuffed animals named for our 26th President and an iconic bear that has been pulled back from the brink of extinction. The story goes that Theodore Roosevelt famously refused to shoot a wounded Louisiana black bear while on a hunting trip, eventually leading to the creation of \u201cTeddy bears.\u201d\n\nThe next chapter for the Louisiana black bears is just as compelling and \u2014 thanks to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) \u2014 has a happy ending.\n\nThe bears thrive in bottomland hardwood forests, which occur in southeast U.S. river floodplains, but by 1980, an estimated 80 percent of their habitat had been converted to agricultural use, and the bear\u2019s future looked bleak. The bear was listed as threatened \u2014 likely to be at risk of extinction in the foreseeable future \u2014 under the ESA in 1992.\n\nCommitted to saving the bear and its habitat, a motivated group of stakeholders came together and formed the Black Bear Conservation Coalition. People from the forest industry, conservationists, state personnel, private landowners, researchers, and the public worked for decades to fund research, educate the public, provide landowner assistance, and restore bear habitat.\n\nThanks to the hard work and partnership of many \u2014 today, tomorrow and yesterday \u2014 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has delisted the black bear from the ESA. The tremendous feat was completed in just 24 years \u2014 nine years ahead of the schedule laid out in its recovery plan.\n\nToday, the Service estimates that Louisiana black bear habitat has increased by a factor of five thanks to restoration efforts on public and private lands. Importantly, habitat connectivity has also increased; bears can travel more freely between populations, which improve genetic diversity and the overall health of the species.\n\nThe rapid recovery of the Louisiana black bear is a testament to the power and importance of effective partnering and shows that states, federal agencies, and private landowners can make a difference for our nation\u2019s imperiled species, preserving our natural heritage for generations to come.\n\nIt\u2019s also a testament to the power of the ESA. Since it was enacted by Congress in 1973, the ESA has successfully prevented the extinction of more than 99 percent of the species it protects \u2014 the recovery of the Louisiana black bear being its most recent success. It joins other iconic species such as the bald eagle and American alligator in being fully recovered and removed from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.\n\nRoosevelt, whose legacy as a conservationist endures to this day, would undoubtedly join us in celebrating the bear\u2019s bright future.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/03/20/saving-teddy-bear-partnerships-lead-louisiana-black-bear-recovery/82058684/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Iconic bear has been pulled back from the brink of extinction.", "og": {"site_name": "shreveporttimes.com", "description": "Iconic bear has been pulled back from the brink of extinction.", "title": "Saving the Teddy Bear: Partnerships Lead to Louisiana Black Bear Recovery", "url": "http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/03/20/saving-teddy-bear-partnerships-lead-louisiana-black-bear-recovery/82058684/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/shreveporttimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iconic bear has been pulled back from the brink of extinction.", "title": "Saving the Teddy Bear: Partnerships Lead to Louisiana Black Bear Recovery", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3658ba8245bd7eb4773e4d7be8871bef8dd37e8d/c=0-636-3098-3734&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/20/Shreveport/B9321420712Z.1_20160320192912_000_GALDQACBU.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@shreveporttimes", "site": "@shreveporttimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898368928", "fb": {"app_id": 170028863032820}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The Louisiana black bear has been removed from the endangered species list.\nCommitted to saving the bear and its habitat, a motivated group of stakeholders came together and formed the Black Bear Conservation Coalition.\nToday, the Service estimates that Louisiana black bear habitat has increased by a factor of five thanks to restoration efforts on public and private lands.\nFish and Wildlife Service has delisted the black bear from the ESA.\nThe story goes that Theodore Roosevelt famously refused to shoot a wounded Louisiana black bear while on a hunting trip, eventually leading to the creation of \u201cTeddy bears.\u201dThe next chapter for the Louisiana black bears is just as compelling and \u2014 thanks to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) \u2014 has a happy ending."}
