We\u2019re trying to make sure that happens in a gold-medal final in Glasgow,\" Alexander said.\n\n\"We have to stop throwing away silly ball, there are far too many brain-snap errors.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got enormous confidence, but we also got a timely reminder we\u2019re not there yet and we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nThe Diamonds tinkered with their line-up knowing they held an unbeatable 3-1 series lead going into the first ever trans-Tasman netball clash in Canberra.\n\nRookie Caitlyn Thwaites got her chance to start as goal shooter and despite some early teething problems, she was solid in attack and took her opportunities.\n\nAlexander swapped back to regular shooting star Caitlin Bassett after half-time, but the match continued to see-saw.\n\nThe Silver Ferns got out to a four goal lead with seven minutes left in the match, but the Diamonds sparked into action with Bassett and Erin Bell taking control.\n\nThe Diamonds clawed their way back to level the score in the last 90 seconds.\n\nThen a flurry of turnovers from both teams kept the crowd on edge before they erupted when Bassett nailed a goal with 14 seconds remaining to clinch a one-goal victory.\n\nThe Diamonds scored seven of the last 10 goals to beat their arch rivals.\n\n\"For us to win that game by one goal, it gives us such confidence that even when we\u2019re tired on the last day of competition, we can come through with the goods,\" Diamonds captain Laura Geitz said.\n\n\"Erin Bell \u2026 sinking that long bomb [in the last quarter] you could tell it just lifted the team and it was the turning moment out there.\n\n\"This team is capable of doing exciting things and that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to.\"\n\nThere was a bash and crash contest in New Zealand\u2019s attacking circle.\n\nThe Silver Ferns have been fuming at Australia\u2019s physical defence in the series and there were massive crashes again when Geitz hit the floor in the opening minutes.\n\nAt one point New Zealand skipper Casey Kopua jeered Geitz for her \"Hollywood\" dive after taking a hit in the circle.\n\nStar New Zealand goal attack Maria Tutaia won player of the match but said she left Canberra with mixed emotions.\n\n\"We can take a lot of highs and lows from this game but a loss is never a good feeling,\" Tutaia said.\n\n\"We just have to deal with [Australia\u2019s physical defence], we\u2019re very well known for playing very skillful netball with the Silver Ferns. In great patches of play, we did that.\"\n\nKopua said the team would use the series defeat as motivation to chase a third consecutive gold medal at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"We won\u2019t be happy with that, the girls will go back and work even harder. Losing to Australia plays with your emotions and you never, ever want that feeling again,\" Kopua said.\n\nThe Diamonds will finish their international season with two Tests against Malawi next week in Wollongong and Gold Coast.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\n\n\nAUSTRALIA 50 (Caitlin Bassett 20/25, Caitlyn Thwaites 17/19, Natalie Medhurst 10/13, Erin Bell 3/3) bt NEW ZEALAND 49 (Catherine Latu 25/27, Maria Tutaia 24/33) at AIS Arena.
