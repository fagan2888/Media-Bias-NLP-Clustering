Most states require motorists to have liability coverage, and Americans have been alerted the past two years via the Affordable Care Act to obtain health care insurance or face consequences.\n\nBut other types of insurance are more subject to debate, at least in terms of their necessity. It takes a savvy insurance consumer to pore over the pros and cons of purchasing various types of coverage ranging from car rental and flight insurance to life insurance for the children and family pet.\n\nThe decision is often a personal one \u2014 what may be pointless to one person may seem irreplaceable to another. Every type of insurance deserves careful thought before buying. Below are seven types of insurance along with observations from experts who offer insights into questions consumers should have answers to before inking a check for any kind of coverage.\n\nCar rental insurance\n\nMaking sure you\u2019re protected when driving a rental is perfectly sensible. What may not be prudent is needlessly doubling up on coverage.\n\nBefore signing on for renter\u2019s insurance that many car rental outfits push, check with your insurance company. The coverage that you already have on your own cars may also apply to any rental.\n\n\u201cGive your credit card company a call,\u201d added Eric Stauffer of ExpertInsuranceReviews.com, an insurance consumer website. \u201cThey may offer liability coverage.\u201d\n\nMake a special point to be proactive if you\u2019re renting a car outside of the United States, Stauffer said. Coverage needs will differ in foreign countries, so be certain that whatever insurance you already own applies and offers sufficient protection.\n\nInsuring older cars\n\nA new car is a shiny, immaculate gem. Even the slightest ding can justify a prompt repair, which makes collision coverage a justifiable expense.\n\nNot so with older cars. The tipping point is when the constantly dropping value of the car falls below the insurance premium and deductible, which may cost more than what the owner might receive from an insurance claim. If that\u2019s you, give some thought to zapping both collision and comprehensive coverage (this covers things like theft, fire and other mishaps). Liability coverage is required by law in most states.\n\n\u201cThe only reason to carry it would be if you still have a car loan that requires you to do so,\u201d said John O\u2019Brien, a Chicago attorney who has handled a number of insurance-related cases. \u201cOtherwise, the risk-reward benefit isn't there.\u201d\n\nWhen is the optimal time to lose collision and comprehensive coverage? Check the approximate current value of your vehicle at websites such as Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book. If the replacement value is less than 10 times what you\u2019re paying in premiums, consider making the change.\n\nCatastrophic illness coverage\n\nThe thought of contracting a serious disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s or cancer is understandably distressing. But spending money to protect yourself against a specific malady is likely wasteful, experts say.\n\nCatastrophic illness coverage is designed to address the expense that can result from particular health problems. Some policies come in the form of supplemental insurance, which augments basic health insurance, while others are stand-alone policies that pay out a lump sum, which can be used for medical care, expenses, lost wages and other costs.\n\nGiven the skyscraper-size bills that can come with fighting a protracted, serious disease, investing in catastrophic coverage may seem worthwhile. But there are caveats galore. Some policies may not pay out a dime until you\u2019ve had the illness for several years. Others limit the specific forms of disease covered by the policy (for instance, some cancer policies exclude skin cancer).\n\n\u201cUnless there are really extraordinary circumstances, buying this type of insurance is a sucker\u2019s bet,\u201d said O\u2019Brien.\n\nBut certain \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d may warrant consideration of catastrophic illness coverage, such as an established family history of a particular disease. If that\u2019s the case, review the restrictions and look for coverage of preventive screening and experimental treatments.\n\nChildren\u2019s life insurance\n\nIf ever a product was designed to yank at any parent\u2019s heartstrings, this might be the one. Children\u2019s life insurance provides financial protection in the event of a child\u2019s death. Coverage limits are relatively low at the start and may increase as the child grows older.\n\nSome insurers recommend such insurance as a means to save for college. Others point out funds may be used for burial costs and other final expenses. Insurability is yet another pitch, particularly for families with a history of poor health, to get life insurance before the kids get older and, in theory, become more difficult to insure.\n\nBut children\u2019s life insurance warrants careful review. For one thing, said certified financial planner Faye Doria, insuring a child runs counter to the very premise of buying life insurance \u2014 to protect a family from significant financial hardship caused by the death of a loved one. Unless your youngster is a TV star or musical wunderkind, there\u2019s really no financial stake to protect.\n\n\u201cPlus, the amount that most kids can be insured for is really a drop in the bucket,\u201d adds Doria, based in Dover, New Hampshire.\n\nAs for the college savings angle, Stauffer points out that the amount the child could receive is roughly the amount paid into the policy. Far better, Stauffer advises, to boost a parent\u2019s life insurance policy and fund a 529 college savings plan, which will almost certainly pay out more come the time to head off to college.\n\n\u201cThese policies are almost predatory the way they play on people\u2019s emotions,\u201d Stauffer said. \u201cUnless you have a child who is somehow or other supporting a family, they simply make no sense.\u201d\n\nEasier coverage calls\n\nSome types of insurance may appeal to some while utterly repelling others. Then, there are other forms of coverage the genuine need of which is a good deal more questionable:\n\n\u2022 Flight insurance: Airplane travel isn\u2019t the same in the post-9/11 world. But statistics suggest there\u2019s only a one in 11 million chance of dying in an airplane crash. And, if those numbers aren\u2019t comforting enough, you\u2019re probably already insured if you paid for your ticket with a major credit card. Check with your card company.\n\n\u2022 Credit life insurance: This coverage for obligations such as a mortgage, credit card debt or a car loan pays off the lender in full if the borrower dies before the loan is paid off. That may sound like a solid idea, but credit life coverage is considered one of the most overpriced forms of coverage on the market. On top of that, survivors aren't on the hook to pay off the deceased's debts unless their names are also on the account. If debt is of concern, just buy more life insurance.\n\n\u2022 Pet insurance: Call this a four-legged variant of children\u2019s life insurance. Unless your dog\u2019s name happens to be Lassie, whose income warrants a higher credit score than your own, treat your pet to a yummy chew toy and pocket the remainder.\n\nJeff Wuorio lives in Southern Maine, where he covers personal finance and entrepreneurship.
