The 13th century Latin text and its associated chant are among the most famous in the entire liturgy and were incorporated into the Requiem Mass. The text was originally intended for All Souls' Day.\n\nThrough a strange series of events, Seicento is presenting not just the U.S. premiere of the 324-year-old work but the first performance ever in the Western Hemisphere. The piece apparently was performed for the funeral of no less a figure than Grand Dauphin Louis, son and heir of Louis XIV, in 1711, the same year that de Lalande's two daughters died.\n\n\"It was long thought lost, but then a manuscript copy appeared at an auction in 1950,\" said Browne, who also is music director of FUMC, which has become one of the city's most prominent venues for classical music performances.\n\nEvanne Browne (Richard Saxon / Courtesy photo)\n\nThe manuscript was purchased by a reclusive collector in Strasbourg, France, and was long unavailable for study or performance. Musicologist Lionel Sawkins finally was able to view it and make a workable score, completing some of the inner viola lines that were absent from the manuscript copy. The Sawkins edition was first performed in France in 1990 and also recorded by Philippe Herreweghe.\n\nSawkins retains exclusive performance rights of his edition, and the score is neither easy nor inexpensive to obtain.\n\n\"But I knew that we just had to perform it,\" Browne said. She explained that Seicento, which specializes in music of the 17th century, already has conquered French baroque style, including ornamentation, French pronunciation of Latin and so-called \"notes in\u00e9gales,\" a type of rhythmic variation involving the durations of certain notes.\n\nDe Lalande's rare masterpiece occupies the second half of this weekend's program. The first half opens with organist Kajsa Teitelbaum performing J.S. Bach's extremely famous \"Toccata and Fugue in D minor,\" heard in Boulder on FUMC's newly restored instrument. Probably no other piece of classical music is more associated with \"scary\" Halloween imagery.\n\nPortions of another, more accessible de Lalande motet for All Souls' Day, \"De profundis clamavi,\" also will be performed, as will the witches' scene from Act II of Henry Purcell's 1689 opera \"Dido and Aeneas.\" Three short motets for the feast of All Saints' Day, including one by late Renaissance composer William Byrd, will be heard, and the program is completed by \"Der Gerechte kommt um\" (\"The Righteous Must Die\"), a Bach arrangement, with German text, of a Latin funeral motet by Johann Kuhnau.\n\nSoloists for the program include soprano Amanda Balestrieri, alto Marjorie Bunday, tenor Steven Soph, and baritone Ryan Parker. Seicento's two youngest artists, Rachel Morrissey and Leah Weitzner, perform in the Purcell witches' scene. Weitzner is a high school student and the group's third Apprentice Artist for Early Music Performance.\n\nIn addition to discussing the Halloween program, Browne also talked about Seicento and its mission.\n\n\"We are Colorado's only group to be doing historically informed performances of baroque music,\" she said. The word Seicento is the Italian designation for the 17th century, the 1600s.\n\nBrowne explained that many groups are doing late baroque music from the first half of the 18th century, including that of Bach and Handel, while others, including Boulder's Ars Nova Singers, often perform music of the Renaissance, which preceded the 17th century.\n\n\"I saw a gap there,\" said Browne, who studied early baroque music in the Netherlands.\n\nShe said music from that period often confounds choral conductors because they either find it boring or don't have a clue how to approach it.\n\nThe group consists of an auditioned choir that performs with accompaniment from period instruments. Browne was inspired to create the ensemble when, in 2010, she decided to stage a period performance of Claudio Monterverdi's famous Vespers in celebration of the work's 400th anniversary. She was shocked to discover it was the first performance of this major piece in the state.\n\nIn addition to next weekend's programs, the Seicento Baroque Ensemble, which made its debut in fall 2011, plans two more appearances for the season. In December, they join the Boulder Chamber Orchestra, directed by Bahman Saless, for its holiday concerts, performing Vivaldi's \"Gloria.\" It will be their first performance with modern instruments. Those concerts are Dec. 19 at FUMC and Dec. 20 at Montview Presbyterian Church in Denver.\n\nA program in March will focus on music commissioned and inspired by the flamboyant Queen Christina of Sweden. The 17th century monarch was a devoted patron of the arts and spent time in Rome. She knew the music of such figures as Carlo Gesualdo and Alessandro Scarlatti. Raised to wear men's clothing and become \"king\" of England, Christina's history includes many questions about her sexual identity. The concerts will be done partly in conjunction with Out Boulder, whose offices are near FUMC. These programs play March 6 at St. Paul in Denver, March 7 at FUMC,and March 8 at the Stanley Hotel Concert Hall in Estes Park.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_26794082/boulders-seicento-baroque-ensemble-offers-halloween-themed-concerts", "sailthru.author": "By Kelly Dean Hansen \n \n  Camera Classical  Music Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26794082:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-26T06:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Relatively new group's program includes rare continental premiere of work written in 1690.", "title": "Boulder's Seicento Baroque Ensemble offers Halloween-themed concerts", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_26794082/boulders-seicento-baroque-ensemble-offers-halloween-themed-concerts", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1024/20141024__26DCPCLA~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "modificationDate": "2014-10-25T16:50:59-0600", "endDate": "2024-10-24T17:08:11-0600", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado news, Entertainment Boulder news, Entertainment Colorado news, US Entertainment news, world Entertainment news.", "byline": "By Kelly Dean", "pubDate": "2014-10-25T16:52:04-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-26T06:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder's Seicento Baroque Ensemble offers Halloween-themed concerts", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1024/20141024__26DCPCLA~1_300.jpg", "description": "Relatively new group's program includes rare continental premiere of work written in 1690.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_26794082/boulders-seicento-baroque-ensemble-offers-halloween-themed-concerts", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Relatively new group's program includes rare continental premiere of work written in 1690.", "title": "Boulder's Seicento Baroque Ensemble offers Halloween-themed concerts"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1024/20141024__26DCPCLA~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2002\"", "article_summary": "In addition to next weekend's programs, the Seicento Baroque Ensemble, which made its debut in fall 2011, plans two more appearances for the season.\n\"We are Colorado's only group to be doing historically informed performances of baroque music,\" she said.\n: Dr. Deborah Kaufmann will give a pre-concert talk at 6:45 both nightsThe Seicento Baroque Ensemble, one of Boulder's newest classical music groups, offers a unique Halloween celebration this weekend that does not involve candy or costumes.\nWeitzner is a high school student and the group's third Apprentice Artist for Early Music Performance.\n\"I saw a gap there,\" said Browne, who studied early baroque music in the Netherlands."}
