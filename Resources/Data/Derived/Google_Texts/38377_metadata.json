Nor should it be. The test of our commitment to free expression, after all, isn't our willingness to tolerate speech that everyone likes. If you only support free speech for ideas you agree with, you're a hack. If you only support free speech for ideas that everyone agrees with, you're a coward.

To have acted so hastily, in violation of OU's own student conduct code, bespeaks a dishonorable willingness to throw students to the wolves in order to avoid bad publicity \u2014 accompanied, perhaps, by the sort of generalized hostility to fraternities that seems all too common among university administrations these days. (That hostility, based on a general dislike of fraternities as bastions of \"white male privilege,\" is itself racist and sexist, of course.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In a fiery column for USA Today, Glenn Reynolds, the Instapundit and a law prof at University of Tennessee, tears into the University of Oklahoma's president", "title": "\"If you only support free speech for ideas you agree with, you're a hack.\"", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/16/if-you-only-support-free-speech-for-idea", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14265305271366.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a fiery column for USA Today, Glenn Reynolds, the Instapundit and a law prof at University of Tennessee, tears into the University of Oklahoma's president David Boren, who expelled the idiot frat brother caught singing racist songs.
