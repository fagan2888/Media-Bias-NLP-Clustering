It\u2019s just amazing.\u201d\n\nThe sequence of plays leading up to the winner was thrilling.\n\nBraden Holtby prevented the Rangers from winning just seconds before Ovechkin scored. The Washington goaltender stopped Rick Nash in close, then combined with defenseman Nate Schmidt to stop Derek Stepan on the rebound attempt.\n\nOvechkin, playing in the 800th game of his career, got the puck and skated the length of the ice on the left side before cutting across the middle and beating Lundqvist to give Washington its 12th victory in 14 games (12-1-1). Ovechkin will try to join the NHL\u2019s 500-goal club Sunday at home against Ottawa.\n\n\u201cNash obviously took it to the net,\u201d Holtby said after making 23 saves and improving to 19-0-2 in his past 21 starts. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big, long body. It was a spin-around chance. I threw my right pad and had nowhere else to put it but to Stepan. He made a nice move, but Schmitty stuck with the play and made a game-saver.\n\n\u201cThose kind of plays, if you\u2019re a confident group, they happen.\u201d\n\nOvechkin got the loose puck next to his own goal, circled behind his net and then used his speed and great shot to end the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to score one goal, sooner or later,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alex Ovechkin on brink of joining 500 club", "title": "Alex Ovechkin on brink of joining 500 club", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/alex-ovechkin-on-brink-of-joining-500-club/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__BN20160110_Z00_BNSP10HKNSEPp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__BN20160110_Z00_BNSP10HKNSEPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T19:10:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:00:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Braden Holtby prevented the Rangers from winning just seconds before Ovechkin scored.\n500 is going to be special for Russian superstar Alexander Ovechkin whenever it comes, No.\nOvechkin will try to join the NHL\u2019s 500-goal club Sunday at home against Ottawa.\nThe Washington goaltender stopped Rick Nash in close, then combined with defenseman Nate Schmidt to stop Derek Stepan on the rebound attempt.\n\u201cNash obviously took it to the net,\u201d Holtby said after making 23 saves and improving to 19-0-2 in his past 21 starts."}
