In August 2012, about four years after the government took control of the two mortgage firms, federal officials directed the companies to turn over nearly all profits to the U.S. Treasury. Several investor groups have sued to challenge the arrangement.\n\nThe Senate legislation \u2014 by Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) \u2014 does not address how to deal with the shareholders. Some key lawmakers, including Crapo, have said they are looking to the courts for answers. But as a Senate panel prepares to vote on the Johnson-Crapo measure possibly later this month, the newly formed groups are making it known that they want Congress to deal with the issue.\n\nOn Wednesday, about 50 Fannie and Freddie shareholders went to Capitol Hill to deliver the message. Investors Unite, launched by Tennessee money manager Timothy J. Pagliara, organized the visit with support from consumer activist Ralph Nader, a vocal critic of the government\u2019s treatment of the shareholders.\n\n\u201cThis needs to be solved in Congress,\u201d Pagliara, chief executive of CapWealth Advisors, said at a news conference to kick off the event. His firm\u2019s clients own 8 million shares of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock. \u201cIt\u2019s a cowardly act to throw that back at the court system.\u201d\n\nShareholders responded with rowdy applause and waved signs that read \u201cShareholders Have Rights\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Wipe Us Out.\u201d Pagliara said the event was designed to highlight that the Fannie and Freddie debate affects 9-to-5 working people, not just monied hedge funds and institutional investors looking for a tidy profit.\n\nAmong the attendees were a Nevada homemaker, a Kansas farmer, a California human resources specialist and David Sims \u2014 a Seeking Alpha blogger in Richmond who helped organize the event by reaching out to other Fannie and Freddie shareholders on message boards.\n\nEarlier this week, another group entered the fray. The Coalition for Mortgage Security announced its launch in a statement Monday and vowed to press for legislation that \u201cresponsibly winds down\u201d Fannie and Freddie. But the Johnson-Crapo measure is not it, Ken Blackwell, the group\u2019s director, said Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate proposal is \u201cinsufficient\u201d when it comes to protecting homeowners, taxpayers and investors, said Blackwell, a Republican who has served as undersecretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and mayor of Cincinnati. His group plans to go national with its message via social media, traditional news outlets and town-hall meetings once its puts together a bipartisan team, Blackwell said.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t want the situation that we\u2019ve had with Obamacare, where almost from the beginning, this is perceived to be a decisively partisan issue,\u201d Blackwell said.\n\nAnother group, the conservative 60 Plus Association, invoked President Obama\u2019s health-care law when it unleashed a $1.6 million blitz of television and radio advertisements targeting senators who support the Johnson-Crapo bill. The group bashed the bill for helping wipe out investor profits and urged senators not to \u201cbring Obamacare to the mortgage industry.\u201d\n\nWhen the ads came out last week, supporters of the Johnson-Crapo measure, including the Consumer Federation of America and the Mortgage Bankers Association, said in a statement that 60 Plus was using \u201cscare tactics.\u201d 60 Plus, \u201calong with hedge funds and other third party groups who have shown little other interest in housing, is offering misleading information and comparisons in an effort to derail this bipartisan reform effort that has been years in the making,\u201d the statement said, adding that the hedge funds \u201ccould reap massive profits by keeping the housing finance system in its current state of limbo.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear who is funding the campaigns of 60 Plus, the Coalition for Mortgage Security and Investors Unite because they are tax-exempt groups that are not required to disclose their donors. Through a spokesman, 60 Plus said it has 250,000 donors across the country who contribute to its efforts. Pagliara said he and other donors are funding his group and that many of the shareholders at Wednesday\u2019s event on Capitol Hill paid for their trips to Washington.\n\nThe coalition headed by Blackwell said it will keep its supporters private unless they prefer to go public. \u201cI don\u2019t have any worries that we will be sufficiently funded,\u201d he said.\n\nBut will all these groups have sway? Probably not, said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities. \u201cI would say that any of these groups that pop up overnight to combat a single issue tend to have a lot less influence than established players who have been working with lawmakers through multiple election cycles,\u201d Seiberg said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, Fannie, Freddie, Ralph Nader, housing finance reform, GSE reform, Johnson, Crapo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Fannie, Freddie shareholders say a Senate proposal would hurt the mortgage giants\u2019 investors.", "title": "Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac shareholders rail against measure to dismantle two firms", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-shareholders-rail-against-measure-to-dismantle-two-firms/2014/04/09/70be13e0-c00a-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/09/National-Economy/Images/AP090820084029.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-shareholders-rail-against-measure-to-dismantle-two-firms/2014/04/09/70be13e0-c00a-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business, Fannie, Freddie, Ralph Nader, housing finance reform, GSE reform, Johnson, Crapo", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "70be13e0-c00a-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Fannie, Freddie shareholders say a Senate proposal would hurt the mortgage giants\u2019 investors."}, "article_summary": "On Wednesday, about 50 Fannie and Freddie shareholders went to Capitol Hill to deliver the message.\nThese groups are demanding a stop to what they view as the government\u2019s rip-off of Fannie and Freddie investors.\nHis firm\u2019s clients own 8 million shares of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock.\nThe Coalition for Mortgage Security announced its launch in a statement Monday and vowed to press for legislation that \u201cresponsibly winds down\u201d Fannie and Freddie.\nBut the Johnson-Crapo measure is not it, Ken Blackwell, the group\u2019s director, said Wednesday."}
