Last week, the land was acquired by the Urban Land Conservancy, which is planning demolition on Sept. 3.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely our goal to, as soon as possible, get it abated and demolished and have it be a more productive and positive force in the neighborhood,\u201d said Debra Bustos, vice president of real estate for the Urban Land Conservancy.\n\nBustos said another group had purchased a tax lien that was on the property, which Urban Land Conservancy then bought. If a property owner does not pay property taxes for a certain period of time, someone else can pay those taxes and file a treasurer\u2019s deed. In this case no one came forward to take possession of the property and the liens are wiped out. Urban Land Conservancy paid just over $100,000 for the property.\n\n\u201cThis is a major victory for us as a community,\u201d said City Councilman Paul Lopez, who represents the area. \u201cThis is a major victory for me as a councilman.\u201d\n\nThe property, which is referred to as the \u201cOld Thriftway\u201d in the neighborhood, once was home to a Laundromat, convenience store and dry cleaner. But since 2008, it\u2019s been a haven for criminal activity and squatting place for the homeless.\n\nIn the past year, police have responded to a suicide, a sexual assault and recovered stolen goods in the back of the property. There was illegal dumping on site, and the building is littered with graffiti and broken windows.\n\nMore recently there was an assault at the building that resulted in a person\u2019s death.\n\nBordering the site is a seniors apartment complex, a trailer park community and a preschool for the Denver Indian Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been vacant, an eyesore and a magnet for transients, all within a few feet of a daycare facility,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s yet to be decided what will become of the property, but Bustos said it would complement the neighborhood. Urban Land Conservancy also will have a special contractor come in to properly remove the asbestos from the property prior to demolition.\n\nResidents and people in the community are excited that a blight in the community is being removed.\n\n\u201cI think that this change is going to be catalytic for the neighborhood,\u201d said Rachel Cleaves, co-chair of Westwood Unidos, a neighborhood group. \u201cIt\u2019s been been a very unsafe, blighted property for years.\u201d\n\nFelipe Perez, maintenance supervisor of the Belmont Apartments, a senior living facility bordering the property, said the residents always have expressed unease over the Old Thriftway. He thinks they will be glad when the building comes down.\n\n\u201cI think for the seniors who live here, they will probably feel safer,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI know they have concerns.\u201d\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Old Thriftway in Denver\u2019s Westwood neighborhood bought by Urban Land Conservancy", "title": "Old Thriftway in Denver\u2019s Westwood neighborhood bought by Urban Land Conservancy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/05/old-thriftway-in-denvers-westwood-neighborhood-bought-by-urban-land-conservancy/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T15:08:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-05T15:08:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Last week, the land was acquired by the Urban Land Conservancy, which is planning demolition on Sept. 3.\nBustos said another group had purchased a tax lien that was on the property, which Urban Land Conservancy then bought.\nA blighted old Thriftway in Denver\u2019s Westwood neighborhood finally will be torn down next month.\nUrban Land Conservancy also will have a special contractor come in to properly remove the asbestos from the property prior to demolition.\nUrban Land Conservancy paid just over $100,000 for the property."}
