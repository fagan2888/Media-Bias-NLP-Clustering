Practitioners take a holistic approach to patient care; that is, they see the patient as a whole person, not just a set of symptoms or a series of isolated conditions.\n\nThey\u2019re also focused on prevention and wellness, and place a high value on the body\u2019s natural ability to heal itself in conjunction with other natural forces. This proactive stance is a dramatic divergence from linear, interventional approaches to medicine in which most efforts are aimed at curing illness once it occurs. Many of these practices and techniques draw on long-established, even ancient, traditions.\n\nThe difference between complementary and alternative\n\nAlthough the terms are often used in tandem or interchangeably, there is a difference. Complementary means \u201calong with.\u201d Alternative means \u201cinstead of.\u201d So, for example, if you use yoga and blood pressure pills together to reduce hypertension, the yoga is complementary; if you use yoga to replace the drugs entirely, it is alternative.\n\nWhat types of CAM are there?\n\nAccording to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, an arm of the National Institutes of Health, the practices can be divided into two main streams: natural products and mind/body practices.\n\nNatural products include herbs (also called botanicals), vitamins and minerals, and probiotics. They are heavily marketed, readily available to users, often sold as packaged dietary supplements and can include many products sold loosely. These are diet-based therapies.\n\nThere is a wide range of mind/body practices. The prominent and most widely recognized ones are:\n\nn yoga, which is a broad field integrating mind, body and spirit, combining physical postures and movement, breathing exercised and meditation;\n\nn acupuncture;\n\nn massage therapy in which practitioners manipulate the soft tissues of the body;\n\nn meditation such as mindfulness meditation or transcendental meditation;\n\nn movement therapies such as Pilates;\n\nn relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises and guided imagery;\n\nn spinal manipulation as practiced by chiropractors, osteopathic physicians, naturopathic physicians, physical therapists and some medical doctors;\n\nn tai chi and qigong, practices from traditional Chinese medicine that combine specific movements or postures, coordinated breathing, and mental focus;\n\nn hands-on practices such as Reiki and other energy transfers;\n\nn other approaches such as hypnotherapy.\n\nFor more information, visit the website, www.nccam.nih.gov.\n\nAn ever-changing landscape\n\nThe list of practices is constantly changing for several reasons. One, mainstream medicine \u2014 and all its literature and news \u2014 is slow to recognize some of them. Two, growing research validates many practices and even separates some into smaller but distinct practices. And three, some are becoming so widely accepted and used that they are no longer considered by many people to be out of the mainstream.\n\nAccording to the NCCAM, 40 percent of American adults look to CAM to \u201cimprove well-being, relieve symptoms, and enhance traditional care.\u201d This is confirmed by surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Americans\u2019 annual CAM bill comes to $34 billion, or about $350 for every American adult who uses it.\n\nAlthough that might seem small \u2014 certainly compared with overall health expenditures that topped $3 trillion last year (nine times as much as spent on CAM alone) \u2014 it is still a large and growing market, with career opportunities popping up everywhere.\n\nCAM is here to stay\n\nData collected from reports in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Wall Street Journal show that in 1977, one-third of the American population was using some form of CAM therapy, but by 2001, subsequent analyses of lifetime use demonstrated that 67 percent of those surveyed in 1977 reported continual use of at least one therapy. Further, the reports state, although \u201cit is often difficult to project long-term trends, past utilization of CAM therapies forecast a promising future. Today, CAM has proven to be neither a short-lived social phenomenon nor a radical replacement of conventional medicine.\u201d\n\nThere are underlying reasons for the growth. Although the wide range of complementary and alternative therapies may differ, they all seem to do five things: empower the individual to participate in and take responsibility for his or her own health; emphasize on lifestyle issues such as regular exercise, proper nutrition, sufficient rest, and emotional and spiritual balance; treat the individual as a whole person, as opposed to a collection of parts; focus on prevention and wellness; and, because of widespread access to the Internet for most Americans, fit in well with our need to take ownership of our health care decisions.\n\nSo where are the jobs?\n\nAs recently as 20 years ago, mainstream medicine in the United States paid little attention to complementary and alternative medicine and, worse, many mainstream practitioners were outwardly dismissive of it, considering it a fad, at best, but more as a danger that wasn\u2019t understood and couldn\u2019t be measured or regulated\n\nToday, as a result of intense study of, deep research in and close attention to the whole field \u2014 predominantly by the National Institutes of Health and many leading colleges and medical schools \u2014 CAM has become widely accepted. What\u2019s more it has been woven into much of the mainstream in what is called integrative medicine, the practice of combining complementary and alternative modalities with traditional biomedicine.\n\nConsequently, you will find that, although a few decades ago CAM practitioners were on their own (and marginalized), they are now employed by medical centers, hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, hospice facilities, and other mainstream establishments in the care of almost every type of patient with every kind of condition, from cancer to colitis to asthma, and for dealing with situations as varied as childbirth, depression, addiction, pain management, sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders.\n\nDemonstrating this trend, the American Hospital Association reported, in 2011, that 42 percent of hospitals in the U.S. offered at least one CAM modality, up from 37 percent in 2007, and the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments show increasing use of complementary modalities, as well. According to the VA, 89 percent of their facilities offered complementary therapies in 2011.\n\nAnd how does one qualify?\n\nAs in any other field, different jobs require different qualifications such as certificates or degrees.\n\nCertificate programs are widely available for \u2014 and are sufficient for entry into \u2014 the fields of reflexology, massage therapy, spiritual or energy healing, life coaching, yoga, Pilates, Reiki and others. These are generally short courses, many of which are available online. It is advisable to take these courses from accredited schools, whether they are two or four year colleges or technical trades schools.\n\nYou can earn degrees at a traditional (brick and mortar) campus, through distance learning or through a blended approach using both. Here are the levels:\n\nn Associate degree (AA, AS) \u2014 This is generally a two-year course of study, usually requiring a high school diploma with prerequisites in science and math. Many of these programs will qualify you to become a technologist, health assistant, aroma or other kind of therapist, aesthetician, herbalist and even writer in the field.\n\nn Bachelor\u2019s degree (BA, BS) \u2014 Done full time, bachelor\u2019s degrees are prescribed as four-year programs, but many people today cannot devote all their time to study and must take longer. In fact, more people take more than fours than those who complete school in the same span. In rarer cases, a bachelor\u2019s degree is completed in less than four years.\n\nIn addition to traditional courses \u2014 biology, chemistry, math, health systems and so forth \u2014 many schools now include courses in herbal remedies, nutrition science, traditional Chinese medicine and homeopathy. With your BA or BS, you can qualify for jobs such as holistic health practitioners, herbalists, naturopathic health practitioners, nutrition counselors, research assistants, program coordinators and writers.\n\nn Master\u2019s degree (MA, MS) \u2014 Masters-level programs require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and develop advanced knowledge of a specific area of expertise. In addition to master\u2019s degrees in any of the biological sciences or chemistry or other sciences, there are now Master of Sciences degrees specifically in CAM.\n\nAside from jobs as listed above (with associate or bachelor\u2019s degrees), holders of Master of Sciences degrees in CAM become health care educators and practice managers, as well as higher level and higher paid practitioners and therapists. They also find positions in regulatory, legal, and administrative affairs of integrative, complementary and alternative health care.\n\nn Doctorate degree (PhD, DAOM) \u2014 CAM doctorates include naturopathic doctor, doctor of chiropractic, doctor of acupuncture and oriental medicine, doctor of nursing practice, doctor of osteopathic medicine and doctor of philosophy. All of these programs require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and many require a master\u2019s degree.\n\nThey are two- to four-year programs depending on the degree. Graduates with these doctorate degrees typically practice as chiropractic, naturopathic, or osteopathic physicians, nurse midwives, acupuncturists or even college professors.\n\nWhere\u2019s it all going?\n\nDepending on the studies you read and the data you access, Americans\u2019 expenditures on complementary and alternative products and practices are growing from 4 to 10 percent per year. The market for CAM \u2014 and across-the-board career opportunities along with it \u2014 will likely double in 7\u00bd years, a growth rate much faster than that of the U.S. economy and faster than most sectors and occupations.\n\nWhat\u2019s are the drivers?\n\nThese numbers do not even take into account several major, looming factors that will exert enormous pressure for change: the Affordable Care Act, intensified research (the NIH consistently pours $250 million into research and training each year), Americans\u2019 total health care expenses spiraling out of control to more than $3 trillion, and difficult-to-measure changes in Americans\u2019 attitudes toward more natural and self-directed health care practices. Real growth rates in CAM and CAM careers could very easily be double to triple what they\u2019ve been.\n\nProof positive\n\nTwo recent statements in The Natural Medicine Journal put everything you\u2019ve read above into clear and compelling terms.\n\n1. \u201cAs the costs of health care and prescription drugs rapidly increase each year, policymakers are now focusing their attention on the cost of various therapies and providers in the face of a finite health care budget and limited health care resources.\u201d\n\n2.\u201cWith the increasing popularity of CAM, policymakers and insurers invested in addressing the rising cost of health care should work to ensure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act proceeds as intended (inclusive of CAM providers).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/careers-complementary-and-alternative-medicine", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "ELI AMDUR", "parsely-title": "Careers in complementary and alternative medicine", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_155675071.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "If you are in a group of four American adults, and you have never used at least one form of complementary or alternative medicine, chances are you\u2019re the only one.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/careers-complementary-and-alternative-medicine", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_155675071.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_200254987-001.jpg"}, "title": "Careers in complementary and alternative medicine", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-22T20:22:20Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-803836"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=277948", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=277948", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "ELI AMDUR", "parsely-section": "News", "keywords": "News,,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-22T13:22:20-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "If you are in a group of four American adults, and you have never used at least one form of complementary or alternative medicine, chances are you\u2019re the only one.", "title": "Careers in complementary and alternative medicine", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/careers-complementary-and-alternative-medicine", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_155675071.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "If you are in a group of four American adults, and you have never used at least one form of complementary or alternative medicine, chances are you\u2019re the only one."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde01f\"", "article_summary": "Americans\u2019 use of and belief in complementary and alternative medicine have grown, as have career opportunities in that field.\nThey also find positions in regulatory, legal, and administrative affairs of integrative, complementary and alternative health care.\nWith your BA or BS, you can qualify for jobs such as holistic health practitioners, herbalists, naturopathic health practitioners, nutrition counselors, research assistants, program coordinators and writers.\nThe National Institutes of Health defines complementary and alternative medicine as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, modalities and products that are not currently considered to be part of conventional Western medicine.\nIf you are in a group of four American adults, and you have never used at least one form of complementary or alternative medicine, chances are you\u2019re the only one."}
