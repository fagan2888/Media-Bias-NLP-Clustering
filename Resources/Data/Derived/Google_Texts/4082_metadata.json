Rick Perry is calling for an end to the Export-Import Bank\u2014a reversal from the position he held as governor.\n\nIn an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal published Monday, Perry, a likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate, wrote that he has changed his mind.\n\nPerry wrote that during his time as governor, Texas \u201cbecame the nation\u2019s leading exporter,\u201d and that the Ex-Im Bank \u201cplayed a role in making this happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Perry, over 1,200 companies in Texas have financed $24 billion in exports through Ex-Im. He acknowledged that in June of last year, he wrote a letter to Congress \u201curging the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\u201d\n\nBut now, in light of \u201crecent revelations of corruption and bribery at the institution,\u201d Perry said he can no longer support it.\n\n\u201cNext month, the bank comes up for reauthorization again\u2014but this time I can\u2019t get on board,\u201d wrote Perry.\n\n\u201cThose at Ex-Im who have abused the public trust must be pursued to the full extent of the law,\u201d wrote Perry. \u201cBut it may be that the best way to mend Ex-Im is to end it.\u201d\n\nThe Export-Import Bank is a little-known government agency that provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s backers argue the bank helps small businesses compete in the global market.\n\nThe bank\u2019s charter expires June 30, and as Congress inches closer to its deadline on whether Ex-Im should be reauthorized, the debate over its future is heating up.\n\nA number of other presumed and declared Republican presidential candidates\u2014including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2014have also called for the bank to be shuttered. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham appears to be its lone supporter in the present GOP field.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Texas Gov.
