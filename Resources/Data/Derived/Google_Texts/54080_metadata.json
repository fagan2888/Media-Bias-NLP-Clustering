Whether these unprecedented, tightly managed public visits make the royal family seem closer to the people, or on another plane altogether, will be interesting to see.\n\n\u201cWe will open places that have never been opened until now\u201d to commemorate the emperor\u2019s birthday, a Imperial Household Agency spokesman told JRT.\n\nThe tours will take place on the weekend of May 24 and 25, and on a Saturday and Sunday in early October yet to be scheduled. A total of 600 visitors will get the opportunity to visit the palace over the two weekends. There will be three tours on each of the four days, with 50 participants on each. The agency will provide the full details in mid-February, then accept applications from prospective participants by postcard.\n\nThe Imperial Palace is situated in the center of Tokyo on the former site of Edo Castle of the Tokugawa shogun \u2014 the samurai warlords who ruled Japan between 1603 and 1867. The eastern part of the site is open to the public as a park except on Mondays and Fridays. A huge wall that would have supported the main castle complex \u2014 which was destroyed by fire in the 17th century \u2014 still remains, along with other structures.\n\nBut the main palace building and other sections aren\u2019t open to the public. The building can only be viewed by the public from the garden outside on Jan. 2 each year, and on the emperor\u2019s birthday, when the royal family appears on the terrace of Chowa-den building, used for public appearances.\n\nBuilt in 1968, the Imperial Palace occupies an area of 22,949 square meters. In addition to the Chowa-den, the special tours will allow the public to see places such as the Matsuno-ma chamber of the Sei-den building, where the most important ceremonies are held, including the emperor\u2019s coronation and prime minister\u2019s investiture, as well as the Homei-den building, used for state banquets.\n\nFor those who can\u2019t participate in these visits, or who may simply want to see more of the imperial family\u2019s inner world, the agency also opens the palace in the ancient capital of Kyoto in western Japan for several days a year in spring and autumn. The imperial family lived in the complex for about 1,000 years before moving to Tokyo in 1869.\n\nAnd since last year, the agency has provided special public viewings of the ongoing repairs to the roof of the Shosoin treasure warehouse in the ancient western city of Nara. This Unesco world heritage site holds a large collection of art and craft works, including those associated with the royal family in the 8th century.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "To mark the 80th birthday of Emperor Akihito, the Imperial Household Agency will for the first time offer special visits to sections of the Imperial Palace that are normally off limits to the public.", "title": "Imperial Palace to Open to Special Tours to Mark Emperor\u2019s Birthday", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/12/18/imperial-palace-to-open-to-special-tours-to-mark-emperors-birthday/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AV152_palace_G_20131218044253.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Imperial Palace to Open to Special Tours to Mark Emperor\u2019s Birthday", "description": "To mark the 80th birthday of Emperor Akihito, the Imperial Household Agency will for the first time offer special visits to sections of the Imperial Palace that are normally off limits to the public.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Hiroyuki Kachi", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "To mark the 80th birthday of Emperor Akihito, the Imperial Household Agency will for the first time offer special visits to sections of the Imperial Palace that are normally off limits to the public.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-18T10:00:02-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/12/18/imperial-palace-to-open-to-special-tours-to-mark-emperors-birthday/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-15681", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "To mark the 80th birthday of Emperor Akihito, the Imperial Household Agency will for the first time offer special visits to sections of the Imperial Palace that are normally off limits to the public.", "title": "Imperial Palace to Open to Special Tours to Mark Emperor\u2019s Birthday", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/12/18/imperial-palace-to-open-to-special-tours-to-mark-emperors-birthday/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AV152_palace_G_20131218044253.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-15681", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-18T10:00:34-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb83\"", "article_summary": "Getty Images A general view of the moats and walls around the imperial palace on Aug. 31 in Tokyo.\nTo mark the 80th birthday of Emperor Akihito on Dec. 23, the Imperial Household Agency will for the first time offer special visits to sections of the Imperial Palace that are normally off limits to the public.\nBuilt in 1968, the Imperial Palace occupies an area of 22,949 square meters.\nThe imperial family lived in the complex for about 1,000 years before moving to Tokyo in 1869.\n\u201cWe will open places that have never been opened until now\u201d to commemorate the emperor\u2019s birthday, a Imperial Household Agency spokesman told JRT."}
