The Nuggets forward says he\u2019s always understood just what his role on the basketball team was.\n\nBut many of his teammates didn\u2019t.\n\nThat lack of clarity was one of the biggest sore spots on the Nuggets team that had gone unchecked, then festered, and ultimately had to be addressed. Individual player meetings held Thursday made that crystal clear to the head coach, Brian Shaw, who at that point, was spot-on with the belief that additional communication was more necessary than running any drill.\n\nEvan Fournier and Nate Robinson were among the players that needed the most clarification. Each stewed in his own way about inconsistent playing time. Both needed reassurance that they were important parts of the team. And they got that.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t lie, it feels good to be on the court,\u201d said Fournier after the Nuggets win over Memphis. \u201cEspecially in a win. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m a part of it.\u201d\n\nFournier\u2019s 21 minutes played was his second-highest total of the season. He responded with a season-high tying 12 points.\n\nFournier said he was \u201cunclear\u201d about his role before mid-week.\n\n\u201cI was on the bench,\u201d Fournier said. \u201cA lot of negative thoughts. I think it wasn\u2019t good for me, for the coaching staff or for the team. So, just feels good to talk to the coaches and know what they are expecting so I can get better and just be happy. That means a lot.\u201d\n\nRobinson\u2019s 23 minutes were the most he\u2019s played in a game in three weeks. He said meeting with Shaw and the coaching staff \u201cwas just much-needed that everybody get whatever it is they need to get off their chest.\u201d\n\nAnd with that no longer a burden on his mind, Robinson responded with 15 points, his highest point total in a game in nearly a month.\n\n\u201cIt was a liberating feeling for them,\u201d said Shaw of Fournier and Robinson. \u201cWe played nine guys. I talked about cutting the rotation down and playing eight or nine guys, and that means some other guys minutes are going to go up.\u201d\n\nShaw was pleased at what he saw from a minute-distribution standpoint when he looked at the box score after the Nuggets win over Memphis.\n\n\u201cI look at the distribution of minutes between those nine guys and I think everyone would feel pretty good about the amount of time they got to play,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re getting yanked out. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m trying to make sure that everybody is happy and everybody gets a little bit of time instead of guys being able to get into more of a rhythm \u2014 five or six-minute runs at a time as opposed to three, four and then you\u2019re coming out.\u201d\n\nDarrell Arthur praised the impact of the meetings and the clarity in role responsibility that came out of them, saying now players \u201cmindset is great.\u201d\n\nShaw\u2019s search for productive players and effective lineups played a huge part in some of the constant shuffling early on. But he\u2019s settling in on players he likes.\n\n\u201cWell, if I\u2019m getting that production out of them, even when they are tired or playing a little bit more, it outweighs having a guy come in for three or four minutes, not being able to really get into a rhythm,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI think that was a big part of why some of our guys were struggling because they aren\u2019t getting that consistent run.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Now knowing roles, clear minds bring calm Nuggets hearts", "title": "Now knowing roles, clear minds bring calm Nuggets hearts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/04/now-knowing-roles-clear-minds-bring-calm-nuggets-hearts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104_040817_nuggets.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104_040817_nuggets.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T15:58:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:35:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6c3\"", "article_summary": "That lack of clarity was one of the biggest sore spots on the Nuggets team that had gone unchecked, then festered, and ultimately had to be addressed.\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m a part of it.\u201dFournier\u2019s 21 minutes played was his second-highest total of the season.\n\u201cI can\u2019t lie, it feels good to be on the court,\u201d said Fournier after the Nuggets win over Memphis.\nThe Nuggets forward says he\u2019s always understood just what his role on the basketball team was.\nJust to be clear, Kenneth Faried wants you to know he doesn\u2019t belong lumped in this category."}
