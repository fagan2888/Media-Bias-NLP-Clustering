( Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nAt some point between now and the end of June, the Supreme Court will decide King v. Burwell and, in the process, determine whether the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d actually means \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d This phrase, which appears twice in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) provisions authorizing tax credits for the purchase of health insurance in exchanges, has bedeviled defenders of the IRS rule purporting to authorize credits in federally established exchanges. Some claim this phrase is \u201cconvenient shorthand\u201d for \u201cexchange\u201d (even though it\u2019s neither more convenient nor shorter), while others argue the phrase is effectively meaningless, or actually means something else (such as established in the State). The plaintiffs, on the other hand, maintain that the language means precisely what it says.\n\nIf Congress did not mean to refer to state-established exchanges, why did it use the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d? According to story by Robert Pear in the New York Times \u201cthe words were a product of shifting politics and a sloppy merging of different versions. Some described the words as \u2018inadvertent,\u2019 \u2018inartful\u2019 or \u2018a drafting error.'\u201d In other words, by this account it was a mistake \u2014 and a mistake no one noticed until well after the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nThis may be how congressional staffers and legislators characterize the drafting process now, but that\u2019s not what the federal government and its supporting amici told the Supreme Court. The solicitor general, for instance, proclaimed in its brief that the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d was a \u201cstatutory term of art.\u201d At oral argument, the SG also denied that there were any last-minute revisions (as I discussed here). Throughout, the federal government has insisted that the statute actually authorizes the contested IRS rule.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t the SG embraced the \u201cdrafting error\u201d argument? Because that would be a sure way to lose. As I explained years ago, when first discussing this issue on the VC, the courts are not in the business of fixing purported \u201cdrafting errors,\u201d and the burden on those making such arguments is quite high. Justice Elena Kagan made the same point in her opinion last year in Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, in which she explained that the \u201cCourt has no roving license, in even ordinary cases of statutory interpretation, to disregard clear language simply on the view that . . . Congress \u2018must have intended\u2019 something broader.\u201d It\u2019s also hard to maintain that the inclusion of a phrase is a \u201cdrafting error\u201d when it was added in multiple places and multiple separate times during the drafting process, as \u201cestablished by the State\u201d was in Section 1401.\n\nLater on in the Times story, in discussing how the PPACA emerged from the Senate Finance and HELP Committee bills, Pear writes:\n\nthere were substantial differences between the two committees\u2019 versions of the bill, and the task of merging them in October and November 2009 fell largely to Mr. Reid. Both bills called for insurance exchanges and provided subsidies to lower-income people, but the health committee measure clearly allowed subsidies in all states. The Finance Committee version was not so explicit.\n\nAs Pear recounts, there was language in the HELP bill clearly authorizing subsidies in federal exchanges, but no such language in the Finance Committee bill. What Pear fails to mention is that the HELP bill also expressly withheld subsidies in states that failed to adopt specified reforms. The staff members Pear interviewed may insist there was never any discussion of withholding subsidies, it is beyond dispute that this is precisely what the HELP bill did.\n\nNot only did the HELP bill hold off subsidies for up to four years in states that refused to create their own exchanges, it also barred subsidies in states that failed to enact other desired reforms, as Michael Cannon and I explained in our amicus brief (see p. 26). Professor Tim Jost, who contests our interpretation of the PPACA on other points, described the HELP provisions in the same way in 2009 (see p. 7). Further, this point was conceded in the pro-government legislators\u2019 amicus brief filed in the D.C. Circuit in Halbig and (less explicitly) in FN18 of the government\u2019s King brief. So anyone who claims that the Senate never considered withholding subsidies in recalcitrant states is either a) dishonest, or b) doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nPear continues:\n\nIn stitching together the final legislation, Mr. Reid took the language on tax credits from the Finance Committee, and he generally followed the health committee in allowing the secretary of health and human services to operate a federal exchange. But in borrowing from the health committee bill, Mr. Reid did not adopt an important provision that could perhaps have avoided the current fight. That provision said that a state with a federal exchange \u201cshall be deemed to be a participating state,\u201d and that its residents could receive federal subsidies to help pay premiums.\n\nIn other words, according to Pear\u2019s account, the Senate drafters failed to include language expressly authorizing subsidies in federal exchanges, even though that language was in one of the precursor bills. This sort of equivalence language exists in other parts of the PPACA, however. Section 1322(c)(6), for instance, conditions recognition of an organization as a \u201cqualified nonprofit health insurance issuer,\u201d in part, on whether a state has adopted insurance market reforms or \u201cthe Secretary has implemented [the reforms] for the State.\u201d So the bill\u2019s drafters knew such language was necessary where equivalence was desired and knew full well how to authorize the federal government to fill the state\u2019s shoes where that was intended. The bill\u2019s drafters just did not include such language here.\n\nPear\u2019s sources uniformly claim that it was never anyone\u2019s intent to deny subsidies in states that failed to create their own exchanges, but such claims really don\u2019t have much legal relevance. Post-hoc accounts of are not reliable indicia of legislative intent particularly where, as here, they are not supported by objective contemporaneous evidence. Yet to this day, no such evidence has emerged \u2014 no memos from committee staff discussing the drafting revisions, no e-mails or contemporary analyses of the actual bill\u2019s language, no documents indicating how House staffers interpreted the Senate bill they were forced to accept, nothing. And insofar as the bill was not everything its supporters wanted, and there was no way to fix it, they made the choice to pass it anyway.\n\nThe most reliable indicator of legislative intent is the text of the statute Congress enacted and the president signed into law. That statute only authorizes tax credits for insurance plans purchased in an \u201cExchange established by the State.\u201d As the Pear article makes clear, the relevant statutory text is on the side of the plaintiffs. Were it not, there would no need to claim anything was an \u201cerror\u201d or proclaim a contrary intent.\n\nPear concludes:\n\nA powerful line of judicial thinking holds that courts do not have a license to disregard or revise the clear language of a law. What matters, Justice Antonin Scalia has said, is \u201cnot what Congress would have wanted, but what Congress enacted.\u201d\n\nAnd that is precisely why the Court should side with the plaintiffs.\n\n* * *\n\nMy co-author Michael Cannon has additional thoughts, and identifies some problems with some of the claims made by Pear\u2019s sources. He concludes:\n\nWhile the Times\u2019 sources may have intended to undercut the King challengers\u2019 case, they, like others before them, inadvertently bolstered it. They acknowledged, perhaps inadvertently, that they did not pay as much attention to the bill as maybe they should have, that they had no choice but to enact a bill they knew was flawed, that the statute\u2019s meaning is plain, and that the government\u2019s \u201cterm of art\u201d argument is unbelievable. They demonstrated why courts should rely on the plain meaning of statutes and ignore post hoc statements by members of Congress about what they really intended.\n\nCharles Cooke reaches a similar conclusion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The NYT reports that including the phrase in key portions of the PPACA was a \"drafting error.\" So why does the federal government claim it's a \"term of art\"?", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The NYT reports that including the phrase in key portions of the PPACA was a \"drafting error.\" So why does the federal government claim it's a \"term of art\"?", "title": "On the origins of \u2018established by the State\u2019 in the Affordable Care Act", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/26/on-the-origins-of-established-by-the-state-in-the-affordable-care-act/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/plum-line/Images/Health_Overhaul_Two_Americas-047e0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/26/on-the-origins-of-established-by-the-state-in-the-affordable-care-act/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "If Congress did not mean to refer to state-established exchanges, why did it use the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d?\nThat provision said that a state with a federal exchange \u201cshall be deemed to be a participating state,\u201d and that its residents could receive federal subsidies to help pay premiums.\nBut in borrowing from the health committee bill, Mr. Reid did not adopt an important provision that could perhaps have avoided the current fight.\nPedro Rojas holds a sign directing people to an insurance company where they could sign up for the Affordable Care Act in Miami in February.\nAs Pear recounts, there was language in the HELP bill clearly authorizing subsidies in federal exchanges, but no such language in the Finance Committee bill."}
