Frustration with the high court is likely to motivate many conservatives to support presidential candidates who make the most credible and forceful pledges to place strong conservatives on the bench. And this is likely to push the GOP presidential field to the right as the candidates try to establish their conservative bona fides and set themselves apart.\n\nThe subtext is that the next president will probably have several Supreme Court appointments to make. Three of the nine current justices are in their 80s, one is in his late 70s, and some have had health problems. The next president's judicial choices could shape the court and its decisions for many years to come.\n\n[READ: The Republican Path After Crushing Losses]\n\nThe latest batch of Supreme Court decisions is \"going to send this issue through the roof,\" especially among conservatives, says political scientist Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution, a former White House adviser to President Bill Clinton. The question for those on the right, Galston says, is, \"What do they have to do to ensure that someone who is conservative when they are first on the court stays that way.\" This dynamic has led GOP presidential candidates to move more aggressively than ever to criticize the court and pledge to ensure a conservative majority in the future.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, is proposing a constitutional amendment that would subject Supreme Court justices to periodic judicial retention elections. Shortly after last week's high court decisions affirming a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and upholding the validity of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, Cruz told a GOP rally, \"This week's assault was but the latest in a long line of judicial assaults on our Constitution and Judeo-Christian values that have made America great.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican presidential candidate, expressed disappointment in the high court's decision declaring that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. \"We live in a republic and must abide by the law,\" Rubio told reporters, but he added: \"As we look ahead, it must be a priority of the next president to nominate judges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and originally understood.\"\n\nDemocrats are expected to pick up on the court theme, too. They will argue that one big reason for electing another Democrat to the White House is to ensure that liberals are named to the high court. This could motivate core Democratic constituencies to vote, such as gay people who want to keep the momentum going after the court's affirmation of same-sex marriage, Latinos who want the court to be more lenient with illegal immigrants, and women who want to preserve abortion rights.\n\nUnderscoring liberals' concerns is the court's apparent willingness to revisit the abortion issue. The justices decided, on a 5-4 vote announced Monday, to keep 19 Texas abortion clinics open pending a decision by the high court to grant a full review of state regulations that critics say would severely limit abortion in Texas.\n\n[PHOTOS: The Supreme Court Saves Obamacare]\n\nBut it is conservatives who seem most animated by high-court politics, and Chief Justice John Roberts, once a darling of the right, is the target for special scorn. Roberts upset conservatives with his support for Obamacare's constitutionality as part of a 6-3 ruling in which Roberts was in the majority. \"It's a sad day for the Constitution when the clear terms of a statute can be 'interpreted' away in the service of an aggressively lawless president,\" Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network told Politico. \"The two biggest losers...are the English language and the legacy of Chief Justice Roberts.\"\n\nIt was the second time that Roberts has joined the court's liberals in a major case that saved Obamacare, and this caused conservatives to feel betrayed by the man they thought would be reliably on their side. Roberts was the deciding vote in a 2012 decision upholding the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate provision.\n\nConservatives express concern that Roberts is turning out like former Justices David Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens, Republican appointees who grew more moderate over the years on the court. Roberts' record has not been a relentless move leftward, however. In addition to his opposition to a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, he sided with conservatives on decisions regarding voting rights and campaign finance.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Report [News]", "title": "The Supreme Court Will Be an Election Issue in 2016", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The candidates will focus on the Supreme Court during the 2016 presidential election.", "title": "Courting Voters", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/07/02/the-supreme-court-will-be-an-election-issue-in-2016", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/2d/e7/b4f0255b41aba2c5e7017f0cc3db/150702-reportpres-editorial.pres.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The candidates will focus on the Supreme Court during the 2016 presidential election.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "The Supreme Court Will Be an Election Issue in 2016"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "July 2, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kenneth T.
