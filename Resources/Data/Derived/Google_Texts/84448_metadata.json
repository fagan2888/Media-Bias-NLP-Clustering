The ad cites a news story about the announced sale of MacArthur\u2019s former company, York Risk Services Group, in 2005, but that was years before the company was sued for its handling of claims stemming from Hurricane Ike and a California wildfire in 2008.\n\nPlus, the ad says that \u201cin Congress, MacArthur wants to help insurance companies jack up rates and deny people coverage.\u201d But the source for that claim is a newspaper article that mentions MacArthur wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has nothing to do with the issue of property insurance, the focus of the ad.\n\nCheating Accusations\n\nThe ad\u2019s narrator says, \u201cMacArthur ran an insurance company accused of cheating hurricane and wildfire victims,\u201d while a graphic shown on screen reads, \u201cTom MacArthur \u2018Accused Of Cheating Disaster Victims.\u2019 \u201d The narrator is right. The graphic is wrong.\n\nTom MacArthur was the chairman and CEO of York Risk Services Group Inc. from 1999 to 2010. The ad describes MacArthur as an \u201cinsurance CEO,\u201d but York is really a claims and risk management company that provides services, such as claims processing, for insurers and other companies.\n\nIt\u2019s true that York, as a claims processing agent, was the subject of two lawsuits and a state complaint stemming from the company\u2019s handling of insurance claims for victims of both Hurricane Ike and the Sayre Fire in Sylmar, California, in 2008.\n\nHouston Baptist University filed a lawsuit against York and ACE American Insurance Company in 2010 seeking payment to repair damages caused by the hurricane to a campus administrative complex. The university\u2019s president, Robert B. Sloan Jr., accused the insurance company of not paying \u201cwhat they owe us under our coverage,\u201d according to The Collegian, the university\u2019s student publication. \u201cThey drug their feet\u201d and \u201cweren\u2019t very responsive,\u201d the paper quoted Sloan as saying.\n\nLikewise, the Port of Galveston, Texas, sued York and the Lexington Insurance Company for $15 million in unpaid insurance claims for damages related to the same hurricane.\n\nAnd the California Department of Insurance filed an enforcement action against York and the New Hampshire Insurance Company in 2012, regarding their handling of insurance claims tied to the 2008 wildfire in Sylmar, California. CDI, in response to complaints from policyholders whose homes were lost in the fire, said that it investigated York and the insurance company \u201cfor 125 violations of the California Insurance Code, with each violation representing an alleged unfair or deceptive act.\u201d\n\nAll three cases involving York were later settled after MacArthur had left the company.\n\nWhile the ad\u2019s narrator can fairly say that \u201cMacArthur ran an insurance company accused of cheating hurricane and wildfire victims,\u201d it\u2019s wrong to say, as the accompanying screen graphic does, that MacArthur himself was personally accused of cheating victims.\n\nThe fact that he wasn\u2019t accused was a point made clear in the very Daily Mail article cited in the TV ad. \u201cMacArthur, the New Jersey congressional candidate, is not named personally in any of the legal actions described in this report, but he was both a York officer and a major shareholder,\u201d the report said.\n\nAnyone watching the ad without audio, or even someone listening to the ad but not paying close attention to what is being said, could be misled by the ad\u2019s visual. It\u2019s a pattern of deception our sister website, FlackCheck.org, calls \u201cSeeing What\u2019s Not Heard.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Aug. 21: After we published this item, the DCCC changed the image in the ad to read \u201cTom MacArthur\u2019s Company \u2018Accused of Cheating.\u2019\u201d The revised ad began airing on Aug. 19, the DCCC said in a statement emailed to us. \u201cWe added the word \u2018company\u2019 to the screen to match the narrator\u2019s existing audio,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOther Claims\n\nThe ad also claims that \u201cwhile people suffered, MacArthur walked away with $39 million.\u201d But that, too, leaves a false impression.\n\nThe ad isn\u2019t referring to a payout MacArthur received after leaving the company in 2010. Instead, the ad cites a December 2005 story from The Deal, an online publication, about an agreement Odyssey Investment Partners LLC made to purchase York for around $105 million.\n\nAs part of the deal, MacArthur agreed to sell his half of the company to Odyssey for $39 million plus an additional dividend payment. The acquisition was finalized in May 2006, with MacArthur staying on as chairman and CEO of the company. So MacArthur received his money long before the natural disasters, and subsequent lawsuits, ever occurred.\n\nIn addition, the ad claims that \u201cMacArthur wants to help insurance companies jack up rates and deny people coverage\u201d if elected to Congress. Viewers might assume the ad is referring to him helping property or casualty insurance companies. It\u2019s not.\n\nThe ad is actually referring to MacArthur\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act. The Courier-Post article cited in the ad says that MacArthur and Steve Lonegan, whom MacArthur defeated in the GOP primary, \u201cboth want repeal of Obamacare.\u201d But the federal health care law has nothing to do with the disaster relief insurance claims that are the subject of the ad.\n\nThe ad, one of the DCCC\u2019s first two independent expenditure ads of the midterms, began airing on cable in New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District on Aug. 12. MacArthur is running against Democrat Aimee Belgard.\n\n\u2014 D\u2019Angelo Gore", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0166\"", "article_summary": "Cheating AccusationsThe ad\u2019s narrator says, \u201cMacArthur ran an insurance company accused of cheating hurricane and wildfire victims,\u201d while a graphic shown on screen reads, \u201cTom MacArthur \u2018Accused Of Cheating Disaster Victims.\u2019 \u201d The narrator is right.\nIn addition, the ad claims that \u201cMacArthur wants to help insurance companies jack up rates and deny people coverage\u201d if elected to Congress.\nLikewise, the Port of Galveston, Texas, sued York and the Lexington Insurance Company for $15 million in unpaid insurance claims for damages related to the same hurricane.\nIt\u2019s a pattern of deception our sister website, FlackCheck.org, calls \u201cSeeing What\u2019s Not Heard.\u201dUpdate, Aug. 21: After we published this item, the DCCC changed the image in the ad to read \u201cTom MacArthur\u2019s Company \u2018Accused of Cheating.\u2019\u201d The revised ad began airing on Aug. 19, the DCCC said in a statement emailed to us.\nThe university\u2019s president, Robert B.
