Public attitudes against exceptions have hardened, and efforts by faith groups in states where courts, not lawmakers, recognized same-sex unions have had little success.\n\n\u201cWhen the judiciary does it, they don\u2019t do the kind of balancing that legislatures tend to do,\u201d said Tim Schultz, president of the 1st Amendment Partnership, which has organized legislative caucuses focused on religious liberty in 20 states.\n\nEvery state legislative debate over gay marriage has addressed the question of whether religious objectors could be exempt in any way from recognizing same-sex unions. But in states where same-sex marriage became law through the courts, only one, Connecticut, followed up by enacting significant new exemptions. Massachusetts, Iowa, and New Jersey have provided no opt-outs for gay marriage opponents.\n\nUntil recently, gay rights groups accepted some exceptions to pick up badly needed votes from conservative lawmakers. But that political pressure has dropped as acceptance of same-sex unions has grown. Gay advocates say broad carve-outs perpetuate the very discrimination they had been working to end.\n\nThat argument gained currency after the Hobby Lobby ruling last June. The high court decided the arts-and-crafts chain and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of providing employees the free contraceptive coverage required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile conservatives rejoiced, liberal groups were outraged, and many vowed to aggressively oppose exceptions for faith groups. Soon after, prominent gay rights and civil rights groups withdrew their support from the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, because of the wide reach of its exemption.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a broad consensus that the rules should apply to everyone, which is why we withdrew our support from ENDA,\u201d said Jennifer Pizer, senior counsel at the national gay rights group Lambda Legal. \u201cIf you have different standards, then it communicates a message that some kinds of discrimination are not as serious as others.\u201d\n\nThe religious exemption fight isn\u2019t about what happens inside the sanctuary. First Amendment protections for worship and clergy are clear. The concern instead is for religious organizations with some business in the public arena. That category includes faith-affiliated associations that rent their properties to the public for wedding receptions; religious charities that provide adoption and other social services, often with government funding, and individual religious objectors such as justices of the peace, government clerks, or business owners.\n\nThe exemptions approved so far have generally been much narrower than faith leaders sought, although opponents did win some meaningful concessions. About a half-dozen states allowed religious associations, such as the Knights of Columbus, or some faith-based nonprofits to deny specific benefits for gay couples \u2014 such as insurance for spouses \u2014 or refuse to serve them. A few states allowed privately funded adoption agencies to refuse to place children with gay couples. Religiously affiliated marriage support programs, such as Christian couples\u2019 retreats, were exempted in several states. But many of the states only reiterated First Amendment protections for worship.\n\nStill, the high court decision last week to turn away appeals by states trying to protect their same-sex marriage bans moves the debate over exemptions into territory that is more conservative, politically and religiously. Utah, Nevada, and Idaho are heavily Mormon. South Carolina, where the attorney general is fighting to uphold the state\u2019s gay marriage ban despite the court ruling, is largely evangelical Protestant.\n\n\u201cSome of the states are so red \u2014 think South Carolina \u2014 that the legislature can likely lock down all kinds of religious liberty protections, even those we have not yet seen adopted anywhere, like protection for the small mom-and-pop wedding professionals, simply because they have the votes of like-minded colleagues,\u201d said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a family law specialist at the University of Illinois, Champaign, who tracks exemptions in state laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState Rep. Jacob Anderegg, a Utah Republican, said he plans to reintroduce a religious exemptions bill he had temporarily shelved amid the federal court cases on gay marriage in the past two years. His bill would allow anyone authorized by the state to solemnize marriages \u2014 including clergy and justices of the peace \u2014 to refuse on religious grounds to preside at same-sex marriages.\n\n\u201cThe bill reasserts and re-establishes fundamental principles: I have a religious objection. You can\u2019t force me or compel me to do it,\u201d Anderegg said. He expects a few other exemptions to be proposed in the next legislative session.\n\nEric Hawkins, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, would not comment on any plans by the church to seek exceptions.\n\nCathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative advocacy group, said her organization was still analyzing the impact of the court decision and hadn\u2019t yet decided on strategy. But, she said, \u201cthe priority is to assure religious liberty is protected.\u201d She said the public can be moved to support religious exemptions through the cases of wedding cake bakers or photographers who have faced discrimination complaints for refusing to serve same-sex couples.\n\n\u201cOur challenge is to get those stories out,\u201d Herrod said.\n\nBut a controversy in Arizona last February over exemptions showed the limits on the public acceptance of broad opt-outs, even in conservative-leaning states. When state lawmakers expanded protections in the state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the national backlash from business leaders, gay rights groups, and others was so intense that Republican Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed the measure.\n\nAdvocates for the bill said critics massively overreacted. Proponents argued the bill would have given objectors only the chance to bring a religious liberty claim before a court. But critics argued the legislation would have effectively allowed businesses to refuse service to gays and lesbians without penalty, especially given that Arizona has no statewide nondiscrimination policy that covers sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cThere will be a temptation to enact broad exemptions in states that otherwise would oppose same-sex marriage,\u201d said John Green, a religion and politics expert at the University of Akron\u2019s Bliss Institute for Applied Politics. \u201cHowever, overly broad exemptions can backfire as well: They can be perceived as intolerant and discriminatory.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2014/10/15/next-gay-marriage-fight-religious-exemptions/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SweetCakesC.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "They're losing in the courts, so conservatives are turning to state legislatures for help.
