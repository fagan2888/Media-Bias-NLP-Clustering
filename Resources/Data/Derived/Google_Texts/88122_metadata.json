REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR3PII8\n\n4192660\n\nThe nation shouldn\u2019t be debating the nation\u2019s health-care system or the jihadi attack in Benghazi in 2012, President Barack Obama complained at a May 19 fundraiser in Maryland.\n\n\u201cYes, we can have a legitimate debate about does every government program work \u2026 [but] the debate we\u2019re having right now is about, what, Benghazi? Obamacare?\u201d Obama told his donors in the wealthy Potomac district of Maryland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not serious [and] is not speaking to the real concerns that people have,\u201d Obama insisted.\n\nObama\u2019s effort to change the subject came a few hours after a survey by a friendly political media site showed that only 39 percent of respondents agreed that \u201cthe debate on Obamacare should be over,\u201d as Obama insists.\n\nSixty percent of Americans in the survey said the debate should not be over.\n\nThe survey, by Politico, reported that Obama\u2019s job rating is only 40 percent in the states that will have critical Senate races this year.\n\nThe poll also showed that voters generally oppose the Obamacare network. Eighty-nine percent of respondents said Obamacare is important to their vote, but only 16 percent support the law \u201cas it is,\u201d said the poll. Forty-six percent want to repeal the law, and 35 percent want to modify the law.\n\nThe poll did not survey Americans about the still mysterious background to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic site in Benghazi. The September 2012 attack killed four Americans, and drove the U.S. out of the city, giving local jihadi groups a base where they could prepare other attacks in Algeria, Nigeria, Mali and other African countries.\n\nObama\u2019s policy decisions in the years and the months prior to the Benghazi assault are hidden largely because his deputies have tried to blame White House policy errors on underlings.\n\nObama\u2019s complaints about the public\u2019s debate over Obamacare and Benghazi came after he insisted to donors that his policies \u2014 such as doubled immigration of low-skill workers \u2014 would help the nation\u2019s economy recover after the 2007 collapse of the government-created property bubble.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not that we lack solutions. \u2026 The problem we have is\u2026 one party in Congress right now that has been captured by ideologues,\u201d Obama complained. Republicans \u201cfundamentally believe that the problem is government [and] don\u2019t believe that we as a community, as a country have any serious role to play in giving people a hand up,\u201d he told the donors.\n\nTheir \u201cprincipal focus at any given point in the day is trying to figure out how can they make people sufficiently cynical, sufficiently angry, sufficiently suspicious that they can win the next election\u201d by driving down turnout, he insisted.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "He wants you to talk about issues that help him", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The nation shouldn\u2019t be debating the nation\u2019s health-care system or the jihadi attack in Benghazi in 2012, President Barack Obama complained at a May 19 fundraiser in Maryland.    \"Yes, we can hav", "title": "Obama To Voters: Shut Up About Obamacare And Benghazi", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/20/obama-to-voters-shut-up-about-obamacare-and-benghazi/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/obama3.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He wants you to talk about issues that help him", "title": "Obama To Voters: Shut Up About Obamacare And Benghazi Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/20/obama-to-voters-shut-up-about-obamacare-and-benghazi/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/obama3.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-20 09:34:08", "sailthru.title": "Obama To Voters: Shut Up About Obamacare And Benghazi", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "barack obama,benghazi", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,benghazi,neil-munro", "sailthru.description": "The nation shouldn\u2019t be debating the nation\u2019s health-care system or the jihadi attack in Benghazi in 2012, President Barack Obama complained at a May 19 fundraiser in Maryland.    \"Yes, we can hav", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/obama3.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05d6\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare?\u201d Obama told his donors in the wealthy Potomac district of Maryland.\nThe poll did not survey Americans about the still mysterious background to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic site in Benghazi.\n\u201cYes, we can have a legitimate debate about does every government program work \u2026 [but] the debate we\u2019re having right now is about, what, Benghazi?\nREUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR3PII84192660The nation shouldn\u2019t be debating the nation\u2019s health-care system or the jihadi attack in Benghazi in 2012, President Barack Obama complained at a May 19 fundraiser in Maryland.\nU.S. President Barack Obama (2nd L) talks while having lunch with Vice President Joe Biden (2nd R) construction workers at Shake Shack in Washington May 16, 2014."}
