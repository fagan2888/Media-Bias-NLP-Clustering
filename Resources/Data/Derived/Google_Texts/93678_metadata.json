He hustled his way to Denver from El Paso on Saturday afternoon, speeding his way toward a return to the major-league mound.\n\nColorado called up the left-handed reliever to make his season debut against the Atlanta Braves at Coors Field. To make room on their 25-man roster, the Rockies designated pitcher Aaron Laffey for assignment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s en route,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said in the dugout about 2\u00bd hours before the game. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really good to see Rex.\u201d\n\nBrothers didn\u2019t arrive until after 1 p.m., Weiss said, about an hour before first pitch.\n\nIn his season debut, Brothers threw 15 pitches in the seventh inning \u2014 but 11 were balls. He got one out and walked two.\n\n\u201cI was hoping for an easier outing for him. But Rex was ready,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThe ball was coming out of his hand real well. Some fastballs got away a little bit. But I thought he looked good.\n\n\u201cI was hoping for an easier outing for him. But Rex was ready.\u201d\n\nThe move left the Rockies with an unused spot on their 40-man roster. That leaves the door open for top pitching prospect Jon Gray to, potentially, make his major-league debut sometime after the all-star break.\n\nFor now, Brothers is the focus. He had a 4.71 ERA over 28 innings, and 40 strikeouts against 26 walks, with Triple-A Albuquerque. He broke spring training in the minors after his struggles last season carried over to 2015.\n\nBrothers unraveled last season with the Rockies. He was their presumptive future closer. But he slid from eighth inning setup man to sixth inning lefty spot specialist. He finished with 5.59 ERA over 56 innings, with a too low 1.41 K-to-walk ratio (it was 2.11 in 2013).\n\nIn his first 15 games with Albuquerque this season, he struck out 20 batters but walked 15, with a 7.43 ERA. In his past 17 games for the Isotopes, he had a 2.35 ERA with 20 strikeouts and 11 walks.\n\n\u201cThe stuff is still intact,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s commanding it, he\u2019s an elite major-league pitcher.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet if Brothers\u2019 promotion is permanent. The Rockies have used 14 pitchers the past two games against Atlanta \u2014 so they were desperate for bullpen help.\n\n\u201cNone of us know if we\u2019re here to stay,\u201d Weiss said, half jokingly. \u201cWe\u2019re all day to day.\u201d\n\nLaffey\u2019s removal came a day after his call-up. He debuted with the Rockies for 2 innings, allowing three runs. But he got a victory in piggyback relief of Gonzalez Germen.\n\nLaffey will go to baseball\u2019s waiver wire for 10 days and could return to the Rockies.\n\nHe lost his roster spot for a possible call-up of Gray, who may be the Rockies\u2019 starting pitcher Friday in San Diego.\n\nBraves\u2019 Alex Wood (6-5, 3.34 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (4-4, 4.95), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nBettis was blasted for a career-high 10 runs in his previous start, against the Angels. He had allowed four home runs all year \u2014 but he gave up four in 2 innings Tuesday, including two to Mike Trout. Afterward, Bettis said: \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s time to hit the delete button here and move forward.\u201d He will try to rebound against the Braves\u2019 Wood, who threw two pitches against the Rockies on Thursday before a long weather delay sat him down. The Rockies are 7-4 in the games started by Bettis this year.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brothers called up; spot left open for Gray", "title": "Brothers called up; spot left open for Gray", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/11/brothers-called-up-spot-left-open-for-gray/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_123304_rex-brothers.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_123304_rex-brothers.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-11T13:00:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T05:39:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d3c\"", "article_summary": "He lost his roster spot for a possible call-up of Gray, who may be the Rockies\u2019 starting pitcher Friday in San Diego.\nIn his season debut, Brothers threw 15 pitches in the seventh inning \u2014 but 11 were balls.\nBut Rex was ready.\u201dThe move left the Rockies with an unused spot on their 40-man roster.\nTo make room on their 25-man roster, the Rockies designated pitcher Aaron Laffey for assignment.\nThat leaves the door open for top pitching prospect Jon Gray to, potentially, make his major-league debut sometime after the all-star break."}
