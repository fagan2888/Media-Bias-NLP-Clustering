Forecasters had predicted the storm would have maximum sustained winds at landfall of about 125 mph (200 kph) \u2014 the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nAuthorities deployed more than 35,000 military personnel to relocate residents in vulnerable areas as the typhoon made its way across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOver a meter (39 inches) of rain has fallen already in parts of Taiwan, with as much as 1.5 to 2 meters possible by the time the storm passes in the country\u2019s southwest, CNN Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said.\n\nFlights canceled\n\nTaiwanese airlines have announced flight adjustments, canceling a number of domestic and international flights for Saturday, according to Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency. Railways have likewise suspended high speed and regular train services, the agency said.\n\nThe Central Weather Bureau warned 16 cities and counties that they were likely to experience intense rain and powerful winds from Soudelor.\n\nSoudelor became the strongest storm on the planet so far this year, with peak winds at 180 mph (290 kph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\n\nStorm chaser James Reynolds told CNN from southeastern Taiwan that there had been extremely ferocious winds and blinding rain as the storm made landfall, as well as huge waves battering the coastline.\n\nThe result, he said, \u201cwas a lot of flying debris, a lot of tree damage and along the coastal areas, the waves had inundated the low-lying areas, damaging the roads in places as well as some vulnerable properties which were right by the coast.\u201d\n\nVideo footage showed rescue workers struggling to make their way through surging, thigh-high waters, as many communities suffered mudslides and flooding.\n\nAccording to state power provider Taiwan Power Co., about 1 million homes were still without electricity as of 8 p.m. local time Saturday.\n\nEmergency crews are working to restore supply, the company said, adding that this is the biggest power outage seen on the island as a result of a typhoon.\n\nStorm headed to China\n\nIn China, nearly 185,000 people have been moved to safer areas in Fujian province, which is expected to take a direct hit from the typhoon, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nTorrential rains over the next couple of days are likely to be a greater problem there than high winds, CNN\u2019s Cabrera said. Heavy downpours in the course of the rainy season have already saturated the ground in places, he said.\n\nSoudelor has already wreaked havoc in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands, passing through this week, and disrupting water and electricity services.\n\nThe West Pacific Basin has seen 10 typhoons so far this year.\n\nOf those, five have reached super-typhoon strength, meaning sustained winds of at least 150 mph (240 kph). That total is higher than the average of four for an entire year.\n\nBy Faith Karimi, Laura Smith-Spark and Steve Almasy\n\nCNN\u2019s Taylor Ward, Brandon Miller, Kevin Wang and journalist Wayne Chang contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Typhoon Soudelor pounded Taiwan with fierce winds and torrential rain Saturday, killing at least five people and injuring at least 185, according to Taiwan's National Fire Agency.
