But after spending big on an ambitious website, the state had to give up on its exchange after its first year and start over with completely new technology.

That resulted in Maryland getting an extra $15.9 million.\n\nThe state overestimated how many customers were signing up for private insurance plans through the Obamacare exchange and undercounted the number that were enrolling in Medicaid, the coverage for low-income people. The federal government pays a larger share of Obamacare enrollment than it does for Medicaid, which functions a state-federal partnership, and Maryland\u2019s inaccurate numbers led to another $12.5 million overpayment.\n\nThe auditors charged that Maryland must refund the federal government the full $28.4 million for the mistakes. But Maryland officials responded that federal guidelines didn\u2019t require them to update their enrollment estimates for private coverage or for its Medicaid expansion and say they don\u2019t plan on repaying the federal taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe audit is the latest in Maryland\u2019s financial problems. Maryland Health Connection was the first state-run Obamacare exchange to shut down its first Obamacare website, along with Massachusetts and Oregon.\n\nPotential waste of taxpayer dollars due to the marketplace\u2019s flops has been a point of contention for the state\u2019s Republicans.
