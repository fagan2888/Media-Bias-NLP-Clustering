It also detailed the percentage of enrollees selecting each plan, with or without tax credits. Data was not available for the state exchanges, which make up about one third of the total 8 million enrollees.\n\nThe report said 69 percent of individuals who qualified for subsidies are paying an average monthly premium of $100 or less. Premiums, of course, vary widely from region to region depending on the share of competition in each market.\n\nAverage premiums in New Hampshire, where only one insurer controls the region, were $390 before subsidies, well above the national average.\n\n\u201cIf more insurers come into the marketplace in future years, it seems likely not only that consumers will have a greater choice of plans, but also that the benchmark plan (second-lowest cost silver plan) will become even more affordable,\u201d the report said.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Subsidy Overpayments: How to Recoup?\n\nSo far, in every state where data is available, more insurers will be participating in the exchanges next year, which will likely stabilize the price of premiums.\n\nUnder the law, subsidies are available with incomes ranging from one to four times the federal poverty level \u2013 or $11,490 to $45,960 for an individual and $23,550 to $94,200 for a family of four. They are determined by an individual\u2019s annual income as listed on their applications\u2014otherwise known as an honor system.\n\nSo far this year the federal government has paid out $4.7 billion in subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation currently estimate that the ACA\u2019s insurance provisions will cost just under 41.1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIt could likely climb higher, since a significant number of this year\u2019s subsidies have apparently been incorrectly doled out to more than two million Americans. Earlier this week The New York Times reported that the administration is in the process of contacting hundreds of thousands of people to verify their eligibility for the tax credits they are currently using to subsidize their health coverage.\n\nThis could mean that a significant number of enrollees could lose their subsidies \u2013 or maybe even their coverage.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly two months after Obamacare\u2019s first open enrollment closed, we finally have a cl", "title": "Average Obamacare Subsidy--$3,312; Payout to Date--$4.7 Billion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/Average-Obamacare-Subsidy-3312-Paid-Date-47-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08172012_health_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/Average-Obamacare-Subsidy-3312-Paid-Date-47-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08172012_health_money_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Nearly two months after Obamacare\u2019s first open enrollment closed, we finally have a cl", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe13bd\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s an average tax credit of about $276 a month, or $3,312 a year.\nAverage premiums in New Hampshire, where only one insurer controls the region, were $390 before subsidies, well above the national average.\nRelated: A Million Americans Can Get Wrong SubsidiesHowever, for the overwhelming majority of Obamacare enrollees (87 percent) who did qualify for financial assistance, the average monthly premium on the silver plan costs about $69.\nThe report said 69 percent of individuals who qualified for subsidies are paying an average monthly premium of $100 or less.\nPremiums, of course, vary widely from region to region depending on the share of competition in each market."}
