A few senators and congressmen wave their fists, thinking (if not shouting) imprecations at the White House.\n\nJonathan Turley, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University, makes a persuasive case that Congress and the rest of us have nobody to blame but themselves.\n\nMr. Turley is no conservative. In testimony last week to the House Judiciary Committee, he said he likes and supports many of the president\u2019s policies, but he\u2019s stunned by the extralegal means with which they\u2019re implemented \u2014 and how the president gets away with it.\n\n\u201cRecently,\u201d he said, \u201cCongress has seemed feckless and uncertain as to its authority. It surprises me.\u201d\n\nAs a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama said one of the country\u2019s problems was that \u201cGeorge Bush is trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all, and that\u2019s what I intend to reverse when I\u2019m president of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nNow that he sits behind the desk constructed of timbers of the HMS Resolute, a gift to the White House from Queen Victoria, Mr. Obama has changed his tune. He refuses to enforce federal law as written. He installs appointments to high office without waiting for the consent of the Senate. He has delayed implementing the most unpopular provisions of Obamacare until after the November elections.\n\nMr. Obama is not the first president to push the boundaries of the office. Franklin D. Roosevelt bent the Supreme Court to his will with a scheme to expand the Supreme Court and appointed enough justices to OK his agenda.\n\nSince the Korean War, every president has not bothered to ask Congress for a declaration of war, as the Constitution requires. What\u2019s different now is scale. Under Mr. Obama, Congress is irrelevant.\n\n\u201cI am a typical Madisonian scholar,\u201d explained Mr. Turley. \u201cI tend to view all branches as equal, but some more equal than others, and that would be the legislative branch \u2026 it is the thumping heart of our system, and it has lost a great deal of power, and that power has largely been transferred to the executive branch.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has done everything in his power to expedite the destruction of the legislative branch by weakening the filibuster, one of the most potent tools a senator can employ. He ceded this important congressional prerogative merely to allow the president to install a few short-term appointees in the executive branch.\n\nThe weak and feckless connivers include Republicans, too. House Speaker John A. Boehner gave the president the ability to borrow indefinitely merely to avoid a conflict over the debt ceiling.\n\nCourts are part of the problem, and have largely become rubber stamps for the White House and the Justice Department. Even Chief Justice John Roberts, who was thought to be the needed bulwark of the Constitution, reimagined the Obamacare law as a \u201ctax\u201d to uphold its constitutionality.\n\nThe secret FISA court has given the go-ahead to every National Security Agency request for more power to oppress, even signing a single warrant enabling the organization to snoop on millions of Americans.\n\nMr. Turley warns that Mr. Obama has gone too far. But how far is too far? And what can anyone do about it?
