His bold power play to annex the peninsula, which is part of Ukraine, caught the entire international community off guard and sent a clear signal of Russia\u2019s willingness to claim territory in the former Soviet Union\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nRelated: Russian Ties to Ukraine Go Much Deeper Than Gas\n\nWhile the move emboldens Putin on the international stage, his standing with some Russians is in question. The general public seems to love Putin and his audacious move. But Russia\u2019s oligarchs \u2013 the muscle behind Putin\u2019s power \u2013 are likely less enthusiastic.\n\nThat\u2019s because they\u2019ve lost a fortune. The Monday after Russian troops entered Crimea, the Russian stock market fell 13 percent, erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth. The next day, Putin held a press conference in which he appeared unfazed by the financial loss.\n\nNow, with the referendum going forward, new economic sanctions are in the works. Even Germany, one of Russia\u2019s closest European allies, is pressing forward with penalties for the Crimean invasion.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a confrontation, but the actions of the Russian side make the preparations necessary,\u201d German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Tuesday. \u201cWe continue to urge Russia to use the last possibilities that are still there for a diplomatic solution against such an escalation. Otherwise, relations between Europe and Russia won\u2019t improve.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ukraine's 'Eastern Spring' Has a Chance to Blossom\n\nThese new sanctions, combined with the Russian economy\u2019s reliance on energy, could be Putin\u2019s Achilles heel. If the oligarchs aren\u2019t happy, Putin could be pressured to relent.\n\nRussia \u201chas rejected globalization and relies on one product that passes through many corrupt hands to fuel its economy,\u201d said Edward Goldberg, a professor at Baruch College and the New York University Center for Global Affairs. \u201cAny businessperson will tell you that you can\u2019t be in the marketplace with one product unless you have a monopoly. And for Russia, which possibly had a slight monopoly in energy, that monopoly is dissipating by the minute.\u201d\n\nThe Power Behind Putin\n\nRussian wealth is the most concentrated in the world: In a country of more than 140 million people, just 110 people control 35 percent of it. The majority of these men (there are very few women considered oligarchs) made their money in the energy business.\n\nRelated: Pressure on Putin As Russian Wealth Disappears\n\nThe best-known oligarch is Roman Abramovich, who made his $9 billion fortune in the Russian oil and mineral industries before moving to London and buying the football club Chelsea FC. But most of the oligarchs are unknown outside Russia and the international business community. Among them is Mikhail Fridman, whose fortune is valued at $17.6 billion dollars, which he made through TNK-BP, a Russian gas company that has since been swallowed by Rosneft. Alexei Miller, Putin's personal appointee at the state-run Gazprom, is also among the Russian elite.\n\nThe existing oligarchs are close to Putin; those who weren\u2019t were systematically jailed after he took power \u2013 or they fled Russia. Putin put the oligarchs in a position to get rich, but their money also helps Putin by undergirding his power. The oligarchs, for instance, largely financed the $50 billion Olympic Games in Sochi.\n\nNow, as the Ukraine situation shifts from a military crisis to an economic one, many of these men are in a panic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen 10 people from the Forbes list in the recent few days. They\u2019re pale; they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a prominent banker, told the The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s those who are here who will take the burden.\u201d\n\nMany of these oligarchs have been through this before. When Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, the Russian stock market reached its lowest point in two years.\n\nThe oligarchs are under pressure partly because the Russian economy is so reliant on foreign countries buying energy. The National Center for Policy Analysis says the energy business provided at least half of Russia\u2019s budget last year. Energy also represents 30 percent of Russian GDP and has accounted for 50 percent of GDP growth since 2000.\n\nGoldberg said this reliance makes Russia weak, even as it takes Crimea.\n\n\u201cRussia is a failed state in 21st-century terms,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin appears powerful, but he serves at the pleasure of Russia\u2019s richest.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Oligarchs Are Key to War and Peace in Ukraine", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/12/Putin-s-Oligarchs-Are-Key-War-and-Peace-Ukraine", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/12/Putin-s-Oligarchs-Are-Key-War-and-Peace-Ukraine", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Putin.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin appears powerful, but he serves at the pleasure of Russia\u2019s richest.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7ce\"", "article_summary": "But Russia\u2019s oligarchs \u2013 the muscle behind Putin\u2019s power \u2013 are likely less enthusiastic.\nPutin put the oligarchs in a position to get rich, but their money also helps Putin by undergirding his power.\nThe existing oligarchs are close to Putin; those who weren\u2019t were systematically jailed after he took power \u2013 or they fled Russia.\nThe oligarchs are under pressure partly because the Russian economy is so reliant on foreign countries buying energy.\nThe majority of these men (there are very few women considered oligarchs) made their money in the energy business."}
