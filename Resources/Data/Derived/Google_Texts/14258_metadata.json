He will step down at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, about a month after leaving rehab and returning to Congress.\n\n\"Unfortunately, some of my struggles had serious consequences,\" Radel wrote in the letter. \"While I have dealt with those issues on a personal level, it is my belief that professionally I cannot fully and effectively serve as a United States representative to the place I love and call home, Southwest Florida.\"\n\nElected to Congress in 2012, Radel was charged by authorities in October after attempting to purchase 3.5 grams of cocaine \u2013 a decision he traced back to his struggle with alcoholism \u2013 from an undercover federal agent in Washington, DC. In November, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession. He was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $250.\n\nFollowing a month-long stint in rehab, Radel returned to Congress at the beginning of the year despite numerous calls from within his own party to step down. He has apparently reconsidered that decision, however, and has also notified Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner of his decision to resign.\n\n\"I believe that Trey is making the right decision for him and his family,\" Scott said in a statement Monday, according to USA Today. \"I'm glad that he has sought help, and it's my hope he continues to put his attention on rehabilitation and his family.\"\n\nDuring his time in office, Radel was an outspoken critic of the Affordable Care Act, and made a name for himself as the \u201chip hop conservative\u201d for speaking publicly about his interest in rap music, which he credited for opening his eyes to numerous issues.\n\nAlthough Radel was elected in a heavily conservative district, his resignation is expected to spark a competitive primary as politicians jockey to succeed him. According to the Washington Post, former State Rep. Paige Kreegel, State Senate Majority Leader Lizbeth Benacquisto and Radel\u2019s predecessor, former congressman Connie Mack, are all possible candidates.\n\n\"Trey's decision to resign from Congress was undoubtedly very difficult, but it was the right decision,\" Mack told USA Today in a statement. \"Now it's time for Southwest Florida to elect a new congressman who will be a tireless champion of our shared mainstream conservative values.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "United States Congressman Trey Radel (R-Florida) is officially resigning from his post in the House of Representatives following a months-long scandal that erupted when he was charged with cocaine possession.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "United States Congressman Trey Radel (R-Florida) is officially resigning from his post in the House of Representatives following a months-long scandal that erupted when he was charged with cocaine possession.", "title": "Florida congressman resigns amid cocaine scandal", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/ff/b0/00/000_173175038.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/rep-trey-radel-resigns-259/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "United States Congressman Trey Radel (R-Florida) is officially resigning from his post in the House of Representatives following a months-long scandal that erupted when he was charged with cocaine possession.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/ff/b0/00/000_173175038.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88ca\"", "article_summary": "\"Now it's time for Southwest Florida to elect a new congressman who will be a tireless champion of our shared mainstream conservative values.\"\nThe 37-year-old Republican lawmaker from Fort Myers, Florida, announced his resignation in a letter sent to House Speaker John Boehner.\nUnited States Congressman Trey Radel (R-Florida) is officially resigning from his post in the House of Representatives following a months-long scandal that erupted when he was charged with cocaine possession.\n\"Trey's decision to resign from Congress was undoubtedly very difficult, but it was the right decision,\" Mack told USA Today in a statement.\nRick Scott and Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner of his decision to resign."}
