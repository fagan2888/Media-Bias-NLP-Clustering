It is carried by the same tick that carries bacteria for Lyme disease \u2014 although only 1 percent carry Powassan.\n\nPowassan differs from Lyme disease in another important way: While a tick has to remain attached to a person for at least a day to transmit Lyme, it needs only 15 minutes to spread Powassan.\n\nThe state was notified Nov. 11 that a sample sent by the woman\u2019s physician to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was identified as Powassan. It updated its website to include information about the disease.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t send the alert out until yesterday.\n\nOn Thursday, the health department said it didn\u2019t issue an advisory because the disease is extremely rare and because \"it was no longer tick season.\"\n\nYesterday, state officials said what they received in mid-November was merely a preliminary report from the CDC. The final report was received yesterday, which triggered the alert to local doctors, said Donna Leusner, a department spokeswoman.\n\nWhile cases of tick-borne illnesses soar in the summer months, they remain possible year-round, said Tom Mather, a public health entomologist with the TickEncounter Resource Center at the University of Rhode Island.\n\nIt remains unclear why six months passed between the woman\u2019s death and any official knowledge about its cause. A spokesman for the CDC said he did not know when tissue samples from the woman\u2019s doctor were received.\n\nCiting privacy concerns, neither the Warren County woman\u2019s name nor her hometown were released. Peter Summers, Warren County\u2019s health officer, said he didn\u2019t hear about the case until November.\n\nMather predicted once New Jersey doctors know Powassan is a possibility among their patients, the state will see a jump in the number of patients suspected of having the illness.\n\nThere have been fewer than 60 cases of Powassan since it was discovered in 1958. However, most of those have been in the last 10 years. This year, there have been eight cases nationally; New Jersey\u2019s is now the ninth.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news'", "title": "N.J. officials alert medical community about fatality from tick-borne illness", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"N.J. officials alert medical community about fatality from tick-borne illness\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/nj_officials_alert_medical_community_about_fatality_from_tick-borne_illness.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/cdc-tickjpg-a55d29a8ad36b354.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11781813\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-07T11:35:26Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/13899623-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "A 51-year-old Warren County woman died in mid-May of Powassan virus, a tick-borne illness whose most dangerous symptom is encephalitis."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 07, 2013,  6:35 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/cdc-tickjpg-a55d29a8ad36b354.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A 51-year-old Warren County woman died in mid-May of Powassan virus, a tick-borne illness whose most dangerous symptom is encephalitis.", "title": "N.J. officials alert medical community about fatality from tick-borne illness", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/nj_officials_alert_medical_community_about_fatality_from_tick-borne_illness.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 07, 2013,  6:35 AM", "article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "A 51-year-old Warren County woman died in mid-May of Powassan virus, a tick-borne illness whose most dangerous symptom is encephalitis."}, "article_summary": "A 51-year-old Warren County woman died in mid-May of Powassan virus, a tick-borne illness whose most dangerous symptom is encephalitis.\nIt is carried by the same tick that carries bacteria for Lyme disease \u2014 although only 1 percent carry Powassan.\nIt was New Jersey\u2019s first case of a disease that, while extremely rare, is fatal in 10 percent of the cases.\nThe state Department of Health sent a statewide advisory about a rare tick-borne disease to doctors and public health officials late yesterday, urging physicians to consider it as a possible cause for patients with viral encephalitis or meningitis.\nThe final report was received yesterday, which triggered the alert to local doctors, said Donna Leusner, a department spokeswoman."}
