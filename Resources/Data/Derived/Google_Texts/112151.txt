As the passage of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill demonstrates once again, the Republican establishment just can’t help spending your money on wasteful and extra-constitutional pork. You can see the list of those Republicans who voted for this betrayal of conservative principles in the Republican List of Shame below.

No doubt many of those on the Republican List of Shame will claim the bill has all kinds of prohibitions on more spending or that it cuts government waste.

That is, to put it politely, a lot of baloney.

What’s more, as Amanda Carpenter senior communications adviser to Senator Ted Cruz pointed out in a series of Tweets, many Capitol Hill staffers haven’t even read the bill and laughed about the whole idea of knowing what was in it before their bosses voted on it.

Here are a few of the wasteful and extra-constitutional programs and earmarks the Republicans on the List of Shame below voted for:

· Funding U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) advertising programs for food stamps in foreign countries like Mexico.

· $35 million for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), an organization believed to be involved in China’s coercive one-child policy of forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations.

· Funding for the implementation of Obamacare, including elective abortion coverage.

· Earmarking Export-Import Bank funds for “green energy.”

· The National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.

· Over $34 million to pay salaries and expenses for the supposedly terminated TARP program (Troubled Asset Relief Program) that bailed-out Wall Street and foreign banks.

And of course there will be more revelations of waste, earmarks and extra-constitutional spending when Americans do actually get to review the 1,582-page $1.012 trillion spending bill.
