In this case, it\u2019s the H1-B visa program, which grants up to 85,000 visas a year, ostensibly to help U.S. companies fill high-tech positions for which, purportedly, no American is suitably educated. These are jobs, companies like Microsoft and Facebook argue, that require such specialization in computer science that they rely on the importation of IT super-hero geniuses. Or something.\n\nWell, not so fast. More and more American workers are finding they\u2019re not only losing their jobs to H1-B visa holders, more often than not, these fired workers also have to endure the ignominy of training their replacements.\n\nThis, of course, is the opposite of what we\u2019re told all the time about the importance of the H1-B visa scheme. We need to attract \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d from around the world to help us compete, as a Microsoft general counsel told National Public Radio (NPR) in 2013. Considering the fact that a record 92 million Americans are out of the workforce, one would think employing our own \u201cbest and brightest\u201d might be a better place to start, let alone importing workers and condemning even more Americans to unending joblessness.\n\nThe latest case of the unfortunate, growing number of examples comes from \u201cthe Happiest Place on Earth\u201d in Orlando, Fla. The New York Times reports about 250 data systems employees at Disney World were called into the boss\u2019 office. They thought they were getting bonuses. What they really got was the shock of a lifetime.\n\n\u201c[A]bout 250 Disney employees were told in late October that they would be laid off. Many of their jobs were transferred to immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers, who were brought in by an outsourcing firm based in India. Over the next three months, some Disney employees were required to train their replacements to do the jobs they had lost,\u201d according to the paper.\n\n\u201c\u2018I just couldn\u2019t believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks and take over our jobs exactly,\u2019 said one former worker, an American in his 40s who remains unemployed since his last day at Disney on Jan. 30. \u2018It was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over your job. I still can\u2019t grasp it,\u2019 reported The New York Times.\n\nThe Disney case is not unique. In Los Angeles, more than 400 information technology employees at Southern California Edison learned they were being laid off and would have to train their H1-B visa replacements.\n\n\u201c\u2018They are bringing in people with a couple of years\u2019 experience to replace us and then we have to train them,\u201d said one longtime IT worker \u2026 . \u201cNot one of these jobs being filled by India was a job that an Edison employee wasn\u2019t already performing,\u201d he said, reported Computerworld magazine, which interviewed several of the laid-off employees.\n\nIn Columbia, Mo., local television station KMIZ reported last month that Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa was investigating allegations that IBM is engaging in the firing of American workers and replacing them with H1-B visa holders.\n\nA local ABC affiliate in Sacramento, Calif., the state capital, is investigating just how many Americans have lost California state jobs to foreign HB-1 visa holders.\n\nIn response to The New York Times report on the Disney allegations, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida called on the Department of Homeland Security to investigate \u201cpotential misuses\u201d of the program.\n\nAnswers are not hard to find. Ron Hira, a professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology spoke with NPR about the issue. \u201cFor the past decade, he\u2019s been studying how consulting firms use temporary work visas to help American companies cut costs. He says they use the visas to supply cheaper workers here, but also to smooth the transfer of American jobs to information-technology centers overseas,\u201d said the radio network.\n\n\u201cWhat these firms have done is exploit the loopholes in the H-1B program to bring in on-site workers to learn the jobs [of] the Americans to then ship it back offshore,\u201d Mr. Hira told NPR.\n\nIn the meantime, in April 10 senators asked the Department of Labor to investigate abuse of the program, but according to Computerworld, that request is \u201cmeeting resistance\u201d at the department. The publication notes the department has suggested \u201cin a letter to lawmakers, that an investigation may be fruitless because it is legal to replace U.S. workers with H-1B workers.\u201d\n\nImmigration proponents, such as Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and President Obama, constantly assure Americans that legalizing \u201cundocumented workers\u201d won\u2019t have any negative impact at all on the security of American jobs. After all, they tell us, illegal aliens only do the jobs Americans won\u2019t do.\n\nJust like how HB-1 visa holders are coming here to do the jobs Americans can\u2019t do. Which is technically true, I suppose. After all, you can\u2019t do your job when you\u2019ve been fired and have been replaced by an unskilled foreigner you had to train.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce is a radio talk show host.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With another week, we have another example of the immigration system harming American workers.
