Chris Holbert, R-Parker, said the plates, which are passed out to all 100 lawmakers, are largely symbolic yet have prevented some lawmakers from receiving photo radar tickets and notices of parking violations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re decorations but they can give lawmakers an unfair advantage when it comes to traffic violations,\u201d said Holbert, who is championing the bill after he saw an investigative report last year by CBS4 Denver which revealed more than a dozen legislative plates that have racked up a total of $2,100 in fines and penalties that were never paid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d added Holbert of the provision that was adopted in 1963.\n\nThe license plates display the House or Senate district number of the lawmaker. There are no tags on the license plates because each are assigned to the specific lawmaker and not the vehicle they drive. Colorado\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicle does not incorporate the plates into its database.\n\nNot all lawmakers use the license plates, but also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary to completely abolish them.\n\n\u201cI support the concept of holding legislators accountable for their traffic infractions,\u201d said Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, whose car is not outfitted with the special plates. \u201cThe plates do help constituents identify who their lawmaker is. I think repeal of the provision is using a blunt instrument on a problem that needs a scalpel approach.\u201d\n\nThe bill is set to be heard in the coming weeks in the House Transportation & Energy Committee. Suggested changes to the DMV system, said Holbert, could be offered as rival legislation.\n\nFollow Kurtis on Twitter: @kurtisalee", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chris Holbert,Dan Pabon,House Transportation and Energy Committee,John Kefalas,license plates", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The state provision that grants special license plates to Colorado lawmakers could be repealed under a proposal by a Colorado lawmaker.", "title": "Special license plates for Colorado lawmakers could be driven out", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/01/15/special-license-plates-for-colorado-lawmakers-could-be-driven-out/104841/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/01/KEFALAS-e1389749191645-495x451.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The state provision that grants special license plates to Colorado lawmakers could be repealed under a proposal by a Colorado lawmaker.", "creator": "@kurtisalee", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/01/15/special-license-plates-for-colorado-lawmakers-could-be-driven-out/104841/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/01/KEFALAS-e1389749191645-495x451.jpg", "title": "Special license plates for Colorado lawmakers could be driven out by legislation", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The state provision that grants special license plates to Colorado lawmakers could be repealed under a proposal by a Colorado lawmaker."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7d7\"", "article_summary": "A provision that grants special license plates to Colorado lawmakers could be repealed under a proposal by a state lawmaker.\nNot all lawmakers use the license plates, but also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary to completely abolish them.\nThere are no tags on the license plates because each are assigned to the specific lawmaker and not the vehicle they drive.\nThe license plates display the House or Senate district number of the lawmaker.\n\u201cI support the concept of holding legislators accountable for their traffic infractions,\u201d said Rep.
