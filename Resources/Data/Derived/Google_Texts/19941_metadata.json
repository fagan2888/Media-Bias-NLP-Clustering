Most people can tell you what 16 says \u2014 \u2026 ;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son.\u2019 But they don\u2019t know nothing about 17,\u201d he said, in The Christian Post. \u201cIt says Jesus didn\u2019t come to condemn us. If anybody had a right to condemn someone, it would be the son of God. If he didn\u2019t do it, then hey, we definitely are not qualified to do it.\u201d\n\nAlan Robertson, the oldest son of Phil and Miss K, fellow family members on \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d weighed in to The Christian Post and said he\u2019s puzzled by atheists and agnostics who don\u2019t believe in an active, interested God.\n\n\u201cA person asked me one time, what\u2019s the evidence that God is there? And I said, \u2018I\u2019ll go out here and pick up an acorn from under a tree. You put it in the ground and water it and 40 years later when you come back, there might be an oak tree as big around as a pick-up truck.\u2019 Inside that little acorn is the resurrection power,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has to come from somewhere. It didn\u2019t just exist.\u201d\n\nChristianity is why the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d family is still together, Mr. Robertson said.\n\n\u201cI think that without faith we wouldn\u2019t be that way,\u201d he said, adding that the show always ends in family prayer. \u201cWe would\u2019ve splintered apart a long time ago and we wouldn\u2019t be together. So obviously, it\u2019s kept us together. One of the things that I like about the show is that it\u2019s subtle, and it kind of reminds me of when Jesus used to teach in parables. Jesus would lay out just a practical teaching, but you really had to dive a little deeper to know more about it. And I think it\u2019s that way with our family\u2019s faith.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uncle Si, as Silas Merritt Robertson is known to \"Duck Dynasty\" watchers, has a new book coming out Tuesday, and it promises more of the same of what makes the A&E hit one of the most-watched reality shows in television history: family-friendly tales that highlight the power and grace of Jesus Christ.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Uncle Si, as Silas Merritt Robertson is known to \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d watchers, has a new book coming out Tuesday, and it promises more of the same of what makes the A&E hit one of the most-watched reality shows in television history: family-friendly tales that highlight the power and grace of Jesus Christ.", "title": "\u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 star Uncle Si dishes on faith in Christ in new book", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/duck-dynasty-star-uncle-si-dishes-faith-christ-new/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/tv-duck-dynasty-ratin_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/tv-duck-dynasty-ratin_lea.jpg", "description": "Uncle Si, as Silas Merritt Robertson is known to \"Duck Dynasty\" watchers, has a new book coming out Tuesday, and it promises more of the same of what makes the A&E hit one of the most-watched reality", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 star Uncle Si dishes on faith in Christ in"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
