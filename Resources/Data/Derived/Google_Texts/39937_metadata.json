Moore, too, was nowhere to be found; after being placed on injured reserve designated to return in November, he was eligible to practice last week but has not done so.\n\nShaun Phillips was also missing from the practice. He was ill, had a fever and was sent home. Coach John Fox was not required to give a full injury report Monday and thus did not give any further updates.\n\nOther than that, though, the Broncos were healthy in Monday\u2019s frigid temperatures as they began preparing to play San Diego on Sunday afternoon. After a light week without knowing their future opponent, it\u2019s time to get down to business.\n\n\u201cIt was just a matter of time,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThey had to play the games, and those are completed, and now we know we\u2019re playing a division team at our place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get into the playoffs, and they\u2019re all difficult. That\u2019s why they have the playoffs. Regardless of if they\u2019re in your division or how many times you\u2019ve played them, it\u2019s a single-elimination tournament, and whoever plays the best wins.\u201d\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joanniesen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Derek Wolfe, Rahim Moore out as Broncos practice for Chargers in cold", "title": "Derek Wolfe, Rahim Moore out as Broncos practice for Chargers in cold", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/06/derek-wolfe-rahim-moore-out-as-broncos-practice-for-chargers-in-cold/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140106__BroncosWRs010613p1-1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140106__BroncosWRs010613p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-06T11:05:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T03:11:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf91\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos, after giving Wolfe the week off last week, had planned to bring him back for Monday\u2019s practice, but he remained absent.\nThe Derek Wolfe and Rahim Moore watch is still on.\nMoore, too, was nowhere to be found; after being placed on injured reserve designated to return in November, he was eligible to practice last week but has not done so.\nOther than that, though, the Broncos were healthy in Monday\u2019s frigid temperatures as they began preparing to play San Diego on Sunday afternoon.\nCoach John Fox was not required to give a full injury report Monday and thus did not give any further updates."}
