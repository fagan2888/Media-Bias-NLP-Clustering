Sure, they\u2019re reminiscent of every other person that works at your local pharmacy store, but they\u2019re actually a treasure trove of knowledge. Monday, Jan. 12, marks National Pharmacist Day 2015, a day to commemorate and thank your local pharmacist for the work they do.\n\nPharmacy has changed a lot over the last century. What was once a profession solely meant to prepare and dispense prescription drugs is now a lot more intimate. Pharmacists today are still privy to the chemical makeup of each and every drug you\u2019re prescribed, but they\u2019re also capable of telling patients exactly which drug is suitable for their body, as there\u2019s typically more than one drug for any one condition or disease. This is important, for example, when a patient has multiple diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, and a drug they\u2019re prescribed can help one condition while worsening the other.\n\nAside from giving patients advice on drugs, pharmacists are also deeply involved in the health care of patients, especially in poor communities, where going to a doctor\u2019s office can be unaffordable. Many of them are part of community health programs and seminars, which teach patients about health and disease \u2014 sometimes they specialize in specific areas, like asthma or diabetes, and provide advice and services. And more recently, they also began administering vaccines, such as the flu shot. Between 2008 and 2011, the number of pharmacists able to administer flu shots rose from 60,000 to 150,000, NPR reported.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare landscape in our nation is changing and pharmacists are no longer simply dispensing medication,\u201d said CVS Caremark\u2019s President and CEO Larry Merlo, while commemorating American Pharmacists Month in October 2013, in a press release. \u201cOur pharmacists are also providing important health care services through innovative programs and services across our practice settings.\u201d\n\nSo, not only are pharmacists making patients\u2019 lives easier through improved services, but we\u2019re now able to get advice on blood pressure in the same place as a gallon of milk. That\u2019s taking convenience to a whole new level.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "national, pharmacist, day, 2015, pharmacists, do, more, they, used, and, we, should, be, thankful", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "National Pharmacist Day is dedicated to appreciating the contribution pharmacists make each and every day to the lives and health care of patients.", "title": "National Pharmacist Day: Commemorating Their Growing Role In Our Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-pharmacist-day-2015-pharmacists-do-more-they-used-and-we-should-be-thankful-317280", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/11/national-pharmacist-day.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Pharmacist Day is dedicated to appreciating the contribution pharmacists make each and every day to the lives and health care of patients.", "title": "National Pharmacist Day: Commemorating Their Growing Role In Our Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-pharmacist-day-2015-pharmacists-do-more-they-used-and-we-should-be-thankful-317280", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/11/national-pharmacist-day.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/11/national-pharmacist-day.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-11T15:54:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-11T16:01:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "National Pharmacist Day is dedicated to appreciating the contribution pharmacists make each and every day to the lives and health care of patients."}, "article_summary": "National Pharmacist Day is dedicated to appreciating the contribution pharmacists make each and every day to the lives and health care of patients.\nMonday, Jan. 12, marks National Pharmacist Day 2015, a day to commemorate and thank your local pharmacist for the work they do.\nAside from giving patients advice on drugs, pharmacists are also deeply involved in the health care of patients, especially in poor communities, where going to a doctor\u2019s office can be unaffordable.\nBetween 2008 and 2011, the number of pharmacists able to administer flu shots rose from 60,000 to 150,000, NPR reported.\nThis is important, for example, when a patient has multiple diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, and a drug they\u2019re prescribed can help one condition while worsening the other."}
