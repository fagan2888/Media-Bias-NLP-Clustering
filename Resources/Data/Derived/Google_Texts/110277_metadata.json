In a statement to Roll Call, a caucus of Senate Democrats said Reid\u2019s filing of an amendment doesn\u2019t guarantee a vote \u2013 not even a procedural one.\n\nThe amendment to the Republicans\u2019 budget reconciliation package, Roll Call reported, would ban individuals who are found guilty of violating laws that prevent the obstruction of women to reproductive health services, like Planned Parenthood, from owning firearms.\n\n\u201cFirearms Guide: 5th Edition\u201d is the world\u2019s most extensive firearms, ammunition and air guns reference guide and gun schematics library on DVD for Windows PC.

We cannot allow ourselves to grow numb to gun violence or to feel powerless in the face of it. We can, and must, make common sense gun reforms that can keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous criminals and the mentally ill. The American people are crying out for us to act. If we do not act, this distressing reality will not change.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, however, aren\u2019t so enthusiastic to use the recent killings as cause to enact gun control.\n\nCheck out the latest patriotic memorabilia at the WND Superstore\n\nSen. Cory Cardner, a Republican who represents Colorado, called the shootings in his state tragic, but aligned more with mental health than gun access.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic and something that is an unacceptable action by clearly some very vile, evil actors,\u201d he said, International Business Times reported. \u201cI hope that we can address this through mental health issues. I think that\u2019s the direction we have to go.\u201d\n\nRelated stories:\n\nLimbaugh eviscerates media\u2019s Farook terror deception\n\nObama, feds drag feet on terrorist label for Farook\n\nP.C. witness ignored Middle Eastern men at Farook home\n\nSolution offered to Muslim carnage: More guns\n\nHarry Reid demanding Senate vote on gun control\n\nObama doubles down on gun control mantra\n\nMichael Savage reported shooter\u2019s name hours before media\n\nDemocrat senator: Stop praying and get on gun control\n\nNewspaper mocks GOP for post-massacre prayers\n\nFox News star sides with Obama on gun violence\n\nDead shooters ID\u2019d as Muslim husband-wife team", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday he\u2019s pressing for a Capitol Hill vote on gun control by adding an amendment to a Republican-sponsored bill to repeal Obamacare, saying in a written message Americans deserve \u201ccommon sense\u201d reforms of the Second Amendment.
