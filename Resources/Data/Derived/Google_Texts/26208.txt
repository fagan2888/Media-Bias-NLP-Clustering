The Veterans Administration is limiting access to healtcare facilities in Newington and West Haven after receiving a potential threat to the West Haven campus.

Normal operations have resumed at VA Healthcare System after the Veterans Administration placed its healthcare facilities in Newington and West Haven on lockdown Tuesday in response to a potential threat received at the West Haven campus.

Local police have apprehended the suspect connected to the threat, according to a press release from Pamela Redmond of VA Connecticut Healthcare System.

Police, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the VA Police Service are handling the case and will determine whether there will be any charges.

Despite heightened security, Redmond said that patient care services were not affected.

The VA Connecticut Healthcare System sent an e-mail earlier on Wednesday saying there was no immediate danger, but announced the VA would temporarily limit access to all exterior doors of the Newington and West Haven campuses, with the exception of the main entrances to Building 2 and 5 on the West Haven campus and Building 2E on the Newington campus as a precautionary measure.

People were asked to be prepared to show proper identification to VA Police when asked.

The VA is working with state and local law enforcement agencies.
