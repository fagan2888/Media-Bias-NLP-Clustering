Perennial leader Verizon took the top spot on both reports.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s 2015 Wireless Network Quality Study, released Thursday, ranked Verizon at the top with the fewest number of problems \u2014 or 10 per 100 connections. That\u2019s better than the average score of the West Region, which includes almost the entire western half of the nation.\n\nTied for second are AT&T and T-Mobile, at 13 problems each. Sprint came in at the bottom, with 14.\n\nBut Sprint saw the greatest improvement. In the last report, Sprint had 17 problems per 100.\n\n\u201cIn general, we did see improvements for both Sprint and T-Mobile overall in most regions,\u201d said Kirk Parsons, practice lead for J.D. Power\u2019s telecom practice. \u201cFor Sprint, they pretty much (improved) across the board in call quality, latency, voice mails. \u2026 T-Mobile had slight improvements in text messaging and call quality.

AT&T came in second at 90, while Sprint and T-Mobile were at 87.9 and 87.1 respectively. This rating included results of calls, data connections and texting, plus the speed of data transfers, downloading e-mail and web or app tasks.\n\nWhile T-Mobile did well for data speeds and was second to Verizon, the company had the lowest score in voice quality and texting.\n\nRich Garwood, T-Mobile\u2019s area vice president who was just in Denver to help launch its 700 MHz service, said that he hopes the company\u2019s upgrades will show up in RootMetrics next report.\n\nFor readers who want to zoom in on their neighborhood to see how the mobile services compare, RootMetrics posts a map indicating quality of service from good to bad at webcoveragemap.rootmetrics.com/us.\n\nOther good sites to check on local mobile-service quality:\n\n\u2022 DeadCellZones.com (Denver)\n\n\u2022 Speedtest.net\n\n\u2022 RootMetrics app to report mobile service quality\n\n\u2022 Sensorly, a crowdsourced wireless network coverage app", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "AT&T,call quality,consumer reports,JD Powers,mobile service,rootmetrics,Sprint,t-mobile,Verizon", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "Verizon tops two reports on mobile service quality in Colorado | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/08/28/verizon-tops-two-reports-on-mobile-service-quality-in-colorado/18734/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/08/1H2015top.jpg?fit=430%2C392", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "Verizon tops two reports on mobile service quality in Colorado", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/08/28/verizon-tops-two-reports-on-mobile-service-quality-in-colorado/18734/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/08/1H2015top.jpg?fit=430%2C392", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "RootMetrics and J.D.
