I'm a wife and a working mom.\"\n\nShe had the North Florida airwaves to herself \u2014 for two months \u2014 defining herself before Republicans could. It was one of a number of smart moves her campaign made and, in hindsight, one of the costly mistakes committed by U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City, whom Graham narrowly defeated Tuesday.\n\nHer victory was one of only a few highlights for Democrats nationally, and it vaults Graham to the top of a barren Democratic bench in Florida.\n\nGraham raised more money than Southerland and, observers on both sides say, outhustled him. Steve Schale, a strategist who helped with the campaign, said at one point last year he worried she was wearing herself thin and told Graham's father, Bob Graham, the former governor and senator.\n\nThe next day Schale got a text message from the candidate. \"It read like, 'Don't you ever go to my dad and tell him I need a rest,' \" Schale recalled Thursday.\n\nGraham also had a focused message, stressing local values \u2014 \"The North Florida way,\" as her ads often said \u2014 and not allowing herself to be boxed in as a Democrat, lightly criticizing President Barack Obama over his response to ISIS and saying the Affordable Care Act needed changes.\n\nSoutherland was his own enemy. He had built up an opposition book worth of gaffes, from suggesting the $174,000 congressional salary wasn't that much to a \"lingerie shower\" comment in defense of his all-male fundraiser.\n\nThe Republican brought in some big names, including Sen. Marco Rubio, but they only reinforced the Washington image. Graham had Jimmy Buffett and former President Bill Clinton, who showed up for a rally in late October at Florida A&M.\n\nHer father \u2014 and the family name \u2014 was an obvious asset.\n\nIn the end, Graham's team saved itself by building a huge advantage in Leon and Gadsden counties, Democratic strongholds. She got 81,605 votes there vs. 42,380 for Southerland. He did well in Bay County, as expected, but in the small counties, Graham pulled just enough support to prevent a landslide.\n\n\"If you move 50 or 100 people, it adds up in a close race,\" said Schale, who credited Graham's team, which included campaign manager Julia Gill Woodward.\n\n\"Our field director Jenn Whitcomb and her team kicked butt,\" said Eric Jotkoff, another adviser.\n\nFinal tally: 125,139 votes for Graham, 122,945 for Southerland \u2014 50.44 percent to 49.56 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In June, when most congressional candidates were focused on building campaigns or dealing with primary opponents, Gwen Graham made the call to go up on TV.", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"url": "http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/how-gwen-graham-defeated-a-gop-incumbent-lone-bright-spot-for-florida/2205593", "image": {"width": 713, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2014/11/a4s_HOUSE102614a_14092250_8col.jpg", "height": 498}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "In June, when most congressional candidates were focused on building campaigns or dealing with primary opponents, Gwen Graham made the call to go up on TV.", "title": "How first-time candidate Gwen Graham defeated a GOP incumbent"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2014/11/a4s_HOUSE102614a_14092250_8col.jpg", "description": "In June, when most congressional candidates were focused on building campaigns or dealing with primary opponents, Gwen Graham made the call to go up on TV.", "site": "@TB_Times", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How first-time candidate Gwen Graham defeated a GOP incumbent"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#115220", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=988277045", "msapplication-TileImage": "/iwov-resources/images/ie10TBTpin.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "default", "keywords": "gwen graham,florida democrats,steve southerland", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gwen graham, florida democrats, steve southerland"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce109\"", "article_summary": "In the end, Graham's team saved itself by building a huge advantage in Leon and Gadsden counties, Democratic strongholds.\nFinal tally: 125,139 votes for Graham, 122,945 for Southerland \u2014 50.44 percent to 49.56 percent.\nIt was one of a number of smart moves her campaign made and, in hindsight, one of the costly mistakes committed by U.S. Rep.
