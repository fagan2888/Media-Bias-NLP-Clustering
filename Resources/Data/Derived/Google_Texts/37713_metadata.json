(Photo: Jim Mone/AP)\n\nMedtronic officials are pushing back against widely published suggestions that the company\u2019s proposed acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien is motivated by a desire to avoid U.S. taxes.\n\nA company tax official said Wednesday that the Fridley-based medical device manufacturer will continue to face a host of U.S. taxes once the deal closes, including on about $14 billion in overseas cash, a key figure in the tax-avoidance debate. The company says the deal primarily is about medical technology.\n\nSome tax experts have suggested the Covidien deal would let Medtronic avoid paying billions in taxes on overseas profits, but Medtronic maintains the cash will continue to be \u201ctrapped\u201d \u2014 subject to U.S. taxes if it is to be used in the United States.\n\nThe comments Wednesday came a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urged Congressional action to prevent these so-called \u201cinversion\u201d deals.\n\n\u201cFor Medtronic to take its (outside-the-United States) cash and invest it in the U.S., there is an incremental tax,\u201d said Phil Albert, the company\u2019s vice president of corporate tax. \u201cThat continues to apply, pre- and post-inversion.\u201d\n\nEdward Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California, countered: \u201cIt\u2019s literally true, but it\u2019s not what any well advised firm would do.\u201d There will be ways, he said, for Medtronic to use its corporate structure to avoid taxes.\n\nAt 35 percent, the United States offers the highest corporate income tax rate in the industrialized world, Donald Goldman, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s W.P. Carey School of Business, said in a recent news report. By contrast, the European Union has an average tax rate of 21 percent.\n\nPaul Vaaler, a tax expert at the University of Minnesota, said in June: \u201cAt the beginning and end of this, the deal is about corporate taxation rates in the U.S., and how those rates deter Medtronic from repatriating billions of dollars now sitting in foreign subsidiary operations.\u201d\n\nBut Albert, the Medtronic official, disputed that motivation, saying: \u201cMedtronic\u2019s foreign earnings post the deal will continue to be subject to the U.S. tax if brought back to the U.S.\u201d\n\nAlbert acknowledged certain tax advantages related to Covidien\u2019s overseas cash that explain why Medtronic is moving its headquarters. If Medtronic were to remain in the United States after the deal, Covidien\u2019s overseas profits would be newly subject to U.S. taxes if invested in this country, Albert said.\n\nIn a \u201cGuide to Tax Inversion\u201d distributed by the company Wednesday, Medtronic stated: \u201cThis deal gives us access to additional cash from Covidien\u2019s overseas operations that will be used to reward shareholders, grow business and invest in innovation. As a result, we are committing to investing $10 (billion) in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMedtronic says it will continue paying federal income taxes on all money earned in the United States, plus state and local taxes. The company also will continue to pay a new excise tax on the sale of medical devices in the U.S., which helps fund expanded health insurance coverage through the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Kleinbard said that cash is fungible, so using the Covidien cash in the U.S. is effectively the same thing as using the Medtronic cash.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the Medtronic cash can be used to fund stock buybacks or lent to the new Irish parent company after the acquisition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end result is the same \u2014 they don\u2019t pay U.S. taxes.\u201d\n\nThis report contains information from The Associated Press and Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/money/2014/07/17/medtronic-reacts-public-criticism/12808557/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Company refutes claims of avoiding U.S. taxes after acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Company refutes claims of avoiding U.S. taxes after acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien", "title": "Medtronic reacts to public criticism", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/money/2014/07/17/medtronic-reacts-public-criticism/12808557/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Company refutes claims of avoiding U.S. taxes after acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien", "title": "Medtronic reacts to public criticism", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0db20dcb315858ac01a267ac7d284701b7ad1879/c=565-0-2039-1474&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/StCloud/2014/07/17/stc0718medtronicresponsehqfiler1.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc35b\"", "article_summary": "But Kleinbard said that cash is fungible, so using the Covidien cash in the U.S. is effectively the same thing as using the Medtronic cash.\n\u201cMoreover, the Medtronic cash can be used to fund stock buybacks or lent to the new Irish parent company after the acquisition,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor Medtronic to take its (outside-the-United States) cash and invest it in the U.S., there is an incremental tax,\u201d said Phil Albert, the company\u2019s vice president of corporate tax.\nWhile technically its new headquarters will be in Dublin, Medtronic said it will keep its operational headquarters in Fridley, shown here.\nIf Medtronic were to remain in the United States after the deal, Covidien\u2019s overseas profits would be newly subject to U.S. taxes if invested in this country, Albert said."}
