A lot of pro-life people are willing to do what the police tell them.\u201d\n\nBowman added:\n\nThe more fundamental reason is that Falls Church city has this ordinance that is massively overbroad. It gives discretion to the city to decide if something is annoying and therefore an officer can ban it if he wants to. That\u2019s the problem with vague and overbroad laws against speech, is that they can be used in a discriminatory manner to suppress the speech of people who are not popular or do not have the political influence that the abortion industry pays for.\n\nThe Christmas caroler who videotaped the incident, Mary Flores, asked the responding officers to clarify why the singers had to stop.\n\n\u201cIt says here \u2026 that there\u2019s no singing allowed?\u201d Flores asks in the video.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d an officer responds.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this public property?\u201d Flores\u2019 daughter asks.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the officer says, \u201cit\u2019s a noise ordinance violation, on public or private property.\u201d\n\nOfficers relied on a provision in the noise ordinance reading:\n\n(15) Yelling, shouting, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person to yell, shout, talk loudly, whistle or sing on any public street or private property in the city at anytime, so as to cause a noise disturbance. This section shall not apply to any person who is participating in a duly permitted or licensed event or who has been duly authorized to engage in such conduct.\n\nThe penalty upon conviction: up to 12 months in jail or a fine of up to $2,500, or both. Carolers said they stopped singing out of fear of being fined or jailed.\n\nThe pro-life activists planned to be back on the sidewalk singing Christmas carols at noon Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe police will respect their right to do that,\u201d Bowman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officers were captured on video telling carolers on a sidewalk outside an abortion business that their singing violates a city noise ordinance.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Officers were captured on video telling carolers on a sidewalk outside an abortion business that their singing violates a city noise ordinance.", "title": "Police Lift Ban on Christmas Caroling Outside Abortion Clinic", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_ChristmasCarol_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-23T14:05:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ThC0mb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Officers were captured on video telling carolers on a sidewalk outside an abortion business that their singing violates a city noise ordinance.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_ChristmasCarol_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Police Lift Ban on Christmas Caroling Outside Abortion Clinic", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life,religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-12-23T12:21:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-23T14:05:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion, pro-life, pro-life protest, Falls Church police, Christmas caroling, religious liberty, Alliance Defending Freedom, First Amendment"}, "article_summary": "The pro-life activists planned to be back on the sidewalk singing Christmas carols at noon Wednesday.\nPolice lifted a ban on Christmas caroling after ordering a group of pro-life activists to stop singing \u201cSilent Night\u201d and other carols on a sidewalk outside an abortion clinic.\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the officer says, \u201cit\u2019s a noise ordinance violation, on public or private property.\u201dOfficers relied on a provision in the noise ordinance reading:(15) Yelling, shouting, etc.\nThe police force decided to allow Christmas caroling outside the abortion business on South Washington Street.\nFalls Church police said a business called around 10:45 a.m. Saturday to report that a sidewalk was being blocked by protesters."}
