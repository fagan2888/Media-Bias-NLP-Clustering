The Supreme Court has taken up the appeal over the sale of North Carolina State University's Hofmann Forest, a working forest in Onslow and Jones counties.

The Daily News of Jacksonville reported reported the state Supreme Court bypassed the N.C. Court of Appeals in taking the case.

Opponents of the sale include foresters, professors and conservationists who sued in September 2013. A Wake County judge denied their request to prevent N.C. State from selling the 79,000-acre forest that's used for research and education.

The plaintiffs appealed the judge's ruling to the Appeals Court.

N.C State now plans to sell the forest to two buyers.
