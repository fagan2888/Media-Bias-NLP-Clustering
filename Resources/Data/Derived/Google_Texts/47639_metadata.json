Hartmayer of the Diocese of Savannah told congregants Saturday at the new St. Anne Catholic Church that two things would happen the following day.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to come to the Mass you want to attend, and secondly, you will stake out your pew,\u201d Hartmayer said during his homily, drawing laughter from the parishioners.\n\n\u201cBut then comes Ash Wednesday, and that will mess it all up,\u201d he added, to more laughter.\n\nThere was much more laughter and many smiles during the rite of dedication for the new, 26,000-square-foot, faded-brick, statue-filled church that brought out hundreds of parishioners and many area religious leaders on a chilly morning in Richmond Hill.\n\nThe Mass began at the nearby Mary-Martha Chapel \u2014 the structure built by Henry Ford in 1938 \u2014 where religious leaders, Knights of Columbus members and parishioners first gathered. The entire group proceeded to the new church, singing \u201cLet Us Go Rejoicing\u201d the entire way. The processional\u2019s path went by the Holy Family Hall, which was built in 2004 and had been the home of Mass for the parish.\n\nAt the front of the new edifice, Hartmeyer received the front-door keys from a representative of R.W. Allen, that architect that built the facility. Hartmeyer then turned the keys over to Father Joseph Smith, St. Anne pastor, who unlocked the door to let everyone in.\n\nThe church, filled with natural light from its huge windows, quickly filled with the still-singing parishioners. The service began and featured more singing, Bible verses, prayers and sprinkling of holy water throughout. Also during the service, leaders anointed Chrism, a consecrated oil, to the altar and walls of the edifice.\n\nDuring his homily, Hartmayer went through much of the Catholic history of the Richmond Hill area. In the early 1950s, about 30 people from Richmond Hill went to Savannah for weekly Mass. In 1955, the Martha-Mary Chapel became the property of the Diocese of Savannah, and the community began with five families and \u201ca handful of Catholic soldiers based in Hinesville,\u201d Hartmayer said.\n\nThe bishop said the Richmond Hill Catholic community began to grow. Smith told the News in a previous interview that the St. Anne parish today has about 1,000 families covering 2,300 members.\n\nHartmayer also made a comparison to a young married couple who dream of owning and moving into their own home.\n\n\u201cFather Smith, you and the people of St. Anne must feel so happy and so proud and secure that you now have this place that you can call your own. No more kneepads, no more folding chairs,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his address to the congregation, Smith thanked the many people who worked on the planning and gave and prayer of the church, saying that every effort \u201cwas greatly necessary and is greatly appreciated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collaboration. It\u2019s a constant collaboration \u2014 constant collaboration, working together, listening together and making people feel like this is theirs from the very beginning,\u201d Smith said after the Mass.\n\nBishop Emeritus Kevin Boland said prior to the service that having a permanent place of worship is \u201cthe ultimate thing you look for when you establish a faith community,\u201d and that the new St. Anne church is a great sign of growth in the diocese.\n\nHe also praised the structure itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s absolutely magnificent,\u201d Boland said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the finest churches in the diocese. The people can be very proud of what they\u2019ve done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bryancountynews.com/archives/42458/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/bryancountynews/article/2016/02/10/ST_ANNE_OPENS_2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bishop Gregory J.
