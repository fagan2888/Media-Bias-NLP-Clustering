Studies range from arthritis to poor eyesight. \u201cIf you understand how diseases come about, you can figure out how to deal with them,\u201d said Rocky Tuan, director of the university's Center for Cellular and Molecular Engineering in Oakland. He said researchers use stem cells to develop targeted medical treatments and explore biological triggers for disease. Though a team at Oregon Health and Science University cloned human embryos to make stem cells, Tuan said, much of the stem cell data researchers use come from embryos discarded from in vitro fertilization. Other studies rely on what scientists call induced pluripotent stem cells, a newer approach that researchers can use to cultivate a variety of cell lines from non-embryonic adult tissue. Multipotent cells, a more limited type of stem cells, have continued to drive medical discoveries since scholars identified them in the late 1960s. At Pitt, Tuan said researchers use stem cells to try to restore the vision of macular degeneration patients. And they are exploring ways to treat degenerative skeletal diseases, especially those that can hobble joint functions. Some are working toward tissue regeneration in muscles. \u201cThose structures do fall apart, particularly due to injury and aging and bad lifestyle,\u201d Tuan said. \u201cWe try to use stem cells to give rise to the tissues that are now non-functioning. Perhaps you can restore the function of that tissue.\u201d Related .pdfs\n\nCan't view the attachment?

The scientific breakthrough was celebrated around the globe.\n\nThen the bottom fell out.\n\nA scandal erupted over fabricated data, and University of Pittsburgh biologist Gerald Schatten was forced to pull back the findings. Critics cast the 2004 discovery as a farce, a high-profile fraud that forced the journal Science into a rare retraction in January 2006.\n\nEight years later, the push to use stem cells as a medical treatment continues, but scholars balk at the suggestion that anyone is trying to make genetically identical individuals.\n\n\u201cWe're not here to clone human beings, for gosh sakes,\u201d said John Gearhart, a stem cell researcher and University of Pennsylvania professor in regenerative medicine. Instead, he said, scholars are working to manipulate stem cells to produce heart cells for cardiac patients, brain cells for neurological patients and other custom transplants that could match a person's genetic makeup.\n\nSchatten's work continues at the Magee-Womens Research Institute at Pitt, where university officials cleared him of scientific misconduct, and he remains a vice chairman for research development. He focuses on educating and training \u201cphysician-scientists and other scientists,\u201d a school spokeswoman wrote in a statement. She said Schatten was traveling and was unable to speak with the Tribune-Review.\n\nResearchers have turned the onetime myth of developing stem cells into reality.\n\nAt the Oregon Health and Science University, researchers succeeded by blending unfertilized human eggs with body tissue to mold stem cells. Scholars say the cells could let doctors grow customized organs for transplants and other therapies.\n\nThe approach engineered by biologist Shoukhrat Mitalipov's research team last year in Portland is among two that scientists are using to forge laboratory-made stem cells \u2014 the so-called master cells that can transform into other body parts \u2014 without relying on donated human embryos. Federal law tightly controls the use of taxpayer money for embryonic research.\n\nIn Mitalipov's approach, the nucleus of a donated egg is replaced with a patient's DNA. The other method, developed in Kyoto, Japan, allows almost any mature body cell to be reprogrammed to operate as a stem cell.\n\nKyoto University professor Shinya Yamanaka won a 2012 Nobel Prize for the discovery of the induced pluripotent stem cells, which researchers can explore without so much as a human egg, Pitt faculty member Lei Yang said.\n\n\u201cThis technology is fast, it's easy, and it's been repeated many, many times,\u201d said Yang, a stem cell researcher and assistant professor in developmental biology. He called it \u201cvery possible\u201d to regenerate a liver or kidney by using pluripotent cells, a development that Yang said researchers might achieve within a decade.\n\nHe said certain organs, such as the heart, present more of a challenge. Pitt and 11 other institutions are involved in an ongoing program to attempt to replicate brain, kidney and other critical organ functions for research, largely through pluripotent cells.\n\nThe Pitt portion has won $5.8 million to let researchers refine a device that mimics the human liver, which would make it easier for companies to test pharmaceuticals without animal trials. The three-year grant came from the National Institutes of Health, although the NIH would not answer inquiries from the Trib about cloning-related projects.\n\nAny practical patient treatments arising from stem cells probably are years away, said Dr. David A. Shaywitz, chief medical officer at the genomic data management company DNAnexus near San Francisco. The cells offer strong promise in linking particular genes with specific diseases and should remain \u201cpowerful research and development tools,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists still are looking into how different types of man-made stem cells vary from one another, said Mitalipov, the Oregon biologist. Clinical trials that could lead to gene therapy and other applications hinge on approval from the Food and Drug Administration and regulatory bodies overseas, he said.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be difficult to demonstrate to the FDA people that these cells are going to be safe,\u201d said Gearhart, the Penn professor. He called the technology \u201cextremely powerful\u201d as doctors approach experiments with lab-grown cells in human subjects.\n\n\u201cWe hope ... that it's going to function in the same way,\u201d Gearhart said. \u201cYou try to do the best you can.\u201d\n\nAdam Smeltz is a Trib Total Media staff writer.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Adam Smeltz", "description": "A decade ago, a dream team of researchers from Pittsburgh to South Korea claimed a medical invention that promised to reshape a culture war.
