CANDY CROWLEY, CNN: The charm offensive. Listen let me talk to you about President Obama because we are at a point in the mid-term that we see a lot of Democrats who actually don't want the president either in their state or in their district because of the Affordable Care Act has not gone as well as it might have and they have angry constituents.



You on the other hand are embracing it. Is it you are fully embraced - you think that nothing about Obamacare has irreparably harmed Floridians in any way?



FORMER GOV. CHARLIE CRIST: No, I don't think so at all. I think it has been great. And I know the roll out was difficult. I'm sure the president feels that way it too. I had an opportunity to visit with him Friday in Miami. He and Michelle were there, the first lady. And, you know, I just know that he has a compassionate heart, he cares about people. People getting health care is like a civil right. I mean people need to have shelter. They need food. They need water and they need health care and they deserve it. We're the richest country in the world. We ought it provide it and God bless him for doing it.
