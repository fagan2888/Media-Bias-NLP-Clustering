Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Clinton laughs off idea of Trump-Sanders debate Colorado gov sports Trump socks MORE (I-Vt.) believes they haven\u2019t gone far enough. Meanwhile in Congress, Republican lawmakers have been busy attacking the EPA\u2019s proposed new rules that aim to reduce U.S. carbon emissions\u2014the Clean Power Plan. Instead of working to destabilize and nullify the plan, Congress should embrace the opportunity and help states prepare.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan aims to encourage innovation by allowing states to meet carbon reduction targets through various means, including by increasing energy efficiency; investing more in states\u2019 clean energy portfolio; switching from higher carbon emitting power sources to lower-emitters like natural gas; upgrading infrastructure on older power plants to reduce emissions; and incentivizing collaboration between states to develop further reduction plans. This plan would make up the core of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to cut carbon emissions by 26 \u2013 28 percent by 2025.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCongress should throw its support behind the EPA\u2019s flexible, market-based climate proposal, as there are many convincing reasons to back the rules. The Clean Power Plan encourages states to invest in growing renewable energy industries, and implementing the plan will show America is a serious player on the international stage. Moreover, voters have been shown to support large-scale efforts to mitigate climate change.\n\nAccording to a new ABC News poll, 59 percent of Americans want the next president to be one who favors government action to address climate change. 72 percent of Americans who are likely to vote in 2016 support an international agreement to cut greenhouse gases. Another recent poll from Stanford University dispels the myth that Republicans do not support fighting climate change: 48 percent of Republicans polled would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports fighting climate change, and 71 percent of those polled believe that failing to reduce carbon emissions will be an enormous problem in the long run. Among young voters, the causes of climate change are a settled issue. In addition, Americans across the political spectrum are very supportive of clean energy sources like solar, wind, and natural gas that could blunt harsher climate change. Congress should heed these voices when considering their stance on the new regulations.\n\nBeyond being a solution to a problem many voters are worried about, the Clean Power Plan also offers states an opportunity to tap into a growing and exciting industry. While clean energy is no panacea, it creates new jobs, has the potential to bring cheaper energy prices, and has a smaller impact on the environment. Solar panel installations were at a record high in 2014 of 6.2 gigawatts, and look to be growing in the years ahead. The job market for solar has grown by 86 percent over the past five years to about 174,000 workers and could grow to over 210,000 at the end of 2015. Wind energy growth has been strong over the past decade, and is the largest non-hydro renewable generator of electricity. Over the past ten years, the costs of wind and solar have fallen greatly, and they are now more competitive with traditional forms of energy. A recent report by the NRDC also predicts the Clean Power Plan could result in 224,000 jobs by 2020.\n\nImplementing the Clean Power Plan also allows America to re-claim its mantel of climate leadership on the international stage. After the U.S. failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the Obama Administration has put the U.S. back in the driver\u2019s seat. The Clean Power Plan nicely compliments America\u2019s 2014 bilateral agreement with China, which constrained their future carbon emissions for the first time, and the Obama Administration\u2019s pledge to cut carbon emissions from the federal government by 40 percent by 2025. These moves in tandem show aggressive leadership and give the U.S. international credibility in the lead up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris this December. We are in a better position to hold other countries accountable in submitting their carbon emission reduction plans, and more importantly live up to our own commitments over the next decade and onwards.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan is a strong framework that paves the way for further investment in clean energy, will improve standing abroad, reduce carbon emissions, and help solve a problem that many voters deem alarming. Instead of re-litigating old battles, Congress and our next president should embrace this opportunity to invest in the future of America\u2019s energy economy.\n\nCantor is a fellow at the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, and an Economic Policy Analyst at NDN, a center-left think tank in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "59 percent of Americans want the next president to be one who favors government action to address climate change.", "description": "59 percent of Americans want the next president to be one who favors government action to address climate change.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "59 percent of Americans want the next president to be one who favors government action to address climate change.", "title": "Time for Congress to embrace the clean power plan", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/241237-time-for-congress-to-embrace-the-clean-power-plan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/241237-time-for-congress-to-embrace-the-clean-power-plan", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-07T18:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Corey Cantor", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-07T18:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/241237-time-for-congress-to-embrace-the-clean-power-plan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "59 percent of Americans want the next president to be one who favors government action to address climate change.", "card": "summary", "title": "Time for Congress to embrace the clean power plan"}, "dcterms.title": "Time for Congress to embrace the clean power plan"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile in Congress, Republican lawmakers have been busy attacking the EPA\u2019s proposed new rules that aim to reduce U.S. carbon emissions\u2014the Clean Power Plan.\nA recent report by the NRDC also predicts the Clean Power Plan could result in 224,000 jobs by 2020.\nImplementing the Clean Power Plan also allows America to re-claim its mantel of climate leadership on the international stage.\nThe Clean Power Plan encourages states to invest in growing renewable energy industries, and implementing the plan will show America is a serious player on the international stage.\nThe Clean Power Plan is a strong framework that paves the way for further investment in clean energy, will improve standing abroad, reduce carbon emissions, and help solve a problem that many voters deem alarming."}
