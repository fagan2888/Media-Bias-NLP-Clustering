Under this decision, so-called \u201ccreepshot\u201d photos, where men often take photos of unconsenting women that they encounter on the street, are legal in Texas.\n\nThe facts of this particular case are far more disturbing than a more ordinary case where a man spots an adult woman that he finds attractive and then snaps a picture of her. According to the Houston Chronicle, a man named Ronald Thompson was charged with \u201c26 counts of improper photography after taking underwater pictures of clothed children \u2013 most wearing swimsuits \u2013 at a San Antonio water park.\u201d\n\nYet, as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals explains in its opinion, the mere fact that this law applies to cases that are disturbing \u2014 or even the fact that it criminalizes some activity that is not protected by the First Amendment \u2014 is not sufficient to save the law from a constitutional challenge. \u201cThe statutory provision at issue is extremely broad, applying to any non-consensual photograph, occurring anywhere, as long as the actor has an intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire. This statute could easily be applied to an entertainment reporter who takes a photograph of an attractive celebrity on a public street.\u201d\n\nA major thrust of the court\u2019s reasoning is that, when a person produces photos that would otherwise be protected by the First Amendment, the fact that they are motivated by sexual desire (or nearly any other particular motivation) cannot make an otherwise constitutionally protected act illegal. \u201c[W]hen the intent is something that, if accomplished, would constitute protected expression,\u201d Presiding Judge Sharon Keller wrote for the court, \u201csuch an intent cannot remove from the ambit of the First Amendment conduct that is otherwise protected expression.\u201d\n\nThe court did suggest that a more narrowly drawn law would survive constitutional scrutiny \u2014 \u201csubstantial privacy interests are invaded in an intolerable manner when a person is photographed without consent in a private place, such as the home, or with respect to an area of the person that is not exposed to the general public, such as up a skirt.\u201d Thus, if the Texas legislature responds to this decision with a more narrowly tailored ban on \u201cupskirt\u201d photography, for example, it is likely that this law would be upheld.\n\nIn this sense, the Texas court\u2019s decision resembles another decision last March by a Massachusetts court holding that the state\u2019s \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d laws did not extend to non-consensual photographs up a woman\u2019s skirt or dress. The Massachusetts legislature responded to that court decision in just 36 hours, passing a law that specifically bans upskirt photos.\n\nTexas\u2019s legislature can now take similar action to ensure that women in that state will not be the victims of predatory photographers.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Under this court decision, so-called \"creepshot\" photos, where men take photos of unconsenting women that they encounter on the street, are legal in Texas.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Under this court decision, so-called \"creepshot\" photos, where men take photos of unconsenting women that they encounter on the street, are legal in Texas.", "title": "\u2018Creepshot\u2019 Photos Are Now Legal In Texas", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/09/21/3570111/texas-court-creepshot-photos/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/creepshot-e1411250912706.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under this court decision, so-called \"creepshot\" photos, where men take photos of unconsenting women that they encounter on the street, are legal in Texas.", "title": "\u2018Creepshot\u2019 Photos Are Now Legal In Texas", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/creepshot-e1411250912706-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@imillhiser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/creepshot-e1411250912706.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/creepshot-e1411250912706.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-21T08:46:33+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1916\"", "article_summary": "Under this decision, so-called \u201ccreepshot\u201d photos, where men often take photos of unconsenting women that they encounter on the street, are legal in Texas.\nThe Massachusetts legislature responded to that court decision in just 36 hours, passing a law that specifically bans upskirt photos.\nJustice \u2018Creepshot\u2019 Photos Are Now Legal In Texas CREDIT: ShutterstockA Texas state law prohibiting people from taking photographs \u201cwith the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person\u201d if the person being photographed does not consent is unconstitutional, according to the state\u2019s highest criminal court.\nTexas\u2019s legislature can now take similar action to ensure that women in that state will not be the victims of predatory photographers.\nIn this sense, the Texas court\u2019s decision resembles another decision last March by a Massachusetts court holding that the state\u2019s \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d laws did not extend to non-consensual photographs up a woman\u2019s skirt or dress."}
