Marshall takes the spot vacated by linebacker Von Miller, whom the team placed on injured reserve Tuesday.\n\nMiller tore the ACL in his right knee in the first quarter of Denver\u2019s game Sunday against the Houston Texans.\n\nAn MRI on Monday confirmed the injury, and Miller will miss the rest of the season as he recovers from his surgery, which has not yet taken place.\n\nMarshall played in five games as a rookie for the Jacksonville Jaguars after being selected in the fifth round of the 2012 draft. He spent the first 16 weeks of this season on the Broncos\u2019 practice squad.\n\nThe team signed second-year receiver Nathan Palmer to its practice squad to fill Marshall\u2019s position.\n\nPalmer spent most of this season on the Miami Dolphins\u2019 practice squad and played in five games for the Indianapolis Colts in 2012.\n\nIn eight regular-season games this season \u2014 Sunday would have been his ninth, but he lasted only a quarter \u2014 Miller logged five sacks, well off pace of the 18\u00bd he had last season, when he also made the AFC\u2019s Pro Bowl team. He spent the first six games of this season serving a suspension. Linebacker Nate Irving likely will absorb the bulk of Miller\u2019s playing time.\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com, twitter.com/joanniesen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Von Miller moved to injured reserve, Brandon Marshall signed from Broncos practice squad", "title": "Von Miller moved to injured reserve, Brandon Marshall signed from Broncos practice squad", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/24/von-miller-moved-to-injured-reserve-brandon-marshall-signed-from-broncos-practice-squad/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224_041701_brandon-marshall-broncos-122413.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224_041701_brandon-marshall-broncos-122413.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-24T16:26:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:31:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde71d\"", "article_summary": "On Tuesday, the Broncos announced that they moved linebacker Brandon Marshall \u2014 of the same name as the former Broncos receiver \u2014 off their practice squad and onto the 53-man roster.\nHe spent the first 16 weeks of this season on the Broncos\u2019 practice squad.\nMarshall takes the spot vacated by linebacker Von Miller, whom the team placed on injured reserve Tuesday.\nThe team signed second-year receiver Nathan Palmer to its practice squad to fill Marshall\u2019s position.\nPalmer spent most of this season on the Miami Dolphins\u2019 practice squad and played in five games for the Indianapolis Colts in 2012."}
