Soon, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas will have a supercomputer that can do the equation and 200 trillion more like it in one second.\n\nUNLV will be welcoming Intel\u2019s Cherry Creek supercomputer - which was ranked in 2013 as the 400th fastest supercomputer in the world and the 41st most energy-efficient and powerful computer in the world.\n\nThe supercomputer, which looks like an oversized refrigerator, has 10,000 core processors that will be able to perform intensive computational tasks such as exploring the human genome.\n\nCompare that to a run-of-the-mill laptop, which has a single core processor. Watson, the computer that bested Ken Jennings on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d has 2,880 core processors.\n\nJoe Lombardo, executive director of UNLV\u2019s national supercomputing center, said Cherry Creek will be the fastest and most powerful computer at a higher education institution in Nevada.\n\nCherry Creek, which is on its way to Nevada from an Intel plant in Oregon, will be housed at Switch, the computer data center company that provides off-site servers to technology companies and the federal government. Switch is located in the south valley.\n\nAnd housing the machine at Switch means the computer will be in a safe, cool environment, thanks to the company\u2019s cooling system, Lombardo said.\n\nSupercomputers run very hot, apparently.\n\n\u201cThis is a very special machine,\u201d said Lombardo, who wrote the proposal that persuaded Intel to award Cherry Creek to UNLV.\n\n\u201cHaving access to this technology not only enhances research and enhances the educational experience for our graduate and undergraduate students. It will play a critical and important role in faculty improvement.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbest and brightest faculty\u201d will be attracted to UNLV to work with a state of the art, world-class supercomputer, Lombardo said.\n\nSupercomputers are being used in many industries, including aerospace, automotive design, government intelligence and filmmaking - think complicated graphic art in action scenes.\n\nAnd UNLV students, through their professors, will be able to use it for projects, while \u201cstudents at other universities can read about it,\u201d Lombardo said.\n\nUNLV President Don Snyder called it a \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d and \u201ca game changer.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of Cherry Creek, Snyder said, will help push UNLV to gain the highest ranking as a Carnegie Research university, a prestigious designation from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\n\nBesides its educational uses, Cherry Creek will help advance scientific discoveries at the university.\n\nProfessor Marty Schiller already has plans for the supercomputer.\n\n\u201cMy life\u2019s awesome right now,\u201d the School of Life Sciences professor said. \u201cIt is enabling discoveries that wouldn\u2019t be possible without a high-end computer like this.\u201d\n\nSchiller is researching the human genome to determine how different DNA sequences could result in different diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n\nThe research could show how different medications can help individual people or in some cases not help someone. It\u2019s personalized medicine versus medicine for the masses, Schiller said.\n\nThe complicated algorithms that Schiller writes for his research into genome sequencing must be processed hundreds of thousands of times. These calculations used to take years to perform, Schiller said.\n\n\u201cInstead of two or three years, it takes two or three weeks\u201d by using Cherry Creek, he said.\n\nCherry Creek can be used by the private sector through partnerships with UNLV and Switch and is expected to attract significant research grants.\n\nMeanwhile, Lombardo said UNLV\u2019s own supercomputer, which is housed on campus and named Eureka, will remain active.\n\n\u201cWe want to have more than one of these machines,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quick: Multiply 3.14159 by 1.61803.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Quick: Multiply 3.14159 by 1.61803.", "title": "UNLV welcoming world-class Intel supercomputer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/20/unlv-welcoming-world-class-intel-supercomputer/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/20/6d95a6b709ce3425600f6a706700514b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/20/6d95a6b709ce3425600f6a706700514b.jpg", "description": "Quick: Multiply 3.14159 by 1.61803.", "card": "summary", "title": "UNLV welcoming world-class Intel supercomputer"}, "Author": "FRANCIS McCABE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "UNLV will be welcoming Intel\u2019s Cherry Creek supercomputer - which was ranked in 2013 as the 400th fastest supercomputer in the world and the 41st most energy-efficient and powerful computer in the world.\n\u201cThis is a very special machine,\u201d said Lombardo, who wrote the proposal that persuaded Intel to award Cherry Creek to UNLV.\nIt will play a critical and important role in faculty improvement.\u201dThe \u201cbest and brightest faculty\u201d will be attracted to UNLV to work with a state of the art, world-class supercomputer, Lombardo said.\n\u201cInstead of two or three years, it takes two or three weeks\u201d by using Cherry Creek, he said.\nCherry Creek can be used by the private sector through partnerships with UNLV and Switch and is expected to attract significant research grants."}
