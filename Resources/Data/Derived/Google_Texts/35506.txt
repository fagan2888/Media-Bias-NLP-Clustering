Alexis Davidson isn’t a cry baby type. At 11 years old, she has already yanked out her own loose tooth using a slingbow.

In order to get it done, Alexis attached a string to her loose tooth, which was tied to an arrow on the slingbow. Poised like a warrior princess with a big grin on her face, she lets the arrow go with barely a look of shock or pain — all while her parents are standing on either side of her and filming her. After the tooth flies out behind the arrow, she raises her arms in triumph and dances, apparently not feeling any pain — or perhaps too brave to care.

“Fearless Alexis appears to feel no pain as she jumps up and down in elation in her backyard in Aurora, Colorado,” Caters TV writes on YouTube.

While Alexis’s feat is extraordinary, it’s not always the best idea to try this at home. Most loose teeth and baby teeth require patience and fall out best on their own, when they’re ready to. Pulling out teeth before they’re ready can result in damage to the gums for weeks afterwards — and involves a lot of bleeding and pain. Some dentists even agree that allowing baby teeth to fall out on their own is essential for your adult teeth to develop properly.

And if it’s quite loose and ready to come out — you don’t always need a slingbow to do it at home. Sometimes even just wiggling the tooth, eating and chewing, or simply waiting will do the trick with a lot less pain.
