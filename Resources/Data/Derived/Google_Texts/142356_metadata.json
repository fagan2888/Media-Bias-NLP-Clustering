Then make your selection carefully so you get what you\u2019re paying for, he adds.\n\nTo help you navigate enrollment \u2014 either on health insurance exchanges or elsewhere \u2014 McMillan offers the following helpful tips:\n\n1. Know what services are covered under a selected plan\n\nStart by reviewing what each particular plan offers. For example, what does the network of care providers look like? What services are most important to you based on your particular health needs or conditions, and are they available within a plan\u2019s coverage?\n\n\u201cThis will be a period of great change, and consumers will have a lot of options they haven\u2019t had before on the exchanges,\u201d McMillan says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be clear on what\u2019s available and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n2. Make sure your providers are part of the network\n\nWhen choosing plans, this is a major factor. Look at any given plan to see if your doctors and hospitals you use regularly are listed as network providers.\n\nOne evolving trend has been for health plans to create narrow networks \u2014 smaller versions of their standard network that help them achieve a lower price. The bottom line: Not all providers are included in these limited networks, so it\u2019s worth your effort to check first and make sure your new plan includes the doctors and other practitioners you see regularly, McMillan says.\n\n\u201cLook at any given plan to see if your doctors and hospitals you use regularly are listed as network providers.\u201d\n\n3. Know your out-of-pocket costs\n\nThese are costs associated with the care received. They include things such as deductibles \u2014 the amount you pay before coverage kicks in \u2014 as well as copays and coinsurance on services. Out-of-pocket costs vary by the \u201cmetal\u201d level of plan you choose on a health insurance exchange. So, for example, you would pay 40 percent of costs of coinsurance in a bronze plan, and 30 percent for silver.\n\nIn some high-deductible health plans, the first several thousand dollars will be your responsibility, too. For your personal budgeting and planning, it\u2019s critical to know how much money you\u2019ll have to pull out of your pocket when you go to the doctor, to the hospital, to the medical lab or for any other health service, McMillan notes.\n\n4. Understand how your monthly premium works\n\nPremiums are the monthly payments you make for your insurance coverage. Because the benefits for most plans, both on and off the exchanges, have become standardized, it should be fairly easy to make apples-to-apples comparisons among plans.\n\n\u201cYou should be able to compare premium amounts, how much you pay every month for the service,\u201d McMillan advises. However, your personal premiums may vary depending on your own circumstances \u2014 including whether you\u2019re single or married, a smoker or a nonsmoker, and other factors.\n\n2015 open enrollment for health insurance exchanges starts Nov. 15, 2014 and lasts until Feb. 15, 2015. Open enrollment periods for insurance plans outside of exchanges vary. No matter which path you pursue, learn as much as possible about your plan options before you buy, and you\u2019ll end up with coverage that suits your needs as a result.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When selecting an insurance plan \u2014 either on or off new health insurance exchanges \u2014 know what you\u2019re looking for, what you\u2019re willing to pay and what your plan will and will not cover.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Essentials from Cleveland Clinic", "description": "When selecting an insurance plan \u2014 either on or off new health insurance exchanges \u2014 know what you\u2019re looking for, what you\u2019re willing to pay and what your plan will and will not cover.", "title": "4 Tips for Navigating Open Enrollment for Insurance - Health Essentials from Cleveland Clinic", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 275, "identifier": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/10/Maze.jpg", "height": 225}, "updated_time": "2015-07-20T14:19:03-04:00", "url": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/2014/10/4-tips-for-navigating-open-enrollment-for-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/10/Maze.jpg", "description": "When selecting an insurance plan \u2014 either on or off new health insurance exchanges \u2014 know what you\u2019re looking for, what you\u2019re willing to pay and what your plan will and will not cover.", "card": "summary", "title": "4 Tips for Navigating Open Enrollment for Insurance - Health Essentials from Cleveland Clinic"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-09T06:00:44-04:00", "article": {"section": "Family Medicine", "tag": "insurance", "published_time": "2014-10-09T06:00:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T14:19:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "healthcare reform, insurance, health, cleveland, cleveland clinic, health hub, health essentials"}, "article_summary": "2015 open enrollment for health insurance exchanges starts Nov. 15, 2014 and lasts until Feb. 15, 2015.\nWhen open enrollment season for insurance arrives, you\u2019ll face a wider range of choices than ever before \u2014 especially with a second round of enrollment for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchanges starting in November.\nTo help you navigate enrollment \u2014 either on health insurance exchanges or elsewhere \u2014 McMillan offers the following helpful tips:1.\nOpen enrollment periods for insurance plans outside of exchanges vary.\nOut-of-pocket costs vary by the \u201cmetal\u201d level of plan you choose on a health insurance exchange."}
