Pat McCrory has engaged in in recent days over the issue of the rights of transgender people. As is explained in this morning\u2019s edition of the Weekly Briefing, McCrory plumbed new depths this week with his embarrassing effort to limit the rights of a Virginia boy trying to live as who he is.\n\nThe Governor even went so far as to issue a statement in which he essentially said that transgender people do not exist, but are merely people of one gender masquerading as people of the other.\n\nNow, however, comes word that it may be possible to outdo McCrory. Yesterday, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger issued a statement attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper for not joining McCrory\u2019s pro-discrimination effort. Berger even issued the following through-the-looking-glass tweet:\n\n\u201cShame on AG for Putting Politics Above Student Safety\u201d\n\nYou got that?! Berger is attacking Cooper for playing politics. This is like Vladimir Putin accusing the people of Crimea of aggression against Russia.\n\nThe bottom line: If not joining a lawsuit designed to deny basic human rights to a mild mannered 16 year old boy is \u201cplaying politics,\u201d North Carolina could use a whole lot more a such \u201cplay\u201d and a whole lot less of whatever it is that Berger is shoveling.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe13c9\"", "article_summary": "Yesterday, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger issued a statement attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper for not joining McCrory\u2019s pro-discrimination effort.\nPat McCrory has engaged in in recent days over the issue of the rights of transgender people.\nBerger is attacking Cooper for playing politics.\nBerger even issued the following through-the-looking-glass tweet:\u201cShame on AG for Putting Politics Above Student Safety\u201dYou got that?!\nOne would have thought it tough to top the shameless pandering that Gov."}
