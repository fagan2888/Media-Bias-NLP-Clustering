The Denver Elections Division’s rollout of a tablet app for candidate petition signing this year has received a top award from a national professional group of election officials.

In the ballot-qualification stage of the spring municipal election, some candidates checked out tablets loaded with the app. Supporters signed on the screen, allowing the campaigns to quickly verify the person’s registration and keep a running total of signatures.

That saved campaigns from the uncertainty that typically leads them to collect many more signatures than needed before turning in candidacy petitions.

On Thursday, the Election Center presented the Democracy Award to Elections Division director Amber McReynolds at its national conference in Houston.

The award is given to recognize the outstanding national practice for the year. Denver officials said the division was the first in the nation to offer a mobile petition-signing app, via eSign software.

Denver’s election office won the same award in 2013, for a project that rolled out the use of iPads by elderly and disabled voters to mark ballots.
