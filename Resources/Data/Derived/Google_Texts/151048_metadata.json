And McSally supported a plan that the AARP says privatizes Social Security in the stock market. Martha McSally: She\u2019s really not for you.\u201d\n\n\u2014 voiceover of new House Majority PAC ad attacking GOP congressional candidate Martha McSally of Arizona.\n\nThis ad by House Majority PAC, which supports Democrats, is designed to rebut an attack ad recently launched against Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.) by a group affiliated with the conservative Koch brothers. The race between Martha McSally and Barber is expected to be very close, as Barber in 2012 only bested then political novice by a razor-thin margin.\n\nFor the purposes of this fact check, we are going to focus on the allegations concerning McSally\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d for Social Security, which obviously is of concern to the many retirees who live in Arizona. It is no accident that the ad mentions the AARP, the venerable and powerful advocacy group for retirees.\n\nThe Facts\n\nFor evidence of McSally\u2019s position on Social Security, the ad cites a news article that appeared in the Arizona Daily Star on March 25, 2012. But the AARP reference depends on a policy document from seven years earlier\u2014 October 2005. The AARP never evaluated a particular plan by McSally.\n\nIndeed, the Arizona Daily Star comment by McSally \u2013which is part of one of those questionnaires that candidates answer \u2014 is so vague as to be almost opaque:\n\n\u201cWe must keep the promises we\u2019ve made to seniors and veterans. But a decade of irresponsible spending has left us some tough choices. We need to look at gradually increasing the retirement age for younger workers and giving individuals more options to invest part of their benefits for higher returns.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, she makes clear that for older workers, nothing would change. She does mention raising the retirement age for younger workers \u2014 something that even AARP had indicated it might support as part of a budget deal \u2014 but what does \u201cinvest part of their benefits for higher returns\u201d mean? We consulted with an expert on Social Security who said it could refer to any one of different proposals, including one for add-on accounts proposed by Al Gore in the 2000 campaign.\n\nWe found two other references to Social Security by McSally, which only added to the mystery of her position.\n\nIn another questionnaire that appeared in the Green Valley News on April 4, 2012, she stated:\n\n\u201cWe have to keep the promises we\u2019ve made to our seniors and protect the retirement benefits they\u2019ve earned. At the same time, we have take measures to strengthen and sustain it for future generations because it is currently unsustainable. For younger workers, we need to consider approaches such as gradually increasing the retirement age and allowing them to invest a portion of their Social Security payments in ways that will allow them to maximize their returns.\u201d\n\nIn a debate in Green Valley on April 12, 2012, McSally said:\n\n\u201cAs we look at options to protect and secure Social Security and Medicare for the future, we need to protect the promises we have made to seniors that are at or near retirement. We need to be innovative about ways to sustain those programs for the future, because otherwise they will go bankrupt and they will Pac Man out the rest of the budget. So how do we do that? Some innovation and ideas are on the table, which are worth looking at, for people to keep some money in their pockets when it comes to Social Security.\u201d\n\nNote that all of these comments are from the 2012 race. It\u2019s unclear what her actual position is, given that at one point she refers to investing \u201cbenefits\u201d and at another point refers to investing \u201cpayments,\u201d which could refer to existing payroll taxes, but also to an add-on contribution, or Social Security trust fund assets. And \u201ckeep some money in their pockets\u201d is even vaguer \u2014 it could mean something as general as dealing with the rising cost of Social Security, as the baby boom generation retires, so that taxpayers don\u2019t get hit with higher general tax burdens.\n\nMcSally has come under fire in the local media for being vague on policy proposals during her current run, but one of her aides said her position on Social Security has not evolved since 2012.\n\n\u201cMartha\u2019s position has not changed. She has not and does not support privatizing Social Security, and the idea that she does was and is a deliberate and blatant attempt by [House Democratic Leader] Nancy Pelosi to distort Martha\u2019s position and scare voting seniors,\u201d said Kristen Douglas, deputy campaign manager, in a statement. \u201cMartha has consistently stated on the record that she is fully committed to ensuring promises made to seniors are kept.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, House Majority PAC hit McSally hard on the Social Security issue, with one portraying the former Air Force pilot as having a bad \u201crecipe\u201d for Social Security. With such a close race, it\u2019s possible these ads made a difference. This new ad is essentially a reprise of that line of attack, as shown in two ads below, which McSally at the time decried as false. One television station stopped running the House majority PAC ads after McSally\u2019s campaign said she has \u201cnever supported privatization of Social Security.\u201d\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume McSally advocates a concept similar to what Sen. John McCain (who is an Arizona Republican) once supported in 2005\u2014when it was proposed by then President George W. Bush. That plan would have been voluntary, for workers younger than 55, and would have permitted a diversion no more than a third of payroll taxes into investments other than Treasury bonds (which Social Security is now invested in). The system would still be government-managed; it would not be \u201cin the stock market\u201d or \u201cprivatized.\u201d\n\nThe House Majority PAC cites AARP because the advocacy group labels the private-account concept as \u201cprivatization.\u201d But the AARP document referenced by the ad actually does not say Social Security would be put in the stock market, as the ad claims.\n\nThe AARP report mainly tries to assess whether private accounts would yield better returns for workers and concludes that claims that many workers can expect better returns is an overstatement. \u201cThere is a fairly substantial probability that some cohorts of retirees would be worse off under a privatized Social Security system than they are under the current system,\u201d the report says. That\u2019s basically Stock Market 101: The performance of private accounts depends on the investments that are chosen. As we said, the Bush plan was voluntary, meaning workers could avoid the stock market entirely if they desired.\n\n\u201cPrivatization,\u201d incidentally, is one of those pejorative political labels used by opponents, akin to the bogus Republican claim that the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of health care. Just as the health-care law preserves the private health-care system, private accounts in Social Security would have been established as part of the current system.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, both The Fact Checker and FactCheck.org were highly critical of the Obama campaign for asserting that McCain supported a plan that would put Social Security in the stock market. FactCheck.org said the claim was \u201cdeceptive\u201d and The Fact Checker (then written by Michael Dobbs) said it was worthy of Three Pinocchios.\n\nYet here it is, six years later, and Democrats are still using the same old playbook of scaring seniors. Polling must show that such false attacks work.\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for House Majority PAC, defended the ad. \u201cMcSally has repeatedly expressed support for the idea of privatization, in multiple different ways and in many different venues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [the AARP] call the McSally plan privatization, which is what the ad claims.\u201d\n\nStone also pointed to an Associated Press fact check from 2008, which assessed political spin by both sides on Social Security and declared that the terms \u201cprivatization\u201d and \u201cpersonal accounts\u201d means \u201cthe same thing.\u201d The same fact check said of Democrats: \u201cThey speak darkly and flatly of Republicans plunging Social Security into privatization, subjecting the venerable system to the mercies of the market, and they ignore the voluntary and partial nature of the proposal.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nMcSally certainly could be more specific about her proposal. She has spoken of improving the solvency of Social Security by raising the retirement age, but only for younger workers, presumably in exchange for different investment options that she has only vaguely described. (Note: The private-account plan advanced by Bush would have require a massive bridge loan to finance the transition and at least initially would have done little to address solvency. See The Fact Checker\u2019s popular Guide to Social Security for more information.)\n\nBut, in the meantime, her position on private accounts is virtually irrelevant to the voters of her congressional district. Even if she is supporting a private-account plan similar to Bush\u2019s proposal, that\u2019s a dead letter.\n\nThe concept has absolutely no chance if a Democrat is in the White House. Bush could not even get a committee vote on his idea when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress; Peter Baker\u2019s magisterial history of the Bush administration, \u201cDays of Fire,\u201d makes it clear that the Republican Speaker of the House killed Bush\u2019s proposal. Even the most recent GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, backed away from the idea in 2012, saying the 2008 stock market collapse showed \u201cwe can\u2019t always count on positive returns from these investments.\u201d He instead supported private accounts as an add-on to Social Security, similar to the Gore concept of \u201cSocial Security Plus.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: This ad has rather flimsy evidence to justify the use of such politically-charged code words (\u201cprivatizes Social Security in the stock market\u201d). We might have given this ad Four Pinocchios if we had a better sense of McSally\u2019s policy proposals, but in any case it\u2019s time for Democrats to stop playing this particular scare-seniors card.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "A GOP candidate is attacked for supporting an alleged plan to put Social Security in the stock market", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A GOP candidate is attacked for supporting an alleged plan to put Social Security in the stock market", "title": "Democratic PAC plays an unwarranted \u2018scare seniors\u2019 card on Social Security", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/21/democratic-pac-plays-an-unwarranted-scare-seniors-card-on-social-security/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/10/31/Production/Digital/homepage/Images/Social_Security_COLA_08e1a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/21/democratic-pac-plays-an-unwarranted-scare-seniors-card-on-social-security/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "social security, social security privatization, privatize social security, democrats social security, martha mcsally, ron barber,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "social security, social security privatization, privatize social security, democrats social security, martha mcsally, ron barber,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2ea\"", "article_summary": "We found two other references to Social Security by McSally, which only added to the mystery of her position.\nJust as the health-care law preserves the private health-care system, private accounts in Social Security would have been established as part of the current system.\nAnd McSally supported a plan that the AARP says privatizes Social Security in the stock market.\nThe FactsFor evidence of McSally\u2019s position on Social Security, the ad cites a news article that appeared in the Arizona Daily Star on March 25, 2012.\nSee The Fact Checker\u2019s popular Guide to Social Security for more information.)"}
