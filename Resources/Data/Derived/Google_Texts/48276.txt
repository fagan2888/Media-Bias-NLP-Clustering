Life-saving care has been a passion for the Kanjee family for five years and this week Calgarians will have a chance to help support their cause.

Following the loss of five-year-old Sofia in 2009, the family created the Sofia Kanjee Sunshine Fund through the Albertan Children’s Hospital Foundation to raise dollars to support the critical care of kids in need.

It is a cause they remain incredibly passionate about today.

“It is to allow other families to take their children home from the pediatric intensive care unit,” said Sofia’s mom, Farah Kanjee.

“We had to walk away from that hospital without our daughter and we want other families to walk away with their children in their arms.”

More than $500,000 has already been raised through the fund to ensure sick and injured children receive the best care possible.

On Wednesday, the Kanjee family will proudly present the Sunshine Bubble Ball at Telus Spark, featuring live entertainment including The Tenors, a live auction, food and more.

The word “bubble” in the event’s name pays tribute to Sofia’s bubbly personality and one of her favourite activities.

“One of our favourite memories of Sofia was blowing bubbles in our back yard,” said Farah.

So far, more than 400 tickets have been sold for the Sunshine Bubble Ball, which will support life-saving care, but the Kanjees are hoping to hit the 500-ticket mark.
