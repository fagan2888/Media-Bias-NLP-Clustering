This is the fifth consecutive presidency (beginning with Reagan\u2019s) to end with one party in the White House and the other in control of Capitol Hill, but while the others generally ended with a whimper, President Obama, \u201cliberated\u201d from political constraints, is determined to go out with a bang.\n\nWhat will it take for Republicans in Congress to limit the president\u2019s executive overreach? Simply the will to use the constitutional tools they possess\u2013but unfortunately that will seems absent in the leadership of both the House and the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s promise to avoid a government shutdown means, in practice, that President Obama will get anything for which he\u2019s willing to threaten a veto. This, in and of itself, amounts to a de facto expansion of executive power\u2013not an encouraging beginning.\n\nIt also creates an absurd divide between authority and responsibility, suggesting that a Congress that passes appropriations bills the president vetoes is somehow the party at fault for the \u201cshutdown\u201d that results. It was one thing for Congress to take the blame when disagreements between the Republican House and Democratic Senate prevented spending bills from getting to the president\u2019s desk. Now Sen. McConnell\u2019s folly has made congressional Republicans responsible for keeping the government funded even after they have passed every necessary bill, though they have no more power to control the president\u2019s veto pen now than they had before the midterm election.\n\nMeanwhile, in the House, Speaker John Boehner\u2019s slow-motion lawsuit continues to threaten President Obama with a stern warning at some indefinite point in the future\u2013possibly even before his term expires. The good news is that, after an exhaustive (and, no doubt, exhausting) search, he was able to find someone to take the lawsuit: celebrity law school professor Jonathan Turley, of course.\n\nThere are surely a number of reasons for Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McConnell\u2019s weak responses to President Obama\u2019s aggressive use of executive power. Perhaps they continue to defer to the conventional wisdom that congressional Republicans always lose confrontations with Democratic presidents, despite the very different results from the 2013 Obamacare \u201cshutdown.\u201d\n\nPerhaps they share the Republican Party\u2019s recent preference for a muscular executive and are loathe to undercut powers they hope will be in more friendly hands two years from now.\n\nBut most of all, perhaps they, along with the rest of our bipartisan ruling class, have lost all meaningful contact with the first principle of our government: that officeholders are only the \u201cservant\u201d and \u201cdeputy\u201d of the people, bound by their constitutionally-expressed will. This means that all officeholders have a duty, reinforced by the oath of office they take, to challenge the unconstitutional acts of others.\n\nThere are surely a number of reasons for Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McConnell\u2019s weak responses to President Obama\u2019s aggressive use of executive power. The founders recognized that this would be politically difficult. As Alexander Hamilton suggests in Federalist 78, an officeholder insecure in his position will generally find it expedient to ignore the unconstitutional acts of other leaders. Thus, the principal argument in the essay, a defense of the lifetime tenure of judges, is grounded in the provision\u2019s tendency to prop up a weak judiciary and enable it to accomplish its constitutional responsibility: an \u201cinflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution, and of individuals. . . .\u201d\n\nIn our day, however, the lifetime tenure of judges has not shielded the court from political influence. For some judges, it is a matter of ideology: Progressives deny the reality of a Constitution fixed in meaning by those who adopted it (i.e. the people) and binding upon all American officeholders. They, therefore, manipulate the law and the Constitution to suit the cause of History, as they understand it.\n\nFor other judges, it is a matter of expediency. When Chief Justice John Roberts decided the Obamacare individual mandate was actually a tax, he spared himself and his court a good deal of elite disapproval, while conniving at the unconstitutional heart of the program. He also signaled to the Obama Administration that it could be as imprecise in its execution of the law as it had (intentionally) been in its drafting. The Boehner lawsuit over the Administration\u2019s delays in implementing Obamacare, then, doesn\u2019t just represent a second failure to confront the president\u2019s lawlessness directly, but builds upon the first: can the federal courts really hold the Administration accountable for turning a \u201c2014\u201d into a \u201c2015,\u201d when the highest court in the land has turned a mandate into a tax?\n\nAn independent judiciary, Hamilton argues in Federalist 78, should be the branch \u201cleast dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them.\u201d However it is crucial to note that this claim depends upon the precondition that \u201cthe different departments of power . . . are separated from each other.\u201d In the next paragraph, he lays out the same precondition two more times:\n\nIt equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive. For I agree, that \u201cthere is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\u201d And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, [it] would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments. . . . [emphasis added]\n\nOnly in a political system in which the branches of government are truly separate from each other is the judiciary the least dangerous branch. If all three branches of government were to employ their departmental powers in a common effort, that enterprise might take on a political form as diverse as there are causal combinations between legislative will, executive force, and judicial judgment\u2013far beyond the boundaries of the Constitution. In such a case, the department that holds the power to judge\u2013employing the judicial word without the constraints of a fundamental law\u2013could at times direct and at other times empower those departments holding the sword (executive) and the purse (legislative).\n\nWhat did the founders fear from an unhealthy collaboration between the three branches of government? That all the branches of government would become dangerous. To what or to whom? The great majority of Hamilton and Madison\u2019s fifty-six uses of the word \u201cdangerous\u201d in The Federalist appear in the context of the threat that power misconstrued and/or misapplied poses to political liberty.\n\nProgressivism has encouraged just such a danger, not only in its subordination of individual liberty to its expansive, paternalistic social agenda, but in undermining the boundaries between the three branches of the federal government and denying the reality of fixed constitutional limits to federal governmental power.\n\nThe new Congress can take the first steps to mitigate this danger. It is critical that the House lead the budget process as constitutionally intended\u2013as the body tasked with proposing specific appropriations for specific purposes, not as a hostage to presidential veto threats and \u201cshutdown\u201d and \u201cdefault\u201d deadlines. The Senate, among other things, must vet the president\u2019s judicial nominees with care, measuring them against their willingness to regard the Constitution as it is \u201cin fact . . . a fundamental law,\u201d and their ability to judge accordingly.\n\nWould-be presidential candidates can do their part, by making their own fealty to the Constitution clear and laying out a governing vision and agenda consistent with that. So too the Roberts Court, which can lead the federal courts back to their role as \u201cthe bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments\u201d\u2013and executive ones.\n\nOf course, the most important set of actors in returning to constitutional governance is the American people. Hamilton\u2019s words remind us that we, too, are to be guardians of the rule of law: \u201cUntil the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form [of the Constitution], it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually . . .\u201d This is our responsibility, but also our greatest security\u2013against the abuses of our leaders . . . or the majority.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 05 Jan 2015 07:38:44 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "What will it take for Republicans in Congress to limit the president's executive overreach?
