The movie adaptation of \u201cInto the Woods\u201d is a worthy trip into the fairy-tale land from masterminds Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, who brought the musical to the stage in 1987. With cinematic panache and Rob Marshall at the helm, the screen version gets it right and gets it dark \u2014 not as dark as on stage, perhaps, but the PG rating and feared Disney-fication haven\u2019t hurt the tone one bit.\n\n'Into the Woods'\n\nRatings explained Starring: Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine. Rating: PG for thematic elements, fantasy action and peril, and some suggestive material.\n\nMr. Marshall, the director behind the Oscar-winning musical \u201cChicago\u201d and the less successful \u201cNine,\u201d has collaborated with Sondheim and Lapine to re-create their warped world with a lot of help from an all-star cast, led by the do-no-wrong grand dame of Hollywood, Meryl Streep. She plays the Witch who sets the fairy-tale action in motion and manipulates the familiar players \u2014 Cinderella, Rapunzel and their princes, Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk \u2014 and a Baker and his Wife who have been cursed to be childless.\n\nMs. Streep has sung on screen before (notably in \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d), and here she handles the odd cadences and boomerang emotions of Sondheim compositions with ease, gleefully hamming it up through gutsy crone makeup.\n\nShe bursts into the Baker\u2019s shop to explain how she had cursed his father for stealing from her garden and that the curse was passed to his son. But if he and his wife (befuddled James Corden and the luminous Emily Blunt) fetch a few items within three midnights, the Witch can break the spell.\n\nAh, those items (hint, hint): a cow as white as snow, hair as yellow as corn, a slipper as pure as gold, a cape as red as blood \u2026 you get the idea? Oh, and Jack\u2019s beans show up, too, in a most convenient way.\n\nThe fairy tales proceed in familiar fashion as the story begins, although from the start we see deviations from the stage musical. The most notable is the absence of The Narrator. Here, Mr. Corden\u2019s Baker does voiceover narration, which is nicely integrated into the story.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that the Wolf (Johnny Depp, in what amounts to a cameo) is less sexual predator and more interested in a meal in his cinematic encounter with Red Riding Hood, but her peril is no less implicit. More disturbing to my mind is that the volume seems to be at mind-numbing levels whenever Red (Lilla Crawford, a recent \u201cAnnie\u201d on Broadway) is singing.\n\nWe also meet \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d star Anna Kendrick as a reluctant Cinderella and MacKenzie Mauzy as the yearning Rapunzel, but it\u2019s the preening princes played by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen who make a big impression and provide a dose of much-appreciated humor. Their duet \u201cAgony\u201d is a hoot, and Mr. Pine, far from the heroic Captain Kirk he\u2019s best known for, delivers one of the film\u2019s funniest lines when his royal integrity is questioned.\n\n\u201cI was raised to be charming, not sincere,\u201d he replies.\n\nThe movie takes a turn as all participants find themselves in the woods. There\u2019s a giant on the loose, thanks to Jack (David Huttlestone, Gavroche in \u201cLes Miserables\u201d), and some loved ones are separated and new alliances are formed.\n\nThe special effects are minimal and often a source of humor. The Witch comes and goes quickly, often trailing a cloud of dust and the final note of a one-liner. Even the giant seems to be more a trick of perspective than CGI, the better to appreciate the practical magic of a Sondheim song such as \u201cYour Fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d and \u201cno one is alone\u201d are the themes that resonate as some characters meet their fates in awful and laughable ways. When Cinderella\u2019s evil stepmother (the marvelous Christine Baranski) wields a sharp object, it\u2019s not pretty, but the violence is often cartoonish here and elsewhere.\n\nThe havoc wreaked by the Witch, some of it predicated on a twisted sense of motherly love, comes back to bite her, but not before Ms. Streep\u2019s stunning delivery of the \u201cLast Midnight.\u201d Parent-child, husband-wife relationships are thrown into life-altering upheaval, and characters are lost and others unexpectedly entwined.\n\nThe fairy tales we grew up with are, after all, the stuff of nightmares until the welcome arrival of happily ever afters. \u201cInto the Woods\u201d reminds us that not all endings are quite so tidy.\n\n\u201cInto the Woods\u201d opens Christmas Day.\n\nSharon Eberson: seberson@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1960.
