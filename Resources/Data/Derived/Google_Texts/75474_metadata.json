Economists credit the Affordable Care Act in part, as well as other reforms. And according to new projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the trend could continue.\n\nIn in its annual 25-year forecast of the federal budget, the CBO projected growth of federal spending on healthcare programs will continue to slow at a healthy rate over the next 25 years.\n\nIn a startling but continuing reversal of projection, the CBO said Tuesday that the federal government would spend about $US250 billion less on major federal healthcare programs than it had forecast in 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s new projections say federal spending on major healthcare programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and federal subsidies for people buying insurance on the new Obamacare-established exchanges \u2014 will rise from about 4.9% of GDP this year to about 7.5% in 2035. The latter number is 2.2 percentage points lower than the CBO projected five years ago.\n\nMedicare, in particular, is on an even better path. In 2006, the trustees who monitor the Medicare and Social Security programs said the trust fund that pays hospital bills would be broke by 2018. Now, that trust fund is expected to be solvent until at least 2030, according to the CBO. Overall, Medicare expenditures in 2035 are 2.6 percentage points of GDP lower than the office projected in 2009. Projected Medicare spending is down 35% from five years ago.\n\nPeter Orszag, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Business Insider it\u2019s the equivalent of the \u201cbiggest fiscal development\u201d in more than three decades.\n\n\u201cHealth care spending has always been the core fiscal problem facing the United States,\u201d Orszag said. \u201cIf we had passed legislation that knocked down long-term Medicare spending projections by 35% it would easily qualify as the biggest fiscal development since the early 1980s \u2014 and the fact that the changes are occurring for multiple reasons doesn\u2019t alter that conclusion.\u201d\n\nFrom the Brookings Institute, here are two charts where you can see the healthcare and Medicare spending slowdown in action:\n\nBrookings Institute\n\nBrookings Institute\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the continued healthcare slowdown? The CBO attributed it to many different causes, including slower overall projected economic growth and lower-than-projected interest rates in the future. But the CBO also suggested for the first time that the federal government may be able to keep growth costs in line with overall inflation, based on requirements set in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOther evidence suggests that hospitals and other providers may be able to achieve significant productivity gains or to restrain the growth of their costs in some other way,\u201d the CBO report read.\n\nHere\u2019s the big caveat: Though the healthcare spending growth decline is expected to continue, it doesn\u2019t mean the federal government is out of the woods. The \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of Baby Boomers will soon begin to retire, adding to an already ageing population that will add more to the Medicare rolls and make healthcare spending the federal government\u2019s biggest expense by about 2030.\n\nCongressional Budget Office\n\nOverall, the CBO says federal debt is still on an unsustainable path, and projects it to reach 102% of GDP by 2039. The primary reason for that will be spending on the healthcare programs and Social Security, which are still projected to grow to about 14% of GDP together by 2039.\n\nOrszag, though, thinks the projections might still be a little too pessimistic, despite the sudden stroke of optimism in the CBO report. Medicare spending is up about 1.2% this fiscal year, significantly lower than projections.\n\n\u201cIf that continues,\u201d Orszag said, \u201cthe fiscal picture looks even brighter.\u201d\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=5; cycle=1", "publisher": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The primary driver of future projected debt and...", "application-name": "Business Insider Australia", "author": "Brett LoGiurato", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310_wide.png", "twitter": {"description": "The primary driver of future projected debt and...", "title": "The 'Biggest Fiscal Development' Of The Last Three Decades Is The Stunning Slow Down In Health Care Spending", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/health-care-spending-growth-slow-2014-7", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/535963aaeab8ea100c15349a/image.jpg", "site": "@BIAUS", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_70.png", "robots": "noarchive", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310.png", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The primary driver of future projected debt and...", "title": "The 'Biggest Fiscal Development' Of The Last Three Decades Is The Stunning Slow Down In Health Care Spending", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/health-care-spending-growth-slow-2014-7", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/535963aaeab8ea100c15349a-640/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_144.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-17T01:50:22+10:00"}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf659\"", "article_summary": "But over the last four years, healthcare spending has grown at a historically slow rate.\nProjected Medicare spending is down 35% from five years ago.\nThe latter number is 2.2 percentage points lower than the CBO projected five years ago.\nIn in its annual 25-year forecast of the federal budget, the CBO projected growth of federal spending on healthcare programs will continue to slow at a healthy rate over the next 25 years.\nHere\u2019s the big caveat: Though the healthcare spending growth decline is expected to continue, it doesn\u2019t mean the federal government is out of the woods."}
