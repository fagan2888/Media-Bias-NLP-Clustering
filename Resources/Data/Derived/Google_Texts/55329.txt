Former Gov. Howard Dean (D-VT) argued that Sen. Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) recent attempt to distance himself from the Affordable Care Act was “revisionism” on Schumer’s part, but that the bill and the process by which it was passed were flawed on Saturday’s “Up” on MSNBC.

“The process was the problem and the bill was the problem” he stated. And, “The way this was handled, into the White House went the insurance companies, the lawyers, the doctors, the hospitals, the drug companies. Everyone got their deal, incredibly publicly. You can’t do that, especially if you’re the president of change.”

Regarding Schumer’s comments, Dean said, “this is revisionism. The fact of the matter was he was leading the charge. It got screwed up in [Sen. Max] Baucus’ (D-MT) committee, it was basically written by the insurance companies. And we have this bill now and it’s going to work, but it was a really bad way to go about it.”
