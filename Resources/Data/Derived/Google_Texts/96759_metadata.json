I love my doctors. I don\u2019t want to change,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s been a Sutter patient since her children were born two decades ago.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sutter Health announced that state officials had given it the green light to market its own HMO product, Sutter Health Plus, in Sonoma County.\n\nThe move allows Sutter to develop locally a more integrated managed care model like that offered by Kaiser Permanente. It could also bring a more affordable health plan option to patients using the local Sutter Health system, according to insurance experts.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it: They\u2019re going after Kaiser market share,\u201d said Vic McKnight, a broker and principal at the Petaluma office of EPIC Insurance Brokers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of competition in the health insurance market,\u201d McKnight said, adding that Sutter Health Plus could be an alternative for local residents who are shopping for the lowest-cost plan.\n\nHe said people like Canelis, whose entire roster of physicians is affiliated with Sutter Health, are ideal candidates for the new HMO.\n\nOne of the largest health care providers in Sonoma County and California, Sutter Health first launched its own health plan in January 2014. Last fall, Sutter Health filed a \u201cnotice of material modification\u201d with the state Department of Managed Health Care to sell the HMO plan in Sonoma County. The health plan was previously available in a multicounty region taking in much of the Central Valley.\n\nSutter Health Plus CEO Steve Nolte said Sutter officials came to the conclusion three years ago that having an in-house insurance product would allow the nonprofit health care provider to better adapt to the rapidly changing health care landscape under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe believe that health care is becoming more confusing, and we believe that we have the ability to make it less confusing,\u201d Nolte said, adding that selling its own HMO plan allows Sutter to have a direct line of communication with patients to better manage their health care.\n\nThe health care industry, he said, is changing from a \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d model to one that is more consumer-driven, centered around the health care needs of the patient. It is a model that is increasingly focused on health care outcomes.\n\nSelling its own HMO products \u201cplaces us directly in the pathway of the voice of the customer. Hearing it, we get an unfiltered view of what they\u2019re thinking \u2026 how their health care will be paid for and delivered.\u201d\n\nState approval was given last Friday, and Sutter Health Plus has begun to reach out to insurance brokers, agents, consultants and any other professional authorized to give health insurance advice. Nolte said Sutter will conduct a \u201cmodest\u201d branding campaign to promote the new HMO products, but that most of the promotion will take place through insurance brokers, agents and consultants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nikki Canelis of Cazadero learned two important things during her visit Tuesday", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Officials have cleared the way for Sutter Health to offer its HMO in Sonoma County, raising the possibility of a more affordable health plan option for patients.", "title": "California OKs Sutter Health HMO for Sonoma County", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/3606867-181/state-oks-sutter-health-hmo", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=1CQzKcQdsU_VeLMxM2SK6M$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYupnzEtIVevXy6Nv8izDCQiWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-03-03T10:01:02-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefe1\"", "article_summary": "One of the largest health care providers in Sonoma County and California, Sutter Health first launched its own health plan in January 2014.\nOn Tuesday, Sutter Health announced that state officials had given it the green light to market its own HMO product, Sutter Health Plus, in Sonoma County.\nThe health care industry, he said, is changing from a \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d model to one that is more consumer-driven, centered around the health care needs of the patient.\nLast fall, Sutter Health filed a \u201cnotice of material modification\u201d with the state Department of Managed Health Care to sell the HMO plan in Sonoma County.\nIt could also bring a more affordable health plan option to patients using the local Sutter Health system, according to insurance experts."}
