It will reopen Aug. 1 as UnityPoint Clinic-Women\u2019s Health.\n\nAlso opening Aug. 1, adjacent to the women\u2019s health clinic, will be UnityPoint Clinic-Family Medicine.\n\nThe cost of the project is about $500,000, including the acquisition of McMahon\u2019s practice, according to Brandon. He said the building is ideally suited for medical practices, both in terms of the facility and its location.\n\n\u201cWith the start of our Peosta clinic, we\u2019ve identified the western part of Dubuque to be a very attractive area because of a lack of Finley- related medical services, and it is a high -growth population area for Dubuque County,\u201d he said.\n\nMcMahon established Women\u2019s Wellness Center in May 2004.\n\n\u201cWe grew it from the grass-roots to 12,000 patients,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a gift to be able to be involved in the lives of so many patients and their families.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said, changes in health care, including the federal Affordable Care Act and Iowa\u2019s traditionally poor federal reimbursement rates, have impacted how she delivers care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become more of a challenge to provide the one-on-one attention that people deserve,\u201d she said.\n\nMcMahon will leave the women\u2019s wellness practice with its sale.\n\nBrandon said other current staff would be approached as Finley seeks employees for the women\u2019s clinic when it reopens. The clinic will be staffed by two nurse practitioners, including Gretchen Hong, and six other employees.\n\nThe adjacent family medicine clinic will be staffed by Dr. Kenneth Martin, a physician currently in family practice at UnityPoint Health-Trinity in the Quad Cities. Brandon said Finley will add a second provider at the family medicine clinic, along with six additional staff members.\n\nBoth clinics will include exam rooms and radiology services, as well as laboratory services.\n\n\u201cWe look at this as benefiting the community,\u201d Brandon said.\n\nFinley will open two urgent-care clinics later this year in Dubuque \u2014 at Asbury and Kennedy roads on Aug. 1 and in Babka Wellness Center, 1550 University Ave., on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident that patient demand for access to health care will be greatly enhanced,\u201d Brandon said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "THonline.com", "description": "UnityPoint Health-Finley Hospital will purchase Women\u2019s Wellness Center in Dubuque and open a pair of clinics at the site this summer.", "title": "Finley to purchase Dubuque wellness center, open 2 clinics", "url": "http://www.thonline.com/news/tri-state/article_e4fd7fa4-7fb8-5d17-b28d-5326cf099897.html", "image": "http://www.thmedia.co/wp-content/uploads/THMediaLogo.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@telegraphherald", "card": "summary"}, "description": "UnityPoint Health-Finley Hospital will purchase Women\u2019s Wellness Center in Dubuque and open a pair of clinics at the site this summer.", "fb": {"admins": 692560310781758, "app_id": 692560310781758}, "__sync_contentCategory": "paid", "keywords": "dubuque,unitypoint health-finley hospital,tri-state,articles,business", "google-site-verification": "GYcRZWQq2QYfeT7KNjDwGTx3YMtA2kGnC3W1wJOHKHY", "news_keywords": "dubuque,unitypoint health-finley hospital,tri-state,articles,business"}, "article_summary": "UnityPoint Health-Finley Hospital will purchase Women\u2019s Wellness Center in Dubuque and open a pair of clinics at the site this summer.\nFinley will open two urgent-care clinics later this year in Dubuque \u2014 at Asbury and Kennedy roads on Aug. 1 and in Babka Wellness Center, 1550 University Ave., on Oct. 1.\nMcMahon established Women\u2019s Wellness Center in May 2004.\nMcMahon will leave the women\u2019s wellness practice with its sale.\nBrandon said other current staff would be approached as Finley seeks employees for the women\u2019s clinic when it reopens."}
