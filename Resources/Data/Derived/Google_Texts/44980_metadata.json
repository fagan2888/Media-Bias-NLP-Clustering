Although Biden said he \"accepts\" the Catholic Church's doctrine on abortion, he refused to \"impose it on others.\"\n\nYet, despite Wehby\u2019s comments, Republican senators such as Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss and Richard Burr have all contributed to Wehby\u2019s campaign. Meanwhile, 40 percent of Monica Wehby\u2019s itemized contributions have come from out-of-state, suggesting conservatives in her own state are not too enthralled with her policy stances. To make a comparison, pro-abortion Wendy Davis has received millions of dollars in donations for her gubernatorial campaign in Texas, but a majority of those funds have come from liberal outside sources such as New York and California.\n\nWehby is certainly an impressive candidate. I mean, she\u2019s a pediatric surgeon who performs brain surgeries and has come up with her own alternative to Obamacare. And her victory in the GOP Senate primary polls proves she's a winnable candidate. But, Conger\u2019s success story is just as worthy of an endorsement. The Harvard Law graduate worked his way through law school after being abandoned by his mother and enduring periods of homelessness. More importantly, however, he\u2019s right on the issue of life.\n\nOregon Right to Life has recognized this and is gladly endorsing Conger. Gayle Atteberry, the executive director of Oregon Right to Life, made that even clearer in a special message for the GOP establishment:\n\nI have a simple request: Stay out of our state, and let us choose the best person to represent our values to be on the ballot this November.\n\nGranted, if Wehby is nominated by her party, she would be a better choice than Democrat Jeff Merkley, who has a 100 percent rating on abortion from both NARAL and Planned Parenthood. But, it\u2019s clear Conger is the candidate who would fight hardest for the unborn.\n\nOregon needs someone who will fight for ALL Oregonians \u2013 including those in the womb.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is the Beltway GOP establishment abandoning the pro-life side in Oregon? .05/26/2016 19:11:34PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Is the Beltway GOP establishment abandoning the pro-life side in Oregon?", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Beltway GOP Supporting Pro-Choice Over Pro-Life Candidate in Oregon", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/03/25/gop-supports-prochoice-over-prolife-candidate-in-oregon-n1814234", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/3/25/0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Is the Beltway GOP establishment abandoning the pro-life side in Oregon?", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Beltway GOP Supporting Pro-Choice Over Pro-Life Candidate in Oregon", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/03/25/gop-supports-prochoice-over-prolife-candidate-in-oregon-n1814234", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/3/25/0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Beltway GOP Supporting Pro-Choice Over Pro-Life Candidate in Oregon, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "And her victory in the GOP Senate primary polls proves she's a winnable candidate.\nBut, it\u2019s clear Conger is the candidate who would fight hardest for the unborn.\nThis is no different than the argument Vice President Joe Biden used in the vice presidential debate against Paul Ryan in 2012.\nOregon Right to Life has recognized this and is gladly endorsing Conger.\nWehby has insisted she is \u201cpersonally pro-life,\u201d but:\u201cI believe this is a personal decision between a woman and her family, not a woman and the federal government,\u201d Wehby said."}
