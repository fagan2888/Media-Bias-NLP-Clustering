Get F\u00fchrerious!\u201d imposed over photographs of the former dictator. The use of one of history\u2019s most notorious villains in such a lighthearted manner is one of a plethora of issues that set off alarms for the historian Gavriel D. Rosenfeld in his new book, Hi Hitler: How the Nazi Past is Being Normalized in Contemporary Culture.\n\nRosenfeld argues that in three major areas\u2014academia, politics, and popular culture\u2014the Nazis, Hitler, and the Holocaust have undergone a major process of normalization. This means that in our collective memory, that event and its perpetrators are less different, less of an abnormality in history, than previously agreed upon.\n\nAt first, Rosenfeld\u2019s thesis seems to a merit a high dose of skepticism. While memes used by teens may treat the image of Hitler lightheartedly and while anti-Semitism has reared its head again in Europe, to the average person the Holocaust is still synonymous with the nadir of human depravity in the 20th century and its denial more associated with loons like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nAnd yet, on page after page, referencing books, speeches, movies, and essays, Rosenfeld inexorably builds a thoroughly convincing case that something has shifted in both academia and in politics\u2014that the Holocaust\u2019s heretofore unquestioned status as the great sin of the 20th century (and by association, the Nazis\u2019 status as the century\u2019s greatest villains) is now far from a consensus.\n\nIn the scholarly world and in the global sphere of politics, the views of the Holocaust and the Nazis have changed as people have modified their views on World War II, genocide, and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the last two decades have witnessed a dramatic shift in how World War II is perceived and portrayed. Once unironically depicted as \u201cthe good war\u201d in which the Allied powers triumphed over the evil Axis powers, the war now has a far murkier reputation.\n\nPart of that shift occurred in the scholarly world. Niall Ferguson\u2019s The War of the World, Giles MacDonogh\u2019s After the Reich: The Brutal History of the Allied Occupation, Timothy Snyder\u2019s Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, Max Hasting\u2019s All Hell Let Loose, Michael Bess\u2019s Choices Under Fire: Moral Dimensions of World War II, Jacques Pauwel\u2019s The Myth of the Good War: America in the Second World War, Patrick Buchanan\u2019s Churchill, Hitler, and \u2018The Unnecessary War,\u2019 and Nicholson Baker\u2019s Human Smoke\u2014these are just some of the major books, some better received than others, that have challenged the notion of the \u201cgood war.\u201d\n\nFor some of these authors, the decision by the U.S. and Great Britain to team up with the Soviet Union posed a far greater disaster for humanity than did the Nazis. For others, like Buchanan, writing in the shadow of the Iraq War, World War II\u2019s legacy was one of intervention and a cult of Churchill. Others sought to show how the Allies\u2019 methods of war were similar in brutality to the Axis. And they have sought to undermine Allied moral standing by pointing out that in the U.S. there were also serious racial issues of segregation, Jim Crow, Native American reservations, Japanese internment camps, and in the USSR, the starving of kulaks by Stalin.\n\nWhatever the reason, efforts to chip away at \u201cthe good war\u2019s\u201d reputation also, in Rosenfeld\u2019s eye, had the effect of somewhat normalizing the Nazis. If the Allies were not much better, the reasoning goes, then how bad really were the Nazis?\n\nThen there are the Germans themselves. Rosenfeld cites numerous examples in the spheres of academia, politics, and popular culture wherein Germans shed the role of ashamed citizens and now count themselves as victims of the Nazi regime and of the Soviet \u201cliberation.\u201d\n\nThe most fascinating part of the text is when Rosenfeld dives into how and why the Holocaust has lost the illustrious label of being unique, of being the genocide, and the very \u201capex of evil.\u201d\n\nOne of the more significant shifts occurred when the Soviet Union disintegrated. Eastern European countries and their leaders, free from the yoke of Moscow, were eager to promote their narrative as double victims: of both the Nazis and the Soviets. In doing so, they not only glossed over their population\u2019s complicity in Nazi crimes but also made what the Nazis did to the Jews less\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014exceptional.\n\nOne of the more significant books to also focused on the large-scale violence in Eastern Europe that affected more than just the Jews was Timothy Snyder\u2019s Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. Snyder, according to Rosenfeld, subsumes the Holocaust within violence perpetrated by Nazis and Soviets of that period. For Snyder, Rosenfeld writes, \u201cIt was not the Nazis\u2019 murder of six million Jews, but the murder of fourteen million people in the bloodlands that actually represented the \u2018central event\u2019 of \u2018European history.\u2019\u201d Not only was Hitler being likened to another leader, but it was now questionable whether he was worse.\n\nThe Holocaust shed some of its \u201cuniqueness\u201d thanks to the development of genocide studies, which ironically probably owes its genesis to the Holocaust itself. Comparisons ended up being drawn, for example, between the history of the Native Americans and the Holocaust. According to Rosenfeld, the historian David Stannard has \u201cargued that the genocide of Native Americans exceeded or matched that of the Holocaust both in the extent of the killing and the intent behind it.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Samantha Power, now the U.S. ambassador to the UN, wrote a 1999 essay titled, \u201cTo Suffer by Comparison.\u201d In it Power addresses the issue of using the Holocaust to draw attention to genocides happening in the world today. \u201cOnce the Holocaust has become the frame through which we view other killings it can too easily become a ceiling beneath which all else goes,\u201d she writes. \u201cOnce we realize today\u2019s crimes are not exactly \u2018like\u2019 those of the Holocaust, we all too quickly soothe ourselves with the further notion that \u2018the situation is not so bad after all.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe giant elephant in the room, of course, is the relationship between the Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel. To some, like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \u201cif the State of Israel had been established in time, the Holocaust would not have taken place.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum there is Holocaust-denier David Irving\u2019s famous counterfactual claim: \u201cWithout Hitler, the State of Israel probably would not exist today, so to that extent he was probably the Jews\u2019 greatest friend.\u201d Others have directly linked the \u201cuniqueness\u201d of the Holocaust with Zionism, including Norman Finkelstein who, notes Rosenfeld, claimed that \u201cunique suffering confers unique entitlement.\u201d Regardless of whether or not one thinks it\u2019s justified to invoke the Holocaust with regard to Israeli foreign policy, Israel\u2019s polarizing position has weighed on the Holocaust\u2019s legacy.\n\nPolitical shifts, whether inspired by the Iraq War, post-Communist Eastern Europe, or the issue of Israel, have all changed the environment in which World War II and the singularity of the Nazis are viewed. So, too, has the enduring issue of modern genocide. What Rosenfeld makes clear is that the traditional moral frame through which World War II was viewed is in some ways gone.\n\nRosenfeld makes a convincing case that over more than half a century our views on the Holocaust and the Nazis have altered in the direction of complexity. What he has failed to do, however, is to convince us the image of Hitler has somehow softened because of its ubiquity in popular culture. \u201cThe inflated use of the Nazi legacy for tendentious purposes threatens to drain it of much of its historical distinctiveness and turn it into an empty signifier,\u201d he writes.
