The current proposal would raise the $23,660 annual salary (or $455 weekly) limit for white collar workers, or those working executive, administrative or professional jobs, eligible for overtime.\n\nThe proposal is currently being reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a division of the federal government responsible for examining agency regulations.\n\nAccording to the federal government\u2019s own estimates, the new rule would make more than 5 million more employees eligible for over-time pay, drastically increasing the costs for small business owners who often expect young, salaried employees to put in long hours at low pay.\n\nThe Obama Administration, which undertook efforts to \u201cmodernize and streamline\u201d existing overtime regulations in March 2014, maintains that the proposal will result in an increase employment and reduce overwork \u201cby incentivizing employers\u201d to hire more employees rather than require existing employees to work longer hours, thereby reducing involuntary unemployment.\n\nBut business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, estimate that the new rules will have a crippling effect on small businesses.\n\nA recent report released by the National Retail Federation estimates that that overtime could potentially cost the retail and restaurant industry between $5 and 9.5 billion under the proposed changes and that that employers could spend as much as $874 million (above and beyond overtime pay) just to update payroll systems, convert salaried employees to hourly, and track hours. But the NRF report also notes that most employers will set up mechanisms to make sure that employees do not work more than 40 hours per week, so as to avoid paying overtime to salaried employees earning between $23,660 (the current threshold) and $50,440. NRF also predicts that employers will absorb the costs by cutting benefits and bonuses.\n\nHeritage Foundation labor policy analyst James Sherk says that the new rule fails to take into account the increasing mobility of white collar workers.\n\n\u201cWorkers eligible for overtime cannot get paid for their results and productivity. Their employer must log their hours and pay for time on the job,\u201d wrote Sherk. \u201cWhile this presents few difficulties for workers in a fixed workplace (like a store), it makes much less sense for professional employees who can work anywhere. Today millions of salaried employees check their work e-mail on their smartphones, or telework from home.\n\n\u201cIt would effectively turn millions of salaried employees into hourly workers.\u201d\n\nWriting for NewsWorks.org, a mid-Atlantic nonprofit news website, Rosemary McDonough, a fundraising consultant, argues that the new policy will \u201ccreate a labor force of clockwatchers\u201d and wonders about the future of \u201cthe work ethos of salaried employees who are suddenly \u2018on the clock.\u2019\u201d\n\nNew England reaction\n\nIn Massachusetts, the Obama administration\u2019s overtime proposal has broad support among the state\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators, Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey. Warren this week released a lengthy report \u201chighlighting public comments from workers and their families in all 50 states in support of the proposed new federal overtime rule.\u201d\n\nWarren took to social media to promote her report:\n\nToo often, lawyers & lobbyists bury the voices of American workers. It\u2019s time to listen to workers who need a fighting chance. #overdueOT \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) May 2, 2016\n\nWarren also claims that employers are exploiting a loophole in labor laws \u2014 specifically by classifying various workers as \u2018managers\u2019 in order to \u201cavoid paying many salaried workers the overtime they deserved and were legally entitled to.\u201d\n\nYet in his testimony to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, White Castle\u2019s vice president of government and shareholder relations told members that the proposed changes could inflict serious harm, especially in urban areas.\n\nJamie Richardson, who has been with the popular fast-food chain for eight years, spoke on behalf of the National Council of Chain Restaurants. Richardson said the new rule could further drive down youth employment.\n\n\u201cChain restaurants operate in a uniquely competitive environment with slim profit margins, and would presumably take measures to mitigate the increased labor costs associated with overtime pay when salaried managerial employees who are currently classified as exempt are reclassified to \u2018hourly\u2019 status,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nThe Automotive Wholesalers Association of New England also opposes the new regulation. \u201cThe administrative burdens from this proposed regulation would add yet another headache to small businesses already taxed plenty by the Affordable Care Act, new IRS regulations, and much more,\u201d the AWANE claimed in a statement.\n\nIn April, New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte wrote to administration officials expressing her concern about the impact of the proposed rule on small businesses and nonprofit organizations. Last year, Ayotte teamed up with Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to offer an alternative. Dubbed the Family Friendly and Workplace Flexibility Act, the Granite State Republican\u2019s proposal would offer workers the freedom to arrange for \u201cflex-hours\u201d or \u201ccomp time\u201d with employers for overtime work, instead of monetary compensation, if they so choose.\n\nThe authors of the proposal note that the bill gives private sector workers the same flexibility enjoyed by those working in the public sector.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would enable employees to work with their employers to enter into voluntary agreements that would allow greater flexibility for workers who are looking to better balance their work-life demands,\u201d Ayotte said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe proposal, however, is currently languishing in committee. Ayotte, currently engaged in a heated challenge from both Democratic New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan and former Republican state Sen. Jim Rubens, has yet to officially weigh in on whether she opposes the new overtime proposal being touted by the Obama administration.\n\nImminent changes\n\nOnce the current administrative review is complete, a final draft will be published in the Federal Register but can be challenged by lawmakers under the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives Congress the right to review new federal regulations issued by government agencies. Federal lawmakers have 60 legislative days to kill the rule \u2014 but the president can veto the action if the resolution fails to garner at least two-thirds support from both Houses.\n\nA different approach to at least temporarily halt the rule from being enacted is currently in the works. Last month Republicans introduced legislation intended to slow down the process. Dubbed the Protecting the Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act, the proposal calls for studying in greater detail the rule change\u2019s potentially harmful effects.\n\nAlready, about 350 local and national organization representing small and large businesses, including nonprofits, schools and others like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Massachusetts Lodging Association and the Retailers Association of Massachusetts signed on to a statement backing the proposal.\n\nThe statement points out that despite the Department of Labor\u2019s outreach to various business associations, \u201cit is clear the Secretary (Thomas Perez) is not willing to reconsider the rule in a meaningful way without Congressional action.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) agreed, stating that the legislation \u201cstops the Department of Labor from irresponsibly redefining the overtime threshold without understanding the real world consequences.\u201d\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, known one of the most moderate Republican members of the Senate, was one of the first to add her name to the 35-member list of co-signers, who all happen to be GOPers.\n\nAlthough New Hampshire\u2019s Ayotte opposes the new rule, she remains one of 19 Senate Republicans who has yet to become a co-signer of the bill to require further study of the issue.\n\nContact Evan Lips at [email protected] or on Twitter at @evanmlips.\n\nThis article has been edited to update Senator Kelly Ayotte\u2019s position on the pending regulation.\n\nNBPEconomic\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/05/06/obamas-new-ot-rules-could-further-harm-businesses/", "article_author_name": "Evan Lips", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Home_of_the_Internal_Revenue_Service-e1462984699843.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Barack Obama, department of labor, employer costs, Fair Labot Standards Act, FLSA, hourly employees, hourly wages, Nation Retail Federal, overtime, salaied employees, small business, small businesses, Thomas Perez, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, White Castle"}, "description": "Small business owners, many of whom are currently adapting to recent state and local increases to the minimum wage and facing the prospect of even more dramatic", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Home_of_the_Internal_Revenue_Service-e1462984699843.jpg"}, "keywords": "obama,flsa,fair labor standards act,overtime,salaried emloyees,hourly employees,hourly wages,fight for 15,minimum wage,chamber of commerce elizabeth warren,kelly ayotte,thomas perez,departmentof labor,business,white castle,barack obama,department of labor,employer costs,fair labot standards act,nation retail federal,salaied employees,small business,small businesses,u.s. chamber of commerce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, estimate that the new rules will have a crippling effect on small businesses.\nToday millions of salaried employees check their work e-mail on their smartphones, or telework from home.\nMaggie Hassan and former Republican state Sen.
