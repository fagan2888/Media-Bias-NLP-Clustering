Michael Burgess says it would have been crazy not to respond.\n\nThe Republican from Lewisville said Friday he couldn\u2019t let Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., get away with calling Texas a \u201ccrazy state\u201d at a meeting of the House Rules Committee.\n\nLone Star pride was on the line.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit there at the witness table and not respond if someone says something disparaging about the state of Texas,\u201d Burgess said during a recording of Lone Star Politics on KXAS-TV (NBC5) that airs Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe all live here for a very good reason, because we love the state and we love the economy. We like the climate. We like that the state is able to provide for us and our offspring.\u201d\n\nHastings was blasting Texas Republicans over the state\u2019s failure to participate in the Affordable Care Act, and Gov. Greg Abbott has said he won\u2019t change course.\n\nBurgess demanded an apology. Hastings refused to do so. And Texas\u2019 GOP House delegation later issued a statement: \u201cDon\u2019t Mess with Texas.\u201d\n\nThe squabble between the two giant and influential states drew wide attention, especially on the late-night talk show circuit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re run by children,\u201d comedian Jon Stewart concluded on The Daily Show, which dubbed the prickly exchange the Southern Slam.\n\nBurgess seemed to agree. \u201cThis is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of those things that makes us as an institution not look good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
