He said he searched for at least two hours before driving down the mountain to where he could get a phone signal and call for help.\n\nThe woman, Janet Castrejon, is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 250 pounds. She has long black hair that she wears in a braid. She was last seen wearing a white T-shirt with black lettering, blue jeans and white tennis shoes with a red stripe.\n\nDog teams from the Arizona Department of Corrections are out searching along with county Search and Rescue officers, said Carol Capas, spokeswoman for the Cochise County Sheriff's Office.\n\nIt's a very remote area, Capas said, and searchers also are working closely with family members in New Mexico because Castrejon is actually from there, near the border with Arizona.\n\nStay with Tucson News Now on air and online for updates.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
