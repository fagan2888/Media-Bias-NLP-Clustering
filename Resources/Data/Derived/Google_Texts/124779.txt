A young man from Decatur has baseball talent so extraordinary that it's taken him to Mazatlan, Mexico. Kemp Alderman is one of 18 boys on USA Baseball's U-12 team.

Alderman and his teammates are competing in the Pan American Championships south of the border and they're playing very well. Just 24 hours after team usa no-hit panama, alderman struck out 2 batters as he and three team members combined for another no-hitter in an 8-0 win over ecuador.

We received this quote from Alderman through his team's Press Officer

"I've had a great time playing with the team so far. I've really liked getting to know my teammates and it's been really cool getting to play baseball in Mexico. It's also really cool getting to play for my country in an international tournament."

Alderman also went 1-for-3 at the plate with a run scored.

He's just 12 years old.
