End of bailout. End of story.\n\nWhy do we need it? On Dec. 18, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers was asked what was the administration's Plan B if, because of adverse selection (enrolling too few young and healthy people), the insurance companies face financial difficulty.\n\nJason Furman wouldn't bite.\n\n\u201cThere's a Plan A,\u201d he replied. Enroll the young.\n\nBut of course there's a Plan B. It's a government bailout.\n\nAdministration officials can't say it for political reasons. And they don't have to say it because it's already in the Affordable Care Act, buried deep.\n\nFirst, Section 1341, the \u201creinsurance\u201d fund collected from insurers and self-insuring employers at a nifty $63 a head. (Who do you think the cost is passed on to?) This yields about $20 billion over three years to cover losses.\n\nThen there is Section 1342, the \u201crisk corridor\u201d provision that mandates a major taxpayer payout covering up to 80 percent of insurance-company losses.\n\nNever heard of these? That's the beauty of passing a bill of such monstrous length. You can insert a chicken soup recipe and no one will notice.\n\nNancy Pelosi was right: We'd have to pass the darn thing to know what's in it. Now we have and now we know.\n\nThe whole scheme was risky enough to begin with \u2013 getting enough enrollees and making sure 40 percent are young and healthy. Obamacare is already far behind its own enrollment estimates. But things have gotten worse. The administration has been changing the rules repeatedly \u2013 with every scrimmage-line audible raising costs and diminishing revenue.\n\nFirst, it postponed the employer mandate. Then, it exempted from the individual mandate people whose policies were canceled (by Obamacare). And for those who did join the exchanges, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d insurers to \u2013 during the \u201ctransition\u201d \u2013 cover doctors and drugs not included in their clients' plans.\n\nThe insurers were stunned. Told to give free coverage. Deprived of their best customers. Forced to offer stripped-down \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans to over-30 clients (contrary to the law). These dictates, complained their spokesman, could \u201cdestabilize\u201d the insurance market.\n\nTranslation: How are we going to survive this? Shrinking revenues and rising costs could bring on the \u201cdeath spiral\u201d \u2013 an unbalanced patient pool forcing huge premium increases (to restore revenue) that would further unbalance the patient pool as the young and healthy drop out.\n\nEnd result? Insolvency \u2013 before which the insurance companies will pull out of Obamacare.\n\nSolution? A huge government bailout. It's Obamacare's escape hatch. And \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 it's already baked into the law.\n\nWhich is why the GOP needs to act. Obamacare is a Rube Goldberg machine with hundreds of moving parts. Without viable insurance companies doing the work, it falls apart. No bailout, no Obamacare.\n\nSuch a bill would be overwhelmingly popular because Americans hate fat-cat bailouts of any kind. Why should their tax dollars be spent not only saving giant insurers but also rescuing this unworkable, unbalanced, unstable, unpopular money-pit of a health care scheme?\n\nThe GOP House should pass it and send it to Harry Reid's Democratic Senate. Democrats know it could be fatal for Obamacare. The only alternative would be single-payer. And try selling that to the country after the spectacularly incompetent launch of \u2013 and subsequent widespread disaffection with \u2013 mere semi-nationalization.\n\nDo you really think vulnerable Democrats up for re-election will vote for a bailout? And who better to slay Obamacare than a Democratic Senate \u2013 liberalism repudiating its most important creation of the last 50 years.\n\nWant to be even bolder? Attach the anti-bailout bill to the debt ceiling. That and nothing else. In the past, Republicans made unrealistic and unpopular debt-ceiling demands \u2013 and lost badly. They learned their lesson. Last year, Republicans presented one simple unassailable debt-ceiling demand \u2013 that the Senate pass its first budget in four years.\n\nWho could argue with that? The Senate capitulated within two days.\n\nWho can argue with no bailout? Let the Senate Democrats decide \u2013 support the bailout and lose the Senate. Or oppose the bailout and bury Obamacare.\n\nHappy New Year.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Stop the  | bailout, obamacare, senate, insurance, act, bill, first, insurers, companies, young", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 First order of business for the returning Congress: The No Bailout for Insurance Companies Act of 2014.", "title": "Charles Krauthammer: Stop the Obamacare bailout", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/bailout-595756-obamacare-senate.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mysmby-b781242774z.120140102132451000get1hr223.2.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mysmby-b781242774z.120140102132451000get1hr223.2.jpg"}, "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 First order of business for the returning Congress: The No Bailout for Insurance Companies Act of 2014.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Charles Krauthammer: Stop the Obamacare bailout"}, "content_author": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/mysmby-b781242774z.120140102132451000get1hr223.2.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "bailout, obamacare, senate, insurance, act, bill, first, insurers, companies, young", "publication_date": "2014-01-02", "access-type": "free", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Charles Krauthammer: Stop the Obamacare bailout"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ded\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2013 First order of business for the returning Congress: The No Bailout for Insurance Companies Act of 2014.\nInsolvency \u2013 before which the insurance companies will pull out of Obamacare.\nWithout viable insurance companies doing the work, it falls apart.\nNo bailout, no Obamacare.\nOr oppose the bailout and bury Obamacare."}
