Tethys itself, however, is no pinprick in space. Measuring about 660 miles (1,056 kilometers) across, it is the 16th-largest moon in the solar system and more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 14. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 22 degrees. Image scale is 7 miles (11 kilometers) per pixel. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An image taken by NASA shows Tethys, an icy moon of Saturn, seemingly speared by the immense planet\u2019s distinctive rings.", "title": "NASA Photo Shows One of Saturn\u2019s Moons Seemingly Speared by a Ring", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2014/10/14/nasa-photo-shows-one-of-saturns-moons-seemingly-speared-by-a-ring/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EZ846_1014te_G_20141014140724.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "NASA Photo Shows One of Saturn\u2019s Moons Seemingly Speared by a Ring", "description": "An image taken by NASA shows Tethys, an icy moon of Saturn, seemingly speared by the immense planet\u2019s distinctive rings.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Robert Lee Hotz", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Dispatch Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Dispatch", "article.summary": "An image taken by NASA shows Tethys, an icy moon of Saturn, seemingly speared by the immense planet\u2019s distinctive rings.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-14T18:28:40-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2014/10/14/nasa-photo-shows-one-of-saturns-moons-seemingly-speared-by-a-ring/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DISPATCHB-4150", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "An image taken by NASA shows Tethys, an icy moon of Saturn, seemingly speared by the immense planet\u2019s distinctive rings.", "title": "NASA Photo Shows One of Saturn\u2019s Moons Seemingly Speared by a Ring", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2014/10/14/nasa-photo-shows-one-of-saturns-moons-seemingly-speared-by-a-ring/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EZ846_1014te_G_20141014140724.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Dispatch", "article.id": "BL-DISPATCHB-4150", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-14T18:28:52-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science InstituteThis icy moon of Saturn seems speared by the immense planet\u2019s distinctive rings in this image taken by NASA\u2019s Cassini space probe.\nThe view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 22 degrees.\nThe image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 14.\nMeasuring about 660 miles (1,056 kilometers) across, it is the 16th-largest moon in the solar system and more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined."}
