By contrast, 10 years ago Nordstrom department stores outnumbered Nordstrom Rack stores 94 to 49.\n\nRack, along with the online HauteLook, are successfully wooing young, discount-seeking customers in the hopes they will become shoppers at the pricier department stores as they become older and more successful financially.\n\nLast year, Nordstrom\u2019s full-line stores and website generated $9.7 billion in sales, compared with $3.6 billion for the discount division, which includes the Rack, its website and HauteLook.\n\nDuring the last quarter, sales at the Nordstorm\u2019s department stores rose 1.1% compared to 13% for Rack stores.\n\nSimilar to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Ross stores, Rack targets \u201caspirational\u2019\u2019 consumers seeking more sophisticated fashion at a value. About 20% of the inventory comes from the full-line Nordstrom stores, but most comes from outside sources.\n\nCompany officials have said the best-performing Rack stores are close to the department stores, further suggesting that having the two available options breeds success for both. Rack stores are typically located in strip centers, rather than large malls that have faced limited growth.\n\nOther department stores are trying to duplicate Nordstrom\u2019s success. Macy\u2019s is opening a chain of off-priced stores this year call Macy\u2019s Backstage. Saks has its Off 5th stores and Neiman Marcus has its Last Call stores. All are attempts to compete with the more valued-driven retailers that saw huge growth after the recession.\n\nNordstrom Rack has seen 26 straight quarters of double-digit gains, astounding success in today\u2019s difficult retail environment. Attracting younger, hipper shoppers has been a struggle for retailers seeking to expand their base without alienating its core customers.\n\nNordstrom learned this the hard way in 2000 with its $40 million Reinvent Yourself campaign that turned away longtime shoppers with its sexy ads and too-edgy fashions at its department stores.\n\nGet Free Updates!
