What he meant was that the lobby shop for doctors had done an amazingly good job of limiting competition, raising prices, and redistributing wealth upwards. Unfortunately, when I wrote yesterday that doctors who are sad that Obamacare doesn't give them enough subsidies should be ignored, and that instead we should be finding ways to curtail doctors' pay by dismantling supply restrictions, a lot of conservatives freaked out.\n\n\n\nFor example, here's Breitbart.com's Ben Shapiro offering me some questionable medical advice:\n\nDear @MattYglesias: as someone with a wife in medical school, kindly take your \"coddled, overpaid doctors\" column and use it as an enema. -- Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) November 21, 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAnd here's John Podhoretz of Commentary, The Weekly Standard, and the New York Post staying a bit more polite:\n\nThis is a very strange argument. Apparently doctors aren't allowed to be upset if they get paid less. http://t.co/IuOs2X9kiM -- John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) November 20, 2013\n\nI want good doctors to be paid a fortune, because they save lives and, you know, stuff like that. -- John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) November 20, 2013\n\nOthers were less circumspect:\n\nWith cocksucking leftists like @mattyglesias demonizing America's doctors, why should anyone have any incentive to go into medicine? -- Harry (@Tark31) November 20, 2013\n\nHow many yrs in J School did little sh*t stirrer @mattyglesias spend to get paid to write fluff while doctors give 10 yrs to save people? -- Alexander Khanukov (@akhanukov) November 20, 2013\n\nSo let's get clear on what the issues are here.\n\nAre doctors smart, hard-working people who've obtained extensive and expensive educations? Yes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut here's what else doctors are. Doctors practice a profession that benefits from massive government subsidies\u2014not just direct subsidies but indirect ones like the tax subsidy for large group health insurance. They also work in a heavily regulated industry. It's regulated for good reason\u2014obviously if you're going to have public health regulations anywhere, you're going to have it in the medical industry. But when you have this tangle of subsidies and regulations, then your income becomes a legitimate matter of public concern.\n\nAnd here are the facts:\n\nU.S. doctors earn more than doctors in other rich countries and yet we have fewer of them per capita.\n\nWe have so few doctors not because the hard work, malpractice insurance, and student loans keep people out of the profession, but because of regulatory barriers to entry that have prevented the supply of new MDs from growing with the population.\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that in some contexts nurse-practitioners can treat patients just as well as doctors, but California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Georgia, and other large states make this illegal.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Conservatives' Curious Affection for the Doctors' Cartel", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "In his 1962 book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman described the American Medical Association as \"the strongest trade union in America.\" That wa ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "In his 1962 book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman described the American Medical Association as \"the strongest trade union in America.\" That wa ...", "title": "Conservatives' Curious Affection for the Doctors' Cartel", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance/159254364.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In his 1962 book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman described the American Medical Association as \"the strongest trade union in America.\" That wa ...", "title": "Conservatives' Curious Affection for the Doctors' Cartel", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance/159254364.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@mattyglesias", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-21T10:10:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Conservatives' Curious Affection for the Doctors' Cartel", "sailthru.headline": "Conservatives' Curious Affection for the Doctors' Cartel", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Conservatives\\u0027 Curious Affection for the Doctors\\u0027 Cartel\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance/159254364.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"221131121003\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-21T10:10:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Matthew Yglesias\",\n  \"tags\": [\"health care\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Conservatives' Curious Affection for the Doctors' Cartel", "keywords": "health care, doctors cartel", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "health care, doctors cartel", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://www.Facebook.com/mattyglesias"}, "sailthru.description": "In his 1962 book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman described the American Medical Association as \"the strongest trade union in America.\" That wa ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/21/doctors_cartel_and_the_right_a_bad_romance/159254364.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f8a\"", "article_summary": "And here are the facts:U.S. doctors earn more than doctors in other rich countries and yet we have fewer of them per capita.\nhttp://t.co/IuOs2X9kiM -- John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) November 20, 2013I want good doctors to be paid a fortune, because they save lives and, you know, stuff like that.\n-- Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) November 21, 2013AdvertisementAnd here's John Podhoretz of Commentary, The Weekly Standard, and the New York Post staying a bit more polite:This is a very strange argument.\n-- John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) November 20, 2013Others were less circumspect:With cocksucking leftists like @mattyglesias demonizing America's doctors, why should anyone have any incentive to go into medicine?\nWhat he meant was that the lobby shop for doctors had done an amazingly good job of limiting competition, raising prices, and redistributing wealth upwards."}
