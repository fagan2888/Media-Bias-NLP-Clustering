Wallace County High School took the field for the first time since losing teammate Luke Schemm earlier this week.

Schemm collapsed at the sideline during this playoff game on Tuesday. He was flown to a hospital in Denver and he later died.

To bystanders, Saturday's game between Ingalls and Wallace County could have been any other playoff game.

The Wildcats wanting to play the game to honor their late teammate.

"That's the way Luke would've wanted it," said Larry O'Connor, Wallace County Athletic Director. "There is nothing more that he would've wanted. His life was on the football field and the basketball court. This is exactly where he wants us to be today, competing like he would've competed. And that's exactly where we're at."

Wallace County desiring to preserve a sense of normalcy while still taking the time prior to kick off to remember.

But they aren't grieving alone. Communities all over western Kansas rallying together behind Wallace County, even showing up along the team's trip to Ingalls for the game.

A show of support for Wallace County playing without No. 4 on the field for the first time.

But playing anyway because they believe it's what he would want.

"I'm not saying they're not going to think about Luke, because they're going to say stuff in the huddle I'm sure," O'Connor said. "But they're going to play and give everything they have because they know that's the way luke would play."
