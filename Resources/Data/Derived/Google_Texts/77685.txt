Flooding is forcing the Army Corps of Engineers to cancel reservations for all of its campgrounds at Lake Tenkiller and Lake Eufaula.

Reservations at Tenkiller's Chicken Creek, Cookson Bend, Elk Creek, Petit Bay One, Petit Bay Two, Snake Creek and Strayhorn Landing are canceled through July.

But at Eufaula, the Corps said it was canceling reservations through the end of the season, which is September 30th.

The Corps later issued a clarification, saying Tenkiller Ferry Lake and Lake Eufaula are both open for recreation. It said as lake levels fall and it repairs campgrounds it will re-open campsites on a first-come, first-served basis.

The Corps says its rangers, lake office staff, and volunteers are making repairs as quickly as possible.
