Sioux Falls, SD

Yesterday afternoon, emergency crews responded to reports of a fire on the Hawthorne Elementary playground that caused serious damage to some of the equipment. Now, an Augustana student is setting up a way for people to help repair the playground.

When the playground equipment first started on fire at Hawthorne Elementary this weekend, Wendy Noyes was both worried and confused.

"I was terrified, cause I thought there was a kid up there at first. So I didn't know what was going on, and then I started smelling plastic, and then I saw smoke," Noyes said. "So, me and my husband came out here and we were just wondering what was going on."

The area damaged by the fire has been reduced to a pile of melted plastic. Sioux Falls Fire Rescue is deeming it a total loss. The heat from the fire also broke a window to the building, and smoke damaged the school's roofline. After seeing the news on KELOLAND.com, Augustana student Kayla Koterswski says she and her boyfriend hoped someone would start fund raising efforts. She spoke with us from Minneapolis.

"I realized that if we were talking about hoping that someone else would do it, I may as well do it," Koterswski said. "And so I just kind of went online, and I was familiar with Go Fund Me, and so I just set up a page."

Koterswski says the school will have enough damage to repair without worrying about the playground. She says a decent playground can cost about 15-thousand dollars, which is the current goal on her Go Fund Me page.

"The least that I think as a community we can do is to raise some funds for a new playground and ease that burden a little bit," Koterswski said.

Koterswski says she plans on talking with the school district tomorrow about her fundraising efforts.
