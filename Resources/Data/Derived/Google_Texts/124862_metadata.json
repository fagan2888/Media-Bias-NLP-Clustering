It\u2019s what you put into it,\u201d Benson said. There\u2019s a wide range of water classes being offered at gyms across the country, including:\n\nAqua Kickbox is a traditional kickboxing workout that is more challenging due to the water\u2019s added resistance.\n\nAqua Yoga uses the healing power and support of the water to enhance basic yoga moves.\n\nAqua Zumba, known as the Zumba \u201cpool party,\u201d is a low-impact aquatic exercise, which blends cardio and resistance training with upbeat music.\n\nDeep Water Fun and Fitness is a zero impact class, which improves cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, range of motion, strength, and balance.\n\nHydro Power is a high-intensity, high-resistance, zero-impact, upright, deep-water workout that focuses on cardio-respiratory endurance, muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility.\n\nJust two and a half hours per week of swimming can decrease the risk of chronic illness, according to the CDC. You are also able to exercise longer in water than on land without increased effort or joint or muscle pain.\n\nKaren Kent, an aquatic expert who wrote the water exercise chapter for the American College of Sports Medicine\u2019s group fitness handbook, told Reuters the pool temperature for water workouts should be around 83 to 85 degrees, with air temperature about two degrees higher. The reason for this is because unlike swimmers, who are comfortable in the high 70s (mid 20s), the exercisers\u2019 heads are above the water line. \u201cSwimming laps is different from doing exercise,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery workout has something else to offer and a well-rounded athlete should do all of it.\u201d\n\nSwimming is the fourth most popular recreational activity in the United States behind walking, exercising with equipment, and camping, according to the US Census Bureau.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "water workouts, exercise", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "For low-impact, high resistance exercise, younger crowds are turning to water workout classes like \"Aqua Zumba\" and \"Aqua Kickbox.\"", "title": "Millenials Are Taking Over The Water Aerobics Scene", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/water-workouts-arent-only-seniors-younger-crowds-also-joining-aqua-zumba-and-aqua-kickbox-287226", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/pool-workout.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For low-impact, high resistance exercise, younger crowds are turning to water workout classes like \"Aqua Zumba\" and \"Aqua Kickbox.\"", "title": "Millenials Are Taking Over The Water Aerobics Scene", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/water-workouts-arent-only-seniors-younger-crowds-also-joining-aqua-zumba-and-aqua-kickbox-287226", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/pool-workout.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/pool-workout.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-09T11:05:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T11:05:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "For low-impact, high resistance exercise, younger crowds are turning to water workout classes like \"Aqua Zumba\" and \"Aqua Kickbox.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4184\"", "article_summary": "Aqua Zumba, known as the Zumba \u201cpool party,\u201d is a low-impact aquatic exercise, which blends cardio and resistance training with upbeat music.\n\u201cAquatic exercise can have all the benefits of a really tough cardiovascular workout.\nHydro Power is a high-intensity, high-resistance, zero-impact, upright, deep-water workout that focuses on cardio-respiratory endurance, muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility.\nAqua Yoga uses the healing power and support of the water to enhance basic yoga moves.\nLori Rose Benson of the YMCA of Greater New York told Reuters seniors populate daytime pool classes, but the evening attracts a younger, party-oriented crowd."}
