But what organizations have to do to get to interoperability is one of the vexing questions troubling HIT leaders.\n\n[Poll: What topics will define HIMSS16?]\n\nHalamka, who is also chairman of the New England Healthcare Exchange Network, said there are both barriers and breakthroughs in the larger of context of achieving accountable care.\n\nAlong with Bush, Halamka will lead the session, \u201cHow Future-Proof HIT Infrastructure Supports Data,\u201d to examine successful HIT system interoperation examples.\n\nWith 5,000 patient data exchanges happening every day via the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Halmaka said that while point-to-point approaches to interoperability achieved some small scale, costly success stories, new cloud-hosted solutions might work for a large number of organizations.\n\n\u201cIf you were to look at other industries, whether they be social media or Netflix or HBO, they have approached the problem of creating interoperability at a scale of tens, even hundreds of millions but at low cost,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can we learn from that and how can we replicate it?\u201d\n\n[Like Healthcare IT News on Facebook]\n\nInteroperability will also develop as incentives to achieve accountable care are introduced and payment models continue evolving, he said.\n\n\u201cAs you look at the Affordable Care Act and look at other things happening with Medicare reimbursement, in some way the new incentives will be more potent than meaningful use in changing behavior,\u201d Halmaka added. \u201cSharing data with patients will be more common.\u201d\n\nThe session \u201cHow Future-Proof HIT Infrastructure Supports Data,\u201d is scheduled for March 1, 2016 from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at HIMSS16.\n\nTwitter: @HealthITNews\n\nThis story is part of our ongoing coverage of the HIMSS16 conference.
