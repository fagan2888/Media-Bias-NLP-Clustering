But the frenzy applies across the board as students stress about their fate in the years to come.\n\nRelated: The College Lawsuit That Will Make Your Jaw Drop\n\nIf there\u2019s a key lesson to be learned from today\u2019s college application process in which some kids apply to 10, 15, even 20 schools at $75 a pop (partly because the Common App has made it easier to do so), it\u2019s this: Calm down.\n\nIf America\u2019s young high achievers don\u2019t get into the elite school of their choice, they\u2019ll go somewhere else. That \u201csomewhere else\u201d may prove to be the place where they succeed beyond their wildest dreams. That\u2019s the message of Where You Go Is Not Who You\u2019ll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania, a new book by New York Times columnist Frank Bruni.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe nature of a student\u2019s college experience \u2014 the work he or she puts into it, the skills that he or she picks up, the self-examination that\u2019s undertaken, the resourcefulness that\u2019s honed \u2014 matters more than the name of the institution attended,\u201d Bruni writes. \u201cIn fact students at institutions with less hallowed names sometimes demand more of those places and of themselves. Freed from a focus on the packaging of their education, they get to the meat of it.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Public Colleges with the Most Luxurious Dorms\n\nMany decisions, of course, hinge on college affordability. As if sticker prices hadn\u2019t gone high enough, 57 U.S. colleges and universities are right now charging over $60,000 a year for tuition, room and board, though most of those schools also hand out financial aid. The average annual sticker price of attending a private four-year college right now is $42,000. For an in-state public college, it\u2019s $23,000.\n\nPlaced in the context of America\u2019s current student debt total of some $1.2 trillion (with the average balance at $27,000), this is a recipe for crushing debt loads over a long period of time that can interrupt one\u2019s ability to buy a home, have a car, and otherwise progress economically.\n\nIn addition to the advice to calm down amid all the admissions craziness, here are five other important points, as cited by Bruni in his new book:\n\nThe college admissions game today is too flawed and rigged to be given overwhelming credit for defining a person\u2019s well-being or self-worth.\n\nEducation happens across a broad spectrum of settings and in infinite ways. \u201cIt starts well before college. It continues long after college. College has no monopoly on the ingredients for professional success or for a life well lived.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Biggest Money Scam on College Campuses\n\n\u201cCollege is supposed to set you on your way, and if you expect it to be a guarantee forevermore of smooth sailing \u2013 then you\u2019ve got trouble infinitely greater than any rejection notice.\u201d\n\nWhat matters is what you do in the classroom and in the lab, not the school banner that flutters over you or the school colors you choose to wear. A prestigious college doesn\u2019t necessarily make you successful in life. You do that for yourself.\n\n\u201cWhat really drives your earnings is your field of study,\u201d Bruni quotes Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, as saying. \u201cIf you go to Harvard and become a schoolteacher, you\u2019re not going to make more than another schoolteacher who didn\u2019t go to Harvard.\u201d\n\nFrank Bruni, by the way, did his undergraduate work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a public university, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in English. He went on to attend Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "No group of people in America is checking their inboxes more often than high school se", "title": "It\u2019s Time to Tame the College Admissions Monster", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/It-s-Time-Tame-College-Admissions-Monster", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04202010_Harvard_grads_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/It-s-Time-Tame-College-Admissions-Monster", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04202010_Harvard_grads_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "No group of people in America is checking their inboxes more often than high school se", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "For an in-state public college, it\u2019s $23,000.\nThat\u2019s the message of Where You Go Is Not Who You\u2019ll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania, a new book by New York Times columnist Frank Bruni.\nNo group of people in America is checking their inboxes more often than high school seniors, desperate to learn if they\u2019ve been admitted to the college of their choice.\nIf America\u2019s young high achievers don\u2019t get into the elite school of their choice, they\u2019ll go somewhere else.\nIn addition to the advice to calm down amid all the admissions craziness, here are five other important points, as cited by Bruni in his new book:The college admissions game today is too flawed and rigged to be given overwhelming credit for defining a person\u2019s well-being or self-worth."}
