Recorded on: February 19, 2016\n\nRecorded on: February 19, 2016\n\nAir Date: February 22, 2016\n\nInitiative Petition 28 proposes a new tax on Oregon C Corporations to fund senior services, schools, and health care. Most large companies are C Corporations and they pay corporate taxes. Other business entities, including S Corps and LLC's, attribute their profits to stakeholders, who pay taxes individually. If IP28 qualifies for the ballot and is passed by the voters, the measure would impose a 2.5 % tax on C Corporation income from Oregon sales above $25 million, raising about $2.5 billion per year. The revenue would potentially fill the annual gap of more than $1 billion between the Quality Education Model and actual budgeted state K-12 support, the state's 10% share of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and ongoing shortfalls on care for senior citizens.\n\nThis program features a debate between representatives of A Better Oregon, a citizen group that supports passage of IP 28, and Grow Oregon, a citizen group that prefers other options for closing the gap.\n\ncopyright, 2016 KLCC", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "Recorded on: February 19, 2016 Air Date: February 22, 2016 Initiative Petition 28 proposes a new tax on Oregon C Corporations to fund senior services,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://klcc.org/post/should-oregon-tax-corporations", "type": "article", "description": "Recorded on: February 19, 2016 Air Date: February 22, 2016 Initiative Petition 28 proposes a new tax on Oregon C Corporations to fund senior services,", "title": "Should Oregon Tax Corporations?"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@KLCCEugeneOR", "card": "summary"}, "wordCount": 173, "dc": {"title": "Should Oregon Tax Corporations?"}, "nid": 47004, "datePublished": "2016-02-22", "story_id": 467641266, "keywords": "City Club of Eugene, A Better Oregon, Grow Oregon, IP 28, state taxes, corporate taxes, May 2016 Primary", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Recorded on: February 19, 2016Recorded on: February 19, 2016Air Date: February 22, 2016Initiative Petition 28 proposes a new tax on Oregon C Corporations to fund senior services, schools, and health care.\nIf IP28 qualifies for the ballot and is passed by the voters, the measure would impose a 2.5 % tax on C Corporation income from Oregon sales above $25 million, raising about $2.5 billion per year.\nMost large companies are C Corporations and they pay corporate taxes.\nOther business entities, including S Corps and LLC's, attribute their profits to stakeholders, who pay taxes individually.\nThis program features a debate between representatives of A Better Oregon, a citizen group that supports passage of IP 28, and Grow Oregon, a citizen group that prefers other options for closing the gap."}
