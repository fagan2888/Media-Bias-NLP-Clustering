The Girl Scouts of the Florida Panhandle held their annual Women of Distinction Awards Gala Saturday evening honoring some of the community's most distinguished women.

The event recognized women who have impacted the community each and every day serving as role models for the nearly 5,000 girls participating in programs and services through the Florida Panhandle's Girl Scout chapters.

Twenty-two women were up for Saturday's nomination, and they choose nine from that selection.

Those nominated were chosen by both co-workers and friends who demonstrate their outstanding commitment to the community.

"This is an opportunity for us to recognize women in and throughout the community who are doing good things in the community. So we are just happy to be able to recognize our women for what they do and just make them feel," Host Jacqueline Crum said.

This is the second year the Girl Scouts of the Florida Panhandle have held the event in Panama City Beach.
