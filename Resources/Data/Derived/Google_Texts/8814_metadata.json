It was about control.\" - Dr. Ben Carson October 11, 2013\n\nDr. Ben Carson is a world-renowned American neurosurgeon. He is a brilliant physician with an incredibly compelling and motivational story. Born into poverty in Detroit in 1951 and raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson became the first surgeon to separate conjoined twins and the youngest to head a surgical department. His focus, work ethic and commitment to excellence should be emulated by as many as possible.\n\nOver the past year Carson has emerged on the political scene as a spokesperson for conservative interests. Most recently he addressed the 2013 Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., making the remarks referenced above.\n\n\"Obamacare\" or more accurately the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the worst thing in this nation since slavery? Really? I understand political diatribes and hyperbole but the worst thing in America since slavery? How can reducing the number of uninsured Americans through an expansion of Medicaid and the creation of new health insurance exchange marketplaces be worse than slavery?\n\nThe 13th Amendment abolished slavery in America except as punishment for a crime in 1865. Since then, African Americans have been lynched, had their farms confiscated, been denied the right to vote and have had limited or no access to public and private facilities. For an African American of Carson's intellect and stature to publically make such assertions is historically inaccurate, irresponsible and promotes many of the racist stereotypes that are being used to garner support to overturn the law.\n\nDoes Dr. Carson really believe that the ACA is worse than the Tuskegee syphilis experiment of 1932? This infamous clinical study was conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service on 399 African-American men from 1932 to 1972 to trace the natural progression of untreated syphilis.\n\nWould Dr. Carson have us believe that the ACA is worse than the government sanctioned, racially motivated attack on the Greenwood district of Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921? The Greenwood district of Tulsa, also known as Black Wall Street, was the wealthiest African-American community in America. During a 16-hour period from May 31 and June 1, 1921 Whites rioted, attacked the community and burned it to the ground based upon the rumor that an African-American shoe shiner named Dick Roland touched a White female elevator operator named Sarah Page.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 African American residents were left homeless and 35 city blocks composed of 1,256 residences were destroyed by fire.\n\nAs Carson is being promoted in conservative political circles as an informed spokesman on the talk circuit he has quickly become a political minstrel show. He's jumping Jim Crow. \"Jump Jim Crow\" is a song and dance that was performed in blackface by a White comedian named Thomas Dartmouth around 1830, the early minstrel era of American entertainment. It made a mockery of African Americans; lampooning them as dim-witted, lazy, and buffoonish. The expression to Jump Jim Crow came to mean \"to act like a stereotyped stage caricature of a Black person\" usually by a White person.\n\nThe ACA is far from perfect. The flaws in the legislation will be flushed out and addressed over time or it will die a natural death. How the Obama administration allowed the government web site to go live without beta testing, anticipating the problems and without immediate fixes for them is at least irresponsible.\n\nAs a physician Dr. Ben Carson should know better. If he has problems with the ACA he should present his issues using accurate data and facts; not baseless political ideology and foolish hyperbole.\n\nDr. Wilmer Leon is producer and host of the Sirius/XM Satellite radio channel 110's \"Inside the Issues with Wilmer Leon.\" Go to www.wilmerleon.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(TriceEdneyWire.", "og": {"url": "http://www.districtchronicles.com/news/view.php/424572/Dr-Ben-Carson-uses-his-reputation-to-sla", "site_name": "districtchronicles", "image": "3113030-2335130732_sm_1400803070_sm_14008030702.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson uses his reputation to slam Obamacare"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Uloop districtchronicles", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "keywords": ", , districtchronicles", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e9d\"", "article_summary": "- Dr. Ben Carson October 11, 2013Dr. Ben Carson is a world-renowned American neurosurgeon.\nDoes Dr. Carson really believe that the ACA is worse than the Tuskegee syphilis experiment of 1932?\nAn estimated 10,000 African American residents were left homeless and 35 city blocks composed of 1,256 residences were destroyed by fire.\nWould Dr. Carson have us believe that the ACA is worse than the government sanctioned, racially motivated attack on the Greenwood district of Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921?\nAs a physician Dr. Ben Carson should know better."}
