Police in Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur, said the family of the little girl decided to check for a pulse after a friend of the family who opened the coffin to rearrange the girl\u2019s body saw her head move.\n\nThe girl was brought into her town\u2019s medical clinic on Friday after suffering from a severe fever that had lasted a couple of days. She was pronounced dead the following day, and the family began the discouraging task of planning their daughter\u2019s funeral.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, the attending clinic personnel and physician confirmed that the young patient had no more pulse and was clinically dead last Saturday morning about 9 a.m.,\u201d Police Senior Inspector Heidil Teelan told local reporters. \u201cWe really cannot make confirmation on the status of the girl, but based on the observation of the police personnel I deployed it appear the girl remained in a state of comatose in their house.\u201d\n\nWhen the girl unexpectedly woke up in her own coffin, her family gave her water and brought her back to the clinic that made the egregious misdiagnosis before taking her home. The family is now seeking help from a more qualified doctor in their province of the Philippines and is working with at-home nurses to monitor the girl\u2019s condition.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "3, year, old, coffin, funeral", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This footage of a 3-year-old girl who wakes up in a wooden coffin at her own funeral after being pronounced dead the day before will shock you.", "title": "3-Year-Old Wakes Up In Her Own Coffin, Mid-Funeral [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3-year-old-girl-pronounced-dead-wakes-her-own-funeral-alive-and-well-292848", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/14/coffin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This footage of a 3-year-old girl who wakes up in a wooden coffin at her own funeral after being pronounced dead the day before will shock you.", "title": "3-Year-Old Wakes Up In Her Own Coffin, Mid-Funeral [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3-year-old-girl-pronounced-dead-wakes-her-own-funeral-alive-and-well-292848", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/14/coffin.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/14/coffin.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-14T12:02:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T12:02:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This footage of a 3-year-old girl who wakes up in a wooden coffin at her own funeral after being pronounced dead the day before will shock you."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd3f\"", "article_summary": "She was pronounced dead the following day, and the family began the discouraging task of planning their daughter\u2019s funeral.\nA 3-year-old girl from the Phillipines woke up in a wooden coffin at her own funeral this past Sunday after being pronounced dead due to a severe fever the day before.\nThe girl was brought into her town\u2019s medical clinic on Friday after suffering from a severe fever that had lasted a couple of days.\n\u201cDuring that time, the attending clinic personnel and physician confirmed that the young patient had no more pulse and was clinically dead last Saturday morning about 9 a.m.,\u201d Police Senior Inspector Heidil Teelan told local reporters.\nThe family is now seeking help from a more qualified doctor in their province of the Philippines and is working with at-home nurses to monitor the girl\u2019s condition."}
