If you're heading to Sky Harbor International Airport, give yourself some extra time.

The airport in Phoenix is expecting very heavy traffic for the remainder of Sunday and all day on Monday, Julie Rodriguez, Deputy Aviation Director, said in a statement.

She recommended that all passengers arrived at least two hours before their flight. There could be longer than usual lines.
