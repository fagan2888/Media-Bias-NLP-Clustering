Louisiana lawmakers have approved funding to continue the Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection, a network of 40 community clinics serving the area's uninsured.

At the recently-concluded session, Legislators allocated $10 million from the state budget, which will enable the program to draw down an additional $16 million from the federal government to help care for low-income residents who don't qualify for Medicaid and don't have private health care.

The measure now goes before Gov. Bobby Jindal for approval.

"We're thrilled to see the state legislature fund this important healthcare program, and we're hopeful the governor will sign it into law in the coming days," said a statement from Susan Todd, executive director of 504HealthNet, a network of 19 nonprofit and governmental organizations who participate in the program.

Continued funding for the clinics this year was not assured, with current year money due to end in August. This was the second year funding for the program appeared to be in limbo.

Supporters rallied to save funding, writing legislators about the potential impact of losing preventative and mental health care for 53,000 people in Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes.

"We appreciate everyone who worked to get the funding passed," Todd's statement said.

The Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection is essentially a Medicaid waiver that covers primary and mental health care visits for qualifying patients.

Many of these patients would have been able to obtain health care coverage through a Medicaid expansion provision allowed by the Affordable Care Act. But Jindal and many state lawmakers have opposed expanding that federal health care program in Louisiana. The governor has argued that a Medicaid expansion would shift too many patients from private to public insurance, and would cost the state too much.
