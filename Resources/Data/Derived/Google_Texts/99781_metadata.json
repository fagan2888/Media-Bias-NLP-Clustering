Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, refused to formally confirm the visit, but hinted broadly that the Pope has said he is \u201cwilling\u201d to come to the Philadelphia meeting.\n\nPope Francis will step into church-state controversy, as well as controversy within his church.\n\nThe nation\u2019s conservative bishops, almost all appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, have become vocal critics of America\u2019s social trends. As Archbishop of Denver, Chaput threatened to deny holy communion to Catholic politicians and public figures who hold pro-choice views on abortion.\n\nLiberal Catholics privately cheered when Chaput\u2019s name was not on the list when Francis named his first set of cardinals.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposed the Affordable Care Act, and bishops have supported lawsuits challenging contraception coverage requirements in women\u2019s health insurance.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the bishops sponsored a \u201cFortnight for Freedom\u201d observance aimed at alleged threats to religious liberty in America.\n\nAt the same time, socially activist women religious have become outspoken critics of such Catholic Republicans as House Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Paul Ryan for supporting deep cuts in federal social programs. \u201cNuns on the Bus\u201d tours have aimed at highlighting social inequality in America.\n\nAfter critiquing \u201cradical feminist themes\u201d in nuns\u2019 ministry, the Vatican assigned Seattle Archbishop J. Peter Sartain to oversee the Leadership Conference of Women Religious and make sisters toe the line.\n\nThe nuns have taken sharp exception to the Vatican critique, and recent harsh words from Cardinal Gerhard Muller, the German defender of orthodoxy who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\nAt a meeting with the sisters and Sartain in Rome, Muller rebuked the Leadership Conference for giving an award to a feminist theologian, a nun who teaches at Fordham University.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "He wasn\u2019t awarded a cardinal\u2019s red hat by Pope Francis, but Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has been able to deliver a news scoop about the Pontiff.
