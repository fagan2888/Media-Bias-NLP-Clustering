Thus has Ducey built and maintained his lead: a big tent, big endorsements, excellent grassroots support and volunteers, and a businessman's focus on the bottom line of asking for votes everywhere. It has helped as well that his wonderful wife, Angela, and three boys are as tightly knit and photogenic as families can come and that the very Catholic Ducey can point to his Arizona State University education and his up-from-nothing and broken-family biography as he campaigns around the state.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

Thus she has taped Mesa mayor and big government Republican Scott Smith to endorse despite Smith's enthusiastic embrace of Common Core and his vocal and high profile support of the job-killing emission limitations in the Kyoto Protocol, making for the strangest endorsement in the U.S. in 2014: The accidental governor blessing the liberal Republican who can only win the primary with votes that will be cast for the Democrat in the fall.\n\nAt the same time Bob Parsons, the billionaire founder of GoDaddy.com, which brought soft porn to the a Super Bowl, has blown millions on slimy Ducey attack ads to try and prop up Christine Jones, his former general counsel who has been revealed as a serial exaggerator of her past \u2014 including the mortal sin in this pro-military state of suggesting an Air Force career that didn't exist. Three minor conservative candidates are draining two and three percentage points each from Ducey's column as well, making the race much closer than it should be.\n\nThus did the center-left Arizona Republic find itself endorsing Ducey days before Sarah Palin did. Every serious center-right Republican and 95 percent of the conservatives will support Ducey as indeed the most respected man in Arizona, former Sen. Jon Kyl, has done. But the avalanche of negative ads from a billionaire political dilettante with a friend in the race combined with Democrats seeing in a Smith nomination the chance to snatch back this red state's state house has made Arizona the most interesting governor's race of 2014.\n\nVoting started last week and will continue through Aug. 26, another idiosyncrasy in a state where temps could well reach 110 degrees every day of voting. Ducey should pull further and further away having survived the deluge and as the minor conservative candidates fade and their supporters ponder life under a Democratic governor again, but the barrage of lies and distortions keeps up on television and radio. The good news is that national pro-business and pro-border groups are stepping up to help Ducey and expose Smith even as Ms. GoDaddy Jones craters in the polls.\n\nIt's not called the Wild West for nothing, but when the six-way shootout is done in three weeks, Ducey will be the nominee and Arizona will have a governor the equal of any other in the U.S. and this very red state will stay the course in 2016.\n\nHugh Hewitt is a nationally syndicated talk radio host, law professor at Chapman University's Fowler School of Law, and author, most recently of The Happiest Life.
