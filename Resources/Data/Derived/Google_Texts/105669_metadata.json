For generations, Democrats and Republicans have waged fierce fights over all kinds of policy measures, but even bitter partisans didn\u2019t make much of an effort to weaken existing American laws and programs after they were implemented \u2013 though that\u2019s exactly what Republicans did during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut U.S. policymakers taking steps to sabotage U.S. foreign policy is qualitatively different, and far more alarming \u2013 and in the Obama era, far more common.\n\nWe\u2019ve occasionally seen individual Republicans taking steps to undermine the White House on the global stage. For example, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) traveled to Guatemala last year and worked against U.S. foreign policy during the migrant-children crisis. In 2010, then-House Minority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) traveled to Israel in the hopes of undermining U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. As long-time readers know , actions like these used to be unheard of in the American tradition, but once President Obama took office, Republicans largely re-wrote the rules.\n\nEarlier this year, 47 Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), took the campaign to an entirely new level, sending a letter to Iran, telling officials not to trust the United States. The goal wasn\u2019t subtle: GOP lawmakers hoped to sabotage their own country\u2019s foreign policy in the midst of delicate international nuclear talks.\n\nA month later, Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the nation\u2019s most aggressive climate deniers and the man Senate Republicans chose to lead the Senate committee on environmental policy, boasted , \u201cThe Tom Cotton letter was an educational effort.\u201d As global climate talks get underway at the COP21 conference in Paris, Republicans hope to apply the lessons of the educational effort to try to sabotage the White House once more.\n\nIn Washington, congressional Republicans have drawn a line against the president\u2019s climate initiatives, and the House is scheduled to vote this week on legislation that would undo new Environmental Protection Agency rules on power-plant emissions \u2013 a major element of the administration\u2019s efforts to address climate change. The legislation is unlikely to become law, but Republicans hope it shows the international climate negotiators that the nation is not united politically behind the president\u2019s proposals.\n\nIt\u2019s that last sentence that carries the most weight: congressional Republicans aren\u2019t participants in the international climate talks, but they\u2019re nevertheless hopeful that they can play a role in derailing the negotiations from afar.\n\nThis week\u2019s vote is just part of a larger effort. GOP lawmakers, anticipating a possible climate agreement, are pushing to label any such deal a \u201ctreaty\u201d so Congress would have the authority to kill it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, wrote a Washington Post op-ed over the holiday weekend insisting that the president doesn\u2019t have the authority to sign an international climate agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Inhofe, a.ka. Senator Snowball, has raised the prospect of traveling to Paris in order to tell international officials \u201cthat they\u2019re going to be lied to by the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nWriting in The New Republic, Ben Adler recently summarized the dynamic nicely: \u201cRepublicans are trying to subvert their own government\u2019s foreign policy on climate change.\u201d\n\nNote, the Republican Party \u2013 the only major party in any major democracy on Earth that rejects climate science \u2013 isn\u2019t trying to convince anyone that its ridiculous views are correct. All GOP officials want is for Obama to come home empty-handed, indifferent to the fact that the climate crisis will continue to intensify without restrictions on pollution or emissions.\n\nIf that means American officials sabotaging American policy on the international stage, so be it.\n\nAs we talked about in April, we\u2019ve grown quite accustomed to congressional Republicans causing deliberate gridlock on Capitol Hill. Increasingly, however, GOP lawmakers are equally eager to block policymaking on a global scale.\n\nIn the American tradition, the idea of elected U.S. officials brazenly trying to undermine their own country\u2019s attempts at international leadership was unthinkable. But in 2015, it\u2019s become almost routine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republicans want to derail the Paris talks.
