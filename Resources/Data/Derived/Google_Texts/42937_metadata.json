This might not be as egregious as illegally rewriting laws on the fly to help the Democrat Party survive ObamaCare, but it\u2019s insidious:\n\nA while back, some adult performers noticed that banks were terminating their accounts. The reason, it turned out, was a Justice Department program called \u201cOperation Choke Point.\u201d This program, apparently, seeks to target businesses regarded as undesirable \u2014 like porn \u2014 by hitting them at a financial \u201cchoke point\u201d: their bank accounts. Though the Justice Department can\u2019t prosecute people for making porn, because the First Amendment prohibits that, and too many people would think of them as blue-nosed morality police, which is politically undesirable, it can use its power to put them out of business extra-legally, by pressuring banks to cut off their accounts. Prosecutors and regulators have a lot of discretion, and the threat to use (or abuse) that discretion in ways that make banks uncomfortable provides a lot of leverage. Sure, banks make money off of the accounts of porn performers (and other targeted businesses), but not enough to make up for the hassle of being targeted for harassment by the feds. [\u2026] It\u2019s not only adult stars that are being targeted. Justice Departmenttargetsinclude industries as diverse as ammunition sales, coin dealers, payday loans, \u201cracist materials,\u201d etc. And, again, these are all legal businesses that haven\u2019t been charged with breaking any laws \u2014 the Justice Department just doesn\u2019t like them. So what we have under \u201cOperation Choke Point\u201d is the government deciding it wants to put the squeeze on certain lines of (legal) business, for no other reason than that the Department of Justice doesn\u2019t favor them. It seems almost like some sort of conspiracy to deprive people of their civil rights.\n\nWhere do we go to vote against the Commissar of Undesirable Businesses, if we decide we disagree with his or her judgments\u2026 once we penetrate the veil of secrecy and discover those judgments have been rendered?\n\nNo one\u2019s even pretending DOJ had anything resembling the authority to do this. As we\u2019ve seen time and again during the Obama years \u2013 and a few times before that \u2013 a government agency simply decided something was a good idea, and did it. It feels right, so it must be legal.\n\nReynolds wonders if a different Administration might come up with a different target list of legal but \u201cundesirable\u201d businesses \u2013 say, abortion clinics. Of course, the very foundations of Olympus would be shaken by deafening howls of media outrage if a pro-life Republican President used Operation Choke Point tactics against Planned Parenthood, even though such action would be exactly as legitimate as what the Obama Administration has done here. That\u2019s a big problem, because it boils down to a permanent Ruling Class in bureaucracy and the media deciding what\u2019s good for us\u2026 and targeting what is bad for us, without the sort of public debate and legislative action a free republic deserves.\n\nIt is extremely dangerous, and strongly antithetical to the American understanding of citizenship and government, to have the ruling elite presiding over a nebulous \u201clegal but undesirable\u201d classification rewritten at their whim\u2026 and enforced with government power. The pursuit of \u201cjustice\u201d by the Justice Department, or any other government agency, should involve criminals who act in defiance of clearly written law\u2026 which is another way of saying that government power must be constrained by our elected representatives and their congressional votes. Instead, the American people are growing more accustomed to the titanic centralized State deploying its power against law-abiding businesses. We\u2019re being made comfortable with the idea that Big Government is a supreme organism with its own desires and agenda, which it often places ahead of its duties to the people and the law.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Whatever feels right to the almighty State must be legal, no matter what the law actually says.", "title": "Justice Dept. chokes out 'undesirable' businesses | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/money_jail-480x264.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/05/27/justice-dept-chokes-out-undesirable-businesses/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Whatever feels right to the almighty State must be legal, no matter what the law actually says.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/money_jail-480x264.jpg", "description": "Whatever feels right to the almighty State must be legal, no matter what the law actually says.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3db\"", "article_summary": "And, again, these are all legal businesses that haven\u2019t been charged with breaking any laws \u2014 the Justice Department just doesn\u2019t like them.\nReynolds wonders if a different Administration might come up with a different target list of legal but \u201cundesirable\u201d businesses \u2013 say, abortion clinics.\nThe reason, it turned out, was a Justice Department program called \u201cOperation Choke Point.\u201d This program, apparently, seeks to target businesses regarded as undesirable \u2014 like porn \u2014 by hitting them at a financial \u201cchoke point\u201d: their bank accounts.\nWhere do we go to vote against the Commissar of Undesirable Businesses, if we decide we disagree with his or her judgments\u2026 once we penetrate the veil of secrecy and discover those judgments have been rendered?\nInstead, the American people are growing more accustomed to the titanic centralized State deploying its power against law-abiding businesses."}
