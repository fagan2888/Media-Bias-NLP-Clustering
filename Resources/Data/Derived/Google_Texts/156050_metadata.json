(AP) \u2014 Jakob Silfverberg scored the tiebreaking goal with 21 seconds to play, and the Anaheim Ducks rallied from another third-period deficit for a 2-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday night, taking a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.\n\nPatrick Maroon scored the tying power-play goal midway through the third period and Frederik Andersen made 28 saves for the top-seeded Ducks, who came back from a final-period deficit for the second straight game and the 14th time this season.\n\nSilfverberg sealed it moments before overtime, taking a puck off the boards and wheeling into the faceoff circle for a shot past Ondrej Pavelec, who stopped 37 shots in an outstanding performance.\n\nGame 3 on Monday night will be the first NHL postseason game in Winnipeg since 1996.\n\nAdam Pardy scored his first NHL goal in more than four years in the second period for the Jets, but they\u2019re still looking for the first playoff victory in the history of a franchise that moved north to Winnipeg in 2011 after 11 fruitless seasons as the Atlanta Thrashers.\n\nPardy\u2019s first career playoff goal ended his personal 172-game goal drought and put the Jets in front in a tense game, but the Ducks finally were rewarded for another productive offensive effort.\n\nCam Fowler\u2019s long shot deflected off Maroon\u2019s body to even it with 9:17 left. Silfverberg then finished it with his fifth career playoff goal.\n\nAfter a bone-jarring series opener, neither team let up at all in the rematch. A series between two large, bad-tempered teams produced bruising hockey from the opening faceoff, with Winnipeg\u2019s hulking defensemen delivering an array of brutal hits and the Ducks answering every time.\n\nThe Jets shut out Corey Perry after his four-point performance in Game 1, but captain Ryan Getzlaf picked up an assist, giving him four points in two games.\n\nPardy was an unlikely offensive hero for the Jets after being a healthy scratch in Game 1. The defenseman with four career goals in 315 regular-season games got the start in Game 2 largely for his penalty-killing acumen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Silfverberg\u2019s last-minute goal puts Ducks past Jets 2-1", "author": "Greg Beacham", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Silfverberg\u2019s last-minute goal puts Ducks past Jets 2-1", "title": "Silfverberg\u2019s last-minute goal puts Ducks past Jets 2-1", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/silfverbergs_last_minute_goal_puts_ducks_past_jets_2_1/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/aptopix-jets-ducks-hockey.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Silfverberg\u2019s last-minute goal puts Ducks past Jets 2-1", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/aptopix-jets-ducks-hockey.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Silfverberg\u2019s last-minute goal puts Ducks past Jets 2-1", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Silfverberg\u2019s last-minute goal puts Ducks past Jets 2-1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Silfverberg then finished it with his fifth career playoff goal.\nPardy\u2019s first career playoff goal ended his personal 172-game goal drought and put the Jets in front in a tense game, but the Ducks finally were rewarded for another productive offensive effort.\nPardy was an unlikely offensive hero for the Jets after being a healthy scratch in Game 1.\nGame 3 on Monday night will be the first NHL postseason game in Winnipeg since 1996.\nThe defenseman with four career goals in 315 regular-season games got the start in Game 2 largely for his penalty-killing acumen."}
