The standout revelation was Cameron Bay\u2019s testimony about her final adult shoot for Kink.com before testing positive for HIV: She says her co-star, Xander Corvus, got a cut on his penis in the middle of filming and yet the action continued without a condom.\n\nSome might interpret the mention of this within the context to mean that Bay was infected with HIV on-set that day \u2014 and that the cut on her co-star\u2019s penis was to blame. Indeed, some outlets seemed to imply as much. Take this headline from International Business Times, which turns the cut \u2014 a \u201cnick\u201d and \u201crelatively minor issue,\u201d according to Kink.com\u2019s Peter Acworth \u2014 into a bleeding wound: \u201cHIV+ Porn Star Cameron Bay Tells of Sex with Actor with Bleeding Genitals.\u201d\n\nBut there is no proof that the transmission happened on-set \u2014 during that shoot or otherwise. \u201cI think it is misleading to focus on the penis cut because there is no indication that transmission occurred on set,\u201d Acworth told me in an email. \u201cAll performers who interacted sexually with Cameron Bay (including the performer with a cut) tested negative several times after the shoot and have been cleared of transmission.\u201d\n\nGed Kenslea, director of communications for AHF, acknowledges that to the best of his knowledge the performer \u201c[with the penis cut] has tested negative.\u201d However he says the question of whether the penis cut had anything to do with Bay contracting HIV is \u201cimmaterial at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in essence, high risk activity is taking place on these sets.\u201d\n\nSome industry insiders, like Acworth, argue that AHF is misrepresenting the facts, including the penis cut, in order to advance a political agenda. He says that \u201cAHF has models speak in favor of condoms even though those performers performed on the gay side of the industry in condom mandatory shoots\u201d \u2014 for example, in the case of Rod Daily, Bay\u2019s boyfriend, who performed with condoms in gay porn and tested positive shortly after her \u2014 \u201cor they use someone who performed without condoms but did not contract on set.\u201d Of the six HIV-positive former porn performers to speak at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, he said only one \u2014 Darren James, who tested positive in 2004 \u2014 has been proven to have contracted it on an adult set. (Now, that said, the question of whether past infections could have happened on-set isn\u2019t without controversy.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The debate over rubbers has heated up again with new HIV cases.
