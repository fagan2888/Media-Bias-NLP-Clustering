Marcia Fudge.\n\nZetzer, of Shaker Heights, appeared solo at The City Club of Cleveland Tuesday for what was supposed to be a debate. Fudge refused to attend.\n\nFudge, a former mayor of Warrensville Heights, started serving in Congress in 2008. Zetzer, who has a background in marketing and advertising, has lost three elections in two years, including a campaign opposing an income tax increase in Shaker Heights.\n\n\"What the Tea Party and myself want to do is to leave markets alone,\" Zetzer said.\n\nHere are some five observations from the debate:\n\nZetzer made many digs at Fudge\n\nZetzer was very vocal about his opponent's decision not to attend the event. He said Fudge is out of touch with her constituents and is a career politician living off of taxpayers' money.\n\n\"It takes courage to debate and voters should know that (Fudge) can't face the music,\" he said. \"She has had three elections with almost no competition.\"\n\nHe continued by saying that Fudge hasn't supported any change and that \"conservative reactionaries\" like himself can fix the market.\n\nAll for privatization\n\nPerhaps Zetzer's most surprising statement was when he told the crowd that water and air should be privately owned.\n\nZetzer opposes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other government regulation.\n\n\"The EPA fits standards on a one size fits all,\" he said. \"We put our trust and our health in the EPA, and that scares me.\"\n\nStudent debt\n\nZetzer mentioned the millennial generation's growing student debt. He said that education has gotten more expensive because the government subsidizes student loans.\n\nWhen he was asked how to fix skyrocketing education costs and piles of student debt, he didn't have a solution.\n\n\"There is a bubble in debt that will likely occur in a short time,\" Zetzer said. \"We are sitting on an inflation or deflation time bomb.\"\n\nDoctors should make house calls\n\nZetzer made it clear that he was against the Affordable Care Act and if elected said he would work to repeal it. He likened healthcare to veterinary care.\n\n\"Animals get treated pretty well,\" he said. \"I don't know why human care is 10 times more expensive than care for animals.\"\n\nWhen City Club CEO Dan Mouthrop pushed Zetzer on how ill people without health insurance could get care, Zetzer said hospitals and doctors would still be required to treat sick people, regardless of their ability to pay. He also said the doctors should make house calls to increase their market share.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is bad\n\nFudge voted against a bill that would audit the Federal Reserve, which Zetzer said was a mistake. The value of the dollar has dropped, he said.\n\n\"The Fed thinks you have to pump in money and save jobs that might not be useful,\" he said. \"It's manipulation and a rationale for failed policy of central banking.\"\n\nHe supports the Free Competition in Currency Act, a bill languishing in the U.S. House that would allow people to use metals as money.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-healthcare-act,city-club,marcia-fudge,mark-zetzer", "title": "Republican Mark Zetzer appeared solo for City Club debate: 5 observations", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Republican Mark Zetzer appeared solo for City Club debate: 5 observations\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/10/republican_mark_zetzer_appeare.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/15796652-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14126049\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-07T19:18:42Z\", \"author\": \"DiAngelea Millar, Northeast Ohio Media Group\", \"tags\": [\"@akron\",\"@cleveland-heights\",\"@mobile\",\"@richmond-heights\",\"@seven-hills\",\"@shaker-heights\",\"@university-heights\",\"@warrensville-heights\",\"affordable-healthcare-act\",\"city-club\",\"marcia-fudge\",\"mark-zetzer\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/15796652-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@diangeleamillar", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Mark Zetzer, who is running against U.S. Rep Marcia Fudge for Ohio's 11th district seat, shares his opinions about health care, student loan debt and the Federal Reserve."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, October 07, 2014,  4:42 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/mark-zetzerjpg-826a5b4ce1ab90f3.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dimillar\", \"author_nickname\": \"DiAngelea Millar, Northeast Ohio Media Group\", \"author_id\": \"11816703\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Metro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Mark Zetzer, who is running against U.S. Rep Marcia Fudge for Ohio's 11th district seat, shares his opinions about health care, student loan debt and the Federal Reserve.", "title": "Republican Mark Zetzer appeared solo for City Club debate: 5 observations", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/10/republican_mark_zetzer_appeare.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, October 07, 2014,  3:18 PM", "article_author": "DiAngelea Millar, Northeast Ohio Media Group", "Description": "Mark Zetzer, who is running against U.S. Rep Marcia Fudge for Ohio's 11th district seat, shares his opinions about health care, student loan debt and the Federal Reserve."}, "article_summary": "Zetzer, of Shaker Heights, appeared solo at The City Club of Cleveland Tuesday for what was supposed to be a debate.\nWhen he was asked how to fix skyrocketing education costs and piles of student debt, he didn't have a solution.\nWhen City Club CEO Dan Mouthrop pushed Zetzer on how ill people without health insurance could get care, Zetzer said hospitals and doctors would still be required to treat sick people, regardless of their ability to pay.\nStudent debtZetzer mentioned the millennial generation's growing student debt.\nCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 Republican Mark Zetzer knows he will likely lose the election to represent the heavily Democratic 11th Congressional District to U.S. Rep.
