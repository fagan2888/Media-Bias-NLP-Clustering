Unlike undocumented immigrants, John McCain or Rosie O\u2019Donnell, the Fox News anchor enjoys a rabid following among the network\u2019s viewers, who happen to make up the core of the Republican primary electorate. So picking a fight with Kelly \u2014 as Trump did when he chided her during a tough debate question about insults he\u2019s lobbed at women, dissed her in the spin room, and tweeted his complaints about her \u2014 carries risks that Trump\u2019s other feuds do not.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove gif courtesy of @darth Above gif courtesy of @darth\n\nBetween those moments (conception and birth) lies a developmental continuum that confounds any and every effort at strictly rational systematization. An abortion at six weeks is worse than one at four weeks. Eight weeks is worse than six. Twelve is worse than 10. And so forth, as we approach fetal viability \u2014 at which point, what was once a medical procedure with minimal moral import becomes a matter of murder. I know that Ross Douthat and many other pro-life friends don't see it this way. I respect and admire their consistency, even as I find it hard to understand how they could possibly believe it, and even as I think it sometimes drives them to approach the issue of abortion in a needlessly extreme and counter-productive way. Because, you see, having convinced themselves that every abortion at every stage of pregnancy is murder, pro-lifers can't help but show relative indifference to the other person involved in the moral calculus: the pregnant woman. She's the one looking to hire a contract killer to murder her own child, after all. At six months. At three months. At six weeks. At four weeks. The morning after. The timing doesn't matter. There's always a homicide victim and a perp.\n\nOver the past year, there has been a substantial rise in the share of Americans \u2014 across racial and ethnic groups \u2014 who say the country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites, and a growing number of Americans view racism as a big problem in society.\n\nFor years, voter identification laws have been sold as a sensible antidote to fraud at the polls. Many people, including Supreme Court justices, have bought that fallacious line, even though in-person fraud is essentially nonexistent. Now, slowly but surely, such laws are being revealed for the racially discriminatory, anti-voter schemes that they are. On Wednesday, a federal appeals court panel unanimously agreed that Texas\u2019 voter ID law had a discriminatory effect on black and Latino voters, and therefore violates the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It was the first time a federal appeals court had ruled against such a law. It was also a sign that the Voting Rights Act remains functional, despite the 2013 Supreme Court decision that cut out a key provision requiring federal oversight of jurisdictions, like Texas, with histories of racial discrimination.\n\nThe first official Republican debate on Thursday night was fascinating, gripping television. It was also incomplete. Speaking on FOX News, leading Republican candidates like Donald Trump, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio all took shots at the Affordable Care Act \u2026 but they left out cruical context on how the law is actually working. Here are three key numbers that were overlooked at the GOP debate \u2014 and are incredibly important to understanding the state of health care in America. 1) The nation\u2019s uninsured rate has plunged by at least 37% since the ACA took effect\n\n2) Repealing Obamacare would raise the deficit by $130 billion \u2014 at least\n\n3) Eleven GOP governors have said yes to Medicaid expansion", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Google interest in candidates during and after debates\n\nCarol Giacomo : New York\u2019s senior senator, Chuck Schumer, has cast his ...", "title": "Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Debate fallout, Iran and voting rights", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/8/8/1409804/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-Debate-fallout-Iran-and-voting-rights", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/158213/story_image/CL13ECKWwAAmA2t.jpg?1439001131", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Google interest in candidates during and after debates\n\nCarol Giacomo:\nNew York\u2019s senior senator, Chuck Schumer, has cast his lot with Republican presidential candidates, other hardliners and Israe...", "title": "Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Debate fallout, Iran and voting rights", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/158213/story_image/CL13ECKWwAAmA2t.jpg?1439001131"}, "creator": "@demfromct", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "The first official Republican debate on Thursday night was fascinating, gripping television.\nAn abortion at six weeks is worse than one at four weeks.\nIt was the first time a federal appeals court had ruled against such a law.\nHere are three key numbers that were overlooked at the GOP debate \u2014 and are incredibly important to understanding the state of health care in America.\nPolitico:Donald Trump is finally in a feud with someone Republican primary voters care about: Megyn Kelly."}
