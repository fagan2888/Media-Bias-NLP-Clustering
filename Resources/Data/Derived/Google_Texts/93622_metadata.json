But the party is stuck in an internal debate over how far they can really go \u2013 risking a potential backlash from the party\u2019s right flank if they don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nTea Party activists say they are frustrated with the pace of progress toward conservatives\u2019 goal of upending the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome activists are encouraging members to \u201cfax blast\u201d all 435 House members and 100 senators and demand they \u201cdrive a stake through the heart of ObamaCare once and for all.\u201d\n\nSome Tea Party-backed lawmakers like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are leading the charge against the Affordable Care Act. The senator, and potential presidential candidate, recently warned that Republicans will \u201cget walloped\u201d in 2016 if they don\u2019t live up to their promises, including working to get the health law eliminated.\n\nBut so far, several Republican lawmakers, like Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have indicated they\u2019d have better luck chipping away at the law \u201cpiece by piece.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Hatch and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., introduced legislation to repeal the health care law\u2019s individual mandate requiring most people to obtain insurance. The legislation, called the American Liberty Restoration Act, is backed by 20 GOP senators.\n\n\"This legislation strikes ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate and restores the freedoms outlined in the Constitution,\u201d Hatch said in a written statement.\n\nHatch and a group of bipartisan senators also are pushing a bill to scratch the law\u2019s controversial 2.3 percent tax on medical devices.\n\nSeveral conservative activists and commentators in recent weeks have urged the new Republican Congress to be aggressive. Since right after the election, Brent Bozell, chairman of the conservative ForAmerica group, has said the Republican majority \u201cmust\u201d keep its \u201cpromise\u201d to pass a full repeal bill, if only to force a presidential veto.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, it raises the possibility not only of turbulence for GOP congressional candidates in 2016 but a groundswell of anti-ObamaCare pressure in the presidential primaries and caucuses.\n\nIn the official Republican response to the State of the Union address, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, vowed that the party will \u201ckeep fighting to repeal and replace a health care law that's hurt so many hardworking families.\u201d\n\nFreshman Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has called for Congress to go after the law and is among many GOP lawmakers who have signed a pledge calling for its repeal. He recently told The Hill, \u201cThere is a tide rising\u201d against the health law.\n\nBut like Hatch, he has put forward bills repealing the medical device tax and the individual mandate \u2013 parts of the law, not the whole thing.\n\nParty strategists have questioned whether aiming for full repeal is worth the effort, when President Obama would surely veto.\n\n\u201cRepublicans should not, again, go down the road of full repeal for ObamaCare when they know the president\u2019s not going to have an epiphany and say, \u2018You know what? I screwed up. Yeah, let\u2019s repeal my legacy legislation,\u2019\u201d Republican strategist Brad Blakeman told FoxNews.com.\n\nTop GOP lawmakers have been unclear about their intentions.\n\nFor the most part, GOP leaders still say they want to repeal the law but have focused on piecemeal bills and other pressing matters, ranging from immigration to the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nLast week, during a Republican retreat in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, called ObamaCare a \u201cterrible law\u201d that\u2019s \u201cbeyond repair\u201d and needs to be replaced. Ryan, however, did not offer a timeline for doing so.\n\nLara Brown, director of the political management program at George Washington University, says frustration with the GOP caucus is ill-placed.\n\n\u201cI think that Republicans have the ability to say to their base that \u2018we can only move as fast as our political power allows\u2019 and the reality is that they don\u2019t yet have the White House,\u201d Brown told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe reality is you still need 60 votes to get a bill through the Senate. Republicans have to be very calculated, and they don\u2019t want to burn any bipartisan bridges.\u201d\n\nShe predicted there would not be a huge backlash for the party if they don\u2019t confront the law head-on, because Republicans can easily remind voters that they did not win the White House in 2012.\n\nAn X-factor in Republicans\u2019 strategy is a pending Supreme Court case. The court in March is slated to hear a case that questions the legality of the subsidies that are at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s got Republican lawmakers crafting a game plan in case the court creates an opening to push an alternative health overhaul (though the Obama administration has voiced confidence in their case).\n\nBlakeman said Republicans should attack ObamaCare strategically.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of Democratic support. Let\u2019s fix that which is broken until Obama is out of office,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get a Republican in the White House and then we can talk about serious overhaul almost completely of ObamaCare or outright strike it down.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Joe Lestingi said Republicans, though, lose by waiting \u2013 as Americans grow used to the law.\n\n\u201c[ObamaCare] is going to become more popular and by the time we get a Republican president, this thing is going to be well ingrained in society,\u201d Lestingi told FoxNews.com. \u201cPeople will be used to this program. People will like the coverage they have and it will be really hard for Republicans to overturn.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-controlled House has voted more than 50 times to repeal or defund all or parts of ObamaCare. None of those bills, however, were considered by the Senate, which was controlled by Democrats until this month.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-17 12:40:36 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Republican lawmakers are facing rising pressure from conservative groups and activists to go big \u2013 or potentially go home \u2013 in their fight against ObamaCare.
