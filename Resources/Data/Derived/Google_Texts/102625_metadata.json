An editorial published in the newspaper was entitled, \u201cGazette opinion: Obama earned the low ratings.\u201d The Gazette went on to compare President Obama to President Richard Nixon.\n\nThe newspaper apology over the Obama endorsement listed in detail the mistakes the editorial staff felt have been made during the president\u2019s terms in office. The Billings Gazette also said is missed the former President George W. Bush and the \u201cgood ol\u2019 days\u201d when America was at least \u201cwinning battles in Iraq.\u201d\n\nAn excerpt from the Gazette Obama endorsement apology reads:\n\n\u201cSometimes, you have to admit you\u2019re wrong. And, we were wrong. We said things couldn\u2019t get much worse after the subpar presidency of George W. Bush. The latest NBC/Wall Street Journal polls show that Americans are giving Obama lower marks than in 2006 when Iraq was going poorly for Bush and a tepid response to Hurricane Katrina sunk Bush\u2019s ratings. It\u2019s not that popularity polling should be the final or even best measure of a president. There is that old saw that points out there\u2019s a difference between doing what is right and what is popular. For us, though, it\u2019s the number of bungled or blown policies in the Obama administration which lead us to believe Obama has earned every bit of an abysmal approval rating.\u201d\n\nThe reasons why the Billings Gazette is sorry that it endorsed Barack Obama include:\n\nThe NSA spying on Americans scandal.\n\nThe \u201cwar on carbon\u201d and President Obama\u2019s failure to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nA failure in Iraw that has left the Middle Eastern country on the brink of a civil war.\n\nThe Bowe Bergdahl exchange was also cited among Barack Obama\u2019s failures by the Billings Gazette. The newspaper feels the prisoner swap made the president appear incompetent.\n\nMismanagement of the VA and the deaths of United States veterans was also among the reasons listed for the Obama endorsement apology.\n\nThe Billings Gazette stated that the Obama administration has earned a reputation worse than that of the Nixon administration. The \u201cmost transparent administration in history\u201d broken promise was cited as a failure as well by the newspaper.\n\nObamacare was also deemed not just a failure but a complete \u201cboondoggle.\u201d\n\nThe Billings Gazette editorial also added, \u201cObama\u2019s hope and change have left liberals and conservatives alike hoping for real change, not just more lofty rhetoric.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about the Billings Gazette Obama endorsement apology? Would you vote for the president again if the election were held today?\n\n[Image Via: Chameleons Eye/Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Billings Gazette apologized for endorsing Barack Obama during the 2008 campaign.
