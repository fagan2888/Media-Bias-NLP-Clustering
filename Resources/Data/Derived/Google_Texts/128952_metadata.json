City Councilman Bill Rosendahl \u2014 acknowledge that the number of patients relying on care provided under the federal Ryan White Program has decreased. But they say that about 24,000 county residents with HIV are not receiving any care.\n\nOfficials estimate that more than 10,000 people in the county are HIV-positive and don't know it, and that an additional 13,000 are believed to be aware of their diagnoses but are not getting treatment.\n\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation board Chairwoman Cynthia Davis said the county should maintain the current level of safety-net spending on HIV outpatient services \"to ensure that these hard-to-reach and medically underserved clients\" are properly identified and treated.\n\nEduardo Martinez, a patient, told the board that he was celebrating his 57th birthday after living with HIV for 29 years.\n\n\"I'm very happy and lucky to be here, thanks to Ryan White and thanks to all the clinics in L.A.,\" he said. \"So please, help us help these 24,000 people.\"\n\nMario Perez, head of the county's HIV response programs, says the number of patients enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance has increased. That's part of the reason medical visits paid for under the Ryan White Program have dropped from about 33,500 to an estimated 24,000 this year, officials say.\n\nThe trends show the Affordable Care Act has \"worked as intended\" in L.A. County, Perez said.\n\nCutting back on the outpatient-care contracts will allow the federal money to be used for other services not covered by patients' health insurance.\n\nSupervisor Sheila Kuehl, whose district includes West Hollywood, said that among other things the federal funds could be freed up to help cover co-pays for doctors visits.\n\nabby.sewell@latimes.com\n\nFollow Abby Sewell on Twitter at @sewella for more county news.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Funds for HIV/AIDS healthcare contracts reduced by L.A.
