ASPEN — — EagleVail’s Mikaela Shiffrin made a big mistake and a remarkable recovery in the first of two runs of World Cup giant slalom Saturday and stands in 10th place going into the second run.

Shiffrin went down on her right hip but managed to stay on course.

“Somehow she made it back on her skis,” said Shiffrin’s agent, Kilian Albrecht, a former ski racer for Austria. “She’s a great athlete. Let’s just hope for a great second run.”

Without the bobble, Shiffrin probably would have been in second place behind pacesetter Eva-Marie Brem of Austria, who had the fastest first run by 1.14 seconds over the rest of the field. The second run is scheduled to start at 1 p.m.

Shiffrin said she has been battling a stomach illness.

“But my energy actually feels really good and has for the past few days,” Shiffrin said. “I don’t think that’s an issue today. I made kind of a stupid mistake coming onto the flats. My coach said be smart and be awake. I just went too straight, almost too awake a little bit. So, try to calm down a little bit for the second run and regroup. I feel like I made some good turns. It’s there. Just have to get it out on the hill.”
