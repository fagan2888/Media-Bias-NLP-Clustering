(AP) \u2014 Here\u2019s a roundup of news Saturday from the Television Critics Association summer meeting, at which TV networks and streaming services are presenting details on upcoming programs:\n\n\u2018DOWNTON ABBEY,\u2019 THE MOVIE?\n\nWith \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d coming to an end, its executive producer is offering hope that a follow-up movie is at least a possibility.\n\nBy ending the TV drama several years shy of the 1929 stock market crash, producer Gareth Neame said rich territory is left to be mined if a film is made.\n\nThere\u2019s no script or a firm plan, he said, but a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d movie could be a \u201cwonderful thing.\u201d Afterward, he told The Associated Press that such a project could be made as a big-screen theatrical release but reaffirmed it was speculative at this point.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s time for the series itself to end while it\u2019s still popular and acclaimed, Neame said.\n\nIts sixth and final season will begin airing in September in the U.K. and in January on PBS in the United States. Neame said the last season will bring back some faces from the past, but the focus of the final season is to wrap up story lines for the main cast.\n\nThe high-toned soap opera about the upstairs and downstairs occupants of a stately English mansion dealing with early 20th-century social change will end production Aug. 15.\n\nStudio scenes remain to be shot, but production at Highclere, the estate that stood in for Downton Abbey, wrapped recently.\n\n\u201cThat was a sort of interesting day,\u201d Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham, said of the final taping at Highclere. The cast and crew marked the occasion by taking a \u201cteam photo\u201d in the dining room, where the longest scenes were filmed.\n\n___\n\n\u2018DOWNTON ABBEY,\u2019 THE PARADE FLOAT\n\nMaggie Smith\u2019s character on \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d might find the pomp and circumstance uncomfortable, but the PBS show is getting its own float in the Rose Parade, two days before the premiere of its sixth and final season Jan. 3.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a beautiful send-off to the series and I think it\u2019s fun,\u201d said PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger.\n\nIn an interview with the AP, series star Michelle Dockery said she had never heard of the Rose Parade but joked there would be a lookalike of her riding the float.\n\nFunding for the float will come from PBS\u2019 marketing budget, unless a sponsor can be found, a PBS spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Rose Parade is held every year on New Year\u2019s Day in Pasadena, California.\n\n___\n\n\u2018SHERLOCK\u2019 FOREVER\n\n\u201cSherlock\u201d fans have grown familiar with the waiting game between TV seasons, but they may be encouraged that show-runner Steven Moffat says he could see it \u201cgoing on for a long while.\u201d\n\nMoffat said he and co-executive producer Mark Gatiss are game to keep going.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be us that switch it off. I imagine it\u2019ll be down to Benedict (Cumberbatch) and Martin (Freeman). Obviously we can\u2019t do the show without them, and they\u2019ve always said they\u2019re happy to carry on so long as it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nProduction on new episodes is expected to begin in the spring of 2016, but Cumberbatch and Freeman filmed a one-off episode set in the Victorian-era that has been rumored to air this Christmas in the U.K.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never said it\u2019s a Christmas special,\u201d said Moffat\u2019s wife and \u201cSherlock\u201d producer Sue Vertue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably Christmas-ish,\u201d added Moffat. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know. We\u2019re not making this up.\u201d\n\nThey decided to jump back in time for an episode because \u201cWe checked the books and discovered we got it wrong,\u201d joked Moffat. \u201cWe should have read them first. No, just because we can, really.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Downton\u2019 producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "title": "\u2018Downton\u2019 producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Downton\u2019 producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "title": "\u2018Downton\u2019 producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/02/downton_producer_open_to_possibility_of_big_screen_film/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/quotdownton-abbeyquot-photo-call.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Downton\u2019 producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "title": "\u2018Downton\u2019 producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/quotdownton-abbeyquot-photo-call.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "'Downton' producer open to possibility of big-screen film", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d coming to an end, its executive producer is offering hope that a follow-up movie is at least a possibility.\nStudio scenes remain to be shot, but production at Highclere, the estate that stood in for Downton Abbey, wrapped recently.\nThe Rose Parade is held every year on New Year\u2019s Day in Pasadena, California.\nIts sixth and final season will begin airing in September in the U.K. and in January on PBS in the United States.\nNeame said the last season will bring back some faces from the past, but the focus of the final season is to wrap up story lines for the main cast."}
