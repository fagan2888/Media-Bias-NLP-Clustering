Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, is proposing two bills to reform the state's health care infrastructure in the wake of Insure Tennessee's defeat.\n\nUnder one bill, Kelsey is proposing to allow Tennesseans to buy insurance plans that are for sale on insurance exchanges in other states. The open border approach \u2014 which would require agreements between states, according to the bill \u2014 would widen the breadth of plans from which Tennesseans could choose, Kelsey said.\n\nKelsey, who also is sponsoring a bill that would prevent Tennessee from establishing its own exchange, wants to see Tennesseans have access to the most affordable health care regardless of where the insurance plan is offered \u2014 and regardless of whether Tennesseans send money out of state to buy the plans.\n\n\"I'm concerned about getting Tennesseans the most affordable plan for their budget. That's more important to me than protecting insurance companies' bottom line,\" Kelsey said.\n\nA cross-border approach raises a bevy of questions and concerns, health care industry professionals say. \"We are evaluating the proposed legislation,\" said a spokesman for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which licenses health insurance companies in the state. Insurance companies are governed state by state \u2014 there is no federal agency that regulates insurance \u2014 so an insurance company could offer a plan from out of state and that may not necessarily meet Tennessee standards.\n\n\"It's a whole different ballgame in terms of regulatory oversight. You're depending on a foreign commissioner to provide oversight,\" said Richard Cowart, chairman of law firm Baker Donelson's health and public policy department.\n\nAnother concern that comes up with out-of-state plans is access to medical networks. \"Typically everybody stays within their own states,\" said Keith Dennen of law firm Dickinson Wright, emphasizing that network access becomes a question.\n\nInsurance companies with plans for sale in other states that opened to Tennessee residents would have to make sure Tennessee-based doctors were in their network, Kelsey said. He wants to see Tennesseans have broader access to choices but remains opposed to creating a state-run exchange if the King vs. Burwell case at the U.S. Supreme Court finds that tax credits are not available on the federal health insurance exchange.\n\nThe increased number of plans will make plans more affordable even if credits on the federal exchange are no longer available, he said. \"My goal is to address the health care problem in Tennessee and America by going the opposite way of Obamacare,\" Kelsey said. \"That's why I'm advocating both strategies at the same time: to attack Obamacare in the U.S. Supreme Court and to offer conservative reform to health care.\"\n\nKelsey's proposal is akin to legislation that U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is sponsoring that would allow interstate insurance exchanges.\n\nThe other bill would establish personal health savings accounts in lieu of Medicaid. The plan would credit federal money into participants' accounts that would be used for treatment. Kelsey said this would replace the traditional Medicaid and TennCare programs.\n\nThe proposal would not be effective upon passing the General Assembly. It would require an amendment to the TennCare waiver, said a spokeswoman for TennCare.\n\nKelsey wrote in an open letter to Tennessee's congressional delegates in Washington, D.C., that he wants them to pass laws bolstering state governance of health care and push for approval of block grants for Medicaid funding as antidotes to problems that hospitals and providers suffer under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKelsey has heard in the days after the Insure Tennessee defeat from \"many hospitals\" that are concerned that costs associated with uninsured patients will cause them to close. \"This was a problem caused by Washington, so I am requesting that Washington fix the problem,\" Kelsey wrote.\n\nBoth pieces of state legislation are reprisals. The cross-state option was proposed in 2010, while the personal health savings account bill was on the table in 2006. \"I plan to repropose now that we have a Republican majority in the Senate and the House,\" Kelsey told The Tennessean.\n\nKelsey was one of seven senators on the special session Senate Health and Welfare committee to vote against Insure Tennessee.\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 and on Twitter at @hollyfletcher.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1DVl1hz", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sen.
