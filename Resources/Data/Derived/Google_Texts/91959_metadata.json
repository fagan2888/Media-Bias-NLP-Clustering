Now that goal is shriveling under the weight of a concerted opposition from universities, lawmakers and bureaucrats in Obama\u2019s own administration.\n\nNearly two years after the president, standing before a crowd of 7,000 at the University at Buffalo, unveiled the bold proposal as a way to curb soaring college costs, his administration has quietly but drastically scaled back the initiative. No longer does the federal government intend to use a formula to score schools based on factors like price, average student debt and graduation rates, as Obama had envisioned.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nInstead, the new tool will allow prospective students to decide which factors are important to them, then draw their own conclusions from the statistics. But officials couldn\u2019t point to any new statistics the tool will offer that aren\u2019t already available through existing government websites.\n\nAbandoning the original plan marked the latest in a series of stumbles for Obama\u2019s education priorities. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama called for expanding access to pre-kindergarten to all American children, and in his 2015 address, he pushed a $60 billion plan to offer two years of free community college. Neither proposal has gained any traction.\n\nThe Education Department said it\u2019s still determining what the revised college tool will look like, but that it\u2019s still on track to roll it out by the start of the 2015-2016 academic year, roughly two months from now.\n\n\u201cIt is anything but a retreat,\u201d Education Department Undersecretary Ted Mitchell said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a retooling and, we think, an advance on the original concept.\u201d\n\nYet Obama\u2019s goal, as he described when he announced the plan in August 2013, was to create an alternative to private rankings like U.S. News and World Report whose formulas incentivize schools to \u201cgame the numbers\u201d and even raise costs. Instead, Obama sought a system that prioritized whether schools are enrolling and graduating poorer students and whether their graduates succeed in the workforce.\n\n\u201cI think we should rate colleges based on opportunity \u2014 are they helping students from all kinds of backgrounds succeed \u2014 and on outcomes, on their value to students and parents,\u201d Obama said. He took it a step further by proposing that Congress eventually tie a school\u2019s eligibility for federal financial aid to its score in the new ratings system.\n\nResistance to Obama\u2019s plan was swift, vehement and nearly universal.\n\nAssociations representing colleges with traditionally conflicting interests \u2014 such as community colleges and private universities \u2014 all lined up in opposition, warning the project was too complex, too subjective and too dependent on shoddy data to ever work fairly. As the Education Department mounted an extensive, lengthy listening tour across the country, college presidents warned of dire unintended consequences and implored the government to reconsider.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the proposal drew pushback not only from the president\u2019s traditional Republican foes, but also some Democrats. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a former education secretary and chair of the Senate\u2019s education panel, took to the Senate floor to threaten an amendment blocking the ratings system. And in the House, Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Democratic Rep. Michael Capuano of Massachusetts \u2014 two states with large numbers of colleges \u2014 joined forces to sponsor a resolution opposing Obama\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cDo I think they would have continued if no one had pushed back? Of course I do,\u201d Capuano said.\n\nDeclining graduation rates, skyrocketing student debt and a paltry job market for graduates has many in the education community looking for new ideas to restart America\u2019s colleges and universities.

In a blog post in December 2014, the Education Department said it was considering rating schools as high-performing, medium-performing or low-performing and outlined a few potential metrics, but disappointed many by failing to flesh out the formula it would use to assign ratings.\n\nDriving the decision to stick with a ratings system was Obama, who was dead-set on carrying out his original vision for the project, according to interviews with nearly a dozen congressional aides, administration officials and college association leaders. Many of them spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid criticizing the president publicly.\n\nFrom the start, career bureaucrats and data experts at the Education Department said the idea wasn\u2019t feasible, but met continued White House resistance, those officials said. Technical experts in the education industry that the administration consulted offered similar warnings. Eventually, higher-level Education Department officials grew convinced the plan was unworkable, and persuaded the White House to allow a scaled-back approach devoid of hard-and-fast ratings.\n\n\u201cWe are right where the president wanted us to be in terms of making progress toward his vision,\u201d said James Kvaal, deputy director of the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council.\n\nUniversity associations that had fought the proposal praised the Obama administration for taking their concerns seriously and eventually agreeing to abandon the initial plan, calling it a rare example of the government acknowledging its own missteps.\n\n\u201cThey really did listen on this,\u201d said Sarah Flanagan, the top lobbyist for the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. \u201cThe more they looked into it, they realized it wasn\u2019t doable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama dearly wanted to get the government in the business of rating colleges and universities based on value and affordability, promising a new system by 2015.
