A partnership with physician information platform Medscape, the program is designed to give healthcare professionals a chance to develop their business and leadership skills through online courses taught by Duke professors.\n\n\u201cHealthcare professionals are thrown into roles of leadership without training in the business aspects of healthcare, and yet they are expected to perform,\" said Ana Quinn, the developmental director of the Business of Healthcare Academy. \"We designed this program to provide them with the background that they need to better lead organizations and to confront new healthcare policy changes and the significant financial implications they carry.\u201d\n\nQuinn noted that the courses are designed to provide healthcare professionals with the fundamental knowledge needed to be competitive in today's complex healthcare.\n\nThe five courses\u2014each taught by a different member of the Duke faculty\u2014include Effective Leadership for the 21st Century, Strategic Management, Financial Decision Making and Healthcare Policy Studies. The courses are interactive and video-based, and each can be completed at the learner\u2019s pace. If an individual completes all five, he or she is eligible for a Duke-endorsed certificate.\n\nThe Academy was developed over four years to address recent changes in the American healthcare environment, Quinn said. Chief among these changes is the 2013 passage of the Affordable Care Act\u2014which led many healthcare professionals to seek a better understanding of medicine's new business environment. Duke created the Academy specifically to address these needs.\n\n\"Policy changes and financial concerns became the impetus for creating this program,\" said Quinn, who also serves as the business manager for the Duke Clinical Research Institute.\n\nQuinn noted that as program continues to develop and grow, more courses will be provided.\n\n\u201cThe courses were each designed for the busy healthcare professional who doesn\u2019t have the time to earn an MBA,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThe certificate takes a total of 24 hours to complete, but anyone doing the program can work at whatever pace they see fit.\u201d\n\nThe Academy is one of several interdisciplinary programs recently launched by Duke Medicine\u2014including the Duke Institute for Health Innovation, which opened in September 2013 after six years of planning and working to secure funds. The concept for the Academy was presented at DIHI's Summit on Transformative Innovation in Healthcare last Fall, shown as an example of an interdisciplinary solution to an issue in medicine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "title": "Business training offered to future doctors at Duke Med", "url": "http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2014/09/business-training-offered-future-doctors-duke-med", "image": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/dtc-ph.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DukeChronicle", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TheChronicle", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "TheChronicle", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc2c\"", "article_summary": "Business training offered to future doctors at Duke MedBy Adrian Gariboldi | Thursday, September 25 2014With the Affordable Healthcare Act changing the financial side of medicine, Duke has launched a new program to educate physicians about the business of healthcare.\n\u201cHealthcare professionals are thrown into roles of leadership without training in the business aspects of healthcare, and yet they are expected to perform,\" said Ana Quinn, the developmental director of the Business of Healthcare Academy.\nChief among these changes is the 2013 passage of the Affordable Care Act\u2014which led many healthcare professionals to seek a better understanding of medicine's new business environment.\nA partnership with physician information platform Medscape, the program is designed to give healthcare professionals a chance to develop their business and leadership skills through online courses taught by Duke professors.\nEarlier this month, the School of Medicine announced the launch of the Business of Health Care Academy."}
