Garry McCarthy said he has enough manpower at his disposal to combat the city's violent crime.\n\nMcCarthy made his comments during City Council budget hearings Thursday while defending police overtime costs for his \u201csaturation policy\u201d to fighting violent crime in designated \u201chot spot\u201d neighborhoods.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, McCarthy said police overtime costs currently stand at $70 million. McCarthy also estimated that those costs would reach $93 million by year's end. Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s 2014 budget, however, calls for hiring only enough to replace retiring officers.\n\n\n\nThe city's police department budgeted for 500 new hires last year, but Chicago aldermen believe 1,000 more new officers would both alleviate an understaffed workforce and keep overtime costs down.\n\nMcCarthy cites the reductions in overall violent crime and the homicide rate this year as proof to the contrary. \"We've got adequate resources, and we're making a difference,\" McCarthy said. Yet the murder rate is down only slightly from last year and is still the highest among major American cities.\n\nAld. Ricardo Munoz (22nd) is among a group of aldermen who want the city to allocate $50 million to hire 1,000 more cops and pointed to the current overtime rate to emphasize the point.\n\n\u201cTalk to any management consultant, and they will tell you an organization the size of the Police Department should have a 3 to 31/2 percent overtime budget,\" Munoz said during a break in the hearing, noting that the Police Department has a proposed budget next year of about $1.29 billion. \"We're looking at almost a 10 percent overtime budget here.\"\n\nMcCarthy's stance is markedly different from that of the Chicago Fire Department, which is holding its first firefighters entrance exam in eight years because of escalating overtime costs.\n\nThe Fire Department will spend an estimated $20 million in overtime costs this year and is projected to reach $35.3 million next year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chicagoist", "description": "Despite growing calls from local aldermen to hire more police officers, Chicago Police Supt.
