So instead of bringing on full-time employees, she relied on contract workers.\n\nShe is looking forward to getting price information online from the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, an exchange that was created by the new law. (Currently, business owners can obtain estimated SHOP prices online, but specific ones are only available by mail after filling out and mailing in a PDF downloaded from Healthcare.gov. Some states, including California, have their own SHOP exchanges, and their procedures vary.)\n\nMs. Petrou says the law could enable her to hire full-time employees, depending on the new costs of coverage. If so, she will either pay for a portion of the individual plans that her employees shop for on the exchange, or she may take advantage of tax credits and offer a small group plan. \u201cWe now have options to explore,\u201d she says.\n\nSome experts say this type of flexibility may have a big impact on the economy over all.\n\n\u201cAssuming we get the website working, it\u2019s going to be the biggest step we\u2019ve had in a long time in the U.S. in terms of changing the structure of the economy,\u201d says Craig Garthwaite, assistant professor of management and strategy at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. Mr. Garthwaite is a co-author of one of two recent studies that conclude that the Affordable Care Act could spur entrepreneurship by easing job lock \u2014 where people stay in a job mainly for the health insurance.\n\nThe act was aimed at people like Jeannie Armstrong, who in 2009 was planning to quit her job within a couple of years to start a private clinic for adolescents with substance-abuse problems. But then her 18-year-old son learned that he had diabetes. Fearing that he would be unable to find individual health insurance, she has stayed in her job so her son could keep receiving coverage under her employer\u2019s health plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking pre-existing condition, we\u2019re talking no money, we\u2019re talking health care costs out of the roof,\u201d Ms. Armstrong says of her son\u2019s situation.\n\nBut in January, her son will be eligible for individual health insurance. That will free Ms. Armstrong to quit her job as a social worker in the juvenile court system of Fairfax County, Va., and to pursue her entrepreneurial dreams. Now, instead of opening a for-profit clinic, Ms. Armstrong has decided to go the social-entrepreneurship route. In September, she founded the nonprofit Center to End Adolescent Substance Abuse Encounters.\n\nPhoto\n\nOver the next year, she plans to stay in her job while her son finishes school; in her free time, she will assemble a board of directors and write the organization\u2019s bylaws. By next fall, she plans to be running the nonprofit full time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hamstrung by having to stay in this job,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Armstrong sees the new law as an opportunity to start something new. But Kevin Kuhlman, manager of legislative affairs for the National Federation of Independent Business, says that while job lock is a real concern for entrepreneurs, he remains skeptical that the new law will be able to solve the problem.\n\nThe federation unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most people obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty, in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court last year. The plaintiffs were uninsured and didn\u2019t believe that the government could require them to buy insurance.\n\nCertainly, many established small-business owners are not clamoring for information on new health coverage. Barry Sloane, chairman and chief executive of Newtek Business Services, based in New York, says a majority of his customers\n\nhaven\u2019t bothered to visit the exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe negative publicity that\u2019s come out about the site not functioning has kept people from thinking they can go to it and get a result,\u201d Mr. Sloane says.\n\nSome small businesses aren\u2019t shopping the exchanges because they don\u2019t yet need to, he says. Businesses with fewer than 50 people will not be required to offer health insurance; those with 50 or more employees will have to do so, but not until 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmall-business owners are \u201cvery confused and they\u2019re very concerned,\u201d Mr. Sloane says. And those feelings are only intensifying amid news reports that just a tiny number of Americans have enrolled in the exchange plans and amid questions about the government\u2019s ability to keep enrollees\u2019 personal information secure. \u201cThe negative stigma around the Affordable Care Act is building steam,\u201d he says.\n\nA new crop of Internet companies, meanwhile, is convinced that Americans will need help navigating the new health care landscape. Benefitter, for example, based in San Francisco, provides business owners and individuals with information on the new law\u2019s requirements.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Young Entrepreneur Council, based in New York, is focusing on small-business owners and solo entrepreneurs with a website, StartupInsurance.com, that it founded in September. It offers health insurance plans from six carriers.\n\n\u201cWhether the government is in there or not, whether corporations are in there or not, this is a big void,\u201d Scott Gerber, the council\u2019s founder, says of health care insurance for the small-business market.\n\nJack Hooper is among those who see the law as a business opportunity. A former intelligence analyst for the federal government, he enrolled at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2012 and hoped to start a company after graduation. His wife, Brittany, was to provide financial support and health care benefits through her job while he got the business going, but when she became pregnant with twins, those plans collapsed.\n\nAs he began investigating his own health care options, he realized that the Affordable Care Act could provide more than just access to coverage for his family.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been a very stagnant industry, health insurance, is being shaken up and people are starting to re-evaluate their plans,\u201d Mr. Hooper says. He anticipates that premiums will remain expensive, pushing many Americans to high-deductible plans, and that these people will need help in managing care-related expenses.\n\nLast spring, he started a service called Command Health, which he describes as \u201ca Mint.com or TurboTax for high-deductible health insurance plans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBased on his previous experience working for the federal government, he says, he is not surprised by the problems that have emerged in the Healthcare.gov site. Entrepreneurs like him will end up providing the ultimate solutions to the problems that have emerged from the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Hooper says.\n\nMr. Jeyakumar of Skillbridge says of the law\u2019s rocky start: \u201cBeing a tech entrepreneur myself, I appreciate that technology is often not perfect in the first release, and a lot of great products from Facebook to eBay were buggy when they first came out.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cI think the concept is good, and as with anything, it\u2019s a wait-and-see on execution. If it works, great, and if not, we will fall back on existing alternatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131123152831, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for some people to start their own companies \u2014 including a mini-industry to help navigate the law itself.", "title": "In the Health Law, an Open Door for Entrepreneurs", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/business/in-the-health-law-an-open-door-for-entrepreneurs.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002566485"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/business/24-PROTO1/24-PROTO1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/business/in-the-health-law-an-open-door-for-entrepreneurs.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002566485", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/business/in-the-health-law-an-open-door-for-entrepreneurs.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "In the Health Law, an Open Door for Entrepreneurs", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 23, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Entrepreneurship,Labor and Jobs,Small Business,HealthCare.gov,Computers and the Internet", "news_keywords": "Entrepreneurship,HealthCare.gov", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Claire Martin", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/business/24-PROTO1/24-PROTO1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By CLAIRE MARTIN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for some people to start their own companies \u2014 including a mini-industry to help navigate the law itself.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/business/24-PROTO1/24-PROTO1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for some people to start their own companies \u2014 including a mini-industry to help navigate the law itself.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 23, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2014-07-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Computers and the Internet", "published": "2013-11-23", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "24proto", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140717144600, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/business/in-the-health-law-an-open-door-for-entrepreneurs.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/business/24-PROTO1/24-PROTO1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for some people to start their own companies \u2014 including a mini-industry to help navigate the law itself.", "title": "In the Health Law, an Open Door for Entrepreneurs"}, "pdate": 20131123, "des": "Computers and the Internet", "articleid": 100000002566485, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "In the Health Law, an Open Door for Entrepreneurs", "col": "Prototype", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn terms of hiring, the health care expenses contribute a huge, huge component to your cost of operation,\u201d Ms. Petrou says.\nA new crop of Internet companies, meanwhile, is convinced that Americans will need help navigating the new health care landscape.\nIt offers health insurance plans from six carriers.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been a very stagnant industry, health insurance, is being shaken up and people are starting to re-evaluate their plans,\u201d Mr. Hooper says.\nShe is looking forward to getting price information online from the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, an exchange that was created by the new law."}
