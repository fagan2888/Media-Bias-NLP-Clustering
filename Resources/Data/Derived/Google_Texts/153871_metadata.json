It\u2019s that lack of faith in government restraint that makes it difficult to do things like ask everybody to take a background check.\"Glaze also said that expanded background checks on gun buyers, which he fought for unsuccessfully last year, were unlikely to prevent mass murders like the slaughter in Isla Vista, California, over the Memorial Day weekend.\"Because people perceive a mismatch in the policy solutions that we have to offer and the way some of these mass shootings happened, you know, it is a messaging problem for us, I think. Is it a messaging problem when a mass shooting happens, and nothing that we have to offer would have stopped that mass shooting? Sure, it\u2019s a challenge in this issue.\"The Isla Vista gunman, Elliot Rodger, who killed six people during the random shooting in the beachside college community, was armed with three legally purchased handguns registered to him and 41 loaded magazines.Glaze also told the Journal that it could take \"an election cycle or two\" before Congress would be willing to enact gun controls.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bloomberg, Mark Glaze, gun control", "pubdate": "2014-06-17T08:44:00", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The former chief of Michael Bloomberg's anti-gun group has blamed the failed rollout of Obamacare and fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for hurting gun control.", "title": "Bloomberg Anti-Gun Group Ex-Chief: Obamacare, Snowden Hurt Cause", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Bloomberg-Mark-Glaze-gun-control/2014/06/17/id/577497/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=fd6c7939-7261-4407-ac2b-609de25e39c8&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Bloomberg-Mark-Glaze-gun-control/2014/06/17/id/577497/", "title": "Bloomberg Anti-Gun Group Ex-Chief: Obamacare, Snowden Hurt Cause", "description": "The former chief of Michael Bloomberg's anti-gun group has blamed the failed rollout of Obamacare and fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for hurting gun control.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1402994640, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Bloomberg, Mark Glaze, gun control", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-06-17T08:44:00"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Bloomberg-Mark-Glaze-gun-control/2014/06/17/id/577497/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The former chief of Michael Bloomberg's anti-gun group has blamed the failed rollout of Obamacare and fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for hurting gun control."}, "article_summary": "Is it a messaging problem when a mass shooting happens, and nothing that we have to offer would have stopped that mass shooting?\nIt\u2019s that lack of faith in government restraint that makes it difficult to do things like ask everybody to take a background check.\n\"There\u2019s an almost perfect overlap, I think, between the people who are the most active and radicalized gun voters and people who just don\u2019t like and trust the government very much,\" Glaze told the newspaper.\nSure, it\u2019s a challenge in this issue.\n\"The fact that people have learned that the government has taken for itself the right to listen in on our most private conversations has done nothing to inspire faith in government restraint."}
