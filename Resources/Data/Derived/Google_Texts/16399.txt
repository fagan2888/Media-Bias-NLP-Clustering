UPDATE 12:21 A.M.

According to FHP reports, 20-year-old Michael Roberts was traveling north bound on U.S. 331, while a second driver 55-year-old Robert Wilson, and a third driver 47-year-old Karen Cordell were driving south bound on U.S. 331.

Roberts began drifting into the path of Wilson, and at that time Wilson veered his car to the right, and the two of them collided.

That sent Wilson's car to roll several times.

The impact of the collision between the two cars also sent them to hit Cordell's passenger side of her car.

Wilson was pronounced dead at Healthmark Hospital in DeFuniak Springs.

The investigation is ongoing.
