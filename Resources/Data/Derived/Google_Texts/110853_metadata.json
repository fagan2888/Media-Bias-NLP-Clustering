While beanie burgers are tasty in their own way, the Stanford professor understands that they are a far cry from a Kobe steak. After testing out various models of meatless patties, Brown has finally revealed what he believes may be the key to the perfect synthetic burger: synthetic blood. Now, why didn\u2019t we think of that?\n\nEvelyn Rusli, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, was one of the first members of the public to try out this ultimate veggie burger, which was dubbed \u201cversion 4.0.\u201d According to Rusli, the burger has \u201cthe consistency of animal tissue\u201d and tastes slightly \u201cless bloody\u201d than a gourmet New York City burger. Samir Kaul, a general partner at Khlosla Ventures, a firm backing the Impossible burger, had a different take on the burger\u2019s taste, describing it as \u201cbetter than a turkey burger,\" as reported by The Wall Street Journal blog.\n\nNow while this synthetic blood is a far cry from the bottles of True Blood made popular on the HBO original series, it\u2019s no less worth admiration. According to The Week, the blood looks and tastes like real animal blood but is actually made from plant matter. When combined with the plant-based faux meat, you get a burger which looks, smells, cooks, and course, even tastes like a real hamburger.\n\nAs much as omnivores may try to deny it, vegetarians may be onto something with this whole meatless diet. Eating meat is bad, no matter how you want to look at it. The consumption of red meat is closely tied to increased risks of developing cancer. Apart from killing us, eating meat is also destroying the planet. The Guardian reported that if meat production doubles, by the late 2040s, cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens will be responsible for about as much climate change impact as all the word\u2019s cars, trucks, and aircrafts.\n\nConsidering that the world\u2019s population is expected to be around 9.5 billion by 2060, this prediction will most surely become a reality. Recently, we\u2019ve learned that a little bit of carbon emission can go a long way. In 2012, Brown told the news outlet that his goal was to \u201creduce the human footprint on this planet by 50 percent,\u201d and now, with his synthetic blood creation, this goal seems closer than ever to completion.\n\nBrown\u2019s three-year-old start-up, Impossible Foods, is behind the veggie burger \u201c4.0.\u201d To date, the company has already raised around $75 million in venture capital, and it is backed by many companies, such as Khlosa Ventures and even Bill Gates. Currently, it costs around $20 to produce a single patty, but Brown and his colleagues hope that with further innovations they can get this price to be nearly on par, or even less than the cost of a beef burger.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "perfect, veggie, burger, needs, fake, blood, biochem, professor, strives, concoct, meat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Stanford Biochemistry Professor Dr. Patrick Brown's burger looks, tastes, even bleeds like real meat but is actually made completely of plants.", "title": "Your Veggie Burger Could Probably Use More Fake Blood", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/perfect-veggie-burger-needs-fake-blood-biochem-professor-strives-concoct-meat-substitute-306550", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/08/burgers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stanford Biochemistry Professor Dr. Patrick Brown's burger looks, tastes, even bleeds like real meat but is actually made completely of plants.", "title": "Your Veggie Burger Could Probably Use More Fake Blood", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/perfect-veggie-burger-needs-fake-blood-biochem-professor-strives-concoct-meat-substitute-306550", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/08/burgers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/08/burgers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-10-08T13:02:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-08T13:02:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Stanford Biochemistry Professor Dr. Patrick Brown's burger looks, tastes, even bleeds like real meat but is actually made completely of plants."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1378\"", "article_summary": "After testing out various models of meatless patties, Brown has finally revealed what he believes may be the key to the perfect synthetic burger: synthetic blood.\nNow while this synthetic blood is a far cry from the bottles of True Blood made popular on the HBO original series, it\u2019s no less worth admiration.\nAccording to The Week, the blood looks and tastes like real animal blood but is actually made from plant matter.\nDr. Patrick Brown knows that the perfect veggie hamburger needs to not only impress the vegetarians of the world but also win over the meat-lovers.\nWhen combined with the plant-based faux meat, you get a burger which looks, smells, cooks, and course, even tastes like a real hamburger."}
