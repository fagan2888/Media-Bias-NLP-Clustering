Photo courtesy of Victoria Wilcher Facebook\n\nEarlier this month, the story of a little girl who was asked to leave a KFC because her facial scars were \u201cdisrupting customers\u201d went viral on the Internet. Then, a week later, reports flooded the Internet that the scandal was nothing more than a hoax. Not exactly happy to be publicly portrayed as liars, the family of Victoria Wilcher has politely turned down the restaurant\u2019s $30,000 donation money.\n\nWhen reports first emerged of the sad story involving young Victoria\u2019s Wilcher\u2019s KFC ordeal, the fast-food restaurant chain immediately gave the family a public apology and offered them a $30,000 donation. Later, after reports that the sad story may in fact have been largely false, KFC pulled an honorable move by refusing to withdraw its monetary gift to the toddler.\n\nStill, the young girl will not be receiving a single penny of the donation because the family \u201cdidn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to accept it after everything KFC had done,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney, Bill Kellum told The Jackson Clarion-Ledger. The girl\u2019s grandmother, Kelly Mullins, insists that her tale of unacceptable customer service is wholly truthful and says she's received an angry public reaction after rumors of it being a hoax emerged. To say the least, Mullins remains upset over the entire ordeal.\n\nThe family may not personally want the hefty donation, but they do have some ideas of how the money could be rightfully spent. \u201cWe did tell them they were more than welcome to donate the money to the Frank Stile Foundation,\u201d Kellum explained. This is the charity of Las Vegas plastic surgeon who has agreed to operate on young Victoria free of charge. Florida\u2019s Center for Custom Prosthetics has offered to provide Wilcher with a prostestic eye to replace the one lost in the vicious dog attack.\n\nIt turns out that the family doesn\u2019t actually need KFC\u2019s donation, which is dwarfed in comparison to numbers raised by the public via Victoria\u2019s GoFundME site. Prior to the young girl\u2019s incident, the donation web page had only managed to raise a total of $595. After the incident became public, more than $135,000 was raised via the online donation site, Gawker reported. The family will make sure that \u201cevery cent goes towards Victoria getting better,\u201d Kellum told The Jackson Clarion-Ledger. \u201cThe family is committed to having the money put in a discretionary trust account for Victoria with a third-party, non-family member designated as the trustee.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "family, girl, kicked, out, kfc, facial, scars, turns, down, restaurants, compensation, money", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The family of Victoria Wilcher, the young girl allegedly asked to leave a KFC due to her facial scars, has turned down the restaurant's $30,000 donation.", "title": "Family Of Girl Booted From KFC Rejects $30K Compensation", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/family-girl-kicked-out-kfc-facial-scars-turns-down-restaurants-compensation-money-291452", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/wilcher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The family of Victoria Wilcher, the young girl allegedly asked to leave a KFC due to her facial scars, has turned down the restaurant's $30,000 donation.", "title": "Family Of Girl Booted From KFC Rejects $30K Compensation", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/family-girl-kicked-out-kfc-facial-scars-turns-down-restaurants-compensation-money-291452", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/wilcher.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/wilcher.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-07-03T17:50:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T17:50:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The family of Victoria Wilcher, the young girl allegedly asked to leave a KFC due to her facial scars, has turned down the restaurant's $30,000 donation."}, "article_summary": "Victoria Wilcher's family doesn't personally want KFC's monetary donation but has suggested a charity they would like it to be sent to.\nNot exactly happy to be publicly portrayed as liars, the family of Victoria Wilcher has politely turned down the restaurant\u2019s $30,000 donation money.\nThis is the charity of Las Vegas plastic surgeon who has agreed to operate on young Victoria free of charge.\nPhoto courtesy of Victoria Wilcher FacebookEarlier this month, the story of a little girl who was asked to leave a KFC because her facial scars were \u201cdisrupting customers\u201d went viral on the Internet.\nThe family may not personally want the hefty donation, but they do have some ideas of how the money could be rightfully spent."}
