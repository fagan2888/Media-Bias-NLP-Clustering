Infectious diseases have always been a formidable threat in areas without access to certain medicines, but after the discovery of antibiotics, developed countries significantly dropped the rate at which infectious diseases killed people.\n\nThese diseases are making a comeback, however, and it is totally our own fault.\n\nMedicated Meat\n\nAccording to a new government-backed report, medicine-resistant infections will kill more people every year than cancer by 2050. Resistant infections including new strains of E. coli, malaria, and tuberculosis caused an estimated 700,000 deaths globally this year, but the scientists warn that number will be around 10 million if action is not taken. The study, called the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, was commissioned by David Cameron and led by Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and chairman.\n\nMedicine-resistant infections will not only be killing more, but they will also cost the world $100 trillion (yes, trillion with a \u201ct\u201d) annually. The report points to the use of antibiotics in agriculture as the main culprit behind the drug-resistant infection uprising, warning that the practice should be cut back or even banned. This concerning trend even extended to \u201clast resort\u201d antibiotics \u2014 the last line of defense for humans that cannot be replaced when ineffective.\n\n\u201cI find it staggering that in many countries, most of the consumption of antibiotics is in animals rather than humans,\u201d Jim O\u2019Neill told The Guardian. \u201cThis creates a bid resistance risk for everyone, which was highlighted by the recent Chinese finding of resistance to colistin, an important last-resort antibiotic that has been used extensively in animals.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill said scientific evidence has supported the curtailing of antibiotic use in agriculture, and it\u2019s about time for policymakers to act on it.\n\n\u201cWe need to radically reduce global use of antibiotics, and to do this we need world leaders to agree to an ambitious target to lower levels, along with restricting the use of antibiotics important to humans.\u201d\n\nThe experts involved in the study argued that there should be an agreed level of antibiotic use per kilogram of livestock. They also raised concerns over pollution \u2014 antimicrobial manufacture produces waste, and that waste is often discharged into water courses, causing a \u201cparticular risk for resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe routine and regular pumping of antibiotics into animals is deeply dangerous in that it creates resistance to drugs that are key to modern medicine and key to our lives and livelihoods,\u201d said Nicholas Stern, president of the British Academy. \u201cIt is a classic example of short-term private interest conflict with medium-term public good. In this case, the private gains are modest and the public damage is huge. It requires coordinated public action.\u201d\n\nOur Own Worst Enemy\n\nThough it may prove to be the most damaging, this superbug scare is certainly not the first time humans have been the architects of their own health troubles. We\u2019ve been causing issues for hundreds of years, really.\n\nBeginning with the Industrial Revolution, altering our environment is the first way we managed to hurt our own health. The effects of air pollution have been well documented, and include respiratory irritation, breathing difficulties, and coughing and wheezing. These symptoms are exacerbated in those already suffering from an underlying cardiovascular disease, and in children and the elderly. Continued exposure can result in loss of long capacity, development of diseases like asthma, and a shortened life span.\n\nThough pollution is mostly caused by large factories and businesses, individual lifestyle choices can have a powerful effect on one\u2019s health as well. Whether its smoking, poor diet, overuse of alcohol, unprotected sex, or lack of physical activity, humans commit a myriad of offenses against their own bodies.\n\nLack of exercise and poor diet can lead to obesity, which in turn can be a factor in the development of heart disease and diabetes. Abuse of alcohol harms the liver, and the harmful effects of smoking have been so publicized that it became one of the few semi-success stories in the book of human-caused health issues. Many countries have banned smoking in public areas and around minors, significantly reducing the presence of secondhand smoke, and taxes on cigarettes have been implemented in an attempt to discourage smokers.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to police every individual\u2019s behavior to conform to healthy standards, countrywide legislation against harmful practices (such as the use of antibiotics in livestock) has a chance to save us from ourselves.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "antibiotic, resistance, just, became, public, enemy, number, one, will, likely, kill, more", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here's why the antibiotic-resistance scare is our problem and what we can do to stop it.", "title": "New Killer Will Top Cancer By 2050, And It's Totally Our Own Fault", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/antibiotic-resistance-just-became-public-enemy-number-one-will-likely-kill-more-367140", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/livestock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's why the antibiotic-resistance scare is our problem and what we can do to stop it.", "title": "New Killer Will Top Cancer By 2050, And It's Totally Our Own Fault", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/antibiotic-resistance-just-became-public-enemy-number-one-will-likely-kill-more-367140", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/livestock.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/livestock.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-29T11:23:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-29T11:22:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here's why the antibiotic-resistance scare is our problem and what we can do to stop it."}, "article_summary": "Medicated MeatAccording to a new government-backed report, medicine-resistant infections will kill more people every year than cancer by 2050.\nSome ailments have been global terrors for a very long time \u2014 heart disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS, for example.\nThe study, called the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, was commissioned by David Cameron and led by Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and chairman.\nThis concerning trend even extended to \u201clast resort\u201d antibiotics \u2014 the last line of defense for humans that cannot be replaced when ineffective.\nBeginning with the Industrial Revolution, altering our environment is the first way we managed to hurt our own health."}
