The recent \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d seems to exist so that Robert De Niro can say the \u201cN-word\u201d on-screen and stick his flaccid penis in Zac Efron\u2019s face. Its director, Dan Mazer, is an Oscar nominee. Was this the kind of movie he dreamed of making when he got into film?\n\nBut in the case of \u201cZoolander 2,\u201d it\u2019s hard to fathom why anyone wanted to make this particular version of it. There\u2019s no reason the movie had to be this terrible. \u201cZoolander 2\u201d was written by four people who have done much better things. Nicholas Stoller made \u201cNeighbors\u201d and \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall.\u201d John Hamburg wrote and directed the underrated \u201cI Love You, Man,\u201d a touching and observant bromance. Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux were two-thirds of the team behind \u201cTropic Thunder,\u201d one of the more audacious Hollywood satires of the past decade. Your opinions on seeing Robert Downey Jr. in blackface may vary, but you cannot say the film lacks gumption.\n\nMany of these comic talents were behind the original \u201cZoolander,\u201d a charming dumb-smart comedy marred by its unfortunate release date. The film, about an assassination plot foiled by male models, debuted in theaters just two weeks after Sept. 11. Since no one wanted to see a terrorist comedy, \u201cZoolander\u201d performed very modestly in theaters\u2014en route to becoming a cult classic on DVD.\n\nFor Stiller and co., getting a do-over must have felt like a shot at redemption, like Rocky climbing the stairs of the Philadelphia Art Museum before the title match. It\u2019s just too bad the end result is the exact opposite: falling down and hitting every single step along the way. \u201cZoolander 2\u201d never, ever finds its rhythm, like a badly dubbed foreign film that always feels a beat behind. Some scenes sag under the weight of bad material, while others feel as if the writers forgot to add the actual jokes.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good sign when a movie scores its biggest laughs in the first five minutes. \u201cZoolander 2\u201d begins promisingly enough. The world\u2019s pop stars are being systematically killed off, with Justin Bieber (playing himself) marking the most recent casualty in the celebrity serial murders. Before he dies, Bieber snaps one last selfie in his final moments, taking painstaking care to select the proper Instagram filter to document his untimely death. The premiere of TV\u2019s \u201cScream Queens\u201d featured a similar gag spoofing millennial narcissism in the face of tragedy, and the joke is still funny.\n\nThe rest of \u201cZoolander 2\u201d lacks any real comic bite\u2014or much of a reason to exist. \u201cZoolander 2\u201d details Derek Zoolander\u2019s (Stiller) quest to climb back to the top of the modeling industry, more than a decade after he left the fashion world in disgrace. His ex-wife, Matilda (Christine Taylor), was killed when the Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can\u2019t Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too collapsed immediately after it was built. His son, Derek Jr., was subsequently taken away by Child Protective Services. By teaming up with a sexy Interpol agent (a wasted Penelope Cruz) to find the culprit behind the killings, Zoolander can not only get Derek Jr. back but also prove he\u2019s still got it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brimming with wasted talent and mean-spirited jokes, \"Zoolander 2\" fails to reignite the old magic", "title": "\u201cZoolander\u201d hasn\u2019t aged well: This weirdly conservative, un-funny sequel betrays the original comedy\u2019s roots", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brimming with wasted talent and mean-spirited jokes, \"Zoolander 2\" fails to reignite the old magic", "title": "\u201cZoolander\u201d hasn\u2019t aged well: This weirdly conservative, un-funny sequel betrays the original comedy\u2019s roots", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/11/zoolander_hasnt_aged_well_this_weirdly_conservative_un_funny_sequel_betrays_the_original_comedys_roots/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/zoolander2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brimming with wasted talent and mean-spirited jokes, \"Zoolander 2\" fails to reignite the old magic", "title": "\u201cZoolander\u201d hasn\u2019t aged well: This weirdly conservative, un-funny sequel betrays the original comedy\u2019s roots", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/zoolander2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ben stiller, Comedy, Movies, Owen Wilson, penelope cruz, zoolander, Zoolander 2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: ben stiller, Comedy, Movies, Owen Wilson, penelope cruz, zoolander, Zoolander 2, Entertainment NewsWhen I watch some bad movies, I cannot figure out why they were made.\nHis son, Derek Jr., was subsequently taken away by Child Protective Services.\nSince no one wanted to see a terrorist comedy, \u201cZoolander\u201d performed very modestly in theaters\u2014en route to becoming a cult classic on DVD.\nMany of these comic talents were behind the original \u201cZoolander,\u201d a charming dumb-smart comedy marred by its unfortunate release date.\nBut in the case of \u201cZoolander 2,\u201d it\u2019s hard to fathom why anyone wanted to make this particular version of it."}
