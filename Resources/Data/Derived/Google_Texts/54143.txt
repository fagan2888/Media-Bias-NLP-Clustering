Huron, SD

This weekend, a fairly new outdoor aquatic facility hosts its first state championship meet for hundreds of swimmers. It's a large event for the three-year-old Splash Central Waterpark in Huron.

Family members and coaches cheer from the sidelines as athletes, ranging from kids to young adults, take a leap into statewide competition. Even though this isn't the first meet Splash Central has hosted, Huron Parks and Recreation Swim Coach Bonnie Biel says it's an important event.

"We do the State B Basketball tournament, so we have had large competitions here in town, but nothing that has showcased our pool, our facility like this," Biel said.

It's a pool receiving high praise from other coaches, including the Sioux Falls Seals' Chad Dillon.

"This is one of the best facilities we have in the state," Dillon said. "So they've put a lot of money into this place, and it really shows. So, just from deck space around the pool to eight lane, full 50 meter distance, which is the Olympic size pool, it's really nice to have that."

Dillon says he also enjoys that the facility is outdoors.

With hundreds of people in Huron for today's swim meet, it's an economic boost for the city.

"All of these families staying in town and eating at restaurants and shopping here, you know, is a real big boost for our economy," Biel said.

The meet is also a chance for swimmers around the state to showcase their talent, including the relay team of Lizzy Spaans, Kristina Pike, Katie Dinsmore, and Corinne Pelzer. The four teens raced their way into the state record books Friday night with the fastest 200 freestyle relay since 1977. Dinsmore says she's enjoying competing in Huron.

"It's my favorite pool in South Dakota, definitely, because it's a really nice facility, and the water's really fast, so it makes everyone just swim fast I guess," Dinsmore said.

Causing these girls and many others to make a splash in the state championship.
