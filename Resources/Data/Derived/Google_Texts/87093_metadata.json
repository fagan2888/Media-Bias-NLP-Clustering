But the Wallingford company still has a ways to go to achieve long-term sustainability.\n\nThe nonprofit insurer lost $28 million in 2014 and lost $9.5 million in the first six months of this year. CEO Ken Lalime said early losses are not unusual for a new company, and said HealthyCT has the capital to get through the initial, unprofitable years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re in a good position,\u201d Lalime said when asked about the company\u2019s viability.\n\nAsked when the company needs to start turning a profit, Lalime said probably in the next year to 18 months.\n\n\u201cI think we have the capital to make it through that time without a difficulty,\u201d he said, adding that he expected the company would become profitable in that time.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a need or an expectation, obviously that only tells itself out over time,\u201d Lalime said.\n\nHealthyCT was one of 23 CO-OPs \u2013 consumer oriented and operated plans \u2013 that launched with $2.4 billion in federal money made available through the 2010 health law. HealthyCT received $129 million in federal loans for both start-up costs and to meet capital requirements. Insurance regulators require that carriers have certain levels of capital and surplus to ensure they will be able to pay claims.\n\nRelated: CT\u2019s newest insurer emphasizes its differences. Will that win customers?\n\nCO-OPs came about through a compromise hatched during negotiations over the health law, a way to appease liberals who had pushed for a public insurance option. While boosters touted the idea of nonprofits to compete with for-profit insurers, others were skeptical that the new companies would survive.\n\nFederal auditors reported earlier this year that most of the CO-OPs hadn\u2019t met their initial enrollment and profitability projections in 2014, the first year they offered coverage. The auditors warned that low enrollment and financial losses could limit the ability of some to repay their loans and remain viable.\n\nAnd as of this week, 12 of the 23 CO-OPs had either closed or announced plans to shut down.\n\nThe future of the remaining 11 remains to be seen, noted Scott E. Harrington, a professor of health care management and insurance and risk management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. He has studied and written about CO-OPs.\n\nHarrington reviewed HealthyCT\u2019s most recent filing with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which covered the period that ended June 30. \u201cRelative to some of the others, they\u2019re not so bad,\u201d he said.\n\nA key factor in any CO-OP's viability, Harrington said, is likely to be slow growth, allowing a new insurer to learn as it grows. The worst thing that could happen to a CO-OP, he said, would be to price their plans so low they generate a lot of business \u2013 meaning they insure thousands of people at prices that don\u2019t cover the costs.\n\n\u201cAny CO-OP, including this one, in order to survive, they really have to hit a sweet spot where they can get their price high enough to be able to cover their claims and administrative expenses, but still generate some growth in business,\u201d Harrington said.\n\nHealthyCT did grow slowly, although not by design. In 2014, the company aimed for 25,000 members but ended the year with 7,966, according to a recent filing. The company had some of the highest prices on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT.\n\nBut in 2015, the company lowered its premiums \u2013 making its prices among the lowest on the exchange \u2013 and grew membership. As of June 30, HealthyCT had 31,212 members, according to the filing. Lalime said this week it\u2019s up to more than 36,000.\n\nThe open enrollment period for 2016 coverage is going on now, and this time, HealthyCT doesn\u2019t have the same price advantage compared to its competitors as it did in 2015. The Connecticut Insurance Department required the company to raise its 2016 premiums to a higher level than HealthyCT proposed to ensure that they would generate enough income to pay medical claims.\n\nInsurance Department spokeswoman Donna Tommelleo said the agency meets with HealthyCT regularly. \u201cWe closely monitor its financial health, business plan and objectives, as we do with all carriers,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the failed CO-OPs\u2019 problems have been attributed to changes in a federal program intended to limit the risk insurance companies took in the early years of Obamacare. Many insurers had been counting on substantial payments from the \u201crisk corridor\u201d program, but the federal government recently announced that it would pay only about 12 percent of the funds companies had been expecting.\n\nLalime said HealthyCT had been expecting a relatively small payout from the program and hadn\u2019t counted the money on its balance sheet, minimizing the impact of the federal funding change.\n\nThe company has had other potential advantages. While some CO-OPs had to pay to use other companies\u2019 health care provider networks, HealthyCT built its own. Getting doctors to sign on was eased by the fact that the company was created by the Connecticut State Medical Society and the medical society\u2019s association of independent physician practices, which Lalime used to run.\n\nIn addition, HealthyCT sells insurance through the state\u2019s large-group market, broadening its potential customer base beyond the exchange.\n\nLalime said the company\u2019s enrollment projections for exchange customers are more modest for 2016, since many customers are price-sensitive. The company is counting on growth, but expects most of it will occur outside the exchange.\n\nA significant portion of HealthyCT\u2019s capital is actually money loaned by the federal government. If that money were counted as obligations, the company\u2019s obligations would exceed assets and receivables by about $60 million, Harrington said. But he noted that those loans don\u2019t have to be paid back for many years, and can only be repaid with approval from state regulators. And he said it was widely expected that it would take time for CO-OPs to build up the capital from their own earnings to be able to start repaying the loans.\n\n\u201cAs a practical matter, if one of them survives long enough for those loans to start being due, and they were at least turning some sort of profit, I\u2019m virtually positive they would be renegotiated and there would be an arrangement made to extend the window,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat would Harrington watch for to track CO-OPs' viability? In a year, he said, he\u2019d want to see a significant reduction in operating losses and a trend toward modest growth.\n\n\u201cA year from now, we should know a lot more,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/11/13/cts-insurance-co-op-sticking-around-but-still-a-work-in-progress/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, CO-OP, Connecticut Insurance Department, healthyct, insurance, Ken Lalime", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/11/13/cts-insurance-co-op-sticking-around-but-still-a-work-in-progress/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The nonprofit insurer lost $28 million in 2014 and, as of June 30, had lost $9.5 million this year.
