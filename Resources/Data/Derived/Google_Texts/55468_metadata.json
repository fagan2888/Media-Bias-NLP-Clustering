The Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, in Denver, has challenged the law\u2019s contraceptive-coverage mandate; this might make more sense if the nuns did not already have a way around the mandate: they just have to fill out a form saying the home has a religious mission and objection to paying for contraceptives. The essence of their challenge is that, by saying so, they become complicit\u2014because then others will make sure that their employees have coverage. (The insurance company pays for it, with some help from the government.) They asked for an emergency stay from the Supreme Court before the mandate was to go into effect on January 1st, after losing an appeal, writing in their filing,\n\nWithout an emergency injunction, Mother Provincial Loraine Marie Maguire has to decide between two courses of action: (a) sign and submit a self-certification form, thereby violating her religious beliefs; or (b) refuse to sign the form and pay ruinous fines.\n\nAt issue was \u201cMother Loraine\u2019s religious belief that God does not want her to sign and tender the forms.\u201d On New Year\u2019s Eve, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who deals with such requests for the Tenth Circuit, gave the nuns their stay. She said that the Department of Health and Human Services had until Friday at 10 A.M. to file its response.\n\nIs there any other form of health care around which one could build a suit based on the supposed taint of proximity? The suggestion here is that birth control has such a dirtiness to it that even the formal and financial separation of religious employers from the coverage\u2014they don\u2019t manage it, they don\u2019t pay for it, even though their employees get it\u2014is inadequate. (Purely religious institutions, like churches, have an even broader exemption.) They know about it\u2014know, that is, that the women who work for them have choices that they would prefer they did not have. But they do have them; a Catholic charity can\u2019t insist that the nurses or cleaning women who work for it don\u2019t use contraceptives. (The home has sixty-seven employees.) What the religious-affiliated groups are insisting is that the women bear a heavier economic cost for the sake of their employers\u2019 beliefs\u2014even though the Church groups wouldn\u2019t pay more either way.\n\nIn that sense, the suit embodies the irrationally passionate objections to not only Obamacare but also women\u2019s access to contraceptives and, more broadly, reproductive rights. There is, perhaps, an argument to be made that the true irrationality is having a national scheme of health insurance built around employer-based plans, rather than, say, a single payer. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got, and what women who go out in the workforce and the world have to live with.\n\nOther religious organizations have filed similar challenges; often, they argue that certain types of birth control, like Plan B, are really forms of abortion, though that\u2019s not how they work scientifically. It\u2019s also the case that women take certain kinds of birth-control pills for medical reasons that don\u2019t have to do with preventing pregnancy\u2014they are simply a prescription drug for which they would have to pay, essentially, an ideological tax. These suits are distinct from one brought by Hobby Lobby, a chain of craft stores, that the Supreme Court recently agreed to hear. Hobby Lobby is a secular company, and is asking for an exemption from buying plans that cover contraceptives because of the personal beliefs of its owners. (I wrote about the Hobby Lobby case in November.) But they share a presumption that there is something distinctly alarming about contraception, or at least about women not having to pay out of pocket for it. And yet the legal logic would seem to open the doors to a whole range of ideological objections to various medical treatments.\n\nThere are broader absurdities, too: can a private company also withhold taxes that will be used in ways that repel its owners? Does being exempt also mean being able to disrupt? The nuns\u2019 petition said that to just fill out the form letting their insurer know they qualified so it could proceed was to \u201cabandon their religious convictions and participate in the government\u2019s system to distribute and subsidize contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs and devices.\u201d It is worth noting that, according to the filing, fully half of the funds the nuns use to run their home, according to their filing, come \u201cfrom government payments (chiefly Medicaid and Medicare) for the care they provide to the needy elderly.\u201d\n\nIt is a good guess that the litigation surrounding Obamacare will still be tangled when healthcare.gov, the Web site that seems to have put its worst, early days behind it, is an old and reliable machine. But people have begun to be covered now; these are the months when we will begin to see what it looks like, and what works badly or well, and what could be better. When does the goal of the debate around Obamacare become about a healthier nation with fewer bankruptcies caused by illnesses, rather than about sparing employers\u2019 feelings about what women might be doing in their own homes and doctors\u2019 offices?\n\nPhotograph by Nieves Mares Pagan/Getty.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160524162657, "description": "The suit suggests that birth control has such a dirtiness to it that even the formal and financial separation of religious employers from coverage is \u2026", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "The suit suggests that birth control has such a dirtiness to it that even the formal and financial separation of religious employers from coverage is \u2026", "title": "Nuns Against the Obamacare Mandate - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/182929833-580.jpg", "height": 382}, "updated_time": "2014-07-16T15:25:04-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nuns-against-the-obamacare-mandate", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The suit suggests that birth control has such a dirtiness to it that even the formal and financial separation of religious employers from coverage is \u2026", "creator": "@tnyCloseRead", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/182929833-580.jpg", "title": "Nuns Against the Obamacare Mandate - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"1597141\",\"title_alt\":\"Nuns Against the Obamacare Mandate\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/01\\/182929833-580-580-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Amy Davidson", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-01-02T18:50:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T15:25:04-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 1597141, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Health-Care Reform, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd79\"", "article_summary": "In that sense, the suit embodies the irrationally passionate objections to not only Obamacare but also women\u2019s access to contraceptives and, more broadly, reproductive rights.\nBut they do have them; a Catholic charity can\u2019t insist that the nurses or cleaning women who work for it don\u2019t use contraceptives.\nThey know about it\u2014know, that is, that the women who work for them have choices that they would prefer they did not have.\nShe said that the Department of Health and Human Services had until Friday at 10 A.M. to file its response.\nIs there any other form of health care around which one could build a suit based on the supposed taint of proximity?"}
