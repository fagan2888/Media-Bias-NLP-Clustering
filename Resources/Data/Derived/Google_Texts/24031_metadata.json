SCOTUSblog, the unofficial official source for all things Supreme Court, does have Twitter account. That account takes great pains to alert users that they are \u201cA private blog. NOT THE JUSTICES OR THE COURT.\u201d\n\nHowever, following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling yesterday in King v Burwell, which upheld subsidies for health insurance purchased through federally-run state exchanges, angry conservatives missed the memo, angrily tweeting at @SCOTUSblog to express their outrage over what they thought was \u201ctheir\u201d ruling.\n\nAnd SCOTUSblog had some fun with them, tweetstorming some of the best messages with appropriately sarcastic replies:\n\nThere was some confusion today about the difference between @SCOTUSblog and the Supreme Court. Prepare for the running of the trolls. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nInterpret this: YOU SUCK AT GRAMMAR (and government) MT @love2godown21 Interpret this @SCOTUSblog Your WRONG! \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nSry, thought Congress had passed it; our bad MT @AllAmerVet @SCOTUSblog wtf. Goes against majority of Americans! \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nUm, that\u2019s @Congressblog, duh MT @robbiehart21 #whatilearnedtoday the @SCOTUSblog is now part of congress \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nJust bc they have \u201ccancer,\u201d ooooooh MT @517afd @SCOTUSblog decided it\u2019s ok if working stiffs pay subsidies to ppl who will not work \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nOn both knees [wink] #Giveitatry MT @LKVents @SCOTUSblog bows down to Obama. #Disgusting \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nTo be fair, a few Twitter users who were happy with the ruling made the same mistake. They weren\u2019t spared, either:\n\nCool; though \u201cdude\u201d is a bit disrespectful -Ginsburg MT @walkershockley I\u2019m just like, @SCOTUSblog don\u2019t fuck up #Pride2015 dude \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nPerhaps the best one was from Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, whose staff really ought to have known better:\n\nDidn\u2019t read it. You, Senator? MT @SenatorIsakson Disappointed @SCOTUSblog failed to recognize how terribly flawed @POTUS health care law is. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nIsakson later deleted the tweet and replaced it with one using the #SCOTUS hashtag instead of the @SCOTUSblog account. At the end of the day, the exchanges \u2014 and the day as a whole \u2014 could best be summed up with this one:\n\nLook up \u201cblog\u201d MT @BetsyKerr @SCOTUSblog You got it wrong. Don\u2019t know how to read? \u201cState\u201d means \u201cstate.\u201d \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nAnd either Friday or Monday with this one:\n\nLOL, 2morrow gonna blo ur mind MT @highbritt @SCOTUSblog Thanks for giving us yet another very sorry day for our country. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015\n\nNever change, @SCOTUSblog.
