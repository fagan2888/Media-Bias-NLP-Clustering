Antiheroes are also popular, and so the Count, played by Luke Evans, is no longer a dashing charmer a la Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee. He\u2019s a moody brooder who, before he dove into necks aplenty, was a totally decent, peace-loving, reformed genocidal maniac, with a loving wife (Sarah Gadon) and an adorable son, who only became a vampire to save his kingdom from the evil, invading Turks.\n\nBut does this deal work for villains? \u201cMaleficent\u201d didn\u2019t just humanize a baddie; it made her good. \u201cDracula Untold\u201d is supposed to set the stage for the Marvel Universe-ization of the old Universal horror stable. And yet the tale is sloppy and inelegant and Evans\u2019 Vlad the Impaler \u2014 sort of, not really, based on the real deal \u2014 never gets a moment where he\u2019s finally turned into the icon. He\u2019s just another vampire who happens to have a few things in common with the real deal. Even \u201cDracula 2000\u201d didn\u2019t screw up the iconography.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean \u201cDracula Untold\u201d is worthless, per se. It\u2019s a muddled, tortured tale that has enough on its mind \u2014 and, occasionally, strong enough visuals \u2014 to keep it out of the gutter. Evan\u2019s Vlad/Dracula is more conflicted hero than hero-turned-villain. He\u2019s trying to rectify a period of happiness with the past that earned it, when he slaughtered untold thousands, impaling them on giant spikes as a way to scare others into peace. As he puts it, he became a monster to save lives.\n\nThen the Turks, led by a psycho old friend (Dominic Cooper, lightly tanned and basically recreating his \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Double\u201d creep), whimsically decides to invade Transylvania. It\u2019s only natural Vlad decides to turn monster again. This time he\u2019ll become an actual monster. As luck would have it, there\u2019s a local vampire (Charles Dance, with Gene Simmons tongue) willing to turn him, but only briefly, giving him all the superpowers he needs to take on an army singlehandedly. (Thousands perish throughout the film; naturally, it\u2019s rated PG-13.) It\u2019s more \u201cLimitless\u201d than Bram Stoker. But there\u2019s a bizarre catch: Due to rules so convoluted they\u2019d have been better off never having been explained at all, Vlad will become a bloodsucker for three days \u2014 but will stay that way forever if he actually sucks blood.\n\nCharles Dance hams up a storm as a vampire that turns Dracula into Dracula in \"Dracula Untold.\"\n\nCredit: Universal Pictures\n\nIt\u2019s a tortured way to create a character \u2014 as if there were so many script meetings with meddling producers that no one noticed how knotty the setup had become. But once that\u2019s out of the way, the film isn\u2019t without its pleasures. Scenes of the Extreme Vlad plowing through entire armies by himself look like video games, but the effects look decent, or at least expensive (because they are). Vlad can turns himself not into one bat but into a lot of bats, and he proceeds to bat-punch soldiers, which is un-hate-able. Other times he stands atop cliffs, conducting swarms of bats like Stokowski would an orchestra. The crimson-ochre colors are good on the eyes, especially as the filmmakers shot on 35mm and also didn\u2019t make things darker with dumb 3-D.\n\nEvans is a fine lead too. With \u201cClash of the Titans,\u201d \u201cImmortals\u201d and \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d films, he\u2019s perfected the art of strutting around sword-and-sandal locales, burning with super-intense stares. He\u2019s a perfect throwback badass, albeit hammy in a different way than Dance, who is in a master class all his own. He might even make a good Dracula one day.\n\nOne last thing: This is as humorless as one would expect (or even hope) from a Dracula film, and sometimes in productive ways. It takes seriously the moral complexities of its lead character, who\u2019s the type who would have OKed the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and is therefore not exactly to be trusted. (It still doesn\u2019t know how evil to make him by the end, and ultimately proves generally incoherent.) But it could use more jokes. A bit where a Turkish emissary actually does a Columbo \u2014 complete with a finger point as he says, \u201cJust one more thing\u201d \u2014 seems to have been included by accident. It\u2019s an accidental Columbo.\n\nFollow Matt Prigge on Twitter @mattprigge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: 'Dracula Untold' is a semi-coherent origin story with cool bat action", "author": "Matt Prigge", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Review: 'Dracula Untold' is a semi-coherent origin story with cool bat action", "title": "'Dracula Untold' is a semi-coherent origin story with cool bat action", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/dracula-untold-is-a-semi-coherent-origin-story-with-cool-bat-action/tmWnji---184JOahYPRkd2/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$q7wdcs7fyxckxz1odja4axd9ag7d25p/WEK_Dracula_1010-614x408.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Review: 'Dracula Untold' is a semi-coherent origin story with cool bat action", "creator": "Matt Prigge", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$q7wdcs7fyxckxz1odja4axd9ag7d25p/WEK_Dracula_1010-614x408.jpeg"}, "title": "'Dracula Untold' is a semi-coherent origin story with cool bat action", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies, movies,Charles Dance, Dracula, Dracula Untold, Gary Shore, Luke Evans, movies, reviews, Sarah Gadon", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-17", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/movies", "published_time": "2014-10-09T16:39:07Z", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T16:39:07Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies, movies,Charles Dance, Dracula, Dracula Untold, Gary Shore, Luke Evans, movies, reviews, Sarah Gadon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96b1\"", "article_summary": "Charles Dance hams up a storm as a vampire that turns Dracula into Dracula in \"Dracula Untold.\"\n\u201cDracula Untold\u201d is supposed to set the stage for the Marvel Universe-ization of the old Universal horror stable.\nLuke Evans struts his stuff as a pre-bloodsucker Count in \"Dracula Untold.\"\nThis doesn\u2019t mean \u201cDracula Untold\u201d is worthless, per se.\nCredit: Jasin Boland\u2018Dracula Untold\u2019Director: Gary ShoreStars: Luke Evans, Sarah GadonRating: PG-132 (out of 5) GlobesEvery age gets the Dracula they deserve, so of course \u201cDracula Untold\u201d goes the reboot/origin story route."}
