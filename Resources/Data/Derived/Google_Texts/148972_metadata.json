The form, administered by WebMD Health Services, a health management company, asked employees for intimate details about their jobs, marital situation and finances. It also asked female employees whether they planned to become pregnant over the next year.\n\nLast week, in an emotionally charged faculty senate meeting held on the main campus, several female professors told administrators that requiring women to answer such questions \u2014 or pay a fine \u2014 amounted to an invasion of their privacy.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Rodney A. Erickson, the president of Penn State, said that the university had heeded faculty concerns about the perceived invasiveness of the questionnaire and the punitive nature of the fine. \u201cWe have decided to suspend the $100-per-month surcharge so that people who are uncomfortable with any aspect of the survey will not feel as if they are being penalized,\u201d Mr. Erickson said in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany employers use financial incentives to encourage employees to participate in workplace wellness programs, a trend that is likely to widen with the new health care law. Under the wellness rules for the Affordable Care Act that take effect next January, companies can offer a reward of up to 30 percent of health costs for employees who complete a participatory program like a risk assessment, or biometric tests like waist measurement.\n\nBut the uproar at Penn State illustrates the pitfalls employers can face in imposing incentive-based wellness programs without first obtaining employee support. On a larger level, it suggests that employers\u2019 increasing efforts to cut their health care costs are on a collision course with employees\u2019 boundaries about medical privacy.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe big picture here is that, with the Affordable Care Act, the amount of the incentive has grown significantly and employers are jumping into this,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Donnell, the director of the Health Management Research Center at the University of Michigan. \u201cWe are going to see stops and starts as people figure out how to do that.\u201d\n\nPenn State adopted the wellness program, which currently applies to nonunion employees including professors and staff, at the recommendation of Highmark Health Services, a company that administers Penn State\u2019s health care claims. That led some faculty members to criticize administrators for adopting a wellness program without seeking input on its design from outside experts. In its statement on Wednesday, the university said it would now form a joint task force with faculty members to seek expert advice on both the adoption of the wellness program and health benefits matters generally.\n\nIndustry experts also said Penn State stumbled by using a stick rather than a carrot approach to motivate employees. Professors complained, for instance, that the $100 monthly fine seemed like a strong-arm tactic, considering that some employees earned less than $50,000 annually.\n\nThe original plan came under heavy criticism last weekend on social media.\n\n\u201cWellness plans causing trouble,\u201d Dr. Eric Topol, a prominent cardiologist, posted on his Twitter feed. \u201cA better model desperately needed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d object to WebMD\u2019s #wellness questionnaire, too,\u201d Janice McCallum, a health data marketing strategist, posted on Twitter.\n\nPenn State instituted the wellness plan in an effort to slow double-digit annual growth in its health expenditures. The university is self-insured, which means that it directly covers the health costs of some 40,000 employees, spouses and dependents \u2014 at an estimated cost this fiscal year of $217 million.\n\nPenn State faculty members welcomed the university\u2019s decision to suspend the noncompliance fee and to set up a task force to seek faculty input on possible alternatives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBy removing the penalty, at least temporarily, they have removed the sticking point that was the biggest concern for employees,\u201d said Matthew C. Woessner, an associate professor of political science. \u201cIt gives us hope that whatever future program they undertake, it will be undertaken with due diligence and high ethical standards.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130918121128, "twitter": {"description": "The university had proposed a $100 monthly penalty for employees who failed to provide personal data in a wellness questionnaire.", "title": "Health Plan Penalty Ends at Penn State", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/business/after-uproar-penn-state-suspends-penalty-fee-in-wellness-plan.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002450314"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/19/business/Health/Health-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/business/after-uproar-penn-state-suspends-penalty-fee-in-wellness-plan.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002450314", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/business/after-uproar-penn-state-suspends-penalty-fee-in-wellness-plan.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "Health Plan Penalty Ends At Penn State", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 18, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Pennsylvania State University", "keywords": "Colleges and Universities,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Highmark Health Services,Pennsylvania State University", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Natasha Singer", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/19/business/Health/Health-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By NATASHA SINGER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The university had proposed a $100 monthly penalty for employees who failed to provide personal data in a wellness questionnaire.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/19/business/Health/Health-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The university had proposed a $100 monthly penalty for employees who failed to provide personal data in a wellness questionnaire.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 18, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/s/natasha_singer/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2014-08-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Pennsylvania State University", "published": "2013-09-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "19health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140807170440, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/business/after-uproar-penn-state-suspends-penalty-fee-in-wellness-plan.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/19/business/Health/Health-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The university had proposed a $100 monthly penalty for employees who failed to provide personal data in a wellness questionnaire.", "title": "Health Plan Penalty Ends at Penn State"}, "pdate": 20130918, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002450314, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Health Plan Penalty Ends at Penn State", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Penn State instituted the wellness plan in an effort to slow double-digit annual growth in its health expenditures.\nPenn State faculty members welcomed the university\u2019s decision to suspend the noncompliance fee and to set up a task force to seek faculty input on possible alternatives.\nIndustry experts also said Penn State stumbled by using a stick rather than a carrot approach to motivate employees.\nBut the uproar at Penn State illustrates the pitfalls employers can face in imposing incentive-based wellness programs without first obtaining employee support.\nThe form, administered by WebMD Health Services, a health management company, asked employees for intimate details about their jobs, marital situation and finances."}
