Passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Gov. Martinez, the Lay Caregiver Act, a version of the CARE Act, is a commonsense solution to help those caring for their older mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and other loved ones so they can live independently. The law ensures family caregivers have key support as their loved ones go into the hospital and as they transition home.\n\nThe CARE Act requires hospitals to:\n\nRecord your name on the medical record of your loved one Inform you when your loved one is to be discharged to another facility or back home Give you education and instruction of the medical tasks you will need to perform at home, like managing medication or giving injections\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate this win for caregivers, I think back to earlier this year when I met Marianita from Albuquerque, New Mexico. As caregiver for her best friend, Robert, Marianita did everything he needed to live at home\u2014where he wanted to be. Before Robert passed away from COPD, Marianita managed his many medications, gave him oxygen treatments, brought him to his doctor\u2019s appointments, and more. She shared, \u201cAs a caregiver you don\u2019t really think about getting qualified in any shape or form, you just pick up on it and you just do it\u2026 you have to learn quickly and do what you need to do because your loved one is depending on you.\u201d\n\nWatch Marianita\u2019s story:\n\nLike Marianita, many caregivers take on medical tasks while caring for their parents, spouses, aunts, uncles, friends, and other loved ones. In fact, in a recent AARP survey of New Mexico registered voters age 45-plus, 71% of caregivers said they\u2019ve performed medical tasks \u2013 like wound care, giving injections, and more\u2014while caring for a loved one.\n\nIs the CARE Act in your state?\n\nIn addition to New Mexico, the CARE Act is or will be effective soon in the following states:\n\nStates to watch:\n\nIllinois: The CARE Act, passed by the state legislature in May, was just sent to Gov.

Cuomo\u2019s signature. Rhode Island: Just last week the state legislature unanimously passed the CARE Act; it now goes to Gov. Raimondo\u2019s desk.*\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, over a dozen more states have introduced the CARE Act, with nine still working on the legislation this year.* Check out where your state stands:\n\nIf you are a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTo stay up to date or to get involved with our caregiving advocacy in the states, visit org/supportcaregivers , sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or check out state Web page .\n\n, sign up for the or check out .
