The nimble-footed quarterback got his wish, dashing through the snow and a weary defense all the way into the NCAA record book.\n\nReynolds ran for 136 yards and scored three touchdowns to lead the Midshipmen to a 34-7 victory Saturday, their 12th straight in the series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat anybody 12 times in a row,\u201d coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \u201cBut to beat your rivals, I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201d\n\nReynolds scored on runs of 47 yards, 11 yards and 1 yard. The sophomore has 29 rushing touchdowns, breaking the single-season mark for a quarterback previously held by Ricky Dobbs (Navy, 2009) and Collin Klein (Kansas State, 2011), both of whom had 27.\n\n\u201cComing into the game, I wasn\u2019t too concerned about the record. If I broke it, I broke it. If not, oh well,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cMy main concern was trying to get the W. If that involved me getting zero touchdowns and everyone else having a field day, I was good with that.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t work that way at all. Reynolds ran 30 times for on a frozen, snow-covered field. He also caught a 2-point conversion pass on a trick play following his second touchdown.\n\nHis third score \u2014 with 46 seconds left in a lopsided game \u2014 gave him 176 points for the season, breaking the school record of 174 set by Bill Ingram in 1917.\n\n\u201cThe thought did come across my mind to take a knee,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cBut then my thoughts went to, I have a kid that has a chance to break a record that\u2019s hard to come by.\u201d\n\nNavy (8-4) won the Commander-In-Chief\u2019s Trophy for the second consecutive season and ninth time in 11 years. The trophy is awarded to the service academy with the most victories in games between Navy, Army and Air Force.\n\nThe Midshipmen haven\u2019t lost to Army since 2001 and lead the series 58-49-7. Navy\u2019s 12-game run is the longest in the history of the rivalry that began in 1890.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of good friends on that side,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got great kids over there. They go through what our kids go through. But ultimately, I\u2019ve got to think about our team.\u201d\n\nNiumatalolo became the second coach in Navy history to start his coaching career 6-0 against Army, matching Paul Johnson (2002-07).\n\nThe Midshipmen will conclude their season in the Armed Forces Bowl against Middle Tennessee State on Dec. 30.\n\nArmy (3-9) fumbled five times and was intercepted once in its fifth straight defeat. Embattled coach Rich Ellerson fell to 0-5 against the Midshipmen and 20-41 overall since taking the job in December 2008.\n\n\u201cYou turn the ball over against a good football team, you give up big plays on defense, you take some big hits in the penalty game against a good football team, don\u2019t be surprised if the score gets upside down,\u201d Ellerson said.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Keenan Reynolds ran through steady snow and swirling wind into the NCAA record book, helping Navy beat Army 34-7 on Saturday for its 12th consecutive victory in the series.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Keenan Reynolds ran through steady snow and swirling wind into the NCAA record book, helping Navy beat Army 34-7 on Saturday for its 12th consecutive victory in the series.", "title": "Keenan Reynolds leads Navy to its 12th straight victory over Army", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/14/keenan-reynolds-leads-navy-its-12th-straight-victo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/14/aptopix-army-navy-footballjpeg-0ef9a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/14/aptopix-army-navy-footballjpeg-0ef9a.jpg", "description": "Keenan Reynolds ran through steady snow and swirling wind into the NCAA record book, helping Navy beat Army 34-7 on Saturday for its 12th consecutive victory in the series.", "card": "summary", "title": "Keenan Reynolds leads Navy to its 12th straight victory over Army"}, "Author": "David Ginsburg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Army, Keenan Reynolds, Navy, Ken Niumatalolo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb44b\"", "article_summary": "Reynolds ran for 136 yards and scored three touchdowns to lead the Midshipmen to a 34-7 victory Saturday, their 12th straight in the series.\n\u201cBut to beat your rivals, I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201dReynolds scored on runs of 47 yards, 11 yards and 1 yard.\nThe trophy is awarded to the service academy with the most victories in games between Navy, Army and Air Force.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 All Keenan Reynolds wanted was to beat Army.\nArmy (3-9) fumbled five times and was intercepted once in its fifth straight defeat."}
