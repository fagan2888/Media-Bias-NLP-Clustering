Even if it fails, similar \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures in Colorado and elsewhere have given Republican turnout a boost in years past.\n\nIn Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley could face a similar situation if supporters of an initiative there succeed in getting an anti-abortion measure with a fiscally conservative twist on the ballot: the measure seeks to outlaw the use of state funds to pay for any abortion unless the mother is in grave medical danger.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make this a pro-life thing,\u201d said Jeff Jimerson, who is organizing the petition drive. \u201cThis is a pro-taxpayer thing. There are a lot of libertarians in Oregon, people who don\u2019t really care what you do, just don\u2019t make me pay for it.\u201d\n\nCoupling the issue of abortion with a subject important to Republicans\u2019 Tea Party followers \u2014 government spending \u2014 is one way the party is recalibrating its election-year message. Republicans say that by framing the abortion debate in terms of fiscal conservatism, they can make a connection to the issue they believe will ultimately decide who controls Congress next year \u2014 the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor a lot of members politically it ties into the issue they want to be talking about this election, which is Obamacare,\u201d said Tom McClusky, vice president for government affairs for the March for Life.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have almost universally opposed abortion rights. When Arlen Specter, then a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, ran for president in 1995 and declared he wanted to \u201ctake abortion out of politics,\u201d the right balked, and his candidacy was short-lived. But Republicans do see a danger in talking about it the wrong way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of tone as well as substance,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who noted how Republicans hurt themselves in 2012 by picking congressional candidates like Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, whose infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments cost him his Senate candidacy and put his entire party on the defensive over women\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cWhat do they want us to talk about?\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cRape and incest. What should the pro-life candidate talk about? Late-term abortions, sex-selection and Kermit Gosnell.\u201d Dr. Gosnell was convicted in Philadelphia last year of murdering babies after failed abortions.\n\nMr. Priebus, the Republican chairman, will attend the March for Life this week, rare for a party leader. So will Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. In years past, Republican presidents have addressed the march by phone or video message to avoid speaking in person.\n\nNowhere was the power of the abortion issue more evident recently than in the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, where the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, won in November in part because women preferred him by nine percentage points over the Republican, Ken Cuccinelli, whom Democrats portrayed as extreme on women\u2019s issues.\n\nNearly one-third \u2014 about $4.6 million \u2014 of the $16.4 million that Democrats and their allies spent on broadcast television advertising in Virginia last year dealt with abortion or birth control, according to an analysis by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising.\n\nAbortion rights groups have built targeting models that allow them to predict an individual voter\u2019s position on women\u2019s health issues. These models, along with similar ones built by the Obama campaign, were factors not just in Virginia last year but also in Democratic electoral victories in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne state that Naral and Planned Parenthood Action Fund are studying is North Carolina, where they see parallels to Virginia. Demographic changes there are giving Democrats hope that it could swing back into their column.\n\nOne of the leading contenders to be Ms. Hagan\u2019s opponent in November is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the State House, who voted for the tough restrictions on abortion. Democrats believe that would set them up to make the same kinds of sharp attacks that helped them prevail over Mr. Cuccinelli in November and over Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nWhile Democrats say such measures seeking to restrict abortions could stir votes, they acknowledge the limits of midterm turnout. \u201cOff-year elections are difficult,\u201d said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cYou have lower turnout, and a lot of drop-off voters are women. So in a lot of ways, making sure women are aware and voting is important.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140120225928, "twitter": {"description": "Abortion is becoming an unexpectedly animating issue in the 2014 midterm races, with Republicans using it to stoke enthusiasm among core supporters and Democrats looking to rally female voters.", "title": "Parties Seize on Abortion Issues in Midterm Race", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/us/politics/parties-seize-on-abortion-issues-in-midterm-race.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002661008"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jwpetersNYT", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/us/ABORTION/ABORTION-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/us/politics/parties-seize-on-abortion-issues-in-midterm-race.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002661008", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/us/politics/parties-seize-on-abortion-issues-in-midterm-race.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Parties Seize On Abortion Issues in Midterm Race", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 20, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Abortion,Elections,Democratic Party,Republican Party,States (US),United States", "news_keywords": "Abortion,Election", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jeremy W.
