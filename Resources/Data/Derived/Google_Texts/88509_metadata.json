In particular, the sugars in juice seem more \u201cnatural\u201d than high fructose corn syrup \u2014 the main sweetener in so many sodas. After all, we\u2019ve gotten rid of most of the soda we used to offer kids at school, but schools can still offer juice.\n\nBut a study published online in the journal Nutrition, shows that on average fruit juice has a fructose concentration of about 45.5 grams per liter, only a bit less than the average of 50 grams per liter for sodas. The sneakiest \u2014 and sweetest \u2014 juice is Minute Maid 100 percent apple, with nearly 66 grams of fructose per liter. That\u2019s more than the 62.5 grams per liter in Coca-Cola and the 61 grams per liter in Dr. Pepper.\n\nMichael Goran, the director of the Childhood Obesity Research Center at the University of Southern California, led the study. He says he decided to measure the fructose, specifically, in juices and sodas because of a growing body of evidence suggesting fructose is a riskier substance than glucose.\n\n\u201cThe human body isn\u2019t designed to process this form of sugar at such high levels,\u201d Goran said in a statement. \u201cUnlike glucose, which serves as fuel for the body, fructose is processed almost entirely in the liver where it is converted to fat, which increases risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease.\u201d\n\nGoran\u2019s assertion is not universally accepted. Other health researchers, like Fred Brouns at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, say sugar is basically sugar. He has argued that we should spend less time fixating on fructose and its role in the emerging chronic disease epidemics, and more time looking at sugar and energy over-consumption overall.\n\nGoran says that while high fructose corn syrup in soda and food has become a focal point for researchers and public health advocates in recent years, there\u2019s been less attention on the link between fruit juice and obesity and diabetes.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to imagine why any there\u2019s reason why juices wouldn\u2019t be as harmful as sodas if they\u2019re delivering the same amount of sugar,\u201d he tells us.\n\nOne of the biggest problems, Goran notes, is that nutrition labels only tells us the total grams of sugar \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to know how much fructose is in any product. (The term \u201csugars\u201d on the label can include sucrose, which is a combination of glucose and fructose; lactose and other variations.)\n\nBut, Goran adds, if we\u2019re getting fructose from whole fruit, that\u2019s a different story. The fructose in whole fruit comes with fiber, which slows down and reduces the absorption of the sugar in the body, \u201cserving as a sort of antidote to the negative effects of fructose metabolism.\u201d\n\nBarry Popkin, a leading obesity researcher and professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, agrees that fruit juice consumption is associated with health risks because of the high sugar content.\n\n\u201cYes, from our long-term, huge studies in Singapore, Australia, the U.S. and Europe, I think 100 percent fruit juice is as bad as sugar-sweetened beverages for its effects on our health,\u201d he tells us. And, Popkin adds, every long term study on the effects of 100 percent fruit juice intake on diabetes risk shows a very significant risk, too.\n\nPopkin notes that only about nine countries have banned fruit juices from schools. \u201cHowever, all countries now say a maximum four ounces of fruit juice whereas 20 years ago we said unlimited,\u201d he adds.\n\nSo what\u2019s a juice lover to do with so many super-sweet products on the market? As NPR has reported, some beverage makers are now starting to cut the sugar. Goran recommends diluting juice you buy at the store with 50 percent water.\n\n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, we\u2019re going to need to change the cultural norms about how sweet things like juice really need to be,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "USC researchers report that fruit juices have almost as much fructose as soda, making them just as unhealthful for you.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Fruit Juice vs. Soda?
