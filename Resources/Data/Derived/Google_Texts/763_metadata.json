You get to hang out with people and pets at the same time.\"\n\nAlbright walks dogs for her clients, administers medication and takes the pets to veterinary and grooming appointments.\n\n\"It helps keep the clients in good spirits, as well as their animals,\" Albright said. \"They've become family.\"\n\nPets Forever is a community service program that helps low-income elderly and disabled Larimer County residents keep their dogs and cats by offering basic pet care. That way, the residents, who typically are homebound, can benefit from the comfort and companionship animals offer.\n\n\"It's really important that our community do everything we can to support the bond between people and their animals,\" said Lori Kogan, program founder and associate professor in the clinical sciences department of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at CSU.\n\nKogan started the program nearly five years ago to avoid pet owners having to give up their pets when they're no longer able to care for them, she said.\n\nThe program, which is run by the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, helps 80 residents at any given time by pairing them with CSU student volunteers and a few community volunteers. The volunteers walk dogs, provide pet hygiene and yard and litter-box cleanup, administer pet medications, transport pets to veterinary appointments and assist with pet-related errands, such as buying pet food and supplies.\n\nThis year, there are 60 volunteers working with the pet owners, who get daily or less frequent visits depending on their needs.\n\nThe volunteers, if they are students, can earn one academic credit if they commit to a minimum of four clients per week for one semester and attend weekly meetings that include class discussions and presentations by local nonprofits. That way, they are knowledgeable about the community resources clients may need to access to receive support services.\n\n\"These relationships are so important to the clients and the students,\" Kogan said. \"These people really become surrogate grandparents a lot of the time.\"\n\nFor information about the program or about volunteering, go to petsforever.colostate.edu or email Kogan at lori.kogan@colostate.edu.\n\nShelley Widhalm can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 531, or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
