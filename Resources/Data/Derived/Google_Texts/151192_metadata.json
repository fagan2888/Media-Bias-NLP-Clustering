That\u2019s because Americans are shouldering a greater portion of their health care bills, and medical centers don\u2019t want to get stuck with patients that can\u2019t pay.\n\nTraditionally, neither patients nor providers knew the exact price of procedures until after the insurer processed the charges. Now, however, new technology is allowing hospitals to determine the patient\u2019s responsibility in advance of treatment.\n\nStarting the cost conversation early is especially important now because patients are facing higher deductibles and larger payments for services. Some are surprised to find out that they have to fork over thousands of dollars before their insurance even kicks in, hospital administrators said.\n\nThe policies available on the Obamacare exchanges are hastening this trend. Many enrollees are opting for the bronze and silver plans, which often carry deductibles upwards of $5,000 and $2,000, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe bronze plans are scaring a lot of administrators because the patient liability is so large,\u201d said Debra Lowe, administrative director of revenue cycle at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center. \u201cPatients are unaware they have this high deductible.\u201d\n\nUpfront payments aren\u2019t usually required, but more hospitals are asking patients to settle the bill in advance. If patients can\u2019t afford the charges, some hospitals place them into financial assistance programs, such as payment plans or low-interest loans. Others help them sign up for Medicaid or individual coverage on the Obamacare exchanges. Patients can still opt to wait until after the bill goes through their insurance.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to minimize the after-service bill shock and get them into financial assistance or some other program for more affordable care,\u201d said Andy Scianimanico, vice president for revenue cycle at Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, the parent company of Chicago\u2019s largest hospital.\n\nNorthwestern started upfront financial counseling with patients in 2011 and has now expanded it to four departments, including surgery and imaging. It plans to implement it in all areas of the four-hospital network over the next two years.\n\nSoaring deductibles have prompted hospitals to be more aggressive about collecting in advance. The average deductible for an individual employer-sponsored policy has soared to $1,217, up 47% from five years ago, according to the 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust report. For family policies, deductibles have soared 31% to $1,947.\n\nDeductibles of $5,000 are the most common amount seen at Wexner Medical Center, said Lowe. It started requesting upfront payments in July and hopes to collect 75% of the charges ahead of time.\n\n\u2018Settling the bill upfront also helps improve hospitals\u2019 profitability, said David E. Williams, president of Health Business Group, a consulting firm for the healthcare industry. Providers are at least twice as likely to receive payment if they ask for it in advance. Also, chasing after patients who haven\u2019t paid their bills is very costly.\n\nHospitals provided $46 billion in uncompensated care in 2012, or 6.1% of their total expenses, according to the American Hospital Association.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals are increasingly asking patients to pay for procedures either upfront or before they are discharged.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "Hospitals are increasingly asking patients to pay for procedures either upfront or before they are discharged.", "title": "More hospitals asking patients to pay up front", "url": "http://wqad.com/2014/09/29/more-hospitals-asking-patients-to-pay-up-front/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/s002795073-300.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/s002795073-300.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2014-09-29T23:04:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T23:04:49+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "lifestyle, moneysaver, affordable care act", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPatients are unaware they have this high deductible.\u201dUpfront payments aren\u2019t usually required, but more hospitals are asking patients to settle the bill in advance.\nHospitals are increasingly asking patients to pay for procedures either up front or before they are discharged.\nNorthwestern started upfront financial counseling with patients in 2011 and has now expanded it to four departments, including surgery and imaging.\nNow, however, new technology is allowing hospitals to determine the patient\u2019s responsibility in advance of treatment.\nIf patients can\u2019t afford the charges, some hospitals place them into financial assistance programs, such as payment plans or low-interest loans."}
