NJIT\n\nA longtime commissioner at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey resigned on Monday, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnthony Sartor submitted his resignation just days after a new investigation into activity at the Port Authority by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, including the agency\u2019s work rebuilding the World Trade Center, came to light.\n\nMr. Sartor is a New Jersey appointee who has long chaired the agency\u2019s subcommittee on World Trade Center redevelopment.\n\nHis attorney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Sartor\u2019s resignation had been expected by people familiar with Mr. Vance\u2019s probe, which sought a broad swath of records about the authority\u2019s major projects in New York and New Jersey.\n\nMr. Vance\u2019s investigation comes as the Port Authority already faces an investigation by federal prosecutors in New Jersey.\n\nThat probe, emanating from a political payback scheme engineered by Mr. Christie\u2019s subordinates at the George Washington Bridge, has evolved to trigger new levels of scrutiny from lawmakers, the press and prosecutors into how private and public interests are segregated at the bi-state authority.\n\nRelated Video: Port Authority commissioner Anthony Sartor resigned Monday. In video from a 2011 meeting, he discusses two contracts related to World Trade Center redevelopment; meeting minutes indicate he did not participate in the talks.
