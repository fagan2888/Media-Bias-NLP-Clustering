To wit:\n\nLie #1: Economic growth reduces poverty.\n\n\u201cThe best anti-poverty program,\u201d wrote Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cis economic growth.\u201d\n\nWrong. Since the late 1970s, the economy has grown 147 percentper capita but almost nothing has trickled down. The typical American worker is earning just about what he or she earned three decades ago, adjusted for inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of Americans in poverty remains around 15 percent. That\u2019s even higher than it was in the early 1970s.\n\nHow can the economy have grown so much while most people\u2019s wages go nowhere and the poor remain poor? Because almost all the gains have gone to the top.\n\nResearch by Immanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty shows that forty years ago the richest 1 percent of Americans got 9 percent of total income. Today they get over 20 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s true that redistributing income to the needy is politically easier in a growing economy than in a stagnant one. One reason so many in today\u2019s middle class are reluctant to pay taxes to help the poor is their own incomes are dropping.\n\nBut the lesson we should have learned from the past three decades is economic growth by itself doesn\u2019t reduce poverty.\n\nLie #2: Jobs reduce poverty.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio said poverty is best addressed not by raising the minimum wage or giving the poor more assistance but with \u201creforms that encourage and reward work.\u201d\n\nThis has been the standard Republican line ever since Ronald Reagan declared that the best social program is a job. A number of Democrats have adopted it as well. But it\u2019s wrong.\n\nSurely it\u2019s better to be poor and working than to be poor and unemployed. Evidence suggests jobs are crucial not only to economic well-being but also to self-esteem. Long-term unemployment can even shorten life expectancy.\n\nBut simply having a job is no bulwark against poverty. In fact, across America the ranks of the working poor have been growing. Around one-fourth of all American workers are now in jobs paying below what a full-time, full-year worker needs in order to live above the federally defined poverty line for a family of four.\n\nWhy are more people working but still poor? First of all, more jobs pay lousy wages.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor blasts conservative misinformation about minimum wage increases and more", "title": "Robert Reich: 3 biggest right-wing lies about poverty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor blasts conservative misinformation about minimum wage increases and more", "title": "Robert Reich: 3 biggest right-wing lies about poverty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/robert_reich_3_biggest_right_wing_lies_about_poverty_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor blasts conservative misinformation about minimum wage increases and more", "title": "Robert Reich: 3 biggest right-wing lies about poverty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Income inequality, Poverty, RobertReich.org, usa today", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcca8\"", "article_summary": "In fact, across America the ranks of the working poor have been growing.\nBut the lesson we should have learned from the past three decades is economic growth by itself doesn\u2019t reduce poverty.\nHow can the economy have grown so much while most people\u2019s wages go nowhere and the poor remain poor?\n\u201cThe best anti-poverty program,\u201d wrote Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cis economic growth.\u201dWrong.\nSurely it\u2019s better to be poor and working than to be poor and unemployed."}
