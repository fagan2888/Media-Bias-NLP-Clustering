President Obama was asked about it again at his press conference on Friday. \u201cMr. President, like that cease-fire, you\u2019ve called for diplomatic solutions not only in Israel and Gaza but also in Ukraine, in Iraq, to very little effect so far,\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cHas the United States of America lost its influence in the world? Have you lost yours?\u201d\n\nObama answered as you might expect him to: \u201cApparently people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so our diplomatic efforts often take time. They often will see progress and then a step backwards. That\u2019s been true in the Middle East. That\u2019s been true in Europe. That\u2019s been true in Asia. That\u2019s the nature of world affairs. It\u2019s not neat, and it\u2019s not smooth.\u201d\n\nRelated: Top Marine Tells Obama to Get in the Fight\n\nWhether you agree or disagree with Obama, in light of the latest round of questions about America\u2019s role in the world, it\u2019s worth asking yet again: Just how does the world see the U.S. now?\n\nThe answer, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, may surprise you: The U.S. remains generally popular, even if some of its policies and agencies \u2014 especially the NSA \u2014 are not. Pew found that 65 percent of those surveyed across more than 40 countries view the U.S. favorably, little changed from 2013. And 56 percent of those surveyed said they have confidence in President Obama \u201cto do the right thing in world affairs,\u201d also little changed from a year earlier. The two countries where Obama\u2019s approval dropped the most were Germany (from 88 percent to 71 percent) and Brazil (69 percent to 52 percent). The U.S. has listened in to private phone conversations of leaders in both countries.\n\nRelated: Why the United States Spies on Germany\n\nThe Pew survey focused on the U.S., China and the international balance of power, with particular emphasis on how drone strikes and electronic surveillance have affected the American brand. \"A country\u2019s brand is a valued commodity,\" say the study's authors, \"especially when that nation is the world\u2019s largest economic and strategic power.\"\n\nIt\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s Your Policies\n\nThe study finds most people in most other countries are not happy with the Obama administration\u2019s use of drones to project American military power. Majorities or pluralities in 39 of 44 countries surveyed oppose U.S. drone strikes. Kenya, Israel and the U.S. are the only countries surveyed where approval is greater than 50 percent. At 65 percent, Israel's approval rating for drone strikes is the highest.\n\nRelated: How Obama Lost Friends in Europe and Influence Globally\n\nWhen it comes to electronic surveillance, opinion is similar. Majorities in nearly every country surveyed oppose U.S. monitoring of emails and phone calls of either foreign leaders or their citizens. Specifically:\n\n81 percent of respondents find it unacceptable for the U.S. to monitor the communications of its citizens.\n\n73 percent find it unacceptable for the U.S. to monitor the communications of its leaders.\n\n62 percent find it unacceptable for the U.S. to monitor the communications of American citizens.\n\nThe Shining City Upon a Hill, Only Slightly Dimmed\n\nThe study found that the U.S. spying revealed by Edward Snowden has had a negative effect on global public opinion. For both 2013 and 2014, people in 22 of 36 countries surveyed said they are \"substantially less likely to believe the U.S. government respects the personal freedoms of its citizens.\" The drop off was 20 percentage points or greater in six countries.\n\nRelated: Edward Snowden May Have Finally Beaten the NSA\n\nFor all the resentment engendered by certain aspects of U.S. foreign policy, America's overall image abroad hasn't been appreciably harmed. Only 25 percent of those surveyed view the U.S. unfavorably.\n\nFor all the questions about U.S. foreign policy and global influence, the Pew research finds things could be worse: \u201cIn spite of the unpopularity of U.S. spying and its use of drones, America also remains more popular globally than China, its principal rival in world affairs,\u201d Pew reported. On the other hand, about half of those surveyed see China eventually surpassing the U.S. as the world\u2019s dominant superpower. So President Obama, and the presidents who follow him in the Oval Office, are going to keep getting asked about America\u2019s standing in the world.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Global poll finds America well liked, even if electronic eavesdropping and drone strikes aren't.", "title": "How the World Really Sees Obama\u2019s America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/06/How-World-Really-Sees-Obama-s-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08052014_America_USA_Thumbs_Up.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/06/How-World-Really-Sees-Obama-s-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08052014_America_USA_Thumbs_Up.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Global poll finds America well liked, even if electronic eavesdropping and drone strikes aren't.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How Obama Lost Friends in Europe and Influence GloballyWhen it comes to electronic surveillance, opinion is similar.\nKenya, Israel and the U.S. are the only countries surveyed where approval is greater than 50 percent.\nSo President Obama, and the presidents who follow him in the Oval Office, are going to keep getting asked about America\u2019s standing in the world.\nPresident Obama was asked about it again at his press conference on Friday.\nMajorities or pluralities in 39 of 44 countries surveyed oppose U.S. drone strikes."}
