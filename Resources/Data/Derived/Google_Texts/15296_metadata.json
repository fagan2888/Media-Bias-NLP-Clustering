Ellen Roberts, R-Durango.\n\nThe exchange was set up to increase access to health care coverage, she said, \u201cbut we get bottlenecks instead of better care.\u201d\n\nRoberts said there has been chatter about whether the Legislative Health Benefit Exchange Implementation Review Committee was trying to help Connect for Health Colorado or sink it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nShe expressed concerns about the board makeup and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe board has nine voting members \u2014 five whose terms expire in July \u2014 and three non-voting members from state government. Voting members represent physicians, IT companies, health plans and health-related nonprofits.\n\nThe governor appoints five members and state legislators select the remainder.\n\nRoberts also was critical of the high pay at the exchange. She focused on the nearly $200,000 annual salary offered to CEO candidates and to the interim CEOs, especially compared with public service salaries, such as a governor who\u2019s been making roughly half that amount.\n\n\u201cPublic service means you do things on a reduced pay basis,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe, meaning \u2026 the exchange, have a credibility problem here among the legislators and my constituents.\u201d\n\nRoberts said, despite the high salaries, there has been a revolving door of C-Suite staff \u2014 CEO and the chiefs of finance, technology and other departments \u2014 who gained experience at the exchange and then bolted for jobs in the private sector.\n\nConnect for Health board chair Sharon O\u2019Hara said the exchange used a consultant and salary survey to determine the salary range, and then offered a salary from the lower end of the range. The salaries are comparable to those paid at other state-based exchanges, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is a hybrid we\u2019re trying to staff,\u201d board member Steve ErkenBrack said of the exchange, which is an independent nonprofit with a public purpose \u2014 but not a state agency.\n\nThe new interim CEO, Kevin Patterson, who began work Friday, has expressed a willingness to continue in the position longer term, ErkenBrack said. The search for a permanent CEO has been suspended in the short term, in part because it\u2019s possible there will be five new board members in July, he said.\n\nSen. Kevin Lundberg, R-Larimer County, told exchange representatives not to plan too far into the future.\n\n\u201cForget about the long term,\u201d Lundberg said. \u201cIt is impossible to know what role Obamacare and the exchange will play.\n\n\u201cFind the team that can pull you through to the next year,\u201d Lundberg said.\n\nOutgoing interim CEO Gary Drews acknowledged the exchange was at a critical point, with transitions both in leadership and revenue sources, as federal grants come to an end.\n\nCommittee members had dozens of questions about possible fee increases at the exchange. However, it is the exchange board that must approve them, not the legislative committee.\n\nExchange staff have recommended raising the fee on each individual plan sold on the exchange \u2014 charged to insurers and passed on to consumers \u2014 to 3.5 percent from 1.4 percent. Other fees also could be increased.\n\nThe Colorado exchange has charged lower fees and had smaller budgets than most state-based exchanges \u2013 and most states were set up to recover some costs from Medicaid, whose enrollees also use exchange resources, Drews said.\n\nColorado\u2019s exchange was not set up to recover any Medicaid administrative costs. It should recover those costs, Drews said, but it is in the research phase at this point.\n\n\u201cWhen will the research phase end, and when we\u2019ll we see dollars coming in the door?\u201d asked Sen. John Kefalas, D-Fort Collins.\n\nPatterson told Kefalas he is taking an aggressive approach on Medicaid recovery.\n\nRoberts also brought up online enrollment problems consumers still vexing consumers.\n\nShe said she is still receiving complaints two or three times a week from \u201cconstituents on the verge of tears, in tears or yelling about problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problems still aren\u2019t getting sorted out,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have people who have tried to enroll and still are thrashing about.\u201d\n\nDrews said any talk about Colorado scrapping its exchange for the federal model was short-sighted.\n\n\u201cSimply converting to the federal exchange is not as straightforward as you may imagine,\u201d Drews told legislators. But he didn\u2019t go into detail about the costs states carry in the federally facilitated exchanges.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance exchange questioned by oversight committee", "title": "Colorado health insurance exchange questioned by oversight committee", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/13/colorado-health-insurance-exchange-questioned-by-oversight-committee/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141103_082136_Connect-for-Health-Colorado-Screengrab-1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141103_082136_Connect-for-Health-Colorado-Screengrab-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-13T14:54:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T02:57:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d94\"", "article_summary": "The legislative committee overseeing the state health insurance exchange Wednesday questioned the competence of a volunteer board guiding the exchange.\nHowever, it is the exchange board that must approve them, not the legislative committee.\nIt should recover those costs, Drews said, but it is in the research phase at this point.\nThe board has nine voting members \u2014 five whose terms expire in July \u2014 and three non-voting members from state government.\n\u201cDid this get set up properly with a part-time, volunteer board?\u201d asked committee chair Sen.
