Bush, Iraq, Middle East, The Globalist, Politics News\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Globalist\n\nStephan Richter\u2019s recent \u201cIraq\u2019s Predictable Fate\u201d notes that then German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der had warned the George W. Bush administration in 2002 that the invasion of Iraq was ill-advised.\n\nThe majority of Americans \u2014 and both political parties \u2014 once cheered on that invasion. Americans belatedly have come to realize that they would have been much better off if Schr\u00f6der\u2019s advice had been heeded.\n\nTo be sure, only a tiny minority of Americans have been directly touched by the cost of the war in terms of American lives lost and limbs destroyed. But all Americans will long feel the fiscal burden of amortizing the money cost of the war, including the long-term medical and social support of the warriors sent out to fight that war.\n\nAnd it is anybody\u2019s guess what the Iraqi people might say now if they were polled on the benefits of the U.S. invasion.\n\nAn educated elite\n\nBut what about top U.S. policymakers? Were they really so much less educated about Iraq? Were they unaware of the well-known history of tribal enmity that forever smolders beneath the surface in arbitrarily composed Iraq \u2013 as well as the futility of attempting to invade that country?\n\nIronically, and tragically for the United States as a country, none other than former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney issued the same warning in 1991 and 1994, drawing on the same lessons from history.\n\nUnfortunately, by 2002 Mr. Cheney had all but conveniently forgotten his earlier wisdom proffered during the 1990s. The episode and the details are very much worth recalling, because they show what happens after someone simply \u201cconverts\u201d to the belligerent credo of the neo-conservatives (a.k.a. neo-cons).\n\nCheney, in prior incarnations, had earned a reputation as a measured man. He soon became the top marketer for, and enforcer of, the ill-conceived invasion of Iraq to the American people.\n\nCheney, the wise man: The evidence on video\n\nOn April 7, 1991 Cheney appeared on ABC news\u2019s This Weekas the then U.S. Secretary of Defense in the George H.W. Bush Administration. Secretary Cheney was asked by the late elder statesman of ABC News, David Brinkley, why the U.S. government did not invade Iraq proper after the liberation of Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm.\n\nBRINKLEY: One other question \u2014 it keeps coming up. Why didn\u2019t we go to Baghdad and clean it all up while we were there? Sec. CHENEY: Well, just as it\u2019s important, I think, for a president to know when to commit U.S. forces to combat, it\u2019s also important to know when not to commit U.S. forces to combat. I think for us to get American military personnel involved in a civil war inside Iraq would literally be a quagmire. Once we got to Baghdad, what would we do? Who would we put in power? What kind of government would we have? Would it be a Sunni government, a Shi\u2019a government, a Kurdish government? Would it be secular, along the lines of the Ba\u2019ath Party? Would it be fundamentalist Islamic? I do not think the United States wants to have U.S. military forces accept casualties and accept the responsibility of trying to govern Iraq. I think it makes no sense at all.\n\nA repeat of these talking points can be seen on a YouTube clip, apparently of an interview on C-SPAN in 1994. In the interview, then ex-Secretary of Defense Cheney offered roughly the same talking points as he did on ABC News in 1991. He then added ominously:\n\nIf you can take down the central government of Iraq, you can easily see pieces of Iraq fly off. Part of it the Syrians would like to have in the West. Part of Eastern Iraq the Iranians would like to claim \u2013 fought over for eight years. In the North you have the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It\u2019s a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq.\n\nCheney noted in addition that conquering Iraq and deposing Saddam Hussein was not worth the U.S. casualties it might entail, not even to speak on the death toll and hardship it might visit on the people of Iraq.\n\nWhy do the U.S. media still cover for the Bush team?\n\nOne can understand why former Vice President Cheney would just as soon not be reminded of these prescient remarks made in the aftermath of Desert Storm.\n\nOne can understand also why those politicians, pundits and media personalities who are heavily invested in the aggressive foreign policies espoused by the so-called neo-conservatives (or neo-cons) now spare Mr. Cheney the embarrassment of confronting his earlier dicta on Iraq.\n\nAfter all, even though they are proven wrong once again, they are eager now to use their moment in the media \u201csun.\u201d They want to provide their neo-con theories with another lease on life in the media spotlight.\n\nWhat is much harder to understand is why the mainstream media \u2013 who make great ado about being papers of \u201crecord\u201d \u2014 spare Mr. Cheney and the rest of the neo-cons that embarrassment. Their silence prevents Cheney and Co. from being held accountable \u2013 the opposite of what American democracy should be all about.\n\nFor all their still very voluminous personnel resources, among the U.S. media only very few stood out for their clairvoyance on the subject matter. McClatchy ranks top among those few.\n\nYes, humans can commit errors, even grave ones. However, the public, or those whose profession it is to work on the public record, should not condone proven malfeasance with their silence. Such silence, in real life, has but one practical consequence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before becoming vice president, Cheney acknowledged the country could disintegrate following a U.S. invasion", "title": "When Dick Cheney told the truth about Iraq", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Before becoming vice president, Cheney acknowledged the country could disintegrate following a U.S. invasion", "title": "When Dick Cheney told the truth about Iraq", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/when_dick_cheney_told_the_truth_about_iraq_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dick_cheney4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before becoming vice president, Cheney acknowledged the country could disintegrate following a U.S. invasion", "title": "When Dick Cheney told the truth about Iraq", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dick_cheney4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Uwe Reinhardt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dick Cheney, George W.
