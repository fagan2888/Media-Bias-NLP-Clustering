Hannah celebrated her twenty-fifth birthday in appropriately grungy fashion, Marnie channeled Edie Brickell and Idina Menzel, and Ray sulked his way into a brawl. The episode also introduced Adam\u2019s wildly unpredictable sister Caroline, played by Gaby Hoffmann. This week, I spoke to another twenty-something fan about internet gaffes, dancing to dubstep, mental illness, and relationships both romantic and familial. (Don\u2019t worry, no tacos this time.)\n\nThis Week\u2019s \u201cGirl\u201d: Janelle Clayton, 22\n\nHometown: Airmont, NY\n\nJob: Freelance production assistant\n\nAdam or Ray: Adam\n\nFavorite \u201cGirls\u201d girl: Jessa\n\nEpisode watched: \u201cShe Said OK\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s start talking about the episode. It starts with a phone call from Adam\u2019s sister, Caroline, and his immediate response to her is very negative. Do you have any siblings?\n\nI have an older brother\u2013he\u2019s 27\u2013and my younger sister is 21.\n\nSo you\u2019re in the middle. Before you actually see the sister, what did you think of Adam\u2019s reaction?\n\nHis reaction was negative, but the first thing he did was tell her to come out so he could care for her or address the issue in person. Even though he\u2019s extremely aggressive toward her, I think his instinct was to take care of her immediately. That\u2019s what my first reaction would be: \u201cCome over to my apartment and then we\u2019ll figure out what we need to do.\u201d\n\nWhat is your relationship like with your siblings?\n\nWe\u2019re fine, definitely not like Adam and Caroline. I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re siblings. It\u2019s harder to describe relationships with family members because you don\u2019t know the dynamics between anyone else and their siblings, so I don\u2019t know. Loving. Fine whenever I see them on holidays and vacations and stuff.\n\nDoes she seem like his sister to you?\n\nCaroline does seem like Adam\u2019s sister to me because they\u2019re both manic in different ways. I can\u2019t believe how much chaos she brought into that little apartment within the first few moments that she was there. I understand her emergency, but throughout the episode it just gets worse and worse. I hate to admit that Adam was right but, as he said, she vomits on everything.\n\nI guess it was Shoshanna, in the previous episode, who talked about how much of Hannah Adam is willing to put up with\u2013 all of her hijinks and antics. A normal person with a normal life wouldn\u2019t have time to put up with that. But it might be that, with the high-maintenance kind of person that his sister is, he\u2019s kind of used to dealing with that. Maybe [that\u2019s why] he\u2019s a little long suffering with Hannah.\n\nWe don\u2019t really know much of Adam\u2019s backstory\u2013we see Hannah\u2019s parents, we see Marnie\u2019s mother, and we know that she\u2019s previously divorced\u2013but I\u2019m wondering how Adam\u2019s family is. He was so excited to see Hannah\u2019s parents at her birthday party. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d meet them with such enthusiasm. He was so happy to see them. It makes me think that they\u2019re a touch of normalcy that he never really gets to experience in his life.\n\nHe obviously has some\u2013I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it envy\u2013but he appreciates their level of closeness in a way that Hannah doesn\u2019t appreciate her own parents.\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s so awesome that they always kind of do a jig together, and when he goes around to dance with them it seems that he really actually wanted to spend time with them.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of Marnie\u2019s music video. It is obviously a embarrassing moment for Marnie and a mistake that she wishes wasn\u2019t on YouTube. That\u2019s a very modern problem, people doing things that end up on the Internet and last forever. I didn\u2019t grow up with that problem. There was no YouTube when I was that age. Without being too specific, do you have any regrets or things like that that you\u2019ve done that are just sort of permanently somewhere in the ether?\n\nFortunately, no. I do understand that concern of doing something whether in public or private and wondering if someone is recording you as a joke. Even when you can be dating someone, you\u2019re also cautious about whether or not people take pictures of the two of you because then they could post it. If something doesn\u2019t work out, it does concern you if it\u2019s going to be on someone\u2019s Instagram or Facebook and you\u2019re not really in a relationship and people start to talk\u2013on the Internet, publicly, because you can see comments. It\u2019s definitely a concern when people document anything and everything. But she was willing to do that music video, as Shoshanna or Hannah mentioned, but she\u2019s just upset that Charlie posted it. She\u2019s too embarrassed to speak to him.\n\nI think it was Shoshanna who said she was complicit in the making of this, which is funny. It probably didn\u2019t take much persuasion to get Marnie to do that video. There\u2019s a great deal of narcissism on that show\u2013it\u2019s difficult to say who\u2019s most narcissistic\u2013but she certainly has a large dose of it. She\u2019s clearly leaning into that song throughout that video. I wonder if she\u2019s more embarrassed that Charlie posted it and now they\u2019re not together, or more disappointed with the way it was received, with all the Internet comments? Despite the fact that she protests the thing, you find her desperately trying to sing in public again by the end of the episode.\n\nI think she\u2019s more upset, not about the comments or about how it\u2019s received, but I think she\u2019s more upset that she\u2019s trying to overcome her relationship with Charlie, and he has the power to enter her life whenever he wants to, because there are so many platforms. They\u2019re not connected to each other, but she searches for him. In the bar scene at Hannah\u2019s party, she mentions that Charlie must check her Instagram, just as she is checking his YouTube channel. Nowadays the internet doesn\u2019t let you forget someone. And if maybe you\u2019re dating someone their pictures are going to show up somewhere months later. She\u2019s just upset that the Internet isn\u2019t letting her forget about this man who she claims ruined her life.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to check those. I don\u2019t think she wants to forget him. I think, like you said, that she\u2019s trying to keep tabs on him. It seems like she doesn\u2019t want to sever that relationship. Maybe I\u2019m an old fogey, but I\u2019m a firm believer that you can stop associating with someone. It seems to me fairly easy\u2013unless you run in the same circles, which it doesn\u2019t seem that they do\u2013it seems fairly easy to just stop checking somebody\u2019s Instagram, stop following them. It seems like she just wants that relationship in some way. She\u2019s very, very concerned about what he\u2019s doing and what he\u2019s up to\u2013she\u2019s clearly not over it.\n\nTheir relationship the previous seasons was so superficial. She tried to break up with Charlie multiple times. And each time she ended up figuring that she\u2019d rather be with Charlie \u2014 even though she felt suffocated by him \u2014 than be alone. I\u2019ve realized a lot of times, with girls my age, that having a boyfriend is a social success. Shoshanna ended up being with Ray. Hannah had Adam. Jessa\u2019s kind of doing her own thing. And Marnie, probably subconsciously\u2013or maybe she was thinking about it\u2013didn\u2019t want to be the girl friend without a boyfriend. I know how that feels and I know how other girls feel when that happens. They are kind of always sympathized with in a really odd way, as if the possibility of being married young is awesome. I think in the back of her head that\u2019s what she\u2019s thinking, even though no one mentions marriage in this show, that\u2019s probably what the dynamic comes down to between girlfriends, nowadays \u2014 to mark a success that she wasn\u2019t willing to sacrifice.\n\nSo you think that even at that age, even that young, the seeds of the notion of marriage or a permanent partner is in the back of their minds?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Up this week: discussing YouTube, family, and tooth necklaces with a member of the \"Girls\" demographic", "title": "Watching \u201cGirls\u201d with girls: Marnie goes viral", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Up this week: discussing YouTube, family, and tooth necklaces with a member of the \"Girls\" demographic", "title": "Watching \u201cGirls\u201d with girls: Marnie goes viral", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/watching_girls_with_girls_marnie_goes_viral/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/girls_recap_season3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Up this week: discussing YouTube, family, and tooth necklaces with a member of the \"Girls\" demographic", "title": "Watching \u201cGirls\u201d with girls: Marnie goes viral", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/girls_recap_season3.jpg", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Drumming", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Girls, Lena Dunham, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce606\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s harder to describe relationships with family members because you don\u2019t know the dynamics between anyone else and their siblings, so I don\u2019t know.\nIt starts with a phone call from Adam\u2019s sister, Caroline, and his immediate response to her is very negative.\nCaroline does seem like Adam\u2019s sister to me because they\u2019re both manic in different ways.\nI don\u2019t know, we\u2019re siblings.\nI don\u2019t think she wants to forget him."}
