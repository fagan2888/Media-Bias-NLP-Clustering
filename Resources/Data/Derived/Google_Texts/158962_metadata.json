He was a member of both the Lone Pine Hunting Club and the St. George Family of the St. Ubaldo Society, and worked at Farina Landscaping and Bazil\u2019s Restaurant in Clarks Summit.\n\nEveryone who donates blood at the event will receive a T-shirt and be entered into a basket raffle.\n\nFor more information or to schedule an appointment, call Brenda Conlon at 570-202-0748.\n\n\u2014 JEFF HORVATH\n\njhorvath@timesshamrock.com, @jhorvathTT on Twitter\n\nCarbondale\n\nResidents of the Carbondale Nursing Home and Rehabilitation Center got a special visit last week from some holiday carolers spreading Christmas cheer.\n\nFor the second year, the Mountain Sky music festival venue family showed up laden with gifts and baked goods and singing Christmas tunes.\n\nDelia, Holly and Duncan Geyer, all siblings from the Blue Ridge School District, played traditional Christmas songs on violin, while Ella Casper, 9, and Amelia Gerken, 10, greeted residents and passed out treats.\n\n\u201cI think they were pleasantly surprised by the amount of gifts and treats we brought,\u201d said one Mountain Sky organizer, Melanie Casper. \u201cChristmas being the time of giving back, it just seemed very appropriate to take care of some folks and brighten their day a little bit.\u201d\n\nMany in the community had supported the Scott Twp.-based music venue earlier this year as Mountain Sky struggled to secure several municipal permits to continue operating. During a contentious process that spurred debate over the venue\u2019s neighborliness, Mountain Sky operators promised to remain upstanding members of the community.\n\nThey were holding up their end of the deal Sunday, one nursing home worker said.\n\n\u201cThe holidays are busy for everyone,\u201d said Recreation Director Karissa Cawley, who added that leftover baked treats still abound for residents to enjoy. \u201cFor them to take the time out of their personal lives, it\u2019s really special, and it just shows their sense of community and how they find it important.\u201d\n\n\u2014 JON O\u2019CONNELL\n\njoconnell@timesshamrock.com, @jon_oc on Twitter\n\nJessup\n\nAs the year draws to a close, the Jessup Hose Company No. 2 hopes to receive some last-minute donations to cap its 2015 fund drive.\n\nCompany members sent out about 1,800 donation requests in September but have only seen about 35 percent of those returned. Chief Steve Pitoniak said that is less than the 40 percent return rate they usually see.\n\n\u201cIt costs about $9,000 to equip just one firefighter, and we have to pay for our own equipment,\u201d Mr. Pitoniak said. \u201cWe use donations to replace old equipment and to get new items, which better enables us to do our jobs and protect the community.\u201d\n\nThe newest vehicle in the company\u2019s fleet is a rescue truck that cost roughly $527,000. The company receives only $10,000 annually from the borough \u2014 money that is used to cover fuel costs.\n\nThe drive officially ends Dec. 31, but the company will accept donations after that date.\n\n\u2014 JEFF HORVATH\n\njhorvath@timesshamrock.com, @jhorvathTT on Twitter\n\nLackawanna County\n\nA Lackawanna County buildings and grounds crew brought a truckload of donations to St. Francis Commons, a transitional living facility in Scranton for homeless veterans.\n\nThe items, donated last week, were the result of a food drive the county launched in late November. Although the public was invited to donate, most of the contributions came from county employees, said county spokesman Joseph D\u2019Arienzo.\n\nFood pantries have been struggling this year because the lingering budget impasse continues to hold up their state funding.\n\nCommissioner Patrick O\u2019Malley expected the food drive to become an annual initiative.\n\n\u2014 KYLE WIND\n\nkwind@timesshamrock.com, @kwindTT on Twitter\n\n\u25a0\n\nLackawanna County commissioners recently extended the county\u2019s contract with Scranton-based benefit consultant Kistler Tiffany Benefits for six months.\n\nThe existing three-year contract, with $50,000 in annual brokerage service fees, was previously to expire at the end of the year, said Brian Loughney, deputy director of human resources.\n\n\u201cThis will carry us over in 2016 and keep us in compliance with the Affordable Care Act and other major health care implications,\u201d Mr. Loughney said.\n\nCommissioners did not sign a longer-term agreement because a new administration will be taking office in January.\n\nAt the same time, Commissioner Jim Wansacz said choosing the consultant was a long process and expressed some concern about the new administration having enough time to resolve what the county will do after the extension expires.\n\n\u2014KYLE WIND\n\nkwind@timesshamrock.com, @kwindTT on Twitter\n\nOld Forge\n\nMore than 20 families from the Old Forge School District had their holiday made a little brighter, thanks to donated food baskets.\n\nBorough Councilman Chuck Karam, through his company Bulldog Fireworks, facilitated a drive to assemble 25 baskets of holiday food to donate to a list of families prepared by elementary Principal Nathan Barrett.\n\n\u201cThey picked them up at school at dismissal, and it was really touching,\u201d Mr. Karam said. \u201cThe people who came were very appreciative.\u201d\n\nThe baskets contained groceries, a ham from an anonymous donor, desserts donated by Pennsylvania Ambulance and a $25 gift certificate to Rinaldi\u2019s Cafe on Main Street in the borough.\n\n\u201cWe ended up having a great, great turnout,\u201d Mr. Karam said. \u201cThey were wonderful Christmas food baskets.\u201d\n\n\u2014 SARAH SCINTO\n\nsscinto@timesshamrock.com, @sscintoTT on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"author": "STAFF REPORT", "title": "Around the Towns 12/27/2015", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "STAFF REPORT", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1987824"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "bitly-verification": "68008dbe9586", "DC.title": "Around the Towns 12/27/2015"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7673\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think they were pleasantly surprised by the amount of gifts and treats we brought,\u201d said one Mountain Sky organizer, Melanie Casper.\nDuring a contentious process that spurred debate over the venue\u2019s neighborliness, Mountain Sky operators promised to remain upstanding members of the community.\nThe items, donated last week, were the result of a food drive the county launched in late November.\n\u201cThey were wonderful Christmas food baskets.\u201d\u2014 SARAH SCINTOsscinto@timesshamrock.com, @sscintoTT on Twitter\nCommissioner Patrick O\u2019Malley expected the food drive to become an annual initiative."}
