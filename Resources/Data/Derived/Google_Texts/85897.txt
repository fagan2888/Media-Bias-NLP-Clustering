While The New York Times Magazine appears to be over the moon about a possible Hillary presidential run in 2016, Reason TV’s Ted Balaker reminds us about the former Secretary of State’s absurd comments on illegal drugs. Original release date was February 10, 2011 and the original writeup is below the fold.

Recently, during an interview with Mexico's Televisa, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the United States can't legalize drugs "because there is just too much money in it."

Apparently, Clinton doesn't understand that there's so much money to be made selling illegal drugs precisely because drugs are illegal.

Reason.tv uses Clinton's love of pant suits and Chardonnay to explain the economics of prohibition to the former presidential candidate.
