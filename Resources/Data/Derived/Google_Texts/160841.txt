“SNL’s” search for a black female cast member has proved so fruitful that in addition to hiring New York comic Sasheer Zamata as a performer, the sketch show is bringing aboard two writers as well, LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones, reports the Hollywood Reporter.

Following months of criticism that the show had not had a black female performer since 2007, in December, “SNL” executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that he was considering hiring one or two of the black women — though he made no mention of new writers.

THR reports that “producers were impressed with both Tookes and Jones and thought they were talented, smart and funny.”
