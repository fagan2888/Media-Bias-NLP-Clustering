But his view is being challenged by a new, more incremental liberalism, which centers on advancing liberal goals without big, universal programs \u2014 an approach being invented by President Obama and Mr. Sanders\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe essence of Mr. Sanders\u2019s version of liberalism is government programs. Expansive initiatives that provide benefits to \u201ca broad cross-class constituency,\u201d as the Harvard political sociologist Theda Skocpol puts it, such as Social Security and Medicare, are not only good policy, they\u2019re at the heart of liberal politics. They remind citizens of the essential role of government in providing security and economic opportunity. And they anchor voters to the party that backs those programs.\n\nThat\u2019s the theory, anyway, and it\u2019s deeply embedded in Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach. His proposals for single-payer health care, free college tuition and paid family leave financed through a small payroll tax reflect the view that successful programs should be universal and create a connection between individuals and government.\n\nA program that covers everyone avoids the class conflict over who gets help and who doesn\u2019t, as well as the refrain of \u201cmakers and takers\u201d that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan used in the 2012 election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat\u2019s in sharp contrast to the policy approach of the Obama administration since about 2011, and also to Hillary Clinton and most of Mr. Sanders\u2019s congressional colleagues. Their agendas are most interesting and novel for the absence of big, universal programs that require legislative action. Instead, they test the limits of what government can do by rearranging the pieces of existing programs, using regulations, incentives to states, tax credits and \u201cnudges\u201d informed by behavioral economics in place of direct spending.\n\nWhat does that say about the future of big programs? Unless Mr. Sanders can sweep to power with a mandate and wide congressional majorities that share his view \u2014 the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d he promises \u2014 the future of social and economic policy will involve, for better or worse, these complex, incremental and often invisible changes, instead of big programs.\n\nPhoto\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccompact\u201d for college tuition assistance, which costs a fraction of what Mr. Sanders\u2019s free college plan costs, illustrates the new method. There is no single new program. Instead, she promises, for example, to provide grants to states to help them provide free tuition at community colleges; to expand regulation of predatory loan servicers and education programs; to enact a \u201cBorrower Bill of Rights\u201d; and to allow students to refinance their loans at lower rates.\n\nIt\u2019s all a lot more complicated \u2014 and for candidate Clinton, especially in the primary, a tougher sell \u2014 than a single new program in which government takes most of the responsibility. But it fits well with the methods employed by the Obama administration in the years since the president realized that he could not expect to achieve an ambitious program with a deeply partisan Congress and a Republican House.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s proposed changes to overtime regulations, for example, are predicted to raise wages for up to five million workers. The MyRA retirement proposal will, without congressional action, set millions of American households up with low-risk, low-cost retirement savings accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just congressional intransigence and polarization that led liberals to move beyond big new programs. Passage of the Affordable Care Act finally put in place the last big piece of the New Deal\u2019s agenda. And the cautiousness of most Democratic candidates about taxes makes it difficult to push for new programs. While Mr. Sanders acknowledges that his new programs will require tax increases, he uses the same rule as Mrs. Clinton and President Obama \u2014 no tax increases on households under $250,000 \u2014 in several of his initiatives, and claims that he will pay for the cost of others through taxes on the \u201cbillionaire class.\u201d\n\nBut without new programs, it really is possible to deny the need for broader tax increases, as Mrs. Clinton does. There is no need for revenue to reduce future budget deficits; the best way to keep deficits under control is to keep the economy growing and to reduce health care spending, which again means more tinkering.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nThese policy machinations should not be confused with \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2014 the modest, symbolic gestures adopted by the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s to show a recognition of conservative values. These are intended instead to make progress toward big goals by putting together various moving pieces.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are many downsides to building policy this way. It\u2019s unlikely that the MyRA, for example, will be enough to meet the shortfall in Americans\u2019 retirement savings or reduce inequality of wealth.\n\nThese efforts pull what the Cornell political scientist Suzanne Mettler calls the \u201csubmerged state\u201d further under the waves. Citizens don\u2019t see or feel these initiatives and may not know that they are benefiting from a government initiative at all.\n\nBut if this is the only way to drive reform \u2014 and in the current political configuration, it is \u2014 then politicians in both parties will have no choice but to find ways to achieve big change without big new programs.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160209212011, "twitter": {"description": "Government policy in the future will likely be complex, incremental and often invisible, not sweeping.", "title": "Is the Era of Big-Program Liberalism Over?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/campaign-stops/is-the-era-of-big-program-liberalism-over.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004191672"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/opinion/10schmittWeb/10schmittWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/campaign-stops/is-the-era-of-big-program-liberalism-over.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004191672", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/campaign-stops/is-the-era-of-big-program-liberalism-over.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/campaignstops", "hdl_p": "Is Big-Program Liberalism Over?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 9, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Liberalism (US Politics),Sanders  Bernard,Clinton  Hillary Rodham,Obama  Barack,New Hampshire,Primaries and Caucuses", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Mark Schmitt", "SCG": "campaign-stops", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MARK SCHMITT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Government policy in the future will likely be complex, incremental and often invisible, not sweeping.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/opinion/10schmittWeb/10schmittWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/opinion/10schmittWeb/10schmittWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Government policy in the future will likely be complex, incremental and often invisible, not sweeping.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 9, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-02-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Primaries and Caucuses", "published": "2016-02-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "New Hampshire", "slug": "10schmitt", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160210155518, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/campaign-stops/is-the-era-of-big-program-liberalism-over.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/opinion/10schmittWeb/10schmittWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Government policy in the future will likely be complex, incremental and often invisible, not sweeping.", "title": "Is the Era of Big-Program Liberalism Over?"}, "pdate": 20160209, "des": "Primaries and Caucuses", "articleid": 100000004191672, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Is the Era of Big-Program Liberalism Over?", "col": "Op-Ed Contributor", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdb1\"", "article_summary": "The essence of Mr. Sanders\u2019s version of liberalism is government programs.\nMr. Sanders gets cheers for these ideas, as he did from voters in New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic primary with his resounding victory.\nPhotoMrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccompact\u201d for college tuition assistance, which costs a fraction of what Mr. Sanders\u2019s free college plan costs, illustrates the new method.\nThat\u2019s the theory, anyway, and it\u2019s deeply embedded in Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach.\nWhat does that say about the future of big programs?"}
