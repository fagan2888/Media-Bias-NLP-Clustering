The process took two hours.\n\nLocate 1.2 million people. Find even the thousands of them who don\u2019t speak English or don\u2019t have a place to live. Get them to fill out a 26-page application. Process those forms. And get it done by the end of the year.\n\nThat is the unprecedented mandate facing state officials this year: to scour the rolls of MassHealth, the state\u2019s Medicaid program for low-income people, and make sure that all the enrollees are still eligible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials stumbled at first with an attempt to reenroll 500,000 people in just three months. There were long waits at the MassHealth call center and long lines at the community health centers. Thousands of other recipients simply failed to do anything. In the end, officials extended deadlines, added staff, and changed policies.\n\n\u201cThis was new for us,\u201d said Marylou Sudders, the state\u2019s secretary of health and human services. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect of 1.2 million people.\u201d\n\nThe daunting project is a consequence of the 2013 software failure of the Massachusetts Health Connector. The Connector website was supposed to calculate whether people qualified for MassHealth or for another type of coverage, but it was unable to determine anyone\u2019s eligibility. That forced MassHealth to halt its usual process of confirming eligibility, which involves reenrolling recipients monthly on a rolling basis.\n\nAs a result, everyone who was on MassHealth stayed on MassHealth, regardless of income increases.\n\nNow the federal government, which pays for half or more of MassHealth costs, is requiring the state to get its house in order. And Governor Charlie Baker is counting on the \u201credetermination\u201d process to reap big savings \u2014 at least $250 million to $300 million in the calendar year \u2014 by culling those who no longer qualify.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe any other jurisdiction in the country has had to redetermine so many people in the same period of time,\u201d said Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of the advocacy group Health Care for All.\n\n\u201cI think the idea that patients can do this on their own is just not realistic,\u201d said Sue Joss, executive director of the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center. \u201cThey have to go somewhere for help, and we\u2019re happy to do that. But it\u2019s just overwhelming.\u201d At one point, as many as 70 to 80 walk-ins were streaming into the Brockton health center each day, on top of the 45 with appointments, Joss said.\n\nTo help, MassHealth trained 1,300 \u201ccertified application counselors\u201d who work in health centers, hospitals, and community groups. The state budget allocated $14 million for all aspects of the redetermination process, with three-quarters of the money coming from the federal government.\n\nThe challenges cast into relief the immensity and importance of the state program that provides health coverage for low-income and disabled people.\n\nForty cents of every state taxpayer dollar goes to MassHealth. The program covers a quarter of Massachusetts residents (including 40 percent of children, half the disabled people, and two-thirds of nursing home residents). MassHealth fuels the economy with payments to hospitals, health centers, physicians, laboratories, health insurers, and more.\n\nThe challenge extends from the 11th-floor office of MassHealth director Daniel Tsai to a basement classroom in Brockton, where earlier this month Maria Ribeiro was doggedly scrolling, clicking, and typing her way through a MassHealth application.\n\nThe 47-year-old frequently asked for help from Simao Mendes, a worker with the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center, who runs this weekly enrollment class.\n\nSpeaking in Cape Verdean Creole, Mendes helped Ribeiro estimate her annual income even though her wages as a cake decorator vary from week to week. He showed her where to click when a red-lettered alert declared a discrepancy in her husband\u2019s income (the box saying he had lost his job). He coached her in identifying her relationship to her husband when the pull-down menu did not include the word \u201chusband\u201d (she located the word \u201cspouse\u201d).\n\nIn the end, Ribeiro\u2019s husband and two young sons qualified for MassHealth and were reenrolled, but she was deemed ineligible. Instead, she found a separate plan through the Connector that cost $1 a month after subsidies were applied. Then, she packed away her pay stubs and ID cards, and left \u2014 two hours after she arrived.\n\nMassHealth enrolls 1.9 million people. Of them, 700,000 signed up too recently to require reenrollment. The rest need to verify their eligibility, although 200,000 are easily deemed eligible because they qualify for another income-based government program.\n\nOfficials decided to first reenroll those who qualified mainly because their income was low. Because income levels can shift, these people were most likely to have changed circumstances that might affect eligibility. The effort started with letters mailed Jan. 15.\n\nBut when the April 17 deadline arrived, barely half had taken any action, and many of those who tried to act found they could not get help before their deadline.\n\nAntonia McGuire, president of the Edward M. Kennedy Community Health Center in central Massachusetts, said her centers saw a steady stream of people unable to complete applications on their own.\n\n\u201cThe original time frame was ambitious, to put it in a word,\u201d McGuire said.\n\nSeveral insurers were also raising concerns about possibly losing members and income. About two-thirds of MassHealth members enroll in health insurance plans that receive payments from the state to manage enrollees\u2019 care.\n\nIn response, Sudders and Tsai allowed people to file for extensions to June 30. They doubled staff at the MassHealth call center to shorten wait times. And they gave the health insurers lists of members who had not responded, allowing the insurers to contact them and file extensions for them.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bumpy in the beginning, but I think it has gotten better,\u201d said Michael Nickey, executive director of MassHealth programs for Fallon Health, a Worcester insurer with about 32,000 MassHealth members statewide.\n\nBy early May, the crunch had eased, as thousands filed for extensions.\n\nThe number of people responding to the state\u2019s letters steadily increased, reaching 69 percent by Tuesday. The 158,000 who did not respond were disenrolled. But they can get back on the program, with retroactive coverage, if they make contact with MassHealth before June 30.\n\nIn July, MassHealth will start reaching out to the next 500,000 enrollees. These include disabled and elderly people and those with complicated family situations. Lessons from the first half-million will shape the approach to the next group. Tsai said he will contact organizations that work with such patients even before the letters go out.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.2910373973", "eomportal-id": 559875, "description": "An unprecedented requirement to check the eligibility of 1.2 million Medicaid enrollees is proving daunting for the Baker administration and providers of care.", "eomportal-instanceid": 26, "og": {"city": "Brockton", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "An unprecedented requirement to check the eligibility of 1.2 million Medicaid enrollees is proving daunting for the Baker administration and providers of care.", "title": "Mandate to re-enroll all MassHealth members strains the system - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/14/mandate-enroll-all-masshealth-members-strains-system/Chb1qhiWZ7uwEvX8eAU2WJ/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/05/08/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/IMG_0057A.jpg", "longitude": "-71.01837869999997", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.0834335", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Medicaid,MassHealth,Marylou Sudders,Daniel Tsai", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 11:21:04 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Medicaid,MassHealth,Marylou Sudders,Daniel Tsai", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "420efea4-fab2-11e4-8dd0-51240f23976e"}, "article_summary": "About two-thirds of MassHealth members enroll in health insurance plans that receive payments from the state to manage enrollees\u2019 care.\nAs a result, everyone who was on MassHealth stayed on MassHealth, regardless of income increases.\n\u201cIt was a little bumpy in the beginning, but I think it has gotten better,\u201d said Michael Nickey, executive director of MassHealth programs for Fallon Health, a Worcester insurer with about 32,000 MassHealth members statewide.\nThe 47-year-old frequently asked for help from Simao Mendes, a worker with the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center, who runs this weekly enrollment class.\nThe challenges cast into relief the immensity and importance of the state program that provides health coverage for low-income and disabled people."}
