But on this week\u2019s episode of TLC\u2019s My Strange Addiction, 22-year-old Keyshia disgusted her family (and the rest of America) by sniffing, sucking, and chewing dirty diapers. The Queens, N.Y. resident asks friends and relatives for their babies\u2019 pee-soaked diapers in order to satisfy her cravings. \u201cIt\u2019s very annoying because she doesn\u2019t care what time it is,\u201d said Keyshia\u2019s friend, Kim. \u201cShe\u2019ll wake my baby up to take the diaper that\u2019s on the baby.\u201d\n\nIn the episode, which aired Wednesday, Keyshia said that her habit began about two years ago. Since then, she\u2019s slurped about 25,000 dirty diapers, according to The Huffington Post. Her fianc\u00e9, Jerome, believes her addiction to soiled diapers has gotten out of hand, especially since she places them in communal cups and dishes. \"I've tried to work with her, but she goes beyond for her diapers,\" Jerome said. \"She's even willing to dig in the garbage.\"\n\nThough it makes for great television, Keyshia\u2019s desire to suck on dirty diapers is more than just a \u201cstrange addiction.\u201d Pica, which is the compulsive eating of non-food items, is an actual medical condition. People with pica consume large amounts of these items, like diapers, without regard for the nutritional consequences. Though it is a compulsive behavior, most people with pica don\u2019t necessarily have a psychological disorder. Most times, the items people eat are consumed to fulfill a nutrient deficiency. But, since most people don\u2019t go to the doctor for their habit, those deficiencies often go undiagnosed. Medical Daily has covered a couple of different cases of pica (see here and here), from a student who wouldn\u2019t stop eating crayons to a mother who ate nothing but sand and sponges during her two pregnancies.\n\nKeyshia, like others struggling with pica, tried to kick her dirty diaper habit by the end of the episode. \"I'm going to smell them one last time then you can have them,\" she said.
