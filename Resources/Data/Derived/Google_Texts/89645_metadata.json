The incident does, however, offer an interesting case study of the lifespan of a smear so inane, it couldn\u2019t even sustain itself for more than a day.\n\nOn Tuesday, some conservative media outlets pounced on news that the United States is going to move its embassy to the Holy See to a new location. As a substantive matter, the details aren\u2019t especially interesting: the embassy is moving closer to the Vatican, as part of a relocation that will save taxpayer money and improve security. Other countries have done the same thing, and the church doesn\u2019t care.\n\nBut Republicans, perhaps bored the day before Thanksgiving, threw a tantrum anyway. It wasn\u2019t long before GOP members of Congress, Fox News, and even Jeb Bush were expressing their outrage over Obama \u201cclosing\u201d the embassy to the Vatican (even though Obama wasn\u2019t closing the embassy to the Vatican). The National Republican Senatorial Committee even launched a petition drive to protest the move, calling it \u201cthe latest anti-religion pursuit\u201d of the Obama administration and a decision that \u201cweakens America\u2019s position as a global leader.\u201d\n\nAnd then all of a sudden, poof, the apoplexy disappeared\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a petition last week to protest what it described as the \u201clatest anti-religion pursuit\u201d by the Obama administration, but it looks like the group is already abandoning its crusade. A webpage that took aim at President Obama for his \u201cplans to close the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican\u201d is nowhere to be found on the NRSC\u2019s website. The original URL ( http://yourvoice.nrsc.org/landing/vatican-embassy/ ) now directs back to the NRSC\u2019s homepage.\n\nWhen Tom Kludt asked about the NRSC\u2019s quiet shift in posture, Republican officials declined comment .\n\nBehold, an anti-Obama smear so silly, even the NRSC\u2019s Brad Dayspring and his team couldn\u2019t muster the will to defend it.\n\nI can\u2019t say I blame them. The change in embassy locations was begun under Bush/Cheney; it will save Americans $1.4 million; it improves embassy security (which, post Benghazi, Republicans are supposed to care about); it actually expands the physical size of the embassy without shrinking its staff; and it moves our diplomatic post closer to the Vatican, with the church\u2019s blessing. If the NRSC was prepared to defend its blisteringly stupid position that this move is an \u201canti-religion pursuit,\u201d it would require a level of spin even Republicans aren\u2019t capable of.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Republicans' anti-Obama smear over the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican was so absurd, it couldn't even sustain itself for more than a day.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-lifespan-silly-smear", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The Republicans' anti-Obama smear over the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican was so absurd, it couldn't even sustain itself for more than a day.", "title": "The lifespan of a silly smear", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-lifespan-silly-smear", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/vatican_obama_gb131.jpg?itok=GLMg653j", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-lifespan-silly-smear", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/vatican_obama_gb131.jpg?itok=fGtrMGoQ", "height": 553}, "title": "The lifespan of a silly smear", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Republicans' anti-Obama smear over the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican was so absurd, it couldn't even sustain itself for more than a day."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-02T16:45:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "The lifespan of a silly smear", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-lifespan-silly-smear", "published": 1, "date": "12/02/2013 16:45:00 EST", "tags": "embassy-security,nrsc,vatican,rachel-maddow-show"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The Republicans' anti-Obama smear over the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican was so absurd, it couldn't even sustain itself for more than a day.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Embassy Security, NRSC, Vatican"}, "article_summary": "Behold, an anti-Obama smear so silly, even the NRSC\u2019s Brad Dayspring and his team couldn\u2019t muster the will to defend it.\nThe incident does, however, offer an interesting case study of the lifespan of a smear so inane, it couldn\u2019t even sustain itself for more than a day.\nIf the NRSC was prepared to defend its blisteringly stupid position that this move is an \u201canti-religion pursuit,\u201d it would require a level of spin even Republicans aren\u2019t capable of.\nPresident Obama has been the target of some bizarre partisan attacks over the years, but last week offered an unusually ridiculous line of criticism.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before GOP members of Congress, Fox News, and even Jeb Bush were expressing their outrage over Obama \u201cclosing\u201d the embassy to the Vatican (even though Obama wasn\u2019t closing the embassy to the Vatican)."}
