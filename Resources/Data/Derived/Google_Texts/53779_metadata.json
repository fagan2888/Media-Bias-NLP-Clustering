After those videos were released, StemExpress cut ties with Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood has denied illegal actions.\n\nBecause of Blackburn\u2019s decision to issue subpoenas that include personal information, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the panel could be \u201ccomplicit with physical assaults or murders of these people.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, Blackburn requested \u201cthe names of all employees and students \u2018who perform or assist in performing abortions or conducting fetal tissue research.\u2019\u201d\n\nBlackburn defended her decision and an attempt to quash the subpoenas was defeated. In all of the documents released Wednesday, the names of students and/or employees were redacted.\n\nThe six witnesses who testified before the committee\u2014four of whom disclosed their stance against abortion\u2014all attempted to address the following questions:\n\nDoes fetal tissue research violate human dignity?\n\nShould fetal tissue be grown for the purpose of transplant?\n\nShould anyone profit from fetal tissue? Why not?\n\nWhat level of disclosure should a patient have before an abortion? Before a donation of tissue?\n\nShould an abortion clinic have equipment and expertise for perinatal care for children born alive?\n\nWho should obtain the fetal tissue donation consent?\n\nWhen debating the issue of fetal tissue procurement, members of the select panel fell along party lines. Republicans voiced concern over the legal and ethical issues of procuring tissue from aborted babies, specifically citing consent issues, arguing that mothers who opt for abortion are incapable of providing consent because they doesn\u2019t have the child\u2019s best interest in mind. Democrats argued that since abortion is legal, women should be given the opportunity to donate that tissue to help save \u201cmillions\u201d of lives.\n\nOne of the witnesses, G. Kevin Donovan of the Georgetown University School of Medicine, argued that it\u2019s \u201cdisingenuous\u201d to say millions of lives could be saved by vaccines developed via the tissue of aborted babies.\n\nAlta Charo, a law and bioethics professor at the University of Wisconsin who was called to testify by the ranking member, said blocking fetal tissue procurement could hinder research into vaccines and cures, citing the Zika virus as an example.\n\nDonovan argued that using tissue from aborted babies is \u201cunnecessary\u201d and that \u201cfetal cells could be obtained by miscarriages.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republicans, including Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, a physician, said they fully support using fetal tissue obtained by miscarriages because it doesn\u2019t involve the deliberate destruction of a human life.\n\nSeveral Democrats, including New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, suggested that discarding fetal tissue instead of donating it for research is immoral.\n\n\u201cDo you think it is moral to throw it away rather than use it for medical purposes?\u201d the congresswoman asked.\n\nDonovan said there\u2019s an ongoing discussion within the bioethics community about \u201cwhat do we do with the products of medical research when we think the research itself is tainted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers attempt to address the issue of whether or not fetal tissue procurement is legally and ethically permissible when used for medical research.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers attempt to address the issue of whether or not fetal tissue procurement is legally and ethically permissible when used for medical research.", "title": "Lawmakers Grapple With Ethical Issues of Fetal Tissue", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ppvideo-hearing-1250x650.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T22:24:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LWhZwW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers attempt to address the issue of whether or not fetal tissue procurement is legally and ethically permissible when used for medical research.", "title": "Lawmakers Grapple With Ethical Issues of Fetal Tissue", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ppvideo-hearing-1250x650.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-03-02T18:12:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T22:24:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion, fetal tissue, planned parenthood, fetal issue procurement, Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, diane black, gop, abortion, pro-life"}, "article_summary": "The six witnesses who testified before the committee\u2014four of whom disclosed their stance against abortion\u2014all attempted to address the following questions:Does fetal tissue research violate human dignity?\nSeveral Democrats, including New Jersey Rep.
