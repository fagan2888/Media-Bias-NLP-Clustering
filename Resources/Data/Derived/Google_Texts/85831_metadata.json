We filed jointly and we are getting $45 back with two kids,\" she said. \"We normally get back $1000-$ 2000.\"\n\nSteve Harvey, E.A. with H&R Block said one of the biggest tax changes this year is the penalty for not enrolling in a health insurance plan; it's almost doubled. \"A family of four making $60,000, if they don't have insurance, it's about $975,\" Harvey said.\n\nAnd, for those people who have enrolled in Obamacare, they will see changes filing taxes too. \"The other change this year is more documents are required . There is a form A, form A 1095, there is a 1095 B and C.,\" Harvey said.\n\nThe IRS will not allow you to file without form 1095-A if you have Obamacare. If you have Obamacare, you will get form 1095-A in the mail. You must fill it out and file it with your taxes.\n\nForms 1095-B and 1095-C are for people who have insurance through their work or a private company.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The deadline to avoid a fee when it comes to healthcare passed but it doesn't mean you're off the hook  when it comes to filing your taxes.", "language": "english", "author": "Liz Owens", "og": {"description": "The deadline to avoid a fee when it comes to healthcare passed but it doesn't mean you're off the hook  when it comes to filing your taxes.", "title": "OYS: Hefty penalties and more forms during this tax season", "url": "http://www.wrdw.com/news/onyourside/headlines/OYS-Hefty-penalties-and-more-forms-during-this-tax-season-367280421.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C1D/C6F/C1DC6F6135DF4D7CB0BE5EB70C182827", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/457/55C/45755C76817F47CF9C8451714E602447.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wrdw.com", "description": "The deadline to avoid a fee when it comes to healthcare passed but it doesn't mean you're off the hook  when it comes to filing your taxes.", "title": "OYS: Hefty penalties and more forms during this tax season", "url": "http://www.wrdw.com/news/onyourside/headlines/OYS-Hefty-penalties-and-more-forms-during-this-tax-season-367280421.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Obamacare39.jpg", "creator": "@WRDW_WAGT", "site": "@WRDW_WAGT", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "OYS: Hefty penalties and more forms during this tax season", "google-site-verification": "8-3xFzkQ1iJrzmiRBKWUd9b7vmK9u8kjmhyaKM66jUU", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "OYS Hefty penalties and more, forms during this tax season"}, "article_summary": "And, for those people who have enrolled in Obamacare, they will see changes filing taxes too.\nPlayford and her husband opted out of Obamacare but are now paying the price on their tax returns.\nForms 1095-B and 1095-C are for people who have insurance through their work or a private company.\nThere is a form A, form A 1095, there is a 1095 B and C.,\" Harvey said.\nThe IRS will not allow you to file without form 1095-A if you have Obamacare."}
