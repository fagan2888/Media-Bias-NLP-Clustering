The Democratic caucus in the Alabama Senate today released its agenda for the 2016 legislative session, including proposals for a lottery and casinos and a minimum wage increase.

The caucus is calling its agenda "Empowering Alabama Families."

"There is so much focus on providing incentives for large corporations to locate in Alabama, but nothing has been done to create incentives for everyday hardworking Alabamians," Sen. Priscilla Dunn, D-Bessemer, said in a news release.

The agenda includes:

-- A proposed constitutional amendment to allow a lottery and casinos, with proceeds going into the Education Trust Fund and General Fund. According to the caucus, it's important to include casinos with the lottery bill because they create jobs.

-- A bill sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman, D-Birmingham, to create a state minimum wage of $10.

-- A bill by Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, to restrict companies that receive incentives or other funds from the Alabama Department of Commerce from using temporary workers for more than 5 percent of their workforce.

-- A bill by Coleman to required combined income reporting from out-of-state companies doing business in Alabama, a measure that would close a corporate tax loophole, according to the caucus.

-- A "ban the box" bill by Sen. Quinton Ross, D-Montgomery, to allow those with felonies to wait until a job is offered before disclosing their criminal background.

-- A bill by Sen. Hank Sanders, D-Selma, to repeal Alabama's photo voter ID law.

-- A proposed constitutional amendment by Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, to raise property taxes by 5 mills, or $15 for every $50,000 of property owned.

-- A proposal by Sen. Billy Beasley, D-Clayton, calling for the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

The legislative session starts Tuesday.

Democrats hold eight seats in the 35-member Senate.
