First, let\u2019s define what the bubble is: an unsustainable year-over-year increase in college tuition, which has gone up by about seven and a half percent per year for the past few decades, increasing at a far greater rate than inflation and outstripping the ability of ordinary people to pay for it.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that the result of this increase is a massive growth in student loans and federal grants. But that would reverse cause and effect. In fact, the increased availability of subsidized loans and federal aid is itself the primary cause of rising tuition. After all, the price of higher education can only keep rising if people somehow keep finding money to pay for it. And it is the loans and grants that provide most of that money.\n\nI have described this as the Paradox of Subsidies: \u201cWhy do you subsidize something? To make it cheaper. What is the actual effect? To make it more expensive.\u201d As the government poured free money into higher education, the universities did what came naturally: they took more of that money, not less of it. They increased tuition to keep up with the increased subsidies. And they also decreased the amount of their own money they offered in tuition breaks and grants to students and instead took more of the government-subsidized money.\n\nOne report on Clinton\u2019s plan offers us a classic expression of the paradox:\n\nClinton\u2019s plan places the blame on states for cutting back on their investment in higher education, hiking tuition even as federal scholarships for low-income students\u2014Pell Grants\u2014were being increased and awarded to more students to keep up. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\u201cEven as\u201d? More like \u201cbecause.\u201d (Astute readers will also recognize this as an example of the Butterfield Fallacy.)\n\nWe can measure the effect of subsidies: colleges pocket 65 cents of every dollar. We can actually measure the effect of higher ed subsidies. According to a study by the New York Fed, colleges pocket up to 65 cents of every increased dollar of subsidized student loans made available, slightly less for other kinds of aid. In effect, that money was \u201cpassed through\u201d the students to the schools, who were its real beneficiaries.\n\nAnd where did all of the money go? The universities didn\u2019t hire more and better teachers; it is an open secret that much of the course load is handled, not by pampered tenured professors, but by graduate students and young \u201cadjunct\u201d professors, who receive notoriously low pay, few benefits, and zero job security. The money has mostly gone into a vastly expanded bureaucracy of administrators, and into giant building projects. (The University of Michigan is in the middle of a $1.7 billion construction project.)\n\nThe most pernicious part of this is the massive expansion of student loans. Borrowed at subsidized interest rates and available to all students regardless of their field of study or academic record, government-backed student loans encouraged millions of young people to finance the higher education bubble out of their own future earnings.\n\nGovernment-backed loans encouraged millions of young people to finance the higher ed bubble. The worst impact is on those who were extended loans regardless of whether they were really prepared for college\u2014students who were encouraged to spend several years of their lives and take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, only to drop out before they earned their degrees. The second worst impact is on those who did get their degrees, but in subjects that have little economic value, like sociology or women\u2019s studies. They were encouraged to borrow enormous sums of money against future income they are unlikely ever to earn. Those who received degrees with some conceivable commercial value are the best off, but they are still starting life in the hole, digging themselves out from under massive debt before they can save to buy cars or houses or start businesses. For millennials, who came of age under this system, it has stunted their independence and future prospects.\n\nAll of this was backed by a cultural presumption, fanned by the universities and also by the very same political backers who were inflating the bubble, that higher education is an essential ingredient of the good life, a stepping stone to the middle class, and above all else a necessity for admission into genteel society\u2014college education being the marker for America\u2019s only true class divide. All of this increased the pressure on students to take out all those loans without reckoning how there were going to pay them back.\n\nThe fundamental problem is the way subsidies have insulated higher education from all considerations of cost. It\u2019s the old Platonic dream of the ivory tower: a system in which the academy is regarded as an end-in-itself, not to be held back by grubby market forces, and with the first claim on everybody\u2019s resources. No wonder its cost has been spiraling out of control.\n\nThe Clinton plan would take all the causes of the bubble and increase them. The Clinton plan would take all of these causes and increase them. It would pump $175 billion in new grants to be distributed by state governments, in exchange for a promise by state government to spend more of their own money on higher education, too. So that means more money pumped into the system to be soaked up. Her plan also involves expansion of a program that offers relief to borrowers, capping their student loan payments as a percentage of their post-graduation income and forgiving their debt after 20 years. All of which will encourage the sense that student loans are free money that nobody needs to worry about repaying.\n\nThe only new things about her plan are that some of the costs of the higher education bubble will be collectivized, shifted away from individual borrowers to the taxpayer\u2014which means that there will be even less connection between the value of a college education and its price. At the same time, now that the federal government is taking even more of the burden itself, it will make fitful efforts to clamp down on higher education by imposing controls and regulations. If Hillary\u2019s proposal is a bit like ObamaCare for higher education, then like ObamaCare, it is really just a step on the way to a \u201csingle-payer\u201d system.\n\nThe higher ed bubble exists, and keeps getting bigger, for political reasons. What it is not is any kind of solution to the higher ed bubble. What we need is to remove subsidies, not to add them. We need to reconnect higher education back to economics and the marketplace, and to better align the value of a college degree with its costs. But that would be a political non-starter, because it would involve taking away subsidies from an interest group that reliably supports Democrats, nor would it offer handouts to buy the votes of young people who might otherwise be unenthusiastic about an elderly candidate.\n\nSo the Paradox of Subsidies is really just a subsidiary of the Law of Intended Consequences. The higher education bubble exists, and keeps getting bigger, for a reason. It\u2019s just that the reason can\u2019t be found in economics or in education, but in raw power politics.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 07:49:15 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Hillary Clinton plans to deal with the higher education bubble by massively inflating it.", "title": "Hillary, Higher Ed, and the Paradox of Subsidies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3225553226_f70e3478c4_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-14T06:52:17+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/12/hillary-clinton-higher-ed-and-the-paradox-of-subsidies/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Hillary Clinton plans to deal with the higher education bubble by massively inflating it.", "title": "Hillary, Higher Ed, and the Paradox of Subsidies", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3225553226_f70e3478c4_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@Tracinski", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Education", "tag": "economics,higher education,Hillary Clinton,paradox of subsidies,student loans", "published_time": "2015-08-12T07:49:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T06:52:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Hillary Clinton plans to deal with the higher education bubble by massively inflating it."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf7f\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton plans to deal with the higher education bubble by massively inflating it.\nThe higher education bubble exists, and keeps getting bigger, for a reason.\nThe fundamental problem is the way subsidies have insulated higher education from all considerations of cost.\nAfter all, the price of higher education can only keep rising if people somehow keep finding money to pay for it.\nWe need to reconnect higher education back to economics and the marketplace, and to better align the value of a college degree with its costs."}
