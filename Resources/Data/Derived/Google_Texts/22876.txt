Obamacare has a habit of creating regulations that are even longer than the actual legislation itself. Just last week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released the final rule for Medicaid and managed care programs that ran to a “robust” 1,425 pages. Of course, CMS had to pass it so you could find out what’s in it, assuming you can actually understand what’s in it:

In § 438.3(o), we proposed that contracts covering LTSS [Long-Term Services and Support] provide that services that could be authorized through a waiver under section 1915(c) of the Act or a state plan amendment through section 1915(i) or 1915(k) of the Act be delivered consistent with the settings standards in § 441.301(c)(4).

Health Affairs has a roughly 5,600-word summary of the regulations here. Or, you could read the actual 1,425 pages of the final rule. Yeah, like you’re going to do that.
