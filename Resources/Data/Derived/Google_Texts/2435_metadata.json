Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, D-Ill., introduced new legislation called the Exchange Inclusion for a Healthy America Act of 2015, which would allow illegal immigrants health care coverage under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cTreat your brother and your sister and your neighbor with compassion as you would like to be treated yourself,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez stated on the House floor. \u201cAnd in the case of health care and access to health insurance, it is not simply out of a sense of moral altruism, although that is a part of it. Rather, it is out of the reality that treating our brothers and sisters and neighbors as we want to be treated when it comes to health care and access to care and access to health insurance is in our own self-interest, as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal is to cover everyone in this country, regardless of immigration status, provided they establish state residency and file taxes (which most immigrants already do),\u201d states the congressman\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cWe have to make sure it\u2019s accessible to everyone living here.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, \u201cexplicitly prohibits the payment of exchange tax credits and cost sharing subsidies to illegal immigrants,\u201d says Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cWith respect to legal immigrants, because prior law bars them from receiving Medicaid for five years following the grant of legal status,\u201d Haislmaier said, \u201cthe [Affordable Care Act] allows [legal immigrants] to claim the exchange tax credits and cost sharing subsidies, even if they have incomes below the threshold at which those subsidies are not available to citizens.\u201d\n\nFederal poverty level guidelines show that a person making 100 percent of the federal poverty level may qualify to receive tax credits and other assistance under Obamacare.\n\nThe bill proposed by Guti\u00e9rrez and co-sponsor Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., would amend Obamacare to permit illegal immigrants to purchase health insurance through Obamacare exchanges (also termed health insurance marketplaces) and receive coverage subsidies.\n\nThe bill subjects everyone to an individual mandate to be on health care insurance.\n\n\u201cWe should account for the real nature of [undocumented immigrant\u2019s] integration into American society and include as many as possible in our health system,\u201d states a press release from the office of Guti\u00e9rrez.\n\n\u201cProposals that allow illegal immigrants access to various welfare and entitlement programs, such as Obamacare, have multiple negative effects,\u201d says Heritage Foundation policy analyst David Inserra. Inserra, an expert in Homeland Security, told The Daily Signal three effects of proposals like the bill introduced by Guti\u00e9rrez:\n\n\u201cThey harm the U.S. budget and the fiscal health of these programs.\u201d \u201cSuch programs transfer tax dollars from U.S. citizens and legal immigrants to illegal immigrants.\u201d \u201cExpanding welfare benefits for illegal immigrants is a greater incentive for additional illegal immigration. In sum, the words of famous economist Milton Friedman ring true: \u2018It is one thing to have free immigration to jobs, it is another thing to have free immigration to welfare, and you cannot have both.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn the day of the bill\u2019s introduction, Sept. 30, the legislation was referred to the Energy and Commerce as well as the Ways and Means Committees in the House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He thinks everyone should be able to have access to Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He thinks everyone should be able to have access to Obamacare.", "title": "Bill Proposes Illegal Immigrants Gain Access to Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151005_IllegalCareBill_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-06T00:21:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OTNe16"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He thinks everyone should be able to have access to Obamacare.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151005_IllegalCareBill_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Bill Proposes Illegal Immigrants Gain Access to Obamacare", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-10-05T18:03:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T00:21:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Illegal Immigrants, immigration"}, "article_summary": "The bill proposed by Guti\u00e9rrez and co-sponsor Rep.
