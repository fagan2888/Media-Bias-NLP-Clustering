Her interview centered around the possibility that Ward may challenge Republican establishment incumbent Senator John McCain in a 2016 primary.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLevin describes Ward as a \u201cconstitutional conservative,\u201d recalled her work at the Assembly of State Legislatures meeting, and remarked that he considers her less-than-lengthy political career an asset.\n\n\u201cI am a family physician and very, very proud of that,\u201d Ward began. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not a career politician. I\u2019m somebody who I never thought I would be into politics. I can tell you I was involved in medical politics, but that was regarding my profession and my livelihood.\u201d\n\nShe then explained that ObamaCare encouraged her to enter politics.\n\n\u201cIt [Obamacare] was such an offense to me that the federal government was gonna try to take over my patients and their freedom, their liberty, their ability to get the kind of care that they want and need,\u201d she said. She described the \u201cblood sweat and tears\u201d she spent working to become a doctor. That propelled Ward to run for office as the Senator for the 5th district of Arizona.\n\nLevin broadened the conversation. \u201cThe Republican Party, the bureaucracy in Washington, talks all the time about we have to reach out to women we have to reach out to minorities and yet when conservatives offer themselves in Republican primaries to a man, they back the incumbent. It\u2019s just remarkable that their propaganda does not match their actions.\u201d He asked Ward, \u201cAre you seriously considering getting into this primary against John McCain?\u201d\n\nI am seriously considering it. It isn\u2019t something obviously to take lightly. It is something that is going to take a lot of thoughts, learning, listening, praying, conversations before I can determine if there\u2019s a financial path and a political path that actually could lead to a victory. And believe me, I know that this is a David and Goliath story. Obviously I don\u2019t have the political machine in place, at least not at this time. I haven\u2019t been able to start raising money yet because I\u2019m still serving in the state legislature right now and we\u2019re pretty much prohibited from raising money during our legislative session.\n\nLevin interrupted for a moment. \u201cThat is fascinating to me because the Senators are doing it in Washington endlessly.\u201d\n\nWard continued: \u201cI know that I\u2019m the underdog, I know that it\u2019s not some easy path that I can just say hey pick me I\u2019m a great candidate. I do have to say that you are right about the turn taking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people tell me when I decided to run for office that it wasn\u2019t not my turn, it was the presumed incumbent\u2019s turn to be in the Senate. I\u2019ve heard as I contemplate this [challenging McCain for the U.S. Senate seat] that it\u2019s not my turn.\u201d\n\nWard added, \u201cI think that all this naysaying is detrimental to our party. We have got to get behind the new generation. We have got to get behind the passion, the positivity, the principle that we all want to see in Washington. And that\u2019s going to take a change, not just a change for the sake of change, but a change for good.\u201d\n\nLevin took quickly to the term \u201cnew generation\u201d of Republicans, describing them as more articulate, more principled, more conservative, more Reaganesque. \u201cThis is the new generation of Republicans,\u201d he agreed.\n\nWard added, \u201cIf we want the status quo obviously there\u2019s plenty of people out there who are willing to offer that to us.\u201d\n\nLevin touched on what is considered by some to be McCain\u2019s strongest asset, foreign policy. \u201cPeople will say we will lose John McCain\u2019s expertise. Now I don\u2019t see how, don\u2019t we have professional generals and professional admirals and other people in the Senate and the House with that expertise who are not weak on border security and not weak on a whole host of other issues?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we have more than enough experts who actually are out there doing something, not just talking about it,\u201d Ward concurred. \u201cI will tell you that I\u2019ve seen the shift back to the conservative Senator,\u201d speaking of McCain, suggesting it is a temporary change. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen enough fight against ObamaCare,\u201d which she\u2019s fought at the state level.\n\nAs for Arizona\u2019s \u201chuge unsecured border,\u201d Ward says, \u201cSenator McCain at times it trying to tell us is more secure than ever.\u201d To those that suggest moving away from the issue of immigration enforcement, she said, \u201cI can tell you that my constituents in my district and throughout this state care about border security. They want a secure border, they want us to follow our existing laws and they do not want amnesty for people who came here illegally and are going to the front of the line. Those are things I will stand up for if I decide to run for this office.\u201d\n\nLevin pointed out the problem of fundraising. \u201cMillions and millions\u201d of dollars will be racked up while party bureaucrats throw support behind McCain. He said they will spend 12 months trying to convince voters that he\u2019s conservative, will stand up for them, wants to secure the border and is independent among other things. He said such candidates go to Washington after being elected and do just the opposite. \u201cHe\u2019s already done that, he\u2019s done it several election cycles,\u201d Levin said of McCain.\n\nWard reminded the audience that McCain has been in office for over 30 years. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been there a long time it\u2019s very easy to lose touch with the people you represent. I think that we need people who are of the people, who are those people, who are in Washington representing us so we get government for, of and by the people. Right now we\u2019re getting D.C. represented in Arizona, rather than Arizona represented in D.C.\u201d Ward concluded, \u201cI\u2019d like to see that change.\u201d\n\nLevin ended the segment saying he hopes that Ward jumps into the race.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Potential McCain Challenger Kelli Ward Tells Mark Levin: 'This Is A David And Goliath Story", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Potential McCain Challenger Kelli Ward Tells Mark Levin: 'This Is A David And Goliath Story", "title": "Potential McCain Challenger Kelli Ward Tells Mark Levin: 'This Is A David And Goliath Story - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/McCain-129-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/26/potential-mccain-challenger-kelli-ward-tells-mark-levin-this-is-a-david-and-goliath-story/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Potential McCain Challenger Kelli Ward Tells Mark Levin: 'This Is A David And Goliath Story", "title": "Potential McCain Challenger Kelli Ward Tells Mark Levin: 'This Is A David And Goliath Story - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/McCain-129-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@michellediana", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Arizona, border security, Constitutional conservative, David and Goliath, Mark Levin, national security, new generation, obamacare, physician, Senator John McCain, State Senator Kelli Ward,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-26T06:27:07-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "State Senator Kelli Ward", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01ee\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cBelieve me, I know this is a David and Goliath story,\u201d Arizona State Senator Kelli Ward (R-Lake Havasu City) told national radio host Mark Levin.\nHer interview centered around the possibility that Ward may challenge Republican establishment incumbent Senator John McCain in a 2016 primary.\nWard reminded the audience that McCain has been in office for over 30 years.\n\u201cI will tell you that I\u2019ve seen the shift back to the conservative Senator,\u201d speaking of McCain, suggesting it is a temporary change.\nThat propelled Ward to run for office as the Senator for the 5th district of Arizona."}
