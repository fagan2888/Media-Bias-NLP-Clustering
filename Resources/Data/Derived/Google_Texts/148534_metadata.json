Police say when they arrived, they found that a man inside the club had been shot in the buttocks. He was quickly taken to the hospital, but police say they don't believe his injury was life-threatening. He was hit only once, and he is expected to quickly recover. Since the shooting happened in a nightclub, there were witnesses who saw what happened, and investigators are now talking to them to learn more.\n\n\"We're in the early part of the investigation. Detectives will have to try to collect more evidence and also interview more witnesses and determine who's a suspect in this case. \"\n\nRight now, they're not sure who that suspect is or how the attack started. And if you have any information, you can call Crimestoppers at 855-485-TIPS.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Meridian police are investigating an early morning shooting at a local nightclub.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Meridian police are investigating an early morning shooting at a local nightclub.", "title": "Local Man Shot in Buttocks at Meridian Nightclub", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Local-Man-Shot-in-Buttocks-at-Meridian-Nightclub-285039531.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/00A/4D9/00A4D98615D84234924191D076715248", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/ECA/67A/ECA67AFAC34C494CB627F7F2FECC16FE.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Meridian police are investigating an early morning shooting at a local nightclub.", "title": "Local Man Shot in Buttocks at Meridian Nightclub", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Local-Man-Shot-in-Buttocks-at-Meridian-Nightclub-285039531.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/shooting300.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Local Man Shot in Buttocks at Meridian Nightclub", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local Man Shot in Buttocks"}, "article_summary": "Police say when they arrived, they found that a man inside the club had been shot in the buttocks.\nMeridian police are investigating an early morning shooting at a local nightclub.\nSince the shooting happened in a nightclub, there were witnesses who saw what happened, and investigators are now talking to them to learn more.\nThe call came in around 3 a.m. Sunday that there was a shooting in the Sportsman's Club on 5th Street.\nDetectives will have to try to collect more evidence and also interview more witnesses and determine who's a suspect in this case. \""}
