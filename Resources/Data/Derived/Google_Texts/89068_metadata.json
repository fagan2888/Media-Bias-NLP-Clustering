Key area bioscience companies include Baxter International, which manufactures infusion pumps at a plant in Medina, and Greatbatch, the medical device and pacemaker battery maker, which has facilities in Clarence and Alden.\n\n\u201cWe have a steady supply of highly skilled, highly motivated, very dependable, very hard workers,\u201d Nelson Patterson, a Baxter vice president, said in the MedTech report.\n\nMedTech includes Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties as Western New York, leaving out Baxter\u2019s 550 New York workers from the local total.\n\nThe 234 bioscience companies in the five local counties employed 7,464 workers in 2012, among 28,591 workers across upstate and 74,557 throughout New York, MedTech reported.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012, while Western New York saw the number of bioscience jobs rise by 4 percent, upstate saw a drop of 4 percent and New York overall saw a drop of 2 percent. Jobs in the industry remained flat nationwide over that period.\n\nStatewide, gains in the research and testing lab sectors were offset by steeper job losses in medical devices and pharmaceuticals, as those sectors felt the sting the recession.\n\nIn addition to strong showings in contract biomedical research and lab testing, the Western New York region also employs more biochemists and biophysicists than the national average, Crawford said.\n\nBioscience jobs are valued because they pay more than jobs in other industries. The average biomedical job in Upstate New York pays nearly $71,900, roughly $30,000 more than the $41,373 average private-sector job, according to Battelle\u2019s technology partnership practice, a contributor to the report.\n\nMedTech found that every bioscience job in Western New York supports an additional 1.7 jobs at vendor or supply-chain companies, with 21,768 workers directly or indirectly tied to the industry here, earning $1.3 billion in total compensation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an extremely high multiplier, so you get a bigger bang for your buck related to the biosciences versus most industries,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe bioscience industry pulls in billions of dollars in research and development funding, as well, and New York inventors received 6,400 bioscience patents between 2009 and 2013.\n\nBut the decline in federal R&D funding makes initiatives such as the state\u2019s Buffalo Billion even more valuable, said Crawford, who wants to see the program expanded statewide.\n\nFurther, bioscience companies are having to reinvent themselves in the face of new regulations featured in the Affordable Care Act, including a fundamental reshaping of the health-care payment model and a tax on medical-device makers. Other changes, such as the increasing adoption of electronic health records, present challenges and opportunities for MedTech members, Crawford said.\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employment in the biosciences sector is growing at a faster clip in Western New York than in Upstate New York and the state as a whole, fueled by strong performance locally in the areas of biomedical research, medical testing and drug distribution, an economic-impact analysis by an industry trade gr...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Employment in the biosciences sector is growing at a faster clip in Western New York than in Upstate New York and the state as a whole, fueled by strong performance locally in the areas of biomedical research, medical testing and drug distribution, an economic-impact analysis by an industry trade gr... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Biosciences industry growth boosts Buffalo Niagara economy, report finds  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/biosciences-industry-growth-boosts-buffalo-niagara-economy-report-finds-20140918", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20140918/BUSINESS/140918835/AR/0/AR-140918835.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Bioscience jobs are valued because they pay more than jobs in other industries.\nMedTech includes Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties as Western New York, leaving out Baxter\u2019s 550 New York workers from the local total.\nThe wide-ranging industry includes companies that make biomedical equipment and supplies, manufacture and prepare medical drugs, produce vaccines and conduct lab testing.\nThe 234 bioscience companies in the five local counties employed 7,464 workers in 2012, among 28,591 workers across upstate and 74,557 throughout New York, MedTech reported.\nOther changes, such as the increasing adoption of electronic health records, present challenges and opportunities for MedTech members, Crawford said."}
