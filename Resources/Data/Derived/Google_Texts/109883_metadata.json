When we started looking at these three programs in particular they lost money every month,\u201d Calhoun said.\n\nThat loss has been $65,000 since the school year began.\n\n\u201cIn the past we\u2019ve been able to prop up our daycares by our On-Deck and Third-Base programs but we\u2019re now starting to cut in to the complete Community Education budget and it\u2019s something we can no longer afford,\u201d Calhoun said.\n\nThe school system hopes to help parents find other locations for their children. Calhoun believes there\u2019s enough space open in Kanawha County to absorb the need.\n\nCalhoun said the school system daycares have probably been a little too inexpensive over the years.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to be the cheapest game in town because we have no overhead as far as buildings go,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are repairs needed to be made at Public Employees (daycare) that we just couldn\u2019t afford to make.\u201d\n\nThe Kanawha County Community Education program operates four before school programs (On Deck) and 21 after school programs (Third Base).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Public Employees Daycare near state capitol on the list.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Public Employees Daycare near state capitol on the list.", "title": "Kanawha schools closing three daycare centers", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/02/18/kcs-closing-three-daycare-centers/", "image": {"width": 1066, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/daycare.jpg", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/daycare.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-18T19:44:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-18T19:49:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "By Jeff Jenkins in News | February 18, 2014 at 2:44PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Kanawha County Schools announced Tuesday plans to close three child daycare centers by the end of March, impacting 120 children and 40 staff members.\nEarly Childhood Education Executive Director Bob Calhoun said the agency began reviewing the West Virginia Public Employees Daycare, Elk Center Daycare and Shawnee Daycare about a year ago.\nThe school system hopes to help parents find other locations for their children.\nCalhoun believes there\u2019s enough space open in Kanawha County to absorb the need.\nCalhoun said the school system daycares have probably been a little too inexpensive over the years."}
