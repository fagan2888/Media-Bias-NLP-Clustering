AccessHealthCT, the quasi-public state agency that runs Connecticut’s Obamacare exchange, spent nearly $75,000 to commission three murals, plus nearly $4,000 to have one of them installed.

Contracts with the three artists — Adam Niklewicz, Katro Storm, and Rafael Cornier Jr. — show they were each paid $24,980 to produce murals 8 feet tall and 32 feet long.

The agency paid AdamsAhern Sign Solutions $3,945.51 to install the Niklewicz mural at the Hispanic Health Council in Hartford.

Just before Thanksgiving, state officials gathered at Optimus Health Care in Bridgeport to unveil the Cornier mural, which, according to the New Haven Register, is intended to inspire New Haven residents to “embrace health and wellness.”

“Healthcare reform isn’t just about getting people insurance for unexpected medical emergencies, it’s also about providing access to the preventative care and wellness programs that will help people become and stay healthier,” said Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, a co-chairman of the AccessHealthCT board. “This mural is a creative way for us to express that commitment to building healthier communities.”

Storm’s mural is at theStetson Branch Library in New Haven.

The contracts are publicly available on the exchange’s website.
