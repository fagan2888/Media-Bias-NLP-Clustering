Additionally, CEOs were paid well over six figures, including the Health Republic Insurance of New York, which paid its president and CEO $427,000.\n\nThat co-op closed last fall and is now under investigation for its finances.\n\nThe nine co-ops that collapsed in 2015 paid their CEOs a combined $2.8 million.\n\nNew Mexico Health Connections listed net assets of $23.2 million in 2014, though it lost $2.97 million the same year. Every employee of the co-op made over six figures, including CEO Martin Hickey who made $262,874.\n\nThe New Mexico co-op is still operating, though it announced last year it was dropping preferred provider plans, limiting individuals who purchase insurance through the co-op to the more restrictive health maintenance organization plans, or HMOs.\n\nCo-ops in Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Tennessee, Utah, and Oregon listed net assets despite suffering multi-million dollar losses in 2014. All have since folded.\n\nFor instance, Kentucky Health Cooperative lost $50.4 million, but reported net assets of $65.2 million. The co-op shut down in October. \u201cIn plainest language, things have come up short of where they need to be,\u201d the interim CEO said at the time.\n\nLouisiana Health Cooperative lost $20.8 million, but listed net assets of $14.1 million and paid its CEO $307,000.\n\nThe co-op announced it would end all policies by 2016. Its founders were able to rake in $3.6 million in contracts from the co-op in 2013, the Times-Picayune reported.\n\nHealth Republic Insurance of New York listed $77.5 million in losses, but also $63.7 million in net assets. CEO Debra Friedman was the highest paid official at a failed Obamacare co-op, earning $427,632 in 2014. The co-op closed in November, leaving 200,000 New Yorkers without coverage.\n\nHealth Republic Insurance of New York is being investigated by the state for \u201csubstantial under-reporting\u201d of its finances and may be investigated by the FBI.\n\nCommunity Health Alliance Tennessee ended coverage for 27,000 people in October. The co-op reported $22.9 million in net assets, and suffered $22.1 million in losses the year before.\n\nHealth Republic Insurance Company in Oregon, which also closed in October, is now suing the federal government for $5 billion. The co-op filed suit because it never received $20 million in federal funding after Congress amended the \u201crisk corridor\u201d program under Obamacare. The co-op still owes the federal government $60 million in loans.\n\nPrior to the lawsuit, the Oregon-based co-op lost $12.9 million, but reported $11.4 million in net assets.\n\nNevada Health did not paint a rosy picture of its finances to the IRS, and did not count taxpayer-funded loans as assets on its filings. The co-op lost over $16 million in 2014, and reported negative net assets of $29 million. Citing high costs, Nevada Health closed in August after receiving $65.9 million in loans from the federal government.\n\nThe outlook for co-ops still operating is grim. Agency officials are now warning that eight of the 11 remaining co-ops are on the verge of financial collapse.\n\nThis year is a \u201cmake or break\u201d for Evergreen Health Cooperative in Maryland, which used the same accounting trick, listing $8 million in net assets despite losing $16.3 million.\n\nThe prospects for Maine Community Health Options, which listed negative $1 million in assets, seem grim after the co-op lost more than $17 million in the first nine months of 2015.\n\nEven co-ops that are confident about their finances, like HealthyCT, Inc. do not expect to turn a profit until 2017. The co-op lost $28 million in 2014, but listed $58 million in net assets.\n\nOregon\u2019s Health Co-Op, the second co-op in the state, is still operating, and listed negative net assets of $17.7 million in 2014. The co-op paid its CEO $315,706 despite \u201cabysmal enrollment\u201d that drew less than 1,600 members. This resulted in a $6.8 million loss for the co-op.\n\nThe Portland Tribune recently noted the co-op has survived on a \u201ccombination of caution and pure luck.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Co-ops created under Obamacare reported net assets despite losing millions because they used an accounting trick.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Co-ops created under Obamacare reported net assets despite losing millions because they used an accounting trick approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
