But because the pace of new product development in health-care technology is accelerating, finding that balance has become more difficult as the distinctions between medical devices, software and consumer applications blur. Health IT firms ranging from two-person startups to Fortune 500 companies are urging Congress and federal agencies to clarify and simplify several aspects of regulation and to more frequently update their guidance.\n\nThere are two key areas where business leaders argue that laws and regulations are impeding innovation: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which protects the privacy and security of patient data; and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process, which software companies say is too ambiguous about which types of software will be regulated.\n\nHIPAA, first signed into law in 1996, was updated in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule required by the HITECH Act of 2010. The update strengthened privacy, security and enforcement provisions, but many people designing mobile health applications say it did not simplify policy and technical language. Some complain that instead of specifying how to comply, the regulations offer only high-level recommendations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) refers developers to other resources such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for recommendations on how to encrypt data, for instance.\n\nDr. Divya Dhar is the CEO of Seratis, a Philadelphia-based startup that has created a secure patient-centric mobile messaging application for doctors, nurses and other health-care providers. The application also involves some data analytics. She stresses that in one sense, HIPAA rules enable innovation.\n\n\"The patient should have access to their health data and should very easily be able to say who else they want to share it with,\" says Dr. Divya Dhar, CEO of Seratis.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there is HIPAA means that a secure messaging service like ours is important,\u201d Dhar said. \u201cWithout it, people would just use things like iMessage and Android SMS.\u201d On the other hand, she says, HIPAA can hinder innovation. \u201cBecause data gets locked in, you are unable to use it for the big data analytics piece,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if a patient came to you and wanted to share that data, you would have to go through several hoops to make that happen. The patient should have access to their health data and should very easily be able to say who else they want to share it with.\u201d\n\nDhar said her company had to hire attorneys to make sure its solution complied with HIPAA policies when providers put it in place. \u201cThe policy piece is hard to decipher on your own, and we worked with a very good firm, but obviously that is extremely expensive.\u201d App developers say the law should be written so people can implement it without having to hire lawyers to understand its basic elements.\n\nIn fact, one startup, Atlas Health in Nashville, Tenn., has built its business model around helping other startups meet HIPAA requirements. \u201cThe company\u2019s founding was inspired by my own experience as an independent software developer working for small health-care organizations \u2014 people with ideas for the next big mobile health app,\u201d said Philip Misiowiec, president of Atlas Health. \u201cI realized areas of HIPAA are really murky. You have to spend a lot of time digging through it. It is like reading an encyclopedia.\u201d There are high-end consulting groups that can solve HIPAA woes, but they are expensive, he said. \u201cA two-person company developing a mobile app doesn\u2019t have that kind of money, so that is where we come in.\u201d\n\nMisiowiec said he has made several recommendations to the federal Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC). \u201cFirst, they should develop a simplified guide that says here is how HIPAA applies to you, the possible use cases and what you need to do \u2014 with specific guidelines, including bringing what NIST recommends into that same document.\u201d Second, he said, the ONC should create and maintain an online community for developers to share information. \u201cIf you look at the developer community, there are a lot of great resources like Stack Exchange,\u201d said Misiowiec. \u201cJust having a resource to post questions would be helpful.\u201d\n\nMorgan Reed, executive director of ACT, the App Association, which represents approximately 5,000 app companies and IT firms, said there is a huge disparity in the quality of user experience in the applications available in health care and in other sectors of the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though there are no good ideas out there, but health care is often where good ideas go to die,\u201d he said. At least part of the reason involves regulatory barriers people face when developing apps in this space.\n\nOne area Reed wants to see Congress and HHS revisit is whether cloud service vendors should be required to meet HIPAA requirements as \u201cbusiness associates\u201d of health-care providers.\n\n\"It\u2019s not as though there are no good ideas out there,\" says Morgan Reed, executive director of ACT, the App Association, \"but health care is often where good ideas go to die.\"\n\n\u201cIf you are merely using a cloud service as a waypoint as data moves on to a care team and it is end-to-end encrypted, why require business associate agreements?\u201d Reed asked. \u201cIf every single waypoint has to have a business associate agreement, that is going to slow down the ability to move forward on some of these technologies, especially in one key area: the quantified health solutions such as Apple\u2019s HealthKit and Fitbit, as those products start being more useful.\u201d\n\nAnother problem app developers face is outdated documentation on HHS websites. For programmers, examples are key to how they learn and build their business model, Reed said. But if the examples given predate the iPhone and only reference BlackBerry, then that leads to uncertainty. \u201cThe examples are so out of date that you can\u2019t make a coherent case to your venture capitalists or investors,\u201d he added.\n\nSome analysts and consultants argue that the language of HIPAA security rules is ambiguous by design to put the burden of determining what compliance means on the regulated organizations themselves, based on their own structures, size and budgets. They say companies should be careful about demanding that HHS provide more specificity, because they may not like the more rigid framework drawn up in response.\n\nReed said the industry is glad that HHS takes a technology-neutral approach to HIPAA, and he admits that the ONC and HHS\u2019 Office for Civil Rights are in a difficult position of trying to ensure the privacy and security of data on one hand and accessibility and flow of data on the other. \u201cThey are absolutely trying to figure out how to take advantage of this enormous explosion of mobile health apps that can change patient outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to figure out how they can restructure documents that are going on 10 years old to reflect high-speed Internet, mobile devices and wearables, and it is all coming at them now, and not just on the patient side, but on the physician side as well.\u201d\n\nACT recently sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., asking Congress to push HHS to make changes to HIPAA. Among its suggestions are that \u201cHHS should provide HIPAA information in a manner that is accessible and useful to the community who needs it. The agency should draft new FAQs that directly address mobile developer concerns.\u201d It also asks that the Office for Civil Rights improve and update guidance on acceptable implementations. \u201cGiven that HIPAA is a federal statute that mandates several requirements, OCR should provide implementation standards \u2014 or examples of standard implementations that would not trigger an enforcement action \u2014 instead of leaving app makers to learn about these through an audit,\u201d the letter said.\n\nCalls for Change at the FDA\n\nIf grumbling about HIPAA compliance is commonplace, the complaints about the FDA approval process are much louder and insistent. Facing a growing number of applications that move data (and sometimes care recommendations) between devices, providers\u2019 electronic health records and patients\u2019 mobile devices, the FDA has sought to understand which ones pose a potential patient safety risk and require a formal approval process. So far, the FDA is taking a fairly hands-off approach and requiring approval for few types of applications while it learns more about the burgeoning market. But that ambiguity is tough on entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding.\n\n\u201cI know developers who have opted to go into other things rather than mobile apps they think would be subject to FDA approval now or in the future,\u201d said Joel White, executive director of the Health IT Now Coalition, which represents patient groups, provider organizations, employers and payers. \u201cAnd I know companies that are building regulatory risk premiums into their product development, which would make them more expensive,\u201d he added. \u201cEither the products don\u2019t get developed or they are more expensive. Either way, it is not a good situation, which is why we want more clarity so we can have an environment that promotes innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere should be greater certainty about which technologies will be regulated, by whom and to which standards,\u201d said Mike Marchlik, vice president of quality assurance and regulatory affairs for health IT company McKesson, in an email interview. \u201cThe current model of using the 40-year-old device definition and statute to govern modern health IT creates significant uncertainty, subjects health IT regulation to the changing political landscape, and therefore has the potential to stifle innovation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that lawmakers have been working with health-care stakeholders and patient and provider organizations to define categories that ensure patient safety, foster regulatory certainty and promote innovation. Last year legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress that would create three definitions of health-related software: \u201cmedical software,\u201d \u201cclinical software\u201d and \u201chealth software.\u201d Only medical software would be subject to regulation by the FDA.\n\nIn response, the FDA, working with ONC and the FCC, issued a lengthy draft report (the FDASIA Health IT Report) that recommends a similar three-bucket regulatory risk-based framework, but doesn\u2019t set the categories in stone and leaves some questions unanswered, critics say. (The report also calls for the creation of a Health IT Safety Center to study issues related to patient safety.)\n\nA fundamental tension has developed between the FDA on one hand and software companies and some members of Congress on the other, explained Bradley Merrill Thompson, general counsel of the mHealth Regulatory Coalition. \u201cMembers of Congress want to lock the definitions and process in, and FDA is saying we don\u2019t know enough to draw those lines with enough certainty that a year from now we won\u2019t need to revisit them,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA is saying you need to leave us flexibility about what causes harm and allow us to be flexible in how we apply the rules. Innovators are saying we don\u2019t know whether our product will be regulated or not and investors need to know. There has to be some compromise between those positions.\u201d\n\n\"If you actually drop the pins in the sandbox on regulatory guidance and pour concrete around those pins in an embryonic and evolving market, you might do a disservice to the market,\" says Anand Iyer, chief data science officer at WellDoc.\n\nOne technology executive who believes the FDA\u2019s approach is the correct one is Anand Iyer, chief data science officer at disease management software company WellDoc, based in Baltimore. His company received FDA approval for its \u201cmobile prescription therapy\u201d software more than five years ago. The company\u2019s BlueStar platform is used to help diabetes patients adhere to physicians\u2019 treatment recommendations.\n\nIyer said the FDA was wise to develop an approach called \u201cenforcement discretion,\u201d which leaves it to the manufacturer to conduct a risk analysis and assure stakeholders that it has followed good manufacturing processes and that it doesn\u2019t believe its product is going to create any residual risk to a patient.\n\n\u201cI think this was helpful,\u201d Iyer said. \u201cIt offers flexibility. Truthfully it is too early to be more prescriptive. If you actually drop the pins in the sandbox on regulatory guidance and pour concrete around those pins in an embryonic and evolving market, you might do a disservice to the market. You might constrain it in ways that could be completely wrong.\u201d\n\nIyer said WellDoc solved issues with the FDA through informal dialog. There is a formal process called 513(g) that companies can use to go on record to officially ask the FDA for its perspective and feedback on something. \u201cWe have not done that yet,\u201d Iyer said. \u201cWe were fortunate to be part of many public-private, open-forum discussions with the FDA. These were open things we would just discuss and debate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also have held summits with the FDA, NIH, FTC, National Science Foundation and others to create a cross-governmental perspective on mobile health applications as it relates to regulation, risk and patient safety.\u201d\n\nYet others still see much room for improvement. The FDA\u2019s approval process is badly in need of repair on a couple of different levels, said Thompson. One is the threshold question of defining with precision what it does and does not regulate. \u201cWe have been asking since 2011, over three years, to publish a guidance document defining the portion of clinical decision support software that they intend to regulate,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the FDASIA Health IT Report, the FDA said it would figure out later what to do about clinical decision support, according to Health IT Now\u2019s White. \u201cLater is now for companies like IBM trying to put products based on Watson on the market that link people with clinical trials using clinical decision support,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother unanswered question relates to accessories and connected health. \u201cThe old rule was that if something connects to or plugs into a medical device, it is a medical device regulated in the same manner,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWell, now everything is connected to everything else in a network, so that rule doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. We are scratching our heads trying to figure out where medical devices stop and start. FDA promised us guidance on that, and it is not out yet.\u201d\n\nThe FDA also could be nimbler in response to developer requests, suggested Reed. \u201cWe have been forthright and aggressive with the FDA about some of the timelines to get through the 510(k) or the 513(g) process. [A 510(k) is a notice of intent to market a medical device.]\n\nThe idea that you have to wait for 100 days to hear back on something is not reasonable.\u201d The developer community says that even an answer of \u201cno\u201d is better than no answer at all. \u201cThen at least they know how to begin to address the problem or do something differently,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt is the nonexistent answer that kills.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a conference symposium last February, FDA senior policy adviser Bakul Patel told the audience that in 80 percent of the cases, the agency had met the statutory 90-day timeframe under the 510(k) process, according to a report in Health Data Management.\n\nPatel described the oversight as focused on a small subset of apps that present the greatest risk to patients, while the vast majority of apps do not require active FDA oversight because they do not meet the definition of a medical device under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the report said.\n\nBy its definition, digital health is at the nexus of clinical innovation, behavioral science innovation, pharmaceutical innovation, and consumer electronics and gadget innovation, WellDoc\u2019s Iyer said. That requires a complementary structure of policy and regulation and data security and privacy. He said you could imagine that complicated picture in one of two ways: One is a shoelace that has 16 tangled knots in it. The other is the intersection of freeways 405 and 10 in Los Angeles \u2014 chaotic but well structured. Every onramp and offramp has a purpose.\n\n\u201cThat is the future you want to invoke: well structured, highly complex, with lots of moving parts, but it works,\u201d Iyer said. \u201cThis is the mother of all freeway interchanges, and I think the traffic is starting to flow. People were reticent to get on the onramp, but now you see more people getting on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Health IT firms are urging Congress and federal agencies to clarify and simplify several aspects of regulation, and to more frequently update their guidance.", "pubDate": "2015-01-13", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/Feature_HealthPolicy-1.jpg", "title": "Digital Health Dilemma: Regulators Struggle to Keep Pace with Health-Care Technology Innovation"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaafa\"", "article_summary": "Last year legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress that would create three definitions of health-related software: \u201cmedical software,\u201d \u201cclinical software\u201d and \u201chealth software.\u201d Only medical software would be subject to regulation by the FDA.\nThe update strengthened privacy, security and enforcement provisions, but many people designing mobile health applications say it did not simplify policy and technical language.\nBy its definition, digital health is at the nexus of clinical innovation, behavioral science innovation, pharmaceutical innovation, and consumer electronics and gadget innovation, WellDoc\u2019s Iyer said.\nFederal health-care regulators walk a fine line between protecting the public\u2019s health and fostering innovation in a huge sector of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\u201cThey are absolutely trying to figure out how to take advantage of this enormous explosion of mobile health apps that can change patient outcomes,\u201d he said."}
