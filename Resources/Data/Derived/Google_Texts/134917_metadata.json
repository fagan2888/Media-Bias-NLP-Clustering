According to a recent study published in the journal Human Nature, the simple act of laughing can influence people\u2019s willingness to disclose personal information about themselves.\n\nLaughter can be a powerful tool in interpersonal relationships. The act of sharing the pleasure of humor creates a sense of intimacy and a bond between two people. Laughing creates a positive connection that can be a buffer against stress and disagreements in any relationship.\n\nSharing a laugh also creates the feeling of playfulness that can prime someone to smile and join the fun. A 2012 study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences found laughter actually triggers endorphin activity via the muscular exertions involved when producing the \u201cha ha ha\u201d sound. Endorphins are known for their feel-good effect, which makes individuals more relaxed about what they communicate, including their secrets.\n\nAlan Gray, lead author of the study at the University College London in the UK and his colleagues sought to determine if laughter can temporarily influence the laugher\u2019s willingness to reveal personal information like secrets. The researchers recruited 122 undergraduates, split them into groups of four, and had them watch one of three clips, including a stand-up comedy routine by Michael McIntyre, another straightforward golf instruction video, and the third a pleasant nature excerpt from the \"Jungles\" episode of the BBC's Planet Earth series. The students were required to watch the 10-minute clips together, but without chatting to one another.\n\nThese clips were meant to induce laughter, a pleasant mood, or nothing at all, like the \u201chow to play golf\u201d clip serving as the control condition. After the video, the students were instructed to write a little bio introducing themselves to another member of the group. The researchers would use the bio to determine the effect the clips had on the participants' willingness to self-disclose.\n\nThe findings revealed laughter is actually the social lubricant that bonds people together when it comes to forming new relationships. Those who watched the comedy video shared more personal details compared to the good mood and neutral mood groups. In comparison, both of the other groups were more likely to share details that were relatively dull and did not reveal a plethora of information about themselves.\n\n\"This seems to be in line with the notion that laughter is linked specifically to fostering behaviors that encourage relationship development, since observer ratings of disclosure may be more important for relationship development than how much one feels one is disclosing,\" Gray said in the press release. \"These results suggest that laughter should be a serious topic for those interested in the development of social relationships.\" This suggests laughter can serve as a shortcut to forming new relationships.\n\nThis study correlates with the findings of a previous 2010 study published in the journal Small Group Research, which found laughter can play key roles in group communication and group dynamics, even when there\u2019s nothing funny going on. The role of laughter in jury deliberations during a capital murder case was analyzed in the 2010 study. The findings revealed laughter does matter, even when it\u2019s a serious group task. For example, the jury was unclear on whether a sentence related to one of the charges was for 30 days or 30 years, which led to confusion and laughter. This allowed the jurors to release some tension while allowing them to acknowledge they made an error, and move on as the error was corrected.\n\nLaughter is not only be the best medicine, it may be the best way to make new friends and share secrets, too.\n\nSources: Gray, AW, Dunbar RI, Parkinson B.
