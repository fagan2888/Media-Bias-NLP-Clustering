Here are five things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary vote on Sunday:\n\nUKRAINE FACTOR\n\nSecurity is a key concern for Estonian voters following Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. Even though Estonia is a NATO member, many are worried that Moscow may try to boost its influence in the country, a former Soviet republic where about one-fourth of the 1.3 million residents are ethnic Russians.\n\nSecurity policy is a rare issue on which the main political parties mostly agree. All favor robust defense spending and a strong presence of NATO forces in Estonia. However, the opposition Center Party \u2014 the party of choice for most ethnic Russians \u2014 favors a friendlier approach to Moscow to balance ties with the West.\n\nFLAT TAX\n\nEstonia is known for its pro-market policies and small public sector. It was among the first European countries to introduce a flat tax on personal income, currently set at 20 percent. Companies pay no taxes on reinvested earnings, a rule meant to help startups and other firms expand.\n\nAnalysts say the flat tax is likely to stay though two parties, the Social Democrats and the Center Party, support introducing progressive taxation instead.\n\nE-VOTING\n\nEstonia is a pioneer in electronic voting, becoming the first country to implement Internet voting in a nationwide election in 2005.\n\nElection officials say more than 176,000 voters chose to mark their ballots electronically this year, an increase of 25 percent from 2011.\n\nThe key to the system is Estonia\u2019s national ID card \u2014 nearly all residents have one \u2014 complete with a microchip. Together with a card reader and computer, it allows voters to log on to an election website and cast a vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "5 things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary election", "author": "Jari Tanner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "5 things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary election", "title": "5 things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary election", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/5_things_to_know_about_estonias_parliamentary_election/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/correction-estonia-independence-day.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "5 things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary election", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/correction-estonia-independence-day.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "title": "5 things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary election", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary election", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ca5\"", "article_summary": "Here are five things to know about Estonia\u2019s parliamentary vote on Sunday:UKRAINE FACTORSecurity is a key concern for Estonian voters following Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.\nThe key to the system is Estonia\u2019s national ID card \u2014 nearly all residents have one \u2014 complete with a microchip.\nTogether with a card reader and computer, it allows voters to log on to an election website and cast a vote.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsTALLINN, Estonia (AP) \u2014 Estonia\u2019s center-right government is being challenged by a party that draws its support from the Baltic country\u2019s Russian minority.\nE-VOTINGEstonia is a pioneer in electronic voting, becoming the first country to implement Internet voting in a nationwide election in 2005."}
