Panama City Beach Fire officials spent Saturday afternoon putting out a brush fire on the west end of the beach.

Around 1:30 p.m. crews responded to Manistee Drive off Back Beach Road, just west of Highway 79 in reference to a fire.

The strong winds caused the flames to quickly spread, and some sheds and fences were damaged by the fire.

Luckily, crews were able to contain the fire within thirty minutes.

No one was injured.

At this time officials are still investigating the cause of the fire.
