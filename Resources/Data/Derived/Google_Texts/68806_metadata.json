Shifting from investment grade to speculative grade impacts borrowing costs for the hospital.\n\nThe rating agency also placed the ratings on a \u201cCreditwatch with negative implications.\u201d\n\nNick Espinosa, marketing director for the medical center, said he was unaware of the rating lowering. He told The Monitor he would talk to hospital officials about the development and call back; he never did.\n\nA default means the hospital has not fulfilled specific requirements in order to qualify for the bonds, or loans.\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s said in its report that the projected loss, compared with the hospital\u2019s budget for $2.1 million of operating income, is the result of Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\nA financial newsletter called The Bond Buyer explained that Mission Medical Center is suffering the same crisis as many other Texas hospitals because state officials, protesting the so-called Obamacare, are refusing federal funds to expand Medicaid coverage.\n\nMission hospital directors have already reached out to a bond trustee and a notice of noncompliance with the debt service coverage is forthcoming, the S&P report said.\n\nThis marks the second time this year that S&P lowered the hospital\u2019s bond rating. In March, the rating service lowered it to a \u201cBBB-\u201d from a \u201cBBB.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the rating company indicated softer patient volumes, modest reserves and its business position with competitors as reasons for its new ratin", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "local_news", "og": {"site_name": "Valley Morning Star", "description": "MISSION \u2014 The owners of Mission Regional Medical Center have had their credit bond rating lowered for the second time this year and the hospital may fall into technical default on its bonds, Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Service warned.", "title": "Mission hospital faces low credit bond rating", "url": "http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/local_news/article_e40d029c-ad0d-11e5-8049-9f3b8ecb2934.html", "image": "http://www.aim-ads.com/multimedia-themonitor-com/wwwroot/star_icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@valleystar", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 333523476743065}, "keywords": "local_news", "google-site-verification": "BXTS2lONfpmhbwkgYeWd5fN5Kfc5F3ATaP0EA89JLjA", "description": "MISSION \u2014 The owners of Mission Regional Medical Center have had their credit bond rating lowered for the second time this year and the hospital may fall into technical default on its bonds, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Rating Service warned."}, "article_summary": "MISSION \u2014 The owners of Mission Regional Medical Center have had their credit bond rating lowered for the second time this year and the hospital may fall into technical default on its bonds, Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Service warned.\nThis marks the second time this year that S&P lowered the hospital\u2019s bond rating.\nIn March, the rating service lowered it to a \u201cBBB-\u201d from a \u201cBBB.\u201dAt the time, the rating company indicated softer patient volumes, modest reserves and its business position with competitors as reasons for its new ratin\nHidalgo County Health Services Corp., which owns the facility based in Mission, saw its bond rating drop to \u201cBB+\u201d from \u201cBBB-,\u201d said the Dec. 15 report by Standard & Poor\u2019s.\nMission hospital directors have already reached out to a bond trustee and a notice of noncompliance with the debt service coverage is forthcoming, the S&P report said."}
