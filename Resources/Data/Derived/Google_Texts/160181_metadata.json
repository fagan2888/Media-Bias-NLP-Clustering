Joni Ernst (R-IA) is coming under fire for her failure to address what many consider to be one of the biggest constitutional overreaches by a president in U.S. history in her prime time response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nErnst didn\u2019t mention the fact that Obama just weeks earlier announced an executive amnesty for millions of illegal aliens that Obama himself has said at least 22 times over several years he didn\u2019t have the authority to do. She also didn\u2019t note that, largely because of Obama\u2019s big government policies, the nation is $18 trillion in debt.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty was a glaring omission from her speech,\u201d Rosemary Jenks, anti-amnesty grassroots group NumbersUSA\u2019s director of government relations, told Breitbart News when reached by phone on Wednesday.\n\nDavid Bozell, the president of conservative grassroots group ForAmerica, blames the GOP establishment\u2014specifically Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner\u2014for Ernst\u2019s failure, since they and others in GOP leadership are intricately involved in the process of writing the official Republican response speech. In a phone interview, Bozell said:\n\nMitch McConnell and company\u2014what they were put in office to do is put together a legislative game plan and lay down a marker and they ran 10,000 ads promising they would stop executive amnesty in the last month of October alone. Sen. Ernst, with respect to her response, I know she\u2019s a smart enough woman to understand that the voters are not going to differentiate between those who decree executive orders and those who fund them. They were put into office to not apply taxpayer resources toward unconstitutional presidential overreach. If they have any thoughts of doing anything other than that, voters will respond in kind in very short order. The Republican Party specifically in the Senate needs to stop being cowards and stop looking for somebody to bail them out like the Judiciary\u2014as Sen. [Ron] Johnson [of Wisconsin] was quoted in the National Review over the weekend saying the best hope we have is through the Judiciary. You\u2019re essentially rendering yourself useless.\n\nErnst spokeswoman Brook Hogueson pointed out to Breitbart News that the senator did mention Republicans oppose Obama\u2019s executive overreach as a general matter in the response. \u201cWe\u2019ll work to correct executive overreach,\u201d Ernst said in the speech.\n\nBut when asked why Ernst didn\u2019t specify executive amnesty in that line\u2014Republicans party-wide consistently hit Obama for \u201cexecutive overreach\u201d on everything: foreign policy, healthcare, IRS handling of conservative nonprofit groups, environmental policy and more\u2014Hogueson didn\u2019t respond.\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian hammered Ernst for that throwaway line about nondescript \u201cexecutive overreach\u201d in a National Review column, writing that Ernst \u201cmade no mention of the issue at all, with only a cryptic promise \u2018to correct executive overreach,\u2019 despite Boehner\u2019s always-implausible claim that he would fight \u2018tooth and nail\u2019 to roll back Obama\u2019s Chavezist decrees.\u201d\n\nErnst\u2019s speech in response to the State of the Union \u201cis higher profile than the average press conference for sure,\u201d Bozell said, giving Ernst a bigger bully pulpit to oppose Obama\u2019s amnesty if she was interested in doing so.\n\n\u201cThis has been the consistent criticism of the GOP leadership operation for the last four to six years,\u201d Bozell continued, adding that the GOP\u2019s multiple responses party-wide makes GOP leadership look like \u201ckeystone cops.\u201d\n\nRep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), a newly elected pro-amnesty Republican, delivered a speech in Spanish that pushed for amnesty\u2014and McConnell delivered a prebuttal to Obama from the Senate floor earlier on Tuesday that like Ernst\u2019s speech didn\u2019t mention the executive amnesty. Only the Tea Party response, by Rep. Curt Clawson (R-FL) in an event hosted by the Tea Party Express, offered any kind of substantive argument against amnesty and in favor of the rule of law when it comes to immigration.\n\n\u201cThis kind of keystone cop apparatus would not happen under Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid,\u201d Bozell added later in the interview. \u201cSo maybe they [Boehner and McConnell] grow into these [leadership] roles. I hold out hope they will grow into them, but I really think it\u2019s going to be incumbent upon the new class to show the American people they\u2019ve got the policies to lead.\u201d\n\nIn addition, while none are publicly bashing Ernst some Republicans are angry with her failure to hammer Obama\u2019s amnesty in the televised speech.\n\n\u201cThe state of the union response apparently was delivered in an alternate universe where the President has not just liquidated America\u2019s borders and the Constitution with a vast lawbreaking amnesty,\u201d one congressional GOP aide told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cAwesome woman, not ready for primetime. They should have never put her up to that. That was unfair to her,\u201d another congressional GOP aide added.\n\nA House GOP aide said, too, that it\u2019s \u201cstrange\u201d that Ernst chose not to hone in on Obama\u2019s executive amnesty in his first visit to Congress since enacting the executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange that in the president\u2019s first visit to Congress since trying to eliminate it that the GOP\u2019s official response wouldn\u2019t even mention it,\u201d the House GOP aide said.\n\nAnother House GOP aide said that if Ernst\u2019s rebuttal speech was \u201chonest\u201d it would have included a response to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cMost Americans oppose President Obama\u2019s unilateral action on immigration \u2013 they feel it\u2019s the wrong approach,\u201d that aide said in an email. \u201cSOTU is an opportunity for President Obama to paint a favorable picture of himself. An honest rebuttal should have included some mention of one of the actions that has most disturbed the American people.\u201d\n\nThat House GOP aide added too that Ernst\u2019s decision to ignore the national debt being at $18 trillion is unbelievable.\n\n\u201cI think she hit some of the right notes, but where was her mention of the debt? It was heartening to hear her say we need to balance the budget, but $18 trillion would have been an important figure to mention,\u201d the aide said.\n\nWhen Ernst was running for office in Iowa against now former Rep. Bruce Braley, she said in one debate that she\u2019d not only be open to tax increases\u2014but that she wouldn\u2019t roll back Obama\u2019s first executive amnesty, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, for so-called DREAMers.\n\n\u201cNo, I would not. No, I would not,\u201d Ernst said when asked if she\u2019d repeal DACA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joni Ernst Under Fire For Failure To Mention Obama Amnesty In SOTU Response", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Joni Ernst Under Fire For Failure To Mention Obama Amnesty In SOTU Response", "title": "Joni Ernst Under Fire For Failure To Mention Obama Amnesty In SOTU Response - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/joni-ernst-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-22T06:49:19-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/22/joni-ernst-under-fire-for-failure-to-mention-obama-amnesty-in-sotu-response/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joni Ernst Under Fire For Failure To Mention Obama Amnesty In SOTU Response", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/joni-ernst-AP.jpg", "title": "Joni Ernst Under Fire For Failure To Mention Obama Amnesty In SOTU Response - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carlos Curbelo, Curt Clawson, DACA, executive amnesty, Joni Ernst, Obama, SOTU,Big Government, Immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-22T04:45:36-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-01-22T06:49:19-07:00", "tag": "SOTU", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Another House GOP aide said that if Ernst\u2019s rebuttal speech was \u201chonest\u201d it would have included a response to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nA House GOP aide said, too, that it\u2019s \u201cstrange\u201d that Ernst chose not to hone in on Obama\u2019s executive amnesty in his first visit to Congress since enacting the executive amnesty.\nErnst spokeswoman Brook Hogueson pointed out to Breitbart News that the senator did mention Republicans oppose Obama\u2019s executive overreach as a general matter in the response.\n\u201cMost Americans oppose President Obama\u2019s unilateral action on immigration \u2013 they feel it\u2019s the wrong approach,\u201d that aide said in an email.\nThat was unfair to her,\u201d another congressional GOP aide added."}
