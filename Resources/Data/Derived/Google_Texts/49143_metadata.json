They want the new mayor and her administration to make homelessness a priority.\n\nBefore dawn Sunday, a former cook at the World Bank, an accountant from Moscow and eight other homeless Washingtonians awoke in the sanctuary of Grace Episcopal Church in Georgetown and stowed away their cots.\n\nA few blocks north of the White House, coffee was brewing in another church fellowship hall at daybreak. A Sudanese man with a clutch of plastic bags was first in line to go inside and warm up.\n\nBy lunchtime, more than 400 homeless men and women \u2014 each with a story of loss \u2014 had come and gone from Franklin Square, where they picked up free sandwiches trucked in from congregations in the District, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nLess than two weeks before the swearing-in of Mayor-elect Muriel E. Bowser, a homeless problem that exploded into the city\u2019s public consciousness last year is again palpable on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe District\u2019s main shelter for homeless families is at capacity, and a motel the city leased to serve as an overflow shelter is filling fast. A census last week showed rising numbers of homeless single adults, with more than 1,460 using emergency nightly shelters even before the bitter heart of winter sets in.\n\nTimothy Lewis is a homeless man who often spends the night near Franklin Square. While he hopes there will be more money to help the homeless under the new mayor, he's not that optimistic that anything will change. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the city\u2019s official tally of whom it counts and whom it shelters tells only a fraction of the story.\n\nSeveral hundred men and women are being fed daily, and scores are housed nightly, through a loose network of church ministries that have either sprung up or expanded in recent years as the city chose a tough-love approach with its homeless.\n\nOrganizers of the charity efforts say they are happy to provide the meals and beds. But they also warn that their ability to cover the District\u2019s growing need is being stretched thin and cannot be sustained indefinitely.\n\nMore than 40 churches, synagogues and other houses of worship are circulating petitions that call on Bowser (D) to sign a covenant to make homelessness and affordable housing a top priority.\n\n\u201cWe want the city to plan better and manage better,\u201d said Ann Friedman, an organizer with Good Faith Communities Coalition, the interfaith group that is organizing the petition drive. \u201cThe city has the money, and we want to see this become a priority.\u201d\n\nBowser won the mayoralty in part by distancing herself last winter from Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who was seen as taking a hard stance in pushing the city\u2019s homeless to get their lives in order. She blasted Gray\u2019s decision to use city recreation centers and partitions provided by the Red Cross to create makeshift and temporary shelters and to bunch families together in gymnasiums and auditoriums. Bowser called it \u201cno way to treat\u201d city residents and vowed to increase funding to support permanent housing.\n\nBut many at a gathering of church leaders and advocates for the homeless on Friday questioned whether Bowser and the D.C. Council \u2014 which last week approved a plan to spend at least $150 million on a new soccer stadium \u2014 are serious about addressing the city\u2019s housing shortage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting \u2014 amen \u2014 for an administration in this city that will have the will to provide homes for all people,\u201d said the Rev. Karen Brau, senior pastor at Luther Place Memorial Church on Thomas Circle.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless marched through downtown Friday carrying a wooden coffin to memorialize the 55 people who they say died in the Washington region this year from causes related to homelessness, including medical conditions aggravated by unstable living conditions and poor access to health care.\n\nAt least part of the city\u2019s surge in homelessness has been blamed on gentrification and dwindling numbers of low-income apartments. While announcing the appointment of Polly Donaldson as her head of the Department of Housing and Community Development on Saturday, Bowser made it clear she sees a connection between the two.\n\nDonaldson for a decade has led Transitional Housing Corp., which focuses on finding transitional housing for families coming out of shelters and apartments for homeless singles with mental health or substance abuse issues. She has also served on the city\u2019s Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming from an agency that has a foot in both\u201d housing and homeless issues, Donaldson said.\n\nAs Joseph Brown, 45, packed up his cot Sunday at Grace Episcopal, he said he was relying on the roving five-month shelter provided by the Georgetown Ministry Center (GMC) rather than any service offered by the city.\n\n\u201cThe city\u2019s shelter is awful, horrible,\u201d filled with violence and disease, he said.\n\nBrown, who once worked for a temp agency as a grill cook at the World Bank, said he took a job as a dishwasher two years ago but lost it to a younger worker. The native of Tanzania said he hasn\u2019t been able to make enough to keep a roof over his head since.\n\nThis year, Brown is hopeful again. He was one of 10 homeless people accepted into the roving shelter, which involves churches in Georgetown setting up cots in vestibules and multipurpose rooms to house people for rotating two-week intervals. Meals are provided by parishioners. The GMC has a small office where guests can shower, do laundry, receive mail and use computers to apply for jobs.\n\nIt has a track record of helping most of the 10 people it accepts each winter secure permanent housing by the time the five-month period ends.\n\nVaughn McCants, 30, who went through the center\u2019s program last year after a breakup and alcoholism left him homeless, said the church ministry did something no city shelter could have: \u201cI never felt before that there were so many people out there willing to help somebody they never met.\u201d\n\nHe is now a music student at the University of the District of Columbia. He said he thinks about his experience on the street every day and avoids offers of part-time work as a bartender so he can stay away from alcohol.\n\n\u201cSuccess? It\u2019s not over,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see how that journey gets started. It got started in me, and I had to take control of myself and not give up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With shelters at capacity or filling fast, organizers warn more must be done to address the growing need.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "With shelters at capacity or filling fast, organizers warn more must be done to address the growing need.", "title": "In D.C., faith groups position to be a political force on homelessness", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/in-dc-faith-groups-position-to-be-a-political-force-on-homelessness/2014/12/21/059e3b54-891c-11e4-8ff4-fb93129c9c8b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/21/Others/Images/2014-12-21/Street051419184392.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@byaaroncdavis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, d.c. homelessness, d.c. homeless, d.c. general, d.c. church groups, d.c. georgetown ministry center, homeless, muriel e. bowser", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis"}, "eomportal-uuid": "059e3b54-891c-11e4-8ff4-fb93129c9c8b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, d.c. homelessness, d.c. homeless, d.c. general, d.c. church groups, d.c. georgetown ministry center, homeless, muriel e. bowser"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd446\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe city\u2019s shelter is awful, horrible,\u201d filled with violence and disease, he said.\nMichael S.
