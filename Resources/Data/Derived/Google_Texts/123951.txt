In the first segment:

The State of Texas' Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) has seen many high-profile instances of neglect and abuse within foster homes, some resulted in 10 deaths last fiscal year under "suspicious circumstances." Two of the deaths were specifically from abuse, as in the case of Alexandra Hill.

Children's Rights recently got the go ahead in its lawsuit against DFPS, hoping to lower caseloads of case workers and increase monitoring and improve vetting of foster parents.

San Antonio state Sen. Carlos Uresti has often written about the future of DFPS. In a recent op-ed in the San Antonio Express News he called for improved standards now rather than waiting for this lawsuit to be resolved. Uresti joins us today to talk about what can be done.

In the seconds segment:

Yesterday Gov. Rick Perry directed the Texas Department of Insurance to regulate the new Federal Navigators program. The program was created by the Affordable Care Act in order to help citizens enroll in the new Health Exchange Programs.

Texas State Representative Garnet Coleman (D-Houston) talks to us about what the regulations mean for the navigator programs in Texas.

We also talk with Jose Ibarra from Enroll America of Texas to talk about the questions they are getting from people, and the resources that exist for them.
