The organization billing itself as largest member-based group for registered nurses in the United States threw its support behind Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination on Tuesday.

"Hillary Clinton has been a nurse champion and health care advocate throughout her career and believes empowering nurses is good for patients and good for the country," Pamela F. Cipriano, president of the American Nurses Association, said in a statement. "We need a president that will make it a priority to transform the country's health care system into one that is high quality, affordable and accessible."

Clinton welcomed the endorsement from the Silver Spring, Maryland-based organization by touting her own health care plan.

“As President, I will always stand with America’s nurses in the fight to finally achieve universal, affordable health care and fight against any efforts to roll back the protections and coverage of the Affordable Care Act," Clinton said in a statement released through the campaign. "I will always stand with American workers to protect their rights and safety on the job. And I will fight to ensure that patients get the very best care, including by addressing the looming nursing shortage, investing substantially in tackling America’s substance use disorder crisis, and finally taking mental health as seriously as we do physical health.”

Last August, Bernie Sanders earned the endorsement of National Nurses United, a labor union with 185,000 members.
