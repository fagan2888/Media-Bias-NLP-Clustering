Broncos reserve free safety Shiloh Keo was arrested for driving under the influence in Idaho early Saturday.

“We are aware of the matter involving Shiloh Keo and are in the process of reviewing it,” said Patrick Smyth, the Broncos’ vice president of public relations.

Keo, 28, was booked into the Ada County jail at 2:19 a.m. Saturday by the Idaho State Police. Keo recently tweeted he was heading from Denver to his offseason home in Idaho.

KBOI first reported news of his arrest.

Keo gained notoriety when the Broncos signed him late in the season after he reached out to defensive coordinator Wade Phillips on Twitter. Phillips coached Keo with the Houston Texans and needed depth following injuries to safeties Darian Stewart and T.J. Ward.

Keo played in four regular-season games with one interception. His biggest moment came in the AFC championship game when he recovered the New England Patriots’ onside kick to preserve the Broncos’ 20-18 victory. He finished with two tackles in the postseason, and served as a backup punt returner.

Keo could face a possible suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.
