How about a Happy Meal with that sermon?

A McDonald’s campaign group banking on churchgoers wanting a side of fries with their Word has kicked off a campaign to construct a restaurant inside a place of worship.

The “McMass” group says it’s a win-win for the company and for those of the faith. Its logic: More would attend church if only there was a chance to get a Big Mac during service, the Daily Mail reported.

Paul Di Lucca, a creative director at the church branding agency, Lux Dei design and a leading voice for “McMass,” said it’s high time for Christianity to “capture modern audiences,” the Daily Mail reported. He’s put out a page on the IndieGoGo fundraising site to raise $1 million to build a McDonald’s church, the newspaper said.

So far, interest is minimal. The project’s only received about $104, the Daily Mail reported.

Mr. Di Lucca, who concedes that some might see the campaign as an “insane idea,” said he’s trying to raise money, too, by selling memorabilia, including T-shirts emblazoned with the hashtag #Feast4Jesus, the Daily Mail reported.
