That futuristic tool uses an augmented reality system to project full-color holographic images of troops, targets, vehicles or hazards to soldiers on the battlefield who might not be able to see them.\n\nWithin the next several months, Insight is expected to be incorporated into the ground systems of the military services, changing the way officials prepare for battle.\n\nFor intelligence analysts, the technology is a big step toward resolving data collection issues that clog the information pipeline, Mr. Cutler said. It relies on a newly formed algorithm that rocked the mathematics world only a few years ago for its ability to create an integrated picture from disparate sources.\n\nSince its inception in 2011, the technological tool has been developing at a quick pace and has attracted the interest of all the armed services, Mr. Cutler said.\n\nDARPA began developing Insight after operations in Afghanistan unveiled a need for the military to understand and identify threat networks, such as dangerous insurgents or militants in possession of ballistic missiles, Mr. Cutler said. Two years later, DARPA scientists conducted a field test of the technology with the Army. Those scientists will work with Air Force officials in July, he said.\n\n\u201cWe built the program in a way that we can apply it to a variety of military problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t know today what the challenge is going to be tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDARPA scientists have had to be careful with sharing the technology tool due to concern that it had not been fine tuned to fit the exact needs of the military, Mr. Cutler said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things you don\u2019t want to do is say, \u2018Here is a bunch of discs. This kind of works. Maybe you can play with it. It\u2019s kind of great.\u2019 That\u2019s not a great use of taxpayer money,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pentagon officials monitoring combat zones and sensitive hot spots like Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya will soon have access to a breakthrough technology that will enable them to quickly decide how to react to an unexpected uprising or a dangerous embassy breach.", "Author": "Maggie Ybarra", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Pentagon officials monitoring combat zones and sensitive hot spots like Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya will soon have access to a breakthrough technology that will enable them to quickly decide how to react to an unexpected uprising or a dangerous embassy breach.", "title": "Pentagon to use drones to speed response times", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/25/pentagon-to-use-drones-to-speed-response-times/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2010/10/22/PENTAGON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2010/10/22/PENTAGON.jpg", "title": "Pentagon to use drones to speed response times", "description": "Pentagon officials monitoring combat zones and sensitive hot spots like Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya will soon have access to a breakthrough technology that will enable them to quickly decide how to re", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, War Conflict, Ben Cutler, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Pentagon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0578\"", "article_summary": "For intelligence analysts, the technology is a big step toward resolving data collection issues that clog the information pipeline, Mr. Cutler said.\nInsight was one of more than 100 new technologies demonstrated by DARPA \u2014 the Pentagon\u2019s cutting-edge, high-tech development office \u2014 for military officials, contractors and reporters in the courtyard of the Pentagon last week.\nSince its inception in 2011, the technological tool has been developing at a quick pace and has attracted the interest of all the armed services, Mr. Cutler said.\n\u201cWe built the program in a way that we can apply it to a variety of military problems,\u201d he said.\nThe Army will be able to use Insight by the end of the year and the Air Force will have access to the technology beginning next year, Mr. Cutler said."}
