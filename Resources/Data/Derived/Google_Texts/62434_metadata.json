Truth be told, it was one of the few times a Browns QB actually found his intended target.\n\n\u201cIt does not sit well,\u201d Cleveland coach Mike Pettine said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, because what we talk about is being poised and being focused. \u2026 That\u2019s a big part of all football players, especially the quarterback.\u201d\n\nManziel called the moment a \u201clapse of judgment\u201d and suggested it was brought about by another game of unprintable verbal grief from another team\u2019s players and fans. He was openly mocked by Brian Orakpo in the first quarter when the Redskins linebacker raised both hands and performed the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner\u2019s \u201cmoney\u201d gesture after a sack by Ryan Kerrigan.\n\n\u201cI get words exchanged throughout the entirety of the game, every game, week after week, and I should\u2019ve been smarter,\u201d Manziel said. \u201cIt was a \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 game, and cameras were probably solid on me, and I just need to be smarter about that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s there, and it\u2019s present every game, and I just need to let it slide off my back and go to the next play.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Pettine needs to pick a starting quarterback. The performances were so unspectacular that the coach suggested he might audible from his previously stated plan of announcing his regular-season starter on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAll the options are still on the table,\u201d Pettine said.\n\nHoyer started Monday night and completed 2 of 6 passes for 16 yards. His self-assessment: \u201cIt probably couldn\u2019t have been any worse. It\u2019s disappointing. It was embarrassing.\u201d\n\nManziel, the No. 22 pick in the NFL draft, was 7 for 16 for 65 yards and a touchdown. Of his series early in the game, he said: \u201cI really tried to force everything and not let it fly like I should have. I need to get better at that and throw the dang ball.\u201d\n\nThose stats, as mediocre as they are, were padded by series against the Redskins\u2019 backups. In the first quarter \u2014 when Washington\u2019s starters were in the game \u2014 Manziel was 2 for 7 for 29 yards, and Hoyer was 0 for 2.\n\n\u201cThey both missed some throws,\u201d Pettine said.\n\nIf there\u2019s any hint as to which way Pettine is leaning, it\u2019s worth noting that Hoyer started for the second consecutive game and played mostly with the first-team offense. Manziel was sent out with the reserves to play in the second half.\n\nManziel took advantage by leading a 16-play, 68-yard drive capped by an 8-yard pass to Dion Lewis for Cleveland\u2019s first touchdown.\n\nBut the six points were overshadowed by the one finger.\n\n\u201cA lot of people just scream out things that are very, very disrespectful,\u201d Browns cornerback Joe Haden said. \u201cHe\u2019s just got to zone it out.\u201d\n\nFollow Joseph White on Twitter twitter.com/JGWhiteAP", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Johnny Manziel\u2019s gesture taints Browns\u2019 loss to Washington", "title": "Johnny Manziel\u2019s gesture taints Browns\u2019 loss to Washington", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/19/johnny-manziels-gesture-taints-browns-loss-to-washington/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819_103954_johnny-manziel.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819_103954_johnny-manziel.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T10:34:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:59:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd142\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 If the Cleveland Browns pick a quarterback based solely on numbers, there\u2019s not much either Johnny Manziel or Brian Hoyer did to show he deserves the job.\nTruth be told, it was one of the few times a Browns QB actually found his intended target.\n\u201cI get words exchanged throughout the entirety of the game, every game, week after week, and I should\u2019ve been smarter,\u201d Manziel said.\nIf the choice is based on maturity, the hot-shot rookie\u2019s obscene gesture lost him some ground to the nondescript sixth-year veteran.\nIn the first quarter \u2014 when Washington\u2019s starters were in the game \u2014 Manziel was 2 for 7 for 29 yards, and Hoyer was 0 for 2."}
