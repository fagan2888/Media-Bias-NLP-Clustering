Because of the sale, ActiveCare discontinued operations of that segment.\n\nThe company also indicated in its latest quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 12 that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, or without the threat of liquidation. Positive cash flows from operating activities would mitigate the situation, but ActiveCare still needs to raise money to meet its projected capital investment needs.\n\nManagement's current plan includes offering debt or equity securities and increasing sales of ActiveCare's products.\n\nIn 2014, ActiveCare brought in about $3.58 million through securities offerings. If it isn't able to raise more cash, SEC filings indicate that product development would cease and ActiveCare may go out of business.\n\nSo far, however, the company has been able to increase revenue. The nine months ended June 30, revenue was about $5.4 million compared with $4.95 million for the same period in 2013.\n\nFor the previous edition of Turnaround Tuesday, see Struggling Drug Developer Immune Pharma Looks to Sell, License Products.\n\nFor more troubled companies, see Mergers & Acquisitions Distressed Company Watch List.\n\nGenerally, health care technology companies have been attractive M&A targets.
