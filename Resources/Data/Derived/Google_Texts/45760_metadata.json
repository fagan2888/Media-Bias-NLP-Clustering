So much coming out of academia lately has been utter nonsense so it is important to point out when wisdom is proclaimed as well. Money quote:\n\nGranted, he\u2019s not talking about orthodox Christianity per se, he actually is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but he is absolutely right about the importance of religion in a functioning democracy.\n\nI\u2019d go further to say if you take away the Gospel you can\u2019t hire enough police, but the point is well made nonetheless. Religious freedom is paramount.\n\nThis video is worth the 90 seconds it takes to watch it.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/01/harvard-prof-take-away-religion-cant-hire-enough-police/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/clay-christianson.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-01-19T19:33:55+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "clayton christiansen, democracy, religious freedom, cultural issues", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Video: Harvard Business School Professor Clay Christiansen discusses the importance of religion in a functioning Democracy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Video: Harvard Business School Professor Clay Christiansen discusses the importance of religion in a functioning Democracy.", "title": "Harvard Prof: If You Take Away Religion You Can't Hire Enough Police | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/clay-christianson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-19T13:42:36-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/01/harvard-prof-take-away-religion-cant-hire-enough-police/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Video: Harvard Business School Professor Clay Christiansen discusses the importance of religion in a functioning Democracy.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/clay-christianson.jpg", "title": "Harvard Prof: If You Take Away Religion You Can't Hire Enough Police | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-01-19T13:33:55-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Cultural Issues", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T13:42:36-05:00", "tag": "religious freedom"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf45\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019d go further to say if you take away the Gospel you can\u2019t hire enough police, but the point is well made nonetheless.\nI just watched a video featuring Dr. Clayton Christensen, the Clark Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, that I wanted to share even though it is about 10 months old.\nThis video is worth the 90 seconds it takes to watch it.\nSo much coming out of academia lately has been utter nonsense so it is important to point out when wisdom is proclaimed as well.\nMoney quote:Granted, he\u2019s not talking about orthodox Christianity per se, he actually is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but he is absolutely right about the importance of religion in a functioning democracy."}
