It was another hit or miss week for SNL, with an amiable Edward Norton showcasing an assortment of impressions—from Owen Wilson to Woody Allen to "Rain Man"—in sketches of varied effectiveness. Alec Baldwin and Miley Cyrus joined Norton in the monologue (in which Cyrus announced an upcoming tour). Cyrus also appeared in a later, somewhat questionable Twelve Years a Slave parody, twerking in Civil War-era attire. Musical guest Janelle Monae performed "Dance Apocalyptic" and "Electric Lady."

Some highlights...
