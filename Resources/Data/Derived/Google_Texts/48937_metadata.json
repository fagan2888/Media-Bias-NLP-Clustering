Ted Cruz said today he plans to use \u201cany and all\u201d tools possible to stop the 81-year-old agency from coming back to life.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in front of the U.S. Capitol today, Cruz, R-Texas, raised the prospect of filibustering a highway funding bill that could be used as a vehicle for Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization.\n\n\u201cI am willing to use any and all procedural tools to stop this corporate welfare, this corruption from being propagated,\u201d Cruz said when asked if he would attempt to stop the advancement of the highway legislation if it included Ex-Im reauthorization.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who joined Cruz, agreed.\n\n\u201cI think those of us who oppose it will continue to use any and all procedural tools at our disposal in order to oppose it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two senators were joined by Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as well as leaders of the Club for Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, Heritage Action for America and Tea Party Patriots.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expired June 30, and conservatives in the House and Senate are working to ensure the bank is not reauthorized. However, Senate Democrats are working to attach an amendment reauthorizing Ex-Im to the highway funding bill.\n\nThe Highway Trust Fund expires July 31, and Congress is looking at legislation extending the highway funding bill\u2014which has been dubbed a piece of \u201cmust-piece legislation\u201d\u2014for another five months.\n\n>>> How Democrats Hope to Revive the Export-Import Bank\n\nIn an effort to act before the upper chamber, the House passed a five-month patch for the Highway Trust Fund without Ex-Im reauthorization today.\n\nLast month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a vote on Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization in exchange for their support on Trade Promotion Authority, which ultimately passed Congress.\n\nCantwell and Graham represent two states where Boeing has a strong presence. The aircraft manufacturer is Ex-Im\u2019s biggest beneficiary, and bank opponents have dubbed Ex-Im the \u201cBank of Boeing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking alongside Cruz, Lee and other Ex-Im opponents, Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, criticized McConnell for publicly opposing Ex-Im, but furthering efforts to bring it back to life.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell should stop pretending to oppose the Ex-Im Bank. Nobody\u2019s buying it, and it\u2019s completely dishonest. If McConnell truly opposed the Ex-Im Bank, he would block every amendment to reauthorize it,\u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cHe\u2019s blocked conservative amendments through this entire year during his tenure as majority leader. Why not block liberal amendments?\u201d\n\nCruz, also speaking to McConnell\u2019s leadership, called on the Senate\u2019s top Republican to match his actions with his words.\n\n\u201cWe are here gathered today to celebrate a conservative victory. It\u2019s interesting, with a Republican majority, we haven\u2019t had a lot of conservative victories. This is one. We\u2019re here today to praise Mitch McConnell and [House Speaker] John Boehner,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey have the opportunity to deliver on their campaign rhetoric, and I am hopeful that actions will follow words. And every person here will gladly celebrate strong Republican leadership if we, in fact, have strong Republican leadership.\u201d\n\nThough Ex-Im\u2019s charter expired just over two weeks ago, the bank continues to oversee its existing financing. However, it no longer has the authority to extend new financing to customers.\n\nThe bank provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nConservatives, including Cruz and Lee, argue the bank furthers corporate welfare and cronyism. However, Democrats and moderate Republicans have united in support of Ex-Im, which they say helps small businesses compete in the global market and supports U.S. jobs.\n\n>>> 10 Tweets Reacting to Ex-Im Bank\u2019s Expiration", "article_metadata": {"description": "With talk of Ex-Im's reauthorization continuing, Ted Cruz said today he plans to use \u201cany and all\u201d tools possible to stop the agency from returning to life.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With talk of Ex-Im's reauthorization continuing, Ted Cruz said today he plans to use \u201cany and all\u201d tools possible to stop the agency from returning to life.", "title": "Cruz Willing to Use Any Tools to Stop Ex-Im, Even the Filibuster", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150715_ExImFilibuster_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-15T16:59:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gCvsAW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With talk of Ex-Im's reauthorization continuing, Ted Cruz said today he plans to use \u201cany and all\u201d tools possible to stop the agency from returning to life.", "title": "Cruz Willing to Use Any Tools to Stop Ex-Im, Even the Filibuster", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150715_ExImFilibuster_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-07-15T16:31:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-15T16:59:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Jim Jordan, Bill Flores, Republican Study Committee, Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Ex-Im, Highway Trust Fund"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3ee\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMitch McConnell should stop pretending to oppose the Ex-Im Bank.\nIf McConnell truly opposed the Ex-Im Bank, he would block every amendment to reauthorize it,\u201d Cuccinelli said.\n\u201cI am willing to use any and all procedural tools to stop this corporate welfare, this corruption from being propagated,\u201d Cruz said when asked if he would attempt to stop the advancement of the highway legislation if it included Ex-Im reauthorization.\nSpeaking to reporters in front of the U.S. Capitol today, Cruz, R-Texas, raised the prospect of filibustering a highway funding bill that could be used as a vehicle for Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization.\nHowever, Senate Democrats are working to attach an amendment reauthorizing Ex-Im to the highway funding bill."}
