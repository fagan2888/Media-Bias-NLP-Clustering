The group has been reviewing Winchester operations for seven years.\n\nBasically, the vote allows the county to see what options are available on the open market. Winchester House perennially has run big deficits despite adjustments, such as the move in 2011 to an outside operator, and currently has a budget shortfall of more than $3 million.\n\n\"This is just a solid move forward,\" county board Chairman Aaron Lawlor said.\n\nDespite the numbers, it was not an easy choice because of the county's longtime involvement with Winchester House. It opened in 1847 as a poor farm, and has had a continuing mission to provide a place for those who can't afford nursing home care.\n\nSeveral board members said their final decision could be different.\n\n\"I need to trust the process and also the recommendation,\" said board member Bonnie Thomson Carter of Ingleside. \"I don't know what the outcome will be. I don't think any of us do. But this is a big step forward.\"\n\nAudrey Nixon of North Chicago, the only dissenter, said she had mixed emotions.\n\n\"I just can't,\" support the measure, she said.\n\nCarlson, who has been on the advisory group since it was formed, urged others to keep an open mind.\n\n\"I don't know how I'll respond to the (request for proposals). All this is a beginning.\" he said. \"Depending on what comes back, we'll have some decisions to make.\"\n\nIn 2011, the advisory group recommended an outside operator as a way to save money and continue to provide quality care. Health Dimensions Group of Minneapolis, which still manages the facility, was hired to run Winchester House.\n\nSignificant changes in the health care environment, including the Affordable Care Act, Illinois' move to a managed care system and emergence of other safety net options for those who need skilled nursing care, were part of the rationale for the most recent recommendation.\n\n\"We are going to carry on this very long term tradition this county has had of helping people in need,\" Calabresa said.\n\nRespondents will be given one month to reply. A review of responses could involve announced or unannounced visits to other facilities.\n\nOne of the four components of the request will be that the new facility serve current and future Winchester House residents.\n\nSome board members asked that employees and staff also be considered in the document, and a union representative said any new company should adhere to the collective bargaining agreement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lake County board has agreed to see what the market has to offer by seeking proposals to replace the Winchester House nursing home, which opened as a poor farm in 1847. \"I don't know what the outcome will be -- I don't think any of us do,\" said board member Bonnie Thomson Carter of Ingleside. \"But this is a big step forward.\"", "author": "Mick Zawislak", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "The Lake County board has agreed to see what the market has to offer by seeking proposals to replace the Winchester House nursing home, which opened as a poor farm in 1847. \"I don't know what the outcome will be -- I don't think any of us do,\" said board member Bonnie Thomson Carter of Ingleside. \"But this is a big step forward.\"", "title": "Lake County will seek proposals to replace Winchester House nursing home", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140708/news/140708803/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20140708/news/140708803/AR/0/AR-140708803.jpg&updated=201407081654&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Lake County board has agreed to see what the market has to offer by seeking proposals to replace the Winchester House nursing home, which opened as a poor farm in 1847. \"I don't know what the outcome will be -- I don't think any of us do,\" said board member Bonnie Thomson Carter of Ingleside. \"But this is a big step forward.\"", "title": "Lake County will seek proposals to replace Winchester House nursing home", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140708/news/140708803/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20140708/news/140708803/AR/0/AR-140708803.jpg&updated=201407081654&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "creator": "@dhMickZawislak", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Libertyville, Health & Fitness, Lake County", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2014-07-08", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T20:54:00Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mick.zawislak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lake County will seek proposals to replace Winchester House nursing homehelloWhile not a final decision regarding the future of Winchester House, the Lake County Board on Tuesday decided to test the market in a move that could mark the beginning of the end of the county's longtime involvement with the nursing home.\nOne of the four components of the request will be that the new facility serve current and future Winchester House residents.\nDespite the numbers, it was not an easy choice because of the county's longtime involvement with Winchester House.\n\"This is just a solid move forward,\" county board Chairman Aaron Lawlor said.\nWinchester House perennially has run big deficits despite adjustments, such as the move in 2011 to an outside operator, and currently has a budget shortfall of more than $3 million."}
