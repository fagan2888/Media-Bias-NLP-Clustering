The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, shall be citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has published a full series on birthright citizenship, which all turns on the meaning of the Constitution\u2019s phrase of being \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. Our first report explained how the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014which Congress drafted in 1866\u2014restated the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which explained that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d meant that the person was not a citizen of any foreign power and that the Supreme Court held in 1884 that courts should interpret the Fourteenth Amendment consistent with the Civil Rights Act.\n\nOur second report explained that the Citizenship Clause is a the constitutional minimum for citizenship, not its outermost limit, and that Article I of the Constitution allows Congress to be however generous it wishes in granting citizenship through its Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to foreigners who are not entitled to it by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOne of our subsequent reports discussed the scholarship of top constitutional professors who showed that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment explained during their congressional debates that the Citizenship Clause would not apply to citizens of foreign countries (such as illegal aliens), and the Supreme Court\u2019s first two authoritative cases on the meaning of these provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014from 1873 and 1884\u2014formally adopted this meaning as the correct interpretation of the Citizenship Clause.\n\nFinally, we reported on the 1898 case where the Court deviated from this original meaning said that the Citizenship Clause could reach foreign citizens, but limited its holding in that case to children born to permanent legal residents in this country, not illegal aliens.\n\nNapolitano\u2019s position has been completely rejected by the Supreme Court. The Court has always held that the federal government has plenary authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution to make immigration laws: laws that determine who can enter this nation, and for foreigners, how long they can stay, under what conditions, and whether they can someday become citizens.\n\nAfter Arizona v. United States, we reported how the Supreme Court in 2012 was divided on how immigration law works when the president does things without Congress, but that the Supreme Court reaffirmed a century of precedent that the Constitution vests all immigration powers in the federal government. There\u2019s simply no legal debate on that question at all.\n\nLikewise, Napolitano\u2019s right-to-travel argument is wrong, for three separate reasons. First, it is a right to interstate travel only, not international travel to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. That\u2019s why any American citizen can, for example, move freely from Indiana to Ohio without government permission. It does not\u2014and never has\u2014apply to entering or leaving this country.\n\nSecondly, it is a right to travel from one state to another and settle in that new state to live there permanently. That is what the case Napolitano cites\u2014the Supreme Court\u2019s 1969 case Shapiro v. Thompson\u2014was about: a person moving from Massachusetts to Connecticut to receive welfare benefits in her new state. If this right applied to illegal aliens, they would have the right not to just enter the United States, but also to permanently settle here and receive immediate welfare benefits.\n\nThird, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held\u2014as recently as its 1999 case Saenz v. Roe\u2014that the right to travel is a right of American citizens only; it applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause (which immediately follows the Citizenship Clause), a provision that applies to U.S. citizens only. Natural rights\u2014by contrast\u2014apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Foreigners have never had a constitutional right to free movement within this nation; only American citizens can do so.\n\nBy contrast, Judge Pirro was exactly correct when she explained that, in the Supreme Court\u2019s 1898 case, it abandoned the original meaning of the Citizenship Clause. U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark was a case where the Court\u2019s holding only applied to foreigners \u201cdomiciled\u201d in the United States\u2014a legal term meaning permanent lawful residents. The Court\u2019s statements quoted to support birthright citizenship for illegal aliens is what is called obiter dicta, which is not part of the Court\u2019s holding and thus is not binding precedent.\n\nPirro also noted that in 1923, Congress retroactively granted citizenship to American Indians, who, up to that point, had been denied citizenship ever since the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s ratification in 1868, thus proving that the Fourteenth Amendment never granted them citizenship. Pirro\u2019s only mistake is saying that it appears that Congress was ignoring the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThat\u2019s not entirely accurate. Instead, it shows that the Citizenship Clause is a floor, not a ceiling. As our previous report explained, the Fourteenth Amendment says that certain children born in this country must be granted citizenship, but it leaves Congress unfettered to grant citizenship to be more generous than that floor requires, and it can give citizenship to anyone else Congress wants. That\u2019s what the current INA does, and it\u2019s why Congress can narrow the INA back to its constitutional floor at any time to eliminate the issue of illegal aliens\u2019 anchor babies receiving birthright citizenship.\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
