Maybe Obama's strategy was to say he didn't have a strategy to distract attention away from the poor jobs report that came out last week, and the fact that adults are relying on fast-food industry jobs to support their families.\n\nOn Thursday fast-food workers held strikes in over 100 cities as part of the \"Fight for $15\" campaign. The effort seeks a $15 an hour wage and union representation for fast food workers and is backed by the Service Employee International Union, hoping to unionize workers in what has been a traditionally non-union industry.\n\nThe minimum wage hasn't been increased since 2009 and is currently $7.25 an hour. It's estimated that the average fast food worker makes less than $8 an hour, working out to about $16,000 a year. While those are poverty level wages, not the 'living wage' workers are demanding, the jobs were always intended to be entry level employment for teenagers still living off their parents living wages, not for grown adults trying to support kids ,pay for rent, a mortgage, or for seniors trying to pay for prescriptions.\n\nIt's estimated paying a $15 an hour wage would add $2 to $3 dollars to the price of an entry. Right now a breakfast sandwich and small drink at McDonalds will cost you around $7. How much demand will there be for a $10 breakfast meal that more than likely will look and taste like it was just thawed out and thrown in a microwave.\n\nWhat does it say about the state of this country's economy that fast-food jobs are no longer considered temporary entry level employment for teens, but main, long term employment for grown adults?\n\nThe real problem is not that fast food joints aren't paying a living wage, it's that this country now just makes burgers, chicken nuggets and tacos, when it used to have a thriving manufacturing base producing products that supported paying a real living wage.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "buger-king-merger, burger-king-canada, editorial-cartoon, fast-food-strikes, opinion", "title": "Fast Food Workers Strike: Editorial cartoon", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The real problem is that this country now just makes burgers, chicken nuggets and tacos, when it used to have a thriving manufacturing base.", "title": "Fast Food Workers Strike: Editorial cartoon", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2014/09/fast_food_strikes_editorial_ca.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/darcy/photo/15787948-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The real problem is that this country now just makes burgers, chicken nuggets and tacos, when it used to have a thriving manufacturing base.", "creator": "@Darcycartoon", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/darcy/photo/15787948-standard.jpg", "title": "Fast Food Workers Strike: Editorial cartoon", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 07, 2014, 12:08 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 07, 2014,  5:32 AM", "article_author": "Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com", "Description": "The real problem is that this country now just makes burgers, chicken nuggets and tacos, when it used to have a thriving manufacturing base."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac53\"", "article_summary": "On Thursday fast-food workers held strikes in over 100 cities as part of the \"Fight for $15\" campaign.\nThe effort seeks a $15 an hour wage and union representation for fast food workers and is backed by the Service Employee International Union, hoping to unionize workers in what has been a traditionally non-union industry.\nIt's estimated paying a $15 an hour wage would add $2 to $3 dollars to the price of an entry.\nIt's estimated that the average fast food worker makes less than $8 an hour, working out to about $16,000 a year.\nThe real problem is not that fast food joints aren't paying a living wage, it's that this country now just makes burgers, chicken nuggets and tacos, when it used to have a thriving manufacturing base producing products that supported paying a real living wage."}
