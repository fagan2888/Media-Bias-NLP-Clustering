It has played a role in several court cases over the years, but was made famous in 2014 when the Supreme Court used an usually broad interpretation of the law to grant craft store giant Hobby Lobby exemptions from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut on Thursday morning, several organizations sent a letter to the president challenging the \u201cOLC memo,\u201d a legal opinion written near the end of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency which contends that faith-based groups benefitting from federal grants should not be subject to religious nondiscrimination laws when taking on new employees. The letter charged that this gives these institutions too much power, allowing taxpayer-supported religious groups to openly discriminate against women, LGBT people, and other minority groups in hiring.\n\nRFRA was not intended to create blanket exemptions to laws that protect against discrimination.\n\n\u201cRFRA was intended to provide protection for free exercise rights, applying strict scrutiny, on a case-by-case basis, to federal laws that substantially burden religious exercise,\u201d the letter read. \u201cRFRA was not intended to create blanket exemptions to laws that protect against discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe letter lists recent examples of groups using the memo\u2019s broad interpretation to exclude others, including faith-based organizations that receive money from the Violence Against Women Act but still list religion as a criterion when hiring employees. Some groups have also used the memo to argue for exemptions from the president\u2019s 2014 executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT workers, and still others have tried to use it to extend RFRA beyond the work place: Just this year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Association of Evangelicals cited the OLC Memo while attempting to avoid offering emergency contraception to raped migrant children flooding across America\u2019s southern border.\n\n\u201cThe memo\u2019s erroneous findings are currently being used to justify taxpayer-funded discrimination,\u201d a representative from the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the signers of the letter, said in an emailed statement.\n\nSigners of the letter included many secular and women\u2019s health advocacy groups, such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America, American Atheists, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. But the list also mentioned civil rights organizations such as Human Rights Campaign and the NAACP, as well as a number of religious groups such as the Union for Reform Judaism, Unitarian Universalist Association, Sikh Coalition, United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries, and United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society.\n\nThe letter highlighted its faith-based supporters, noting that some of the groups mentioned were also members of the Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion, the group that pushed for the creation of RFRA in the early 1990s. They posit that the current use of RFRA contradicts its original purpose, and ultimately flies in the face of historical understandings of religious liberty in the United States.\n\n\u201cContrary to the conclusion in the OLC Memo, RFRA is not a tool to categorically override statutory protections against religious hiring discrimination,\u201d the letter read. \u201cNor does it create an absolute free exercise [of religion] right \u2014 without regard to countervailing compelling interests, as required by RFRA \u2014 to receive government grants without complying with applicable regulations that protect taxpayers and participants in federally funded programs.\u201d\n\nSimilar letters were sent to Obama administration officials in 2009, 2013, and 2014, but Thursday\u2019s missive appears to be the most robust effort yet.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cRFRA was not intended to create blanket exemptions to laws that protect against discrimination.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cRFRA was not intended to create blanket exemptions to laws that protect against discrimination.\u201d", "title": "130 Religious, Secular Groups Demand Obama Stop Using \u2018Religious Liberty\u2019 To Justify Discrimination", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/08/20/3693590/rfra-exemption-memo-letter/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20133006/AP185190995507.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cRFRA was not intended to create blanket exemptions to laws that protect against discrimination.\u201d", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20133006/AP185190995507-321x214.jpg", "title": "130 Religious, Secular Groups Demand Obama Stop Using \u2018Religious Liberty\u2019 To Justify Discrimination", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20133006/AP185190995507.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20133006/AP185190995507.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-20T14:01:02+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "RFRA, passed by Congress in 1993, is a law meant to protect religious minorities who might otherwise have their right to religious freedom infringed upon.\nThe letter charged that this gives these institutions too much power, allowing taxpayer-supported religious groups to openly discriminate against women, LGBT people, and other minority groups in hiring.\n\u201cContrary to the conclusion in the OLC Memo, RFRA is not a tool to categorically override statutory protections against religious hiring discrimination,\u201d the letter read.\nRFRA was not intended to create blanket exemptions to laws that protect against discrimination.\nThey posit that the current use of RFRA contradicts its original purpose, and ultimately flies in the face of historical understandings of religious liberty in the United States."}
