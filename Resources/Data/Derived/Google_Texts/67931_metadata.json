Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) said that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is \u201cdefinitely\u201d looking at the possibility of impeaching IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely looking at that,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cDefinitely looking at that. I\u2019ll say this, Mr. Koskinen has on more than one occasion come in front of the committee and conveyed information to the committee that later turned out not to be accurate.\u201d\n\nOn June 25, 2015, the committee held a hearing on the 2013 IRS scandal and found that despite a subpoena and a preservation order, the IRS, under Koskinen\u2019s control, had destroyed or degaussed 422 tapes that might have contained emails from Lois Lerner, the former official at the center of the controversy. Around this time, a National Review article revealed that Republican leaders were considering possibilities to impeach Koskinen.\n\nJordan said that impeachment is a possibility for the IRS commissioner.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an individual who\u2019s head of an agency with this kind of power the Internal Revenue Service has, who has stated things under oath that turned out later to be false, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cCouple that with the false information that was sent out to a lot of Obamacare enrollees that impacted their tax liability that was just false, and some of the data breaches that have taken place there too\u2014so the main focus is, of course, the targeting scandal and his answers to questions in front of the committee under oath that I\u2019ve said later turned out to be untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s also these other things, so that\u2019s something that the committee is looking at but there\u2019s a certain amount of homework you\u2019ve got to do before you start down that path,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking at it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Jordan introduced H. Res. 565 on May 2, 2014 that called on then-Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS.\n\nJordan confirmed that he will continue to push Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the same issue.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at again,\u201d said Jordan. He mentioned that Lynch would be in front of the Judiciary committee sometime in September and that he plans to ask her about that issue then.\n\nJordan also expressed skepticism about the Justice Department\u2019s handling of the IRS controversy.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows the fix is in at the Justice Department,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cThe FBI announced a year and a half ago, according to the Wall Street Journal, that no one was going to be prosecuted. The President made his famous statement on Super Bowl Sunday a year and a half ago that there\u2019s no corruption, not even a smidgen, and the lead attorney on the case is Barbara Bosserman who\u2019s a maxed-out contributor to the President\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo everyone knows the fix is in, and what really tells you that the fix is in with the Justice Department investigation is Lois Lerner was willing to sit down with Justice Department attorneys, Ms. Bosserman and her team, and answer their questions but she\u2019s not willing to answer members of Congress\u2019 questions,\u201d said Jordan.\n\n\u201cNow remember I can\u2019t put her in jail, the Justice Department can put her in jail,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing a congressional investigation; we\u2019re just trying to get the facts for the American people. So she\u2019s willing to talk to the people who could put her in jail but not willing to talk to people who can\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the reason she won\u2019t talk to people who can\u2019t put her in jail is because she knows she\u2019s not going to jail because the President\u2019s already announced there\u2019s no corruption and the FBI\u2019s already leaked to the Wall Street Journal no one\u2019s going to be prosecuted,\u201d Jordan continued. \u201cThe fix is in, so of course we need a special counsel.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
