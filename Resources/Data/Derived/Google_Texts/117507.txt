New poll finds that a majority of Americans see Obamacare website problems as a sign of problems to come with law

The American people aren’t buying into the president’s message that the problems with the healthcare exchange websites aren’t indicative of larger issues with the law, according to an ABC News – Washington Post study released Monday.

The study found that 56 percent of Americans believe the website problems are related to bigger ones with the law, while 40 percent view the website problems as an isolated incident. Among that 56 percent is 55 percent of independents and more than 8 in 10 Republicans.

A majority of Americans – 53 percent – also disapprove of how President Barack Obama is handling the law’s implementation overall. Moreover, just 46 percent of Americans support the law and its changes, with most of them believing the law goes too far.

President Obama delivered a speech from the White House Rose Garden Monday morning to quash complaints about the website’s problems.

“Nobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn’t working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” Obama said. “In the meantime, you can bypass the website.”

(No one probably told him, however, that the toll-free number set up for the program redirects Americans back to the Healthcare.gov website …)

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also attempted to do damage control Monday, attributing the site’s problems to the overwhelming number of visits the site has received over the past three weeks.

“No, in fact, I think it’s absolutely accurate to say that the volume far exceeded our expectations and that the volume has driven the problems that we’ve seen and exposed some of the problems that we now know about,” Carney said.

The Washington Post/ABC News poll commissioned a telephone study of 1,002 adults nationwide from October 17-20, 2013. The margin of error for the study is +/- 3.5 percentage points at a 95 percent level of confidence.
