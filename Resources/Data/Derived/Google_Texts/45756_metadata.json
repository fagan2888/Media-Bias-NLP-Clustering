Several squad cars descended on the area of Franklin Way and Franklin Street, south of Arapahoe Road, in Littleton.\n\nAs deputies crept into the backyard of one home they saw the large adult bear in a tree. It quickly scrambled down the tree and disappeared into thick brush, Brooks said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to go walking through that thick brush,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nNot out of fear, she said emphatically.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of bears,\u201d she said.\n\nThere have been so many bear sightings this summer, in populated areas up and down the Front Range, that it\u2019s possible different bears are tag-teaming Arapahoe deputies.\n\nBut it\u2019s also very possible that the same cunning black bear is leading wildlife officials in circles. Deputies called rangers from Colorado Parks and Wildlife to help in the chase Friday morning.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Centennial: Wily bear safely tranquilized", "title": "Centennial: Wily bear safely tranquilized", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/04/centennial-wily-bear-safely-tranquilized/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150904__centennial-bear-tranquillizedp1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150904__centennial-bear-tranquillizedp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T08:08:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:41:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animals"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf43\"", "article_summary": "In a Centennial residential neighborhood, wildlife officials safely tranquilized a bear Friday that may have been the bane of Arapahoe County sheriff\u2019s deputies and rangers the past three days, according to officials.\nThere have been so many bear sightings this summer, in populated areas up and down the Front Range, that it\u2019s possible different bears are tag-teaming Arapahoe deputies.\nAs deputies crept into the backyard of one home they saw the large adult bear in a tree.\nBut it\u2019s also very possible that the same cunning black bear is leading wildlife officials in circles.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very elusive,\u201d said Julie Brooks, spokeswoman for the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office."}
