The MNsure board of directors will retain its authority, including choice of MNsure\u2019s top executive.\n\nThe final bill includes $500,000 for a task force to examine the future of MNsure, MinnesotaCare and the chance for federal waivers that could allow for a broad range of health care reforms.\n\nAlready passed by the Senate and House, the bill had not been signed Monday afternoon by Gov. Mark Dayton. In March, Dayton called for creating the health care task force.\n\n\u201cOften when you hear a task force or a commission, it means \u2018bury the issue,\u2019 \u201d said Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBut I think this is actually a \u2018we-mean-business\u2019 sort of task force.\u201d\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange in 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act. The government-run marketplace suffered from a balky website and overwhelmed call center during its first year, and enrollment figures have continued to fall short of projections.\n\nThe track record prompted calls for change from both DFLers and the GOP, although the nature of reform proposals were very different.\n\nDebate now moves to a 29-person task force that\u2019s required to provide a report to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 2016. Task force members will be appointed by the Senate, the House and Dayton and include representatives from MNsure and the departments of commerce, health and human services.\n\nIt will look at not just MNsure, but broader questions about funding the state\u2019s public health insurance programs. A top priority is the question of whether to combine MNsure and MinnesotaCare, Jacobs said.\n\nMinnesotaCare covers people with incomes slightly above the poverty level \u2014 a group that\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cworking poor.\u201d It\u2019s a group that\u2019s one of the prime beneficiaries of health insurance exchanges in other states, where people tap tax credits to discount the cost of private insurance.\n\nOne reason state lawmakers have maintained MinnesotaCare is the program\u2019s benefit level for enrollees, which is richer than what\u2019s provided by most private policies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be looking at changing the generosity of the package for people in [MinnesotaCare],\u201d Jacobs said of the task force. Moving program enrollees into the exchange \u201cwould make the MNsure private individual market viable,\u201d he said.\n\nBut any such change would be a fight. On Monday, the group TakeAction Minnesota \u2014 which is aligned with DFLers on many health care issues \u2014 was critical of changes in the current budget bill that ask MinnesotaCare enrollees to pay a greater share of current program costs. The changes save the state budget about $65 million over two years but include higher premiums for some in the program.\n\n\u201cTakeAction Minnesota will remain vigilant to any and all future efforts to jeopardize or dismantle this centerpiece of our state\u2019s health care infrastructure,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nBeyond the task force, the final human services bill includes a House Republican proposal to let individuals obtain federal tax credits when buying coverage outside of MNsure. Currently, subsidies are limited to those who buy on the exchange.\n\nTo make the change, Minnesota would need a waiver from the federal government. Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, questioned whether the Obama administration would grant such a waiver, which could reduce the number of people who buy through MNsure.\n\nRep. Matt Dean, R-Dellwood, said people buying outside of MNsure should have a shot at tax credits considering all the exchange\u2019s troubles. The troubled track record also explains a provision in the final bill, Dean said, that would let consumers appeal MNsure decisions about eligibility for public health insurance to district courts.\n\nThe state relies on the MNsure system to determine if people qualify for federal tax credits or the state\u2019s MinnesotaCare and Medicaid public health insurance programs. Medicaid covers residents with income near or below the poverty line.\n\nAs part of a highly critical report released in February, Legislative Auditor James Nobles recommended that the governor have the power to name MNsure\u2019s top executive \u2014 not the MNsure board. The provision was included in health spending bills from Republicans and DFLers prior into final negotiations but somehow didn\u2019t make it into the final legislation.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t lawmakers adopt more sweeping changes?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very controversial program,\u201d Dean said. \u201cI think there\u2019s disagreement about what it would take to get it corrected for folks.\u201d\n\nRepublicans argue MinnesotaCare is unsustainable, particularly with a tax collected by health care providers that\u2019s scheduled to disappear in 2019. The tax has been a key source of funding for the program.\n\nDFLers argue that MinnesotaCare has worked well for more than 20 years and should continue. Shifting enrollees to private policies on MNsure could subject them to unaffordable health care bills, supporters of the program say.\n\n\u201cMinnesotaCare is still an important piece of the health care future for Minnesota,\u201d Lourey said.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A new task force will take up some of the biggest potential changes to the state&rsquo;s MNsure exchange after lawmakers this weekend couldn&rsquo;t reach agreement on several competing proposals.", "title": "New task force takes up potential MNsure changes", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-proposals-move-to-task-force/304191891/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A new task force will take up some of the biggest potential changes to the state&rsquo;s MNsure exchange after lawmakers this weekend couldn&rsquo;t reach agreement on several competing proposals.", "title": "New task force takes up potential MNsure changes", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-proposals-move-to-task-force/304191891/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new task force will take up some of the biggest potential changes to the state&rsquo;s MNsure exchange after lawmakers this weekend couldn&rsquo;t reach agreement on several competing proposals."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe85\"", "article_summary": "A new task force will take up some of the biggest potential changes to the state\u2019s MNsure exchange after lawmakers this weekend couldn\u2019t reach agreement on several competing proposals.\nIn March, Dayton called for creating the health care task force.\nDebate now moves to a 29-person task force that\u2019s required to provide a report to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 2016.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be looking at changing the generosity of the package for people in [MinnesotaCare],\u201d Jacobs said of the task force.\nShifting enrollees to private policies on MNsure could subject them to unaffordable health care bills, supporters of the program say."}
