They also have to worry about their child becoming ill, and often keep an eye out for any signs that something is coming on. But many of them tend to worry too much, blowing small signs like a cough or two out of proportion, and contacting a doctor just to be cautious. It turns out agave nectar is good for treating infants\u2019 coughs, but not how you may think.\n\nResearchers from Penn State College of Medicine found in a new study that the sweet syrup, extracted from the agave plant, works well when a child has a cough. But it\u2019s not actually the cough that\u2019s being treated. Rather, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s fears. During their study, a placebo and agave nectar were both used to treat acute coughs, but while they were equally bad at putting an end to the cough, parents perceived them as effective \u2014 a placebo effect.\n\n\u201cBoth physicians and parents want symptomatic relief for children with these common and annoying illnesses,\u201d the researchers wrote, according to a press release. \u201cThe significant placebo effect found warrants consideration as health care providers and parents determine how best to manage the disruptive symptoms that occur in the setting of upper respiratory tract infections among young children.\u201d\n\nMore children under 4 visit a family doctor for acute coughs than any other illness, according to a systematic review published in the British Medical Journal. There\u2019s a good reason for this; it\u2019s hard to determine the cause of a cough. It could be anything from the common cold to pneumonia, or an upper respiratory tract infection to whooping cough \u2014 a deadly bacterial infection. But although it\u2019s more often than not anything serious, many parents still want medicine. Yet, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stresses that children shouldn\u2019t get antibiotics because even if they ease symptoms, they could be detrimental to health over time.\n\nThe researchers set out to trick parents over just one night, treating 119 children aged 2 to 47 months suffering from a nighttime cough with either agave nectar, grape-flavored water, or nothing at all. Though they didn\u2019t really do much, the children\u2019s parents believed that they were effective in reducing coughs. Sometimes, that\u2019s all that really matters.\n\nSource: Paul I, Beiler J, Vallanti J, Duda L, King T.
