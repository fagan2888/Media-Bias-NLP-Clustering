As the House’s select committee on Benghazi prepares to start its work, the challenges it faces—and the questions it must answer—are numerous.

Critics of the committee argue all questions on Benghazi have already been answered and the matter should be put to rest. Speaking to Fox News yesterday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton persisted that the Obama administration has made every relevant document available to Congress.

The fact is that the administration has dragged its feet. It took 19 months for emails from the White House to be turned over to Congress. The administration has also discouraged eyewitnesses to the Benghazi attack from giving testimony to congressional investigators.

Five congressional committees have dug into the scandal, unearthing a number of relevant facts. Yet, members of Congress working with a five-minute limit on their question time have often failed to ask the necessary follow-up questions.

Some of the questions that deserve answers are listed below. What Americans want most is the truth about what happened in Benghazi on that fateful night of Sept. 11, 2012, and in Washington in the days that followed.
