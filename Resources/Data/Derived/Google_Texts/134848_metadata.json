I knew it was coming. When government expands entitlements, illegal immigrants always end up with a piece of the pie. Obamacare promoters relented to GOP pressure to include an illegal immigrant ban on eligibility and vowed endlessly that no benefits would go to the \u201cundocumented.\u201d But denial isn\u2019t just a river in Egypt. It\u2019s the Obama way.\n\nIn Oregon this week, officials confessed that nearly 4,000 illegal immigrants had been \u201caccidentally\u201d steered from the state\u2019s low-income Medicaid program and instead were enrolled in Obamacare in violation of the law. Oopsie. The Oregonian newspaper\u2019s Nick Budnick reported that the health bureaucrats \u201cdiscovered the problem several weeks ago and are correcting it.\u201d\n\nTake note: This wasn\u2019t a one-time computer meltdown. Because Oregon\u2019s health insurance exchange website has been offline and its software architects under investigation for possible fraud, the Oregon Obamacare drones have been processing each and every application manually. That means nearly 4,000 illegal immigrant applications with \u201cinaccurate\u201d data somehow passed through government hands and somehow ended up getting routed through as new enrollees with Obamacare-approved full-service health care.\n\nHow many Obamacare services did these nearly 4,000 illegal immigrants avail themselves of, and at what cost?\n\nDoes anyone believe the same incompetent boobs who enrolled them will be able to track down the nearly 4,000 illegal immigrant beneficiaries, \u201ccorrect\u201d the \u201cerrors\u201d and ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again?\n\nWhat a slap in the face to the millions of law-abiding Americans who have lost their health care coverage and work hours thanks to Democratic-sponsored federal health care regulatory burdens and mandate costs.\n\nOne Oregon Obamacare manager defended the unlawful illegal immigrant enrollment by explaining: \u201cWe were just getting people into the services.\u201d And there\u2019s the rub. The imperative of these government social engineers is to herd as many \u201cclients\u201d into taxpayer-subsidized programs as possible. Just last week, Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson publicized an open letter to families with illegal alien relatives promising that no one would be deported for seeking Obamacare services.\n\nCalifornia Democrats are at the forefront of busting open Obamacare for the illegal immigrant population. This month, Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara introduced a bill to extend health benefits and a special online marketplace to 1 million illegal immigrants under an Obamacare-style program subsidized by state taxpayers.\n\nIn case you forgot, President Obama had already paved the path for illegal immigrant Obamacare when he signed the massive expansion of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) in 2009. As I\u2019ve reported previously, the law loosened eligibility requirements for legal immigrants and their children by watering down document and evidentiary standards \u2014 making it easy for individuals to use fake Social Security cards to apply for benefits with little to no chance of getting caught. In addition, Obama\u2019s S-CHIP expansion revoked Medicaid application time limits that were part of the 1996 welfare reform law.\n\nOpen-borders activists saw those provisions as first steps toward universal health coverage for illegals. They see America as the medical welcome mat to the world. In the past year, they\u2019ve ratcheted public protests demanding free organ transplants for illegal alien patients. In Chicago last fall, they marched on a hospital with caskets and posters demanding scarce organs. One illegal immigrant blasted authorities for putting \u201cpaper over our lives.\u201d In California, illegal immigrant transplant patients count on federal incompetence and lax enforcement to abet them, because if they notify the state that DHS \u201cis aware of their presence and does not plan to deport them,\u201d they are eligible for full-blown Medi-Cal coverage, according to the state.\n\nNow, Obamacare peddlers from Oregon to New York and all points in between are rushing to sign up new \u201ccustomers\u201d in advance of the March 31 open enrollment deadline. How many more thousands of illegal immigrants will be roped into the system? Remember: In the lexicon of the left, \u201caccidental\u201d is just another word for inevitable entitlement creep.\n\nMichelle Malkin\u2019s email address is malknblog@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Weekly Opinion Columnist, Opinion, MICHELLE MALKIN, Nick Budnick, Republican Party", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "You knew it was coming.
