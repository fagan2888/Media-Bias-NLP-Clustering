Jessica Moya would give her account of her personal parental nightmare dozens of times over the years: first to police, then to neighbors and family and then to reporters.

Her toddler son Anthony simply vanished in a matter of a few minutes from his grandmother’s apartment. One minute he was sleeping peacefully in a bedroom. Fifteen minutes later he was nowhere to be found.

Though it happened during a period of time when many people are normally scrambling to get to work or to run errands, no one at the Lakewood apartment complex near West Sixth Avenue and West Wadsworth Boulevard would report seeing the tyke wandering around unaccompanied by an adult.

The 18-year-old mother of two awoke around 8:30 a.m. that Monday morning, June 12, 1989. Jessica had been sleeping on the floor in the apartment’s living room.

She walked into a bedroom where her 23-month-old son Anthony had been put to bed the night before.

Anthony was still sleeping.

Jessica said she went back to sleep in the front room for another 15 minutes, woke and discovered the boy was gone.

The apartment door was open.

“I got scared,” Moya later said. “I looked all over – in the cupboards, in the closets and under the bed. I looked everywhere.”

She ran outside and looked in the apartment pool.

She ran around the grounds of the apartment complex.
