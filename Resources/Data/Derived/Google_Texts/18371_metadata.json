They feed the world\u2019s marine life, thicken ice cream, and may provide the key to solving the world\u2019s energy crisis. Algae hold your California roll together. But there\u2019s an algal underworld, too, inhabited by murderous cyanobacteria and backstabbing Prymnesium. Many of these cloak-and-dagger species lurk in our streams and along our shorelines\u2014as 500,000 Ohioans learned the hard way over the weekend, when a Lake Erie algal bloom left them without drinking water for nearly two days.\n\nHumans have a long history of conflict with algae\u2014and current agricultural practices and climate change are making things worse. One of the earliest recorded instances of algae attacking North Americans occurred in the early 1790s off the coast of Washington State, when British naval officer George Vancouver noticed that several of his men were having trouble breathing. Some sailors went numb and babbled incoherently before suffocating. They had ingested saxitoxin (probably by eating bad clams or mussels), a potent poison produced by an algal dinoflagellate belonging to the genus Alexandrium. More than 200 years later, we still have no antidote for saxitoxin, and paralytic shellfish poisoning kills about 9 percent of those who come down with it.\n\nDeath by algae is rare\u2014history\u2019s most deadly algal bloom killed 88 Brazilians in 1988\u2014but it is often dramatic. People who consume too much microcystin, the cyanobacteria product that contaminated Toledo\u2019s water supply, can experience staggering and derangement, along with the more common gastrointestinal distress. The algae Gymnodinium breve produces a toxin that, when ingested, generates alternating hot and cold sensations. Domoic acid, the waste product of several different algae species (and the demise of many seabirds), causes memory loss and disorientation. The aptly named scaritoxin can trigger vertigo.\n\nDifferent regions of the United States have their own local blends of problematic algae, which means there could be more Toledos in our future. (Climate Progress has a nice rundown of some of the most algae-threatened cities, and researchers this week said that Florida could be facing its largest red tide bloom in nearly a decade.) Alexandrium tamarense, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning, is most common in the Pacific and the northeastern United States. Pfiesteria piscicda populates the Mid-Atlantic, while Gymnodinium breve is found in the Southeast.Gamberdiscus toxicus, which concentrates on its way up the food chain until humans consume it in large fish, is a special risk in warm waters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists say harmful algal blooms like the ones currently affecting Lake Erie could be a sign of things to come", "title": "Climate change\u2019s deadly new threat", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scientists say harmful algal blooms like the ones currently affecting Lake Erie could be a sign of things to come", "title": "Climate change\u2019s deadly new threat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/climate_changes_deadly_new_threat_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_212028967.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists say harmful algal blooms like the ones currently affecting Lake Erie could be a sign of things to come", "title": "Climate change\u2019s deadly new threat", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_212028967.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Palmer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Algae, Climate Change, Lake Eerie, Ohio, OnEarth.org", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Algae, Climate Change, Lake Eerie, Ohio, OnEarth.org, Sustainability News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on OnEarth.org.\nAlexandrium tamarense, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning, is most common in the Pacific and the northeastern United States.\nDeath by algae is rare\u2014history\u2019s most deadly algal bloom killed 88 Brazilians in 1988\u2014but it is often dramatic.\nPeople who consume too much microcystin, the cyanobacteria product that contaminated Toledo\u2019s water supply, can experience staggering and derangement, along with the more common gastrointestinal distress.\nHumans have a long history of conflict with algae\u2014and current agricultural practices and climate change are making things worse."}
