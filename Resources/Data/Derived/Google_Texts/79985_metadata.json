But do you know the kind of astronomical fine you might face if you join in?\n\nOne Wisconsin man is finding out the hard way. He\u2019s been nailed with a $183,000 fine \u2014 and he was only involved in a DDoS attack for one minute.\n\nEric J. Rosol plead guilty to the charge of accessing a protected computer. Rosol was one of many Americans outraged by the actions of the billionaire Koch brothers, who were accused of manipulating Wisconsin\u2019s political system and pushing an anti-union agenda. Rosol made the choice to protest by getting involved with OpWisconsin (albeit very briefly).\n\nThe Koch Industries website was only taken down for 15 minutes by the OpWisconsin DDoS attack, and according to court records the actual financial losses to the company were less than $5,000.\n\nIf Rosol had stolen property from a neighbor totaling less than $5,000, Wisconsin law calls for a fine of no more than $10,000 or three years and six months in jail (or both). So how did he end up with a $183,000 fine for running an automated DDoS tool for 60 seconds?\n\nBecause Koch Industries claimed that the attack necessitated a $183,000 expenditure to a consulting firm to better secure its web servers.\n\nObviously Kosol\u2019s participation was minimal, and the impact of a single node during a large-scale DDoS attack is minimal. Kosol, however, was unlucky enough to be caught, and it\u2019s clear that the presiding judge wants to set an example. There\u2019s certainly no way he could actually believe that Kosol himself was 100% responsible for the attack and therefore should endure 100% of the claimed costs.\n\nHopefully the $183,000 fine won\u2019t hold up upon appeal. It\u2019s nothing short of ridiculous, especially when two convicted arsonists in Wisconsin recently had to cough up just $6,400 for burning down a vacant house that still belonged to someone.", "article_metadata": {"zdid": 1579317, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "@geekdotcom", "description": "You may have seen what a DDoS looks like, and you probably know participating in a DDoS attack is illegal in most countries.
