The meltdown in media stocks started earlier in the month as many companies reported disappointing earnings results.\n\nThe S&P 500 Media index fell 14% in August, a steeper loss than the S&P 500\u2032s decline of 6.3%.\n\nAmong the hardest hit stocks in the sector, Class B shares of Viacom Inc., the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon, tumbled 28% in August, while 21st Century Fox\u2019s Class A shares fell 21%. Time Warner Inc., which owns channels such as HBO and TBS, and Walt Disney Co., which owns ESPN and ABC, were down 19% and 15%, respectively.\n\nAdvertising holding companies were less rattled by the media meltdown, with the stocks of U.S.-based Omnicom and Interpublic posting declines of 8.3% and 11%, respectively.\n\nBernstein analyst Todd Juenger, in a research note last month, said that even channels\u2019 once steadily growing revenue from affiliate fees are now at risk and that markets are now valuing TV networks as \u201cstructurally impaired assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think whether cord cutting turns out to be just a small deal or a really big deal, the stocks are going to trade at this low multiple for quite some time, just like they did before [during the recession], until proven otherwise,\u201d Mr. Juenger said in a conference call last month to discuss a new framework for valuing the media sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix, a highly volatile stock, ended the month with a 0.6% gain \u2014 one of the better results in media even after the shares were whipsawed along with the broader market more than most. Shareholders have high hopes for Netflix\u2019s global expansion, and several analysts have said the video-streaming company is well-positioned to benefit from the advertising and ratings woes that plague traditional media firms. So far this year, Netflix shares have more than doubled.\n\nDuring trading Tuesday morning, the S&P 500 was down about 2%, and most media stocks were in the red, led by Netflix with a 6% drop.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "After a wild ride in August, the stocks of many major media companies ended the month with double-digit declines.", "title": "Here\u2019s How Media Stocks Fared During the August Roller Coaster", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/09/01/heres-how-media-stocks-fared-during-the-august-roller-coaster/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC339_Market_P_20150901103608.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Here\u2019s How Media Stocks Fared During the August Roller Coaster", "description": "After a wild ride in August, the stocks of many major media companies ended the month with double-digit declines.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Nathalie Tadena", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "After a wild ride in August, the stocks of many major media companies ended the month with double-digit declines.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-01T15:39:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/09/01/heres-how-media-stocks-fared-during-the-august-roller-coaster/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-4424", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "After a wild ride in August, the stocks of many major media companies ended the month with double-digit declines.", "title": "Here\u2019s How Media Stocks Fared During the August Roller Coaster", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/09/01/heres-how-media-stocks-fared-during-the-august-roller-coaster/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC339_Market_P_20150901103608.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-4424", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-01T15:39:21-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbbc\"", "article_summary": "Lucas Jackson/ReutersAfter a wild ride in August, the stocks of many major media companies ended the month with double-digit declines.\nThe meltdown in media stocks started earlier in the month as many companies reported disappointing earnings results.\nDuring trading Tuesday morning, the S&P 500 was down about 2%, and most media stocks were in the red, led by Netflix with a 6% drop.\nSo far this year, Netflix shares have more than doubled.\nThe S&P 500 Media index fell 14% in August, a steeper loss than the S&P 500\u2032s decline of 6.3%."}
