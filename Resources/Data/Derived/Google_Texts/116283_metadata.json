He followed that with a fifth-place finish in the 3K on Saturday night in 8:02.40. Oregon junior Edward Cheserek won both events.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 5K, Colorado senior Morgan Pearson was sixth in 13:53.22 and Colorado State junior Jerrell Mock was 14th in 14:07.09 \u2014 a finish that earned him the university\u2019s first All-American designation in the event. In the men\u2019s 3K, Colorado State junior Jefferson Abbey was just behind Murphy in 8:02.43, Air Force senior Patrick Corona was ninth in 8:03.12, and Colorado senior Connor Winter was 10th in 8:04.23 in his nationals debut.\n\nColorado\u2019s Erin Clark finished fifth in the 3K in 9:08.63 and teammate Kaitlyn Benner was eighth in 9:09.66. In the women\u2019s 5K on Friday night, the lone Colorado representative was Air Force senior Hannah Everson, who finished seventh in 16:04.86.\n\nIn the field events, Colorado State sophomore Mostafa Hassan was fifth in the shotput with a throw of 64-11\u00bc inches, a mark two feet farther than his season best. Hassan will compete next week at the World Indoor Track and Field Championships in Portland, Ore., representing Egypt.\n\nOregon swept the team titles on the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side.\n\nColorado, a distance running powerhouse, stacks the long-distance events with top runners \u2014 five competed between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s squads this weekend \u2014 and doesn\u2019t typically compete for overall team championships, which requires a team filled out with sprinters, jumpers, throwers and those specialized in multievents. The relative brevity of the indoor season and the slower overall times means it doesn\u2019t hold as much clout as the outdoor season, which the Buffs will open Friday with a home meet at CU.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or @danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s Pierce Murphy secures two top-5 finishes at NCAA Indoors", "title": "Colorado\u2019s Pierce Murphy secures two top-5 finishes at NCAA Indoors", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/colorados-pierce-murphy-secures-two-top-5-finishes-at-ncaa-indoors/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T18:58:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T18:58:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running, University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1cc9\"", "article_summary": "Colorado senior Pierce Murphy secured two top-five finishes in distance events at the NCAA Indoor Championships this weekend, capping his indoor track career for the Buffaloes with a pair of All-American honors.\nThe relative brevity of the indoor season and the slower overall times means it doesn\u2019t hold as much clout as the outdoor season, which the Buffs will open Friday with a home meet at CU.\nIn the men\u2019s 3K, Colorado State junior Jefferson Abbey was just behind Murphy in 8:02.43, Air Force senior Patrick Corona was ninth in 8:03.12, and Colorado senior Connor Winter was 10th in 8:04.23 in his nationals debut.\nIn the men\u2019s 5K, Colorado senior Morgan Pearson was sixth in 13:53.22 and Colorado State junior Jerrell Mock was 14th in 14:07.09 \u2014 a finish that earned him the university\u2019s first All-American designation in the event.\nIn the field events, Colorado State sophomore Mostafa Hassan was fifth in the shotput with a throw of 64-11\u00bc inches, a mark two feet farther than his season best."}
