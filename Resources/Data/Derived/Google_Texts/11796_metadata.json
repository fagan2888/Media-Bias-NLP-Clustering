A police officer was shot protecting her self-serving \u201ccause,\u201d which is a price far too high for Geller\u2019s shenanigans, but this is America, we believe in free speech and Pamela Geller is entitled to abuse that freedom in whatever toxic way she chooses.\n\n(And it goes without saying that violence against speech is always wrong and must be condemned. It is hereby condemned, without reservation.)\n\nGeller\u2019s statement after the shootings was simple: \u201cThis is war \u2014 the war is here.\u201d Which is perhaps the best articulation of the current mood on the right that we\u2019ve seen in a while. Indeed, wing-nuts seem to believe they are simultaneously at war with the federal government of the United States (which just last week they claimed was planning to drop death squads into small rural Texas towns under cover of \u201cmilitary exercises\u201d); with immigrants who are streaming across the border to destroy our way of life; and, of course, with the jihadis who are trying to kill decent Americans who are simply making fun of their religion. As you can see, the right is working itself into a hell of a lather; the \u201cother\u201d has not been this present in their paranoid imaginations for quite some time.\n\nTake Congressman Peter King, who tied up recent events in a nice bow for the folks watching Fox News:\n\n\u201cWhen people like Hillary Clinton say that police should not have weapons of war, the fact is, we are at war; we are at war with Islamist terrorism, and we have to have all weapons and all resources available.\u201d\n\nBringing in Hillary Clinton, weak sister who won\u2019t keep the country safe from terrorists and God-knows-who-else, is very clever. King went on to say that we shouldn\u2019t even be talking about Geller, being provocative because \u201cbeing in America means that you can be provocative. This is the First Amendment. We cannot sacrifice our Constitution to Islamists or politically correct commentators.\u201d\n\nAs you may recall, King held a more nuanced opinion about the people who objected to the building of a Muslim recreation center near Ground Zero:\n\n\u201cThe Muslims have, as everyone else says, the right to practice their religion and they have the right to construct a mosque at ground zero if they wish. What I am saying, though, is that they should listen to public opinion, they should listen to the deep wounds and anguish that this is causing to so many good people.\u201d\n\nWhat a thoughtful comment! Sure they had a right to build the mosque. But perhaps they should have taken people\u2019s feelings into account, where it concerns an issue about which they felt very personally sensitive. (How politically correct of him.) But that was then. This is now.\n\nPeter King knows the GOP base very well. And recent polling bears out the fact that they are ready to rumble. The conventional wisdom holds that it\u2019s always \u201cthe economy, stupid,\u201d and a voter\u2019s main priority will forever be with his or her pocketbook. Perhaps this is true. But the two parties often break down their priorities in their own minds in very different ways:\n\nWhen asked in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll which issue should be the top priority for the federal government to address, Republican primary voters\u2019 leading response was national security and terrorism (27 percent said it was their first choice). That\u2019s followed by the deficit and government spending (24 percent), job creation and economic growth (21 percent) and religious and moral values (12 percent). By comparison, the top priority for Democrats in the poll was job creation and economic growth (37 percent) \u2014 followed by health care (17 percent), climate change (15 percent) and national security and terrorism (13 percent). Among all Americans, the ranking was job creation/economic growth (29 percent), national security/terrorism (21 percent) and deficit/government spending (17 percent). The economy dropping to the No. 3 concern among Republican primary voters is a striking departure from March 2012, when it ranked No. 1 (at 36 percent) \u2014 followed by the deficit/government spending (at 35 percent) and national security/terrorism (at just 8 percent).\n\nSo what has changed since 2012, when the right was obsessed with economic issues? The economy has improved and deficits have shrunk, of course; but that hardly explains why Republicans would be happy about it while Democrats are still concerned. After all, Republicans are invariably hostile to the Obama administration, and will necessarily be running against the president\u2019s record on the economy, whether they like it or not.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not that they suddenly believe it\u2019s morning in America, again. It\u2019s that they have their old fear-mongering mojo back. And you can tell that they think it feels very, very good.\n\nAs for why they prioritize these issues so differently from Democrats: It\u2019s fair to say that they are living in a different media reality and literally see the world and its challenges from a radically different perspective. If you were to watch Fox News or listen to right wing talk radio so religiously, you too would believe that the nation were under siege from foreigners.\n\nWhere a moderate or liberal might think that the Middle East is heating up and that immigration presents a big challenge (and yes, worry a bit about some homegrown terrorist type deciding to try something violent) the right sees a full blown assault on America and everything it stands for. Where the moderate or liberal has grave concerns about the economic future of their children and wonder whether the middle class will continue to fall behind, the right believes Obamacare is a socialist plot to kill old people, and that it\u2019s perfectly possible the White House has ordered the military to put Texas under martial law. (They believe this for reasons that remain obscure, other than that the state is home to a lot of Republicans. But then so is the military, so it\u2019s hard to figure that one.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right has long harbored fantasies about shadowy government conspiracies.
