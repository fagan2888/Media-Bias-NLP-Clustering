Yet with so many locations selling upscale, big-ticket items, will homegrown shoppers be able to shell out enough to support all of the competing players?\n\nStory continues below\n\nClose \ue007 Canadian Retail Brands We Miss Most of \ue000 \ue001\n\nOne of Canada\u2019s most storied and oldest retailers went bankrupt in 1999. The department stores founded by Timothy Eaton in 1869 became famous for their catalogues, sponsorship of the Toronto Santa Claus parade and the downtown Toronto shopping centre that still bears its name.\n\nThis chain of grocery stores was rebranded as A&P before it was bought out by Metro. We miss the chain founded in 1919, party because of those plastic grocery bins you could load onto a conveyor belt to get them outside, but mostly because of their awesome font.\n\nAlthough Toronto is home to the Bata shoe museum, the chain has shuttered all of its Bata and Athlete\u2019s World stores in the country where it was once based. It does, however, continue to sell footwear on almost every other continent. Pictured: Bata founder Tomas Bata.\n\nIt was once Canada\u2019s largest music retailer boasting \u201c140 locations, coast to coast.\u201d The chain was founded by Sam Sniderman in 1937. Along with A&A Records and Canada\u2019s last national music store chain, Music World, it fell victim to the Internet age by the end of the 2000s.\n\nA&A had noticeable flagship stores in downtown Toronto and downtown Montreal. It launched in the early 1960s and went bankrupt in 1991.\n\nEven if you weren\u2019t a fan of lumber shopping, how could you complain about being dragged through a store whose logo is an overall-clad, skipping beaver? Also, it was owned by Molson \u2014 yes, the beer people. What\u2019s more Canadian than that?\n\nThis was THE convenience store chain -- known for its plastic jugs of milk -- for many small-town Ontarians before being sold to the parent company of rival Mac\u2019s Convenience Stores in 1996. It was so Canadian, its chocolate milk got a shout-out in the special thanks section on many Rush albums.\n\nBelieve it or not, Ontario once had another pharmacy chain that gave Shoppers Drug Mart a real run for its money.\n\nThis novelty-items store was where you could buy any Troll doll or Beanie Baby, or marvel at the dirty gift selections while pretending to shop for a Troll or Beanie Baby.\n\nFor all your canvas clothing and accessories needs. The wallets and pencil cases were must-haves for 1980s Southern Ontario kids.\n\nEver since this retailer of cliched Canadian clothing shuttered, we have no idea where to get puffy paint sweatshirts with pictures of loons on them, or the ugly Christmas sweater for all of those trendy theme parties.\n\nThe home to discount menswear and flamed shirts galore was once an institution in malls across the country, but has been reduced to just a handful of shops in small-town malls.\n\nOnce a staple in Western Canada and Ontario, it had great, cheap jeans.\n\nThe classic Canadian \u201cmom store\u201d closed in 2011, after 30 years in operation.\n\nA Zellers-esque chain perhaps best known to eastern Canadians, who might be familiar with the chain\u2019s animated squirrel named Sparky.\n\nThe free popcorn made arguing over which VHS movie to rent bearable.\n\nZeddy! Need we say more?\n\nNEXT: U.S. BRANDS WE WANT TO SEE IN CANADA\n\nA perfect blend of Costco affordability and Whole Foods quality. http://www.traderjoes.com/\n\nAnother option for a mid-priced department store with a diversity of offering is always welcome.

It will also bring as many as 75 more affordable Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5th locations.\n\nAmerican Girl The doll store with a cult like following opened its first two Canadian stores inside Chapters/ Indigo stores in Toronto and Vancouver earlier this year and plans to roll out a cross-country expansion.\n\nDylan\u2019s Candy Bar The brightly-coloured candy retailer founded by Ralph Lauren\u2019s daughter Dylan is reportedly looking for retail space in Canada.\n\nJimmy Choo The American women\u2019s shoe designer is expected to open its first Canadian standalone store in Toronto\u2019s Yorkdale mall later this year.\n\nBloomingdale's Ok this one is speculation at this point, but several retail sources in Canada since 2012 have reported this could be in the works.\n\nNEXT: 10 Things The Fast Food Industry Doesn't Want You To Know\n\nMcDonald's had higher sales growth in 2008 than in 2006 or 2007, opening nearly 600 stores that year, according to Slate. The chain was able to take advantage of Americans' recession tastes: Cheap, convenient food.\n\nOne Reddit user claiming to be an ex-McDonald's worker said he once left a bag of chicken nuggets out on the counter for too long and \"they melted. Into a pool of liquid.\" That didn't stop him from loving the nuggets, \"still delicious,\" he wrote.\n\nMore than 60 percent of low-wage workers are employed by big corporations, according to a July analysis by the National Employment Law Project. And more than 90 percent of those companies were profitable last year.\n\nFast food workers in New York City make an average of $9 per hour, according to the Village Voice. That comes to about $18,500 per year for full-time workers.\n\nFor 40 percent of private sector workers, taking a sick day and still getting paid isn't an option, according to the Baltimore Sun. Fast food workers are especially likely to be part of that 40 percent.\n\nMany fast food workers saw their health benefits put at risk this year, if they even had them at all. Papa John's CEO John Schnatter said he would likely reduce some of his workers hours so that he wouldn't have to cover them in response to Obamacare. Jimmy John's founder, Jimmy John Liautaud told Fox News in October that he would \"have to\" cut workers' hours so that he wasn't forced to cover them under Obamacare.\n\nThe average hourly pay at McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and Taco Bell is less than $8 an hour, according to salary data cited by CNBC.\n\nAs more workers fight for limited jobs, many older employees are gravitating towards the fast food industry. The median age of a fast food worker is 28, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data cited by the Atlantic. For women, who make up two-thirds of the industry's employees, that age is 32.\n\nFast food worker's went on strike in late November in New York City, showcasing a rare effort to organize the industry's workers. Labor leaders often don't make an effort to organize these workers because the high turnover makes the challenge daunting.\n\nFor all their work, fast food workers get very little dough. The lowest paid job category in New York City is \"Combined Food Service and Preparation Workers, Including Fast Food,\" according to Bureau of Labor Department Statistics cited by Salon. \ue002 Share \ue003 Tweet \ue004 \u2716 Advertisement Share this \u2716 close Current Slide\n\nErnst & Young partner Daniel Baer said what distinguishes many of the high-end retailers entering the marketplace is that they're concentrated in major urban centres like Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal and are opening limited stores in those cities.\n\n\"They're relatively targeted where there are people that have disposable income and where there is, as well, the ability to attract tourist dollars,\" said Baer, who also serves as national retail and consumer products industry leader for Ernst & Young.\n\n\"I think there will be the right balance in those marketplaces. Where it will become a little more interesting in my mind is when you're competing with a lot more stores in that aspirational upper middle class, because in that tranche, they are looking at a lot more stores, in fact,\" he added. \"That's where I think the competition will be especially fierce: the Nordstrom Rack, hr2 of Holt Renfrew fame, the (Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th) \u2014 that category.\"\n\nBrynn Winegard, a marketing expert with Winegard & Company, says Canadians tend to be more value-conscious and less price sensitive compared to Americans.\n\n\"We are a lot more accepting of higher prices if we believe the value is there. And our economy is one that is padded enough that our consumers, our people, stay fairly affluent through the business cycle,\" she said.\n\n\"Our retailers and our consumer spending doesn't shift or sway as much through the business cycle \u2014 as an example \u2014 we see in the U.S. What that means for Canadian retail in general ... is that Canadians \u2014 even in downturns \u2014 have good affluence in order to be able to spend.\"\n\nWinegard said there is also a category of consumers who practise what she describes as \"prestige shopping\" where they'll skimp on \"low involvement\" categories of goods and spend more on those in the \"identity\" or \"high involvement\" categories.\n\n\"My example is always the following: people who will go to Wal-Mart for socks and Holt Renfrew for denim \u2014 and there's a lot of them.\"\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue is slated to open its first two Canadian locations in Toronto in 2016.\n\nNordstrom recently launched north of the border at the Chinook Centre in Calgary, and is set to open additional stores at the Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Rideau Centre in Ottawa next year. Toronto will be home to three Nordstrom locations: Yorkdale Shopping Centre and Toronto Eaton Centre in 2016 and at Sherway Gardens in the city's west end in 2017.\n\nWhile luxury retailers may be counting on outside visitors to spend, Trendex North America president Randy Harris questioned whether such hopes will translate to real sales.\n\n\"People keep talking about the tourist business, but the question is, is a tourist coming into downtown Toronto going to get on a bus and go to Sherway Gardens? I don't think so,\" said Harris, whose Toledo, Ohio-based marketing research and consulting firm specializes in the Canadian and Mexican markets.\n\n\"When people talk about 'We're going to get increased tourist business,' I really wonder if we are or not. And remember, there is no city in the world where there are three Nordstroms as close to each other as there (will be) in Toronto.\"\n\nYet the success seen by retailers at Yorkdale \u2014 a launch pad for many first-to-Canada stand-alone stores like Versace, Jimmy Choo, Mulberry and Kate Spade New York \u2014 may provide hopeful signs to competitors in the luxury category. Yorkdale general manager Claire Santamaria said retailers housed within the mall often perform better than they expected.\n\n\"We've seen that for years,\" she said. \"We really started that branch into luxury with Holt Renfrew ... and then with Tiffany, and then we had Burberry. And each time we had one of these brands open in the shopping centre, we often found that they underestimated that consumer demand.\"\n\nBaer said luxury retailers don't compete for customers solely on product but also service \u2014 a tool he described as a \"critical differentiator.\" The challenge for companies will be to ensure that they provide the experience to which people are accustomed, and deliver on what people's perception of the brand is, he added.\n\n\"It's hard to recover if you don't meet that offering right off the bat.\"\n\nFollow @lauren_larose on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Canada Business", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2417006/images/s-SAKS-FIFTH-AVENUE-small.jpg", "description": "TORONTO - With the arrival of Nordstrom north of the border in Calgary and Saks Fifth Avenue waiting in the wings, the U.S. department stores are joining an increasingly crowded field of players banki", "sailthru.expire_date": "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 11:50:12 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "TORONTO - With the arrival of Nordstrom north of the border in Calgary and Saks Fifth Avenue waiting in the wings, the U.S. department stores are joining an increasingly crowded field of players banki", "title": "Invasion Of The American Luxury Retailers", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/12/21/influx-of-luxury-retailer_n_6362260.html", "see_also": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/24/bellis-fair-at-par-sale_n_10120146.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2417006/images/o-SAKS-FIFTH-AVENUE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_CA", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostCanada", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "TORONTO - With the arrival of Nordstrom north of the border in Calgary and Saks Fifth Avenue waiting in the wings, the U.S. department stores are joining an increasingly crowded field of players banki"}, "sailthru.date": "Sun, 21 Dec 2014 11:50:12 -0500", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "thumbnail": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2417006/images/o-SAKS-FIFTH-AVENUE-facebook.jpg", "taboola.category": "canada-business", "sailthru.tags": "luxury retail canada,saks canada,saks fifth avenue canada,nordstrom,Saks Fifth Avenue,nordstrom canada,retail canada,canadian luxury retailers,harry rosen,Larry Rosen,simons,holt renfrew,cp", "fb": {"app_id": 100792273348438}, "keywords": "luxury retail canada,saks canada,saks fifth avenue canada,nordstrom,Saks Fifth Avenue,nordstrom canada,retail canada,canadian luxury retailers,harry rosen,Larry Rosen,simons,holt renfrew,cp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostCanada", "section": "Canada Business"}, "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2417006/images/s-SAKS-FIFTH-AVENUE-small.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca312\"", "article_summary": "Many fast food workers saw their health benefits put at risk this year, if they even had them at all.\nFast food workers in New York City make an average of $9 per hour, according to the Village Voice.\nFast food worker's went on strike in late November in New York City, showcasing a rare effort to organize the industry's workers.\nAlong with A&A Records and Canada\u2019s last national music store chain, Music World, it fell victim to the Internet age by the end of the 2000s.\nhttp://www.openingceremony.us/NEXT: U.S. BRANDS THAT ACTUALLY ARE COMING TO CANADANordstrom The luxury department store chain will open in Toronto\u2019s Eaton Centre in 2016."}
