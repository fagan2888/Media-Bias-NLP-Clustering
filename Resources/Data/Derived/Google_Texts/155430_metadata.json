Each year at this time, crowds from urban Boston descend on the farm next to my parents\u2019 house on the North Shore in Mass. to pick their own strawberries \u2013 fresh, sweet, ripe\u2026and coated with toxins.\n\nWhile the farm staff warns visitors to wash the fruit before eating it, many choose to snack along the way (one group was caught sitting in the strawberry field with a can of \u201cReddi-Whip\u201d in hand). After all, what\u2019s the cost of a few unwashed strawberries?\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to our health, the cost may be fairly high.\n\nOver the years, researchers have documented the bad effects of pesticide exposure on human health. Recently, though, and at a forum this week at Harvard, there\u2019s been increased attention on the links between pesticides and neurodegenerative diseases, notably Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn a study published earlier this year in the journal Neurology, researchers from UCLA identified the way in which certain pesticides can increase the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also found that people with a common genetic variant are even more sensitive to these pesticides \u2013 they are two to five times more likely to develop Parkinson\u2019s if exposed.\n\n\u201cOnce you identify the toxicity of these things, getting rid of the bad pesticides\u2026would be a goal, not just for the people that live in the area, but for the workers that use it,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Jeff Bronstein, a professor of neurology at UCLA.\n\nIn a separate report out of Rutgers University, published in JAMA Neurology, researchers found that exposure to the pesticide DDT may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In the study, researchers found that levels of DDE, the chemical compound that develops when DDT breaks down, were higher in the blood of Alzheimer\u2019s patients compared to those without the disease.\n\nAnd the effects go beyond the risk of Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. Marc Weisskopf, an associate professor of environmental and occupational epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, who spoke at the Harvard forum, said there is evidence that pesticides contribute to a host of neurodevelopmental disorders as well, from ADHD and developmental disorders to lowered cognitive performance. At high levels of exposure, we know it\u2019s a problem, Weisskopf said. But the tricky part is understanding the effects of low-level exposure.\n\nAlthough DDT has been banned in the U.S. since 1972, more than 75% of the population in the U.S. has traces of the chemical in their blood. DDT can take decades to break down in the environment. People are also exposed when they consume foods from areas of the world where DDT is still being used such as areas in Africa and southeast Asia.\n\nDDT is an extremely effective insecticide and is used to combat malaria and other vector-borne illnesses in some parts of the world, where scientists and health experts must weigh the looming threat of malaria against a more distant risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nPesticides, clearly, can also play an important role in agriculture production. Dr. Jason Richardson, lead author of the Rutgers study and an associate Professor at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, grew up on a farm and knows first hand the importance of using pesticides to protect the crops. \u201cIn reality, for us to produce the amount of food that we need to feed our country\u2026pesticides are pretty much a necessary evil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we can do is take better precautions and learn more about what these potential effects are.\u201d\n\nFrom March to November, the farmer next to my parents \u2013 let\u2019s call him Farmer Brown for the sake of anonymity \u2013 sprays his fields. Once the pesticides (which include insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) are airborne, they can leak over onto neighboring properties \u2013 an effect known as \u201cpesticide drift.\u201d Farmer Brown is a friend of my parents, but their philosophies on land stewardship differ entirely.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that has pitted neighbor against neighbor.\n\nFor my parents, both conservation biologists, one of their main concerns with pesticide drift is the impact on the bees and butterflies that pollinate their gardens and serve as a food source for bluebirds, swallows, and other birds in the area. But as their daughter, I worry about the effect of the toxic air they\u2019re breathing on their own health.\n\n\u201cWe have tried not to allow the pesticide issue to affect our friendship with our neighbor,\u201d said my mother. \u201cWe both know how important open space and agriculture is to our future in New England.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to get agricultural interests and environmental interests on the same side,\u201d said my father. \u201cThese poorly conceived practices are allowed by current law and regulation. That is not our neighbor\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nImportantly, it\u2019s not only farmers that are spraying pesticides. Homeowners use up to 10 times more pesticides (including chemicals like Roundup, but that\u2019s another story) per acre on their lawns than farmers use on crops, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nProving there is a direct link between pesticide use and health outcomes is inherently difficult \u2013 it requires long-term studies that can be complicated by many other factors. But for some researchers, despite the limited data, the connections between pesticides and poor health outcomes are pretty clear.\n\n\u201cIn general, the biological plausibility points in that direction,\u201d said Alex Lu, an associate professor of Environmental Exposure Biology at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cIf this is how we kill insects by paralyzing their neurological system, most likely it will happen in humans.\u201d It won\u2019t kill humans, he went on to say, but it could produce neurological effects.\n\nIt\u2019s not just human health we should be worrying about. Lu is the author of a study published this month in the Bulletin of Insectology on the effects of pesticides on bee colony collapse disorder. His team found that the use of two neonicotinoids \u2013 a widely used form of insecticide \u2013 led honeybees to abandon their hives during the winter months and eventually die.\n\n\u201cMore than one-third of the food that we commonly eat needs pollination,\u201d said Lu. \u201cThose foods, including fruits and vegetables, are nutritious foods that we definitely need\u2026Not having enough bees to pollinate those crops will cause a lot of agricultural revenue loss.\u201d In other words, the same pesticides that are being sprayed to help the crops may indirectly cause their demise.\n\nBayer \u2013 the company that manufactures the neonicotinoids that were tested \u2013 questioned Lu\u2019s research, saying that his team used dosages of pesticides that were 10 times greater than what bees might face in the wild, according to coverage in The New York Times.\n\nAnd indeed, Lu says this this type of research can be challenging \u2013 in part because there is no \u201ccontrol\u201d population. Everyone is exposed to pesticides to some degree, so it\u2019s hard to compare people, he said during yesterday\u2019s Harvard forum on pesticides and food. Another issue is the lag time between exposure to the diagnosis of the disease \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to know whether it was the pesticides or another factor that caused the illness.\n\nTo address these concerns, researchers compare populations that are at increased risk of exposure \u2013 such as agricultural workers or families that live in close proximity to farms \u2013 to those that have less of a risk of being exposed.\n\nBut the problem these days isn\u2019t just protecting the crops from insects and other potential infestations. \u201cPeople buy with their eyes,\u201d said Farmer Brown. They want that flawless strawberry or apple. In addition to regulating the use of the more toxic chemicals, perhaps we need to adjust our expectations of the food we eat \u2013 pretty doesn\u2019t necessarily mean good.\n\nSo what\u2019s a consumer to do?\n\nEach year, the Environmental Working Group publishes the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d and the \u201cclean fifteen\u201d lists \u2013 two ratings of conventional foods with the most and least pesticide residue. Since many consumers in the U.S. can\u2019t afford to purchase only organic produce, researchers at the Harvard forum advised consumers to look to these lists to help guide their purchasing choices. For example, a consumer could purchase organic apples and strawberries \u2013 two items on the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d list, and conventional avocados and asparagus \u2013 two items on the \u201cclean fifteen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the years, researchers have documented the negative effects of pesticide exposure on human health.
