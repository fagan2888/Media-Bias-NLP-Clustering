Jeb Bush.\n\nMincing no words, Mrs. Schlafly makes her case in a 2015 update to her landmark book from a half-century ago titled \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d which, in 1964, became the motto of Barry Goldwater\u2019s grass-roots movement.\n\nIn her update, Mrs. Schlafly \u2014 founder of the Eagle Forum \u2014 argues that her party too often picks losers as candidates because of a stranglehold by the political consultant-big business-Wall Street crowd, which she argues makes a bundle from championing moderates over conservatives.\n\nShe warns that may be happening again in 2016 in the persona of Jeb Bush.\n\nShe notes \u201cclosed-door events have been held for Republican megadonors to select who will get the big money that went last time to Mitt Romney\u201d and that the mainstream media already are cheering on Mr. Bush.\n\nAs evidence, she cites a New York Times article about how \u201cJeb Bush is so smart, so intellectual and so well-read. We were told that he is a \u2018top-drawer intellect\u2019 and a voracious reader who maintains 25 books on his Kindle \u2014 books such as George Gilder\u2019s \u2018Knowledge and Power.\u2019\u201d\n\nMrs. Schlafly urges grass-roots conservatives to rise up and resist a coronation of Mr. Bush.\n\n\u201cDo you get the message that the media buildup for Jeb Bush has begun and that the 2016 Republican National Convention may simply nominate for president another Establishment loser candidate?\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be. Some of us remember Everett Dirksen\u2019s famous speech at the 1952 Republican Convention when he publicly taunted the kingmakers, \u2018We followed you before and you led us down the path to defeat.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phyllis Schlafly has long argued that the American conservative movement\u2019s purpose is to influence, not echo, the Republican Party.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Phyllis Schlafly has long argued that the American conservative movement\u2019s purpose is to influence, not echo, the Republican Party.", "title": "Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly assails GOP establishment for trying to coronate Jeb Bush", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/22/conservative-activist-phyllis-schlafly-assails-gop/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/11/equal-rights-amendmentjpeg-020f1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/11/equal-rights-amendmentjpeg-020f1.jpg", "description": "Phyllis Schlafly has long argued that the American conservative movement\u2019s purpose is to influence, not echo, the Republican Party.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly assails GOP establishment for t"}, "Author": "Ralph Z.
