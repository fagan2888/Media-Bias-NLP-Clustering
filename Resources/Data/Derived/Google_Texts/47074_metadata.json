It will be open Thursday-Sunday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.\n\nOn Sunday morning, KCAL9\u2019s Joy Benedict spoke with some of the people seeking wristbands as well as Care Harbor President Don Manelli, who expects about 4,000 people to receive services this week.\n\n\u201cOur biggest year was about 3,700,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing as much as we can in a building this size.\u201d\n\nManelli said Care Harbor is able to provide the services thanks to the medical professionals who volunteer their time for the clinic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added more services,\u201d he said. \u201cAs health care changes we\u2019ve seen the need to add more services. We\u2019re doing partial dentures and dentistry this year. We have oral cancer screening. We have a much bigger staff of medical specialists on site. We\u2019re still looking for volunteers believe it or not, general dentists. We could use a few on Thursday.\u201d\n\nManelli said insurance signups are a big part of the event as well.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people that could have Obamacare don\u2019t have it because they don\u2019t understand that they are eligible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a big component on the arena floor that is educating them to the opportunities. It\u2019s Obamacare, it\u2019s CalFresh. A lot of programs. We signed up a lot last year, and we expect to that this year too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of people lined up at the LA Sports Arena on Sunday morning to receive wristbands that will allow them to receive services at the annual Care Harbor free clinic, which begins Thursday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/09/07/patients-line-up-for-free-clinic-wristbands/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/4676365_g.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/4676365_g.jpg?w=640", "height": 351}, "type": "article", "description": "Thousands of people lined up at the LA Sports Arena on Sunday morning to receive wristbands that will allow them to receive services at the annual Care Harbor free clinic, which begins Thursday.", "title": "Patients Line Up For Free Clinic Wristbands"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSLA", "image": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/4676365_g.jpg?w=640", "description": "Thousands of people lined up at the LA Sports Arena on Sunday morning to receive wristbands that will allow them to receive services at the annual Care Harbor free clinic, which begins Thursday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Patients Line Up For Free Clinic Wristbands"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of LA/OC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Los Angeles", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, local, news, syndicated local, calfresh, care harbor, care harbor wristbands, don manelli, free health care, free medical services, la sports arena, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5c05896c022a6d5696298ac60bad5bcf?s=16", "news_keywords": "calfresh, care harbor, care harbor wristbands, don manelli, free health care, free medical services, la sports arena, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd14b\"", "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) \u2014 Thousands of people lined up at the LA Sports Arena on Sunday morning to receive wristbands that will allow them to receive services at the annual Care Harbor free clinic, which begins Thursday.\nOn Sunday morning, KCAL9\u2019s Joy Benedict spoke with some of the people seeking wristbands as well as Care Harbor President Don Manelli, who expects about 4,000 people to receive services this week.\nThe four-day clinic, which also takes place at the arena, provides free medical, dental and vision care to under-served populations, as well as follow-up care and assistance with insurance signups.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing as much as we can in a building this size.\u201dManelli said Care Harbor is able to provide the services thanks to the medical professionals who volunteer their time for the clinic.\nWe could use a few on Thursday.\u201dManelli said insurance signups are a big part of the event as well."}
