We all know this. There are lies of omission and lies of commission and lies that are the result of willful ignorance and lies that are the result of simple ignorance in its purest form. But only one party has institutionalized dishonesty, and that is the Republican Party.\n\nThey have lied about everything, from Obamacare to Benghazi to the economy, like these,\n\nAnd of course, this one:\n\nNo single article can list every Republican lie, so I will use pictures as well as words here, both in the interest of space and because some people remember better what they say, rather than what they read. Images can be powerful.\n\nRepublicans who pass this around\u2026\n\nignore this\u2026\n\nand this\u2026\n\nand worst of all, this\u2026\n\nThe Miami Herald reported during Election Day 2012 that,\n\n\u201cThe numbers in Florida show this was winnable,\u201d Brett Doster, Florida advisor for Romney, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought based on our polling and range of organization that we had done what we needed to win. Obviously, we didn\u2019t, and for that I and every other operative in Florida has a sick feeling that we left something on the table\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething left on the table\u2026Yes, that would be the truth.\n\nIf you will remember, Mitt lied so often about everything that nobody had any clear idea hat he really thought about anything. Yet he felt he had a reasonable expectation to win. On any important issue, you could find video of Mitt saying both \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d\n\nMitt flip-flopped. He made up for this by lying about flip-flopping.\n\nAnd Republicans obviously think that\u2019s okay, as the recent bruhaha over the prisoner exchange that returned Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl to his family:\n\nRep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA) flip-flopped.\n\nRepublicans deleted comments they made previously in support of freeing Bergdahl so that they can accuse Obama of doing what they had previously supported\n\nThey claim Obama did not discuss the exchange with them but it turns out Obama did discuss it with them as far back as 2011\n\nAnd they are sure as shooting not going to bring up the 500+ GItmo prisoners released by President George W. Bush. For the math challenged, that\u2019s 100 x as many prisoners as Obama exchanged for Bergdahl\n\nThe Cuban anarchist, Ted Cruz, falsely claimed until Obama no American president had ever negotiated with terrorists\n\nSarah Palin condemned Obama\u2019s action yet in 2008 prayed for his release.\n\nWell, Obama answered her prayers.\n\nJohn McCain flip-flopped: he was for a prisoner swap and then suddenly against it. And not only did he flip-flop, but he then lied about having flip-flopped.\n\nAnd perhaps the most egregious example of dishonesty and hypocrisy comes from Oliver North. North, deeply involved in the Iran-Contra scandal and convicted on multiple counts after engaging in trading 2000 missiles to Iran in exchange for seven Americans being held in Lebanon, then gave the money from that missile sale to Iran Contra death squads\u2026well, let\u2019s just let a photo do the talking:\n\nYet North had posted on Facebook in 2011,\n\nToday, I received from the National League of POW/MIA Families, a \u201cNever Forget Bracelet\u201d emblazoned with the name of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. He was seized on June 30, 2009 in Afghanistan and is being held by the Haqqani Organization \u2013 a Taliban afilliated terrorist group \u2013 in northwest Pakistan. Sgt Bergdahl and his loved ones here at home deserve our prayers and encouragement until he is rescued or released. That\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re Americans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we do\u201d \u2013 until a black president does it, apparently. And then, somehow, he gains the right to condemn President Obama.\n\nOf course, the mainstream media is more than willing to let North get away with this without reminding viewers of Iran-Contra, but Jon Stewart was not. As Stewart put it, \u201cYou\u2019re saying it now like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d\n\nThis dishonesty is nothing new. It has been written about before. Lindy West at Jezebel wrote about Paul Rayn National Convention Speech in Florida back in 201, observing that \u201cthe stuff in Ryan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t true\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019re not even subtle, carefully orchestrated lies, either. They\u2019re obvious lies, debunkable by even the drunkest, most casual armchair wonk watching the speech.\u201d\n\nAnd nobody cared. If you care, here is Salon\u2019s list of Ryan\u2019s brazen lies that night.\n\nYou cannot no separate the GOP from lies, because without lies, as the picture worth 10,000 words says,", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican Party has made dishonesty an art-form, lying about everything from Obamacare to Benghazi, from the economy to prisoner exchanges", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Republican Party has made dishonesty an art-form, lying about everything from Obamacare to Benghazi, from the economy to prisoner exchanges", "title": "The Republican Party Has Institutionalized Dishonesty", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/06/07/republican-party-institutionalized-dishonesty.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Republican-Party-Reaganomics-Old-Cronnies-64157498511.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-06-07T07:21:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,Barack Obama,bowe bergdahl,George W.
