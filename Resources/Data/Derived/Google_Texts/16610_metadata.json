By removing prohibitive regulations against building design professionals, the act will allow trained architects and other professionals to quickly and effectively respond to pressing infrastructural issues in times of emergency.\n\nThe legislation reflects the mission of the AIA to contribute its collective expertise when it is needed most, which is crucial in the planning and rebuilding of New Jersey's communities.\n\nWe commend lead sponsor Majority Leader Lou Greenwald, along with sponsors Paul Moriarity and Upendra Chivukula, for their sound and rational advocacy of the bill.\n\n-- Kurt Kalafsky,\n\nTrenton\n\nThe writer is president of the New Jersey chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\n\n\n\nFollow The Times of Trenton on Twitter @TimesofTrenton.
