TEC International, Auburn Hills, Mich., has purchased the BlueBird business from Husqvarna, effective Dec. 5, 2014.

The current BlueBird product is being manufactured in Auburn, Neb., and a build-out plan is in place in an effort to support uninterrupted product supply for customers through the transition. The current system for all orders, calls and billing will continue for now and will be handled by Husqvarna.

In the near future, the company plans to transition all customer care functions to the new BlueBird, so that it is as transparent as possible to customer partners. In addition, the BlueBird website is undergoing enhancements and the company plans to relaunch the site in the first quarter 2015. In addition, the BlueBird name will be retained and BlueBird International will be renamed as BlueBird Turf Products.

During 2015, TEC plans to take over the manufacturing of all BlueBird products, as it relocates the product assembly to its Auburn Hills facility.

“We look forward to growing the business and expanding the BlueBird line with innovative new products,” says Tony Carmen, CEO, TEC International. “The acquisition of BlueBird complements our existing OPE [outdoor power equipment] product lineup with an established line of turf equipment and we look forward to further developing this well-established brand and giving our customers a wider range of product offerings going forward.”
