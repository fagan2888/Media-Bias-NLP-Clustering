That is down slightly from the 182,000 individuals who were enrolled in 2015, before the beginning of the open enrollment period, but the number may grow since individuals can still purchase coverage through the end of January, to become effective in February.\n\nAnother 45,200 individuals were enrolled in dental coverage through the Connector, and 5,500 people bought health insurance through small business plans. Both those numbers were similar to 2015.\n\nEighty-nine percent of individuals enrolled in Health Connector plans in 2015 paid for plans again this year, as of Tuesday. The final number is expected to be higher, because people who are enrolled in an automatic payment system will first pay their premiums on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to returning customers, the Connector has enrolled more than 21,100 new individuals in health insurance, the majority of them in ConnectorCare. ConnectorCare offers state-subsidized plans for individuals who earn less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level ($72,750 for a family of four).\n\nLefferts said state officials are still trying to understand who these new individuals are, whether they were people who did not have insurance coverage before or who received coverage elsewhere.\n\nAmy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of Health Care for All, a health care access advocacy organization that ran a help-line and reached out to the Hispanic community to help people enroll, said the organization helped people fill out 210 applications affecting 392 individuals for people who previously did not have health insurance. Whitcomb Slemmer said these enrollees were more likely to be single, male, young and Spanish speakers \u2013 all demographics that are in line with state statistics about the uninsured population.\n\n\"These are almost 400 people who didn't have health insurance before who can rest assured they have health care when they need it,\" Whitcomb Slemmer said.\n\nWhen the Health Connector website launched in late 2013, in order to conform with the federal Affordable Care Act, it was a technological disaster and was unable to enroll people in insurance. As a result, the state put hundreds of thousands of people on temporary Medicaid coverage in 2014 while it worked to revamp the website. Under former governor Deval Patrick, the state hired new leadership and a new technology firm and rebuilt the website in time for 2015 open enrollment. But while the site largely worked that year, there were still technical glitches, which led to long waits for customer service.\n\nThis year was expected to be a much smoother process, both because of additional technological fixes put in place under Gov. Charlie Baker and because anyone enrolled in insurance in 2015 could be automatically re-enrolled. That is different from the previous two years, when everyone who wanted coverage through the Connector had to shop for a plan and fill out an application.\n\nLefferts said during the first six weeks of open enrollment, the average time for a customer service call to get answered was nine seconds, compared to six minutes last year. Fewer than 1 percent of calls were abandoned this year, compared to more than 12 percent of calls last year. The state also opened four new walk-in centers, including one in Springfield. In November, 3,500 people used the walk-in centers.\n\nWhitcomb Slemmer said there were problems at the beginning of open enrollment with the federal identification verification procedures, but those were ironed out.\n\n\"We're really pleased so far this has been our smoothest enrollment period to date,\" Whitcomb Slemmer said.\n\nA handful of people on the Health Connector's Facebook page still complain about problems, and Joshua Archambault, senior fellow on health care policy at the Pioneer Institute, said he has heard about people having payment issues.\n\n\"I think the unanswerable question is how many people just decided to give up on the Connector based on their past experience,\" Archambault said. For example, some people could have bought insurance directly from insurance carriers.\n\nArchambault said there are also serious questions about how much money it is costing the state to run the Connector and provide the subsidized health insurance.\n\nIn October, Health Connector Executive Director Louis Gutierrez said the entire project has cost state and federal taxpayers $285 million, of which $180 million was for the failed version of the site.\n\n\"Certainly, it's better than in the past, but that's a pretty low bar to exceed,\" Archambault said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health insurance, Health Connector, affordable-care-act, health-care, health-connector, news", "title": "Massachusetts Health Connector enrollment goes smoothly for 2016", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Massachusetts Health Connector enrollment goes smoothly for 2016\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/massachusetts_health_connector_7.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2014/04/14672963-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17693791\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-23T20:50:43Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@boston\",\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"health-care\",\"health-connector\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2014/04/14672963-standard.jpg", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As of Tuesday, the exchange had 179,900 individuals enrolled in health insurance.
