Andrew Cuomo turned to Musk to bail him out of a $1 billion economic development deal that was going down in flames \u2014 and could very well take Cuomo\u2019s political ambitions with it.\n\nCuomo already had done Musk a favor, successfully working with the state legislature to grandfather in five service centers owned by Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors when a bill was in the works to outlaw car sales that take place outside of traditional dealerships.\n\nThe legislative director for Cuomo\u2019s dad, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, helped Tesla\u2019s lobbying efforts.\n\nMonths later, Cuomo and Musk were together again, this time to announce that Musk would move another high-tech firm, SolarCity, into beleaguered Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nThat news did more than support Cuomo\u2019s claim that he would make New York business-friendly. And It did more than make Cuomo look technologically savvy.\n\nIt rescued Cuomo from a high-profile disaster that began when he promised Buffalo voters \u2014 who had voted overwhelmingly for his opponent in the 2010 election \u2014 that he single-handedly could halt their city\u2019s decline.\n\nIn the end, Cuomo won re-election this year, Musk\u2019s SolarCity got a $750-million factory for $1 a year in rent.

About a third of the area\u2019s residents live below poverty.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, Cuomo lost big in Buffalo; he knew that was where he was vulnerable,\u201d said Cox. Since the 2010 election, Cox said, Cuomo \u201chas pampered Buffalo and showered it with projects.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s easy to see why Barbara Walters named billionaire Elon Musk one of 2014\u2019s most fascinating people.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It\u2019s easy to see why Barbara Walters named billionaire Elon Musk one of 2014\u2019s most fascinating people.", "title": "The Billionaire Who's Making Deals With Andrew Cuomo", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/acephotos448213.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-25T12:45:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/13W6SoJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It\u2019s easy to see why Barbara Walters named billionaire Elon Musk one of 2014\u2019s most fascinating people.", "title": "The Billionaire Who's Making Deals With Andrew Cuomo", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/acephotos448213.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2014-12-25T03:01:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-25T12:45:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Elon Musk, barbara walters, Gov.
