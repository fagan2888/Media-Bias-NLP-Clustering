(AP) \u2014 The smell of Cuban coffee drifts from the kitchen as Carolyn Chester digs through faded photos that fill boxes spread across the dining table.\n\nFriends linked arm-in-arm on a Cuban beach.\n\nMen in suits and women in evening gowns at a Havana nightclub.\n\nAnd in almost every frame, an American man with a salt-and-pepper mustache and a raven-haired woman \u2014 Chester\u2019s parents \u2014 smiling at good fortune that, they could not know, would soon be snatched away.\n\n\u201cI always heard about Cuba \u2026 and all this money that we lost and \u2018Maybe one day,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Chester says.\n\nSix decades later, that day may finally be nearing for Chester and others like her. To reach it, though, diplomacy will have to settle very old scores.\n\nAfter Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Cuba confiscated property belonging to thousands of American citizens and companies. Edmund and Enna Chester lost an 80-acre farm, thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of stock, and a Buick that, who knows, may still be plying Havana\u2019s streets.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed a law insisting Cuba pay for confiscated property, valued today at $7 billion, before lifting the U.S. embargo.\n\nThat went unmentioned in President Barack Obama\u2019s December announcement that the countries would resume diplomatic ties. Given Cuba\u2019s frail economy, experts say companies whose property was taken might settle for rights to do business there and move on.\n\nBut corporations don\u2019t cling to memories like families can. That\u2019s clear inside Chester\u2019s 832-square-foot bungalow, where her mother\u2019s gold-framed portrait watches over the yellowing property deed and worthless stock certificates \u2014 reminders that Cuba before Castro is history.\n\nBut bitterness over what came after lingers on.\n\n___\n\nInside a little-known federal agency, 5,900 claims files tally property that once belonged to Americans in Cuba.\n\nBut really, the claims are stories of lives left behind.\n\nEdmund Chester\u2019s story began when he returned to Louisville, Kentucky, from the Army and found work as a newspaper reporter. He taught himself Spanish and in 1929 was hired by The Associated Press, which dispatched him to Havana.\n\nChester spent a decade reporting from the Caribbean and Latin America, time that seeded two crucial relationships.\n\nThe first came after covering a 1933 revolt that put a former sergeant, Fulgencio Batista, in charge of Cuba\u2019s military. In the 1950s, when Batista was Cuba\u2019s dictator, he trusted Chester \u2014 by then a confidante and no longer a journalist \u2014 to write his biography.\n\nThe second began when Chester covered a 1939 earthquake in Chile and spotted Enna at a hotel swimming pool.\n\nIn 1940, CBS hired Chester as chief of radio broadcasting for Latin America. Eventually, he became the network\u2019s director of news in New York.\n\nChester returned to Cuba in 1952, buying a chain of radio stations on an island that was a U.S. economic outpost and a hedonistic getaway for Americans, including celebrities like Frank Sinatra.\n\nChester eventually sold the stations, but the family continued splitting time between Havana and Florida. He opened a public relations agency in Cuba and bought an 80-acre farm there. In 1957, the Chesters acquired $250,000 worth of Cuban Telephone Co shares.\n\nBut Edmund Chester, then Batista\u2019s speechwriter, grew uneasy as Castro gained ground.\n\n\u201cI agree that we ought to make (a) complete break with Cuba at the earliest possible moment,\u201d he wrote Enna in 1958.\n\nHe rejoined the family in Florida before Christmas. Batista fled days later, and Castro seized control.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union began shipping oil to Cuba, the U.S. ordered island refineries, most American-owned, not to process its archrival\u2019s crude.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Run from Cuba, Americans cling to claims for seized property", "title": "Run from Cuba, Americans cling to claims for seized property", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Run from Cuba, Americans cling to claims for seized property", "title": "Run from Cuba, Americans cling to claims for seized property", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/run_from_cuba_americans_cling_to_claims_for_seized_property/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/confiscated-by-castro.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Run from Cuba, Americans cling to claims for seized property", "title": "Run from Cuba, Americans cling to claims for seized property", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/confiscated-by-castro.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Adam Geller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a56\"", "article_summary": "After Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Cuba confiscated property belonging to thousands of American citizens and companies.\n___Inside a little-known federal agency, 5,900 claims files tally property that once belonged to Americans in Cuba.\nEdmund and Enna Chester lost an 80-acre farm, thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of stock, and a Buick that, who knows, may still be plying Havana\u2019s streets.\nIn 1996, Congress passed a law insisting Cuba pay for confiscated property, valued today at $7 billion, before lifting the U.S. embargo.\nWhen the Soviet Union began shipping oil to Cuba, the U.S. ordered island refineries, most American-owned, not to process its archrival\u2019s crude."}
