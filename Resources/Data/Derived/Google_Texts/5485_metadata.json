They wrapped themselves in the Canadian flag. They hugged and jumped together. A lifetime of ski training, countless trips to the ski area and too many contests locked in tense, parental anticipation boiled down to a single glorious moment. Their girls \u2014 who began skiing at age 2 \u2014 were Olympic medalists.\n\n\u201cThey made it,\u201d said Bruce, whose three daughters competed in the moguls finals. \u201cIs there something bigger than this? Is there anything bigger than this? No. This is the place. This is the place to be.\u201d\n\nIt had been three weeks since the parents had actually seen their daughters, who traveled straight from World Cup competition to Russia for the Olympics. That was too long a span.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely shaking right now,\u201d Johane said, after clenching her husband during each of her daughters\u2019 runs Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m so anxious to grab them and kiss them, because I didn\u2019t have the chance in the last three weeks. Bring me my babies! Bring them to me!\u201d\n\nDefending Olympic gold medalist Hannah Kearney \u2014 the top-ranked bump skier in the world \u2014 was on the other side of that emotional spectrum.\n\nThe 27-year-old American on Thursday qualified first for Saturday\u2019s finals. She was poised to become the first freestyle skier to earn consecutive Olympic golds in moguls skiing since the sport debuted in the 1992 Albertville Winter Games. She was on track for a repeat of her 2010 gold when she bobbled on the final run, her left ski caroming off a bump, breaking her form. She immediately regained her style and threw a smooth 360 on the bottom jump. But the bobble cost her.\n\n\u201cI made a huge mistake in my run, and you can\u2019t win in the Olympics when you make a huge mistake in your run,\u201d said a tearful Kearney, who earned bronze, the second U.S. medal of the day.\n\nShe said she showed mental strength cleaning up the rest of her run.\n\n\u201cIt could have been worse,\u201d she said, breaking down in tears. \u201cI\u2019ll have to treat this bronze as a reward for fighting \u2014 and not perfection.\u201d\n\nHer goal for the past four years has been Sochi. Now, she must reassess. Defend her World Cup title. Maybe squeeze another year of competition out of her knees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to know your Olympic career is over and it did not end as well as you were imagining,\u201d said the New Hampshire freestyle skier.\n\nJustine, the youngest of the three Dufour-Lapointe sisters at age 19, woke up nervous Saturday. As soon as she stood atop the 28-degree moguls course, the nerves faded.\n\n\u201cIt was clear. Everything was clear. I knew what I had to do,\u201d said the youngest freestyle skier to ever win Olympic gold. \u201cIt was simple. I had to pull all the heart I had inside, all the energy, all the training that I got over all those years, and I made it.\u201d\n\nChloe, 22, said the moment was something she and her sisters had imagined for four years. She agreed with her younger sister that the course \u201cneeded to be skied with emotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I skied it with my heart and the judges saw that tonight. My goal was to cross the line every single run that I did and be satisfied with what I had done,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cAnd tonight accomplished this, but I also got a silver medal and I also got to be on the podium with my sister.\u201d\n\nThe oldest Dufour-Lapointe sister, Maxime, was eliminated after the second of three final rounds Saturday. Steamboat Springs skier Eliza Outtrim finished sixth.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hannah Kearney finishes 3rd behind Canadian sisters in women\u2019s moguls", "title": "Hannah Kearney finishes 3rd behind Canadian sisters in women\u2019s moguls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/hannah-kearney-finishes-3rd-behind-canadian-sisters-in-womens-moguls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_013814_hannah-kearney.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_013814_hannah-kearney.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T13:40:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:45:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Justine, the youngest of the three Dufour-Lapointe sisters at age 19, woke up nervous Saturday.\nI knew what I had to do,\u201d said the youngest freestyle skier to ever win Olympic gold.\nBring them to me!\u201dDefending Olympic gold medalist Hannah Kearney \u2014 the top-ranked bump skier in the world \u2014 was on the other side of that emotional spectrum.\nShe was poised to become the first freestyle skier to earn consecutive Olympic golds in moguls skiing since the sport debuted in the 1992 Albertville Winter Games.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to know your Olympic career is over and it did not end as well as you were imagining,\u201d said the New Hampshire freestyle skier."}
