The first 911 call to the Denver Police dispatch center came in at 9:15 p.m. on April 16, 2012.

A witness reported a robbery that Monday night near Green Valley Ranch.

Two masked men had entered an O’Reilly Auto Parts Store, threatened a clerk in the store with guns and demanded money.

While Denver police were racing to the store at 5125 Chambers Road, a second report came in that shots had been fired.

Witnesses saw two people running from the store.

When police arrived they discovered a person lying on the ground outside the store.

An investigator from the Denver coroner’s office would later identify the victim as 22-year-old Pablo Del Rio Jr.

One store employee told a family member of the victim that the incident happened so fast, according to one media account.

During the robbery, one of the robbers shot Pablo in the chest.

Pablo chased after him before collapsing in the street.

The clerk had tried to escape and was shot after he bolted through the front doors while trying to flee.

The man was rushed to the University of Colorado Hospital, but he was later pronounced dead.

Police scoured the parking lot and neighborhood for evidence.
