Three people have been charged in connection to botched, unlicensed treatment given at a West Palm Beach cosmetic surgery center, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.

Juan Carlos Pinzon, 43, and Jorge Alarcon, 66, were not licensed to practice medicine in Florida in 2012, when a woman alleges procedures she received left her disfigured, according to the Sun Sentinel. The men are listed on the Health & Beauty Cosmetic Surgery center website as surgical assistants, but say they are physicians in Colombia, the report from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says.

The center director, Dr. William Marrocco, 55,and surgical assistant Monica Daza, 37, also were charged with unlicensed practice of a health care profession causing serious bodily injury.

Richard W. Fedora, 65, is facing charges of sexual misconduct by a psychotherapist and grand theft.
