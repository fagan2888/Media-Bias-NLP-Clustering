The certification represents a giant leap forward for healthcare.\n\nWith this certification, Parrish Medical Center is also introducing Parrish Healthcare.\n\nParrish Healthcare is a groundbreaking network of healthcare providers that includes:\n\n\u25a0 Parrish Medical Center, a Mayo Clinic Care Network member and one of America\u2019s most recognized hospitals for clinical quality, patient safety and healing environments\n\n\u25a0 Parrish Medical Group, National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) certified patient and family-centered medical homes\n\n\u25a0 Florida Health Network, a regional network of healthcare providers, insurers and others.\n\nParrish Medical Center took the lead in creating a regional network of healthcare providers who are committed to working together to practice evidence-based care and to engage in collaborative initiatives that result in superior levels of patient safety and quality outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\n\nWhat is Integrated Care?\n\nThe term integrated care is more than a healthcare buzzword. According to the January/February 2016 issue of Healthcare Executive magazine, \u201cit is a legal arrangement that permits providers to collaborate in improving quality and efficiency of care.\u201d That arrangement requires hospitals and physicians to commit to practicing evidence-based care and engaging in collaborative initiatives that support elimination of patient harm, achievement of high-quality outcomes and reduced costs. That\u2019s the textbook definition of what is formed with Parrish Healthcare. To Parrish, integrated care is also the art of healing, which integrates the precision of evidence-based medicine with the human (person and family) experience to improve lives through superior healthcare quality, safety, service and reduced costs.\n\nCollaboration between healthcare providers is preferable to costly competition that raises your costs and does nothing to improve care. Collaboration has instead been one of its strategic initiatives since even before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nParrish Healthcare\u2019s care integration includes primary and preventive care, outpatient services, inpatient acute hospital care, and post-acute care, including skilled nursing, rehabilitation, home health services, and palliative care.\n\nWhy does Integrated Care Certification matter?\n\nThe Joint Commission began offering Integrated Care Certification in July 2015 to recognize hospitals and ambulatory care settings that excel at integrating information-sharing, transitions of care, hand-off communications and other key activities as a patient moves between the hospital and outpatient care settings. The Joint Commission\u2019s overarching goal is interactive engagement of providers and patients throughout the care cycle. By integrating care across the continuum, this positively affects patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of The Joint Commission, I want to congratulate Parrish Medical Center on becoming the first organization in the country to earn the Integrated Care Certification,\u201d said Mark Pelletier RN, MS, Chief Operating Officer, The Joint Commission.\n\n\u201cThis certification recognizes Parrish Medical Center\u2019s dedication to improving patient outcomes with better coordinated care. It is also a benefit to the surrounding community Parrish serves, and it reflects its commitment to ensuring high-quality care transcends the walls of its hospitals.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Parrish Medical Group at ParrishMedGroup.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parrish Medical Center is the first in the United States to be awarded Integrated Care Certification from The Joint Commission, the nation\u2019s premier healthcare accrediting body.", "og": {"site_name": "SpaceCoast Living Magazine", "description": "Parrish Medical Center is the first in the United States to be awarded\r\nIntegrated Care Certification from The Joint Commission,\r\nthe nation\u2019s premier healthcare accrediting body.\r\nAccording to The Joint Commission, integrated care certification recognizes that Parrish Medical Center is improving patient outcomes with", "title": "A Giant Leap in Healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://spacecoastliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/parrish.jpg", "url": "http://spacecoastliving.com/giant-leap-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "0aa2909f0c96fad89d6a128f8b80c44d"}, "keywords": "health & wellness, hospital, mayo clinic, ncqa, parrish, parrish medical center", "article": {"section": "Health & Wellness", "tag": "parrish medical center", "published_time": "2016-04-28T11:40:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With this certification, Parrish Medical Center is also introducing Parrish Healthcare.\nThe certification represents a giant leap forward for healthcare.\nParrish Medical Center is the first in the United States to be awardedIntegrated Care Certification from The Joint Commission,the nation\u2019s premier healthcare accrediting body.\nCollaboration between healthcare providers is preferable to costly competition that raises your costs and does nothing to improve care.\nThat\u2019s the textbook definition of what is formed with Parrish Healthcare."}
