Their conversation focused on the president's embrace of liberalism in the face of a staunch GOP-controlled Congress. Pfeiffer's choice quote:\n\nWhenever we contemplate bold progressive action, whether that\u2019s the president's endorsement of marriage equality, or coming out strong on power-plant rules to reduce current pollution, on immigration, on net neutrality, you get a lot of hemming and hawing in advance about what this is going to mean: Is this going to alienate people? Is this going to hurt the president's approval ratings? What will this mean in red states?\n\nThere's never been a time when we\u2019ve taken progressive action and regretted it.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "The interview focuses on the president's embrace of liberalism in the face of a staunch GOP controlled Congress.", "title": "Key Obama adviser: \"There's never been a time when we've taken progressive action and regretted it\"", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/03/obama-liberal-white-house", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/obamaquote.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Key Obama adviser: \"There's never been a time when we've taken progressive action and regretted it\"", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/03/obama-liberal-white-house", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/obamaquote.png", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/obamaquote.png"}, "creator": "eenayo", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Obama", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb78d\"", "article_summary": "There's never been a time when we\u2019ve taken progressive action and regretted it.\nHere to jump start your weekend is a \"Quote of the Week,\" taken from Jonathan Chait's interview with longtime Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who worked closely with president from the 2008 campaign until his resignation last week.\nTheir conversation focused on the president's embrace of liberalism in the face of a staunch GOP-controlled Congress.\nIs this going to hurt the president's approval ratings?\nWhat will this mean in red states?"}
