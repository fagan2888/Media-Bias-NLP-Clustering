At the same time, conservative Christian leaders are fixated on lording it over women, queers and kids. Consider the following sample from spring 2015:\n\nChristianity\u2019s Anti-Marketing Team?\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling disgusted, you\u2019re not alone. From the standpoint of wooing converts or even inspiring the faithful to stay faithful, the sex-obsessed behavior of high-profile patriarchal Christians is about as effective as the U.S. Army\u2019s attempt to win hearts and minds with drone strikes. I\u2019m not trying to be poetic here\u2014in the last decade or so, the percent of Americans who self-identify as Christians has dropped from 85 percent to 70 percent, and young people point to the culture wars as a key reason Christianity turns them off.\n\nGuess who\u2019s leaving the fastest? Women. Moderate Christians find themselves apologizing for their co-religionists, trying desperately to overcome the perception (fostered largely by biblical literalists and conservative Catholics) that Christians are judgmental, control-freakish, sex-obsessed hypocrites.\n\nSo, why don\u2019t the anti-marketers back off? After all, Evangelicals center their faith around a verse known as the \u201cGreat Commission\u201d \u2013 Go into the world and make disciples of every creature. And the word \u201ccatholic\u201d means universal, literally. The Catholic Church has spent centuries sending a salesforce of missionaries into countries and cultures around the world to promote their product. If your prime directive is win converts, it seems obvious you should lead with universal feel-good platitudes, not some archaic version of Machos rule! Females, fags, and five-year-olds drool!\n\nSome people say the best evidence against the Bible\u2019s God is that his public relations team is so inept. But I don\u2019t think the problem is incompetence on the part of God\u2019s spokesmen. I think they are stuck.\n\nCaught in an Iron Age Trap\n\nMany moderate Christians see the Bible not as the literally perfect word of God, but a record of humanity\u2019s struggle to understand what is real and what is good. They find unique value in the Christian tradition and the model of Jesus but may also acknowledge value in other spiritual traditions while recognizing the human handprints on the biblical texts.\n\nBy contrast, biblical literalists declare the Good Book to be the complete and timeless word of God, essentially dictated by God to the authors. Having made an idol out of the Bible, they have little choice but to promote the Iron Age worldview of the Bible writers. And in this worldview\u2014childish taunts aside\u2014machos do rule. God gave Adam a \u201chelpmeet\u201d named Eve-not-Steve, and to punish her for seeking independent knowledge swore that Adam would rule over her and she would bear his children and it would hurt like hell. As later Bible texts encode in law and illustrate in story, those children are Man\u2019s property\u2014assets he can use for labor, send to war, sell into slavery, trade for political alliance, or even sacrifice as a burnt offering. In this view, consent is not a thing. Nowhere does the Bible, Old Testament or new, suggest that a woman\u2019s consent is needed or even desired prior to intercourse. And for a man to have sex with another man violates the whole procreative hierarchy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're hardly unique to the Duggars.
