Al Sharpton on Monday blasted Hollywood for being too white, after a series of leaked emails revealed racially insensitive dialogue between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and movie producer Scott Rudin.

“Right now, Hollywood is like the Rocky Mountains, the higher up it goes, the whiter it looks,” Mr. Sharpton told TMZ Monday night.

The civil rights leader said he was “very offended” by the emails — leaked in a massive hack attack on Sony — between Ms. Pascal and Mr. Rudin, who joked back and forth about what movies President Obama presumably likes. “Django,” “12 Years a Slave,” and other films starring mostly black actors were suggested by both executives. They later apologized in separate statements explaining that they were just goofing around and meant no harm by it.

Mr. Sharpton said he’s going to give Ms. Pascal “a lot of heck about the hack” when they sit down to the discuss the issue sometime in the near future with the Urban League’s Marc Morial and the NAACP’s Cornell Brooks.

“We’ll determine there whether we are going to join calls for her resignation, or whether she is going to really, seriously going to deal with the fact that Hollywood really reflects a lot of what was said in that conversation,” he told TMZ. “There’s no blacks with any real decision-making power. There’s no diversity at the top. This could be a time to change Hollywood.”
