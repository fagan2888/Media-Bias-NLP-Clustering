He didn\u2019t know the ATF was running guns into Mexico; didn\u2019t know the NSA was spying on the German chancellor; didn\u2019t know the Obamacare website was a disaster; didn\u2019t know the IRS was targeting conservative groups.\n\nWith every scandal, the president \u2014 the CEO of the United States, if you will \u2014 said he first learned about it in the papers. If he were head of Apple or IBM, he\u2019d have been fired years ago, because in business, it\u2019s your job to know, and ignorance is, frankly, even worse than failing. Fail = fired.\n\nEach time Mr. Obama is faced with a scandal, he does three things: First, he expresses outrage (he is, after all, a man only of words, not deeds); then, he blames his predecessor, George W. Bush; finally, he wraps the entire mess up in bureaucratic red tape \u2014 a blue-ribbon investigation.\n\nThat last move, Mr. Obama\u2019s go-to dodge, does two things: No one, not even the president himself, can speak on the matter (\u201cIt\u2019s under investigation and we should hold off on any \u2026 \u201c); And second, a lengthy probe means Americans will be distracted and move on by the time any final finding is reached.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened with Fast and Furious, the gun-running scandal that eventually prompted Congress to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt. What did the president do? Nothing. Not a thing. All the other scandals have followed the same template.\n\nWhen the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed in Benghazi, Libya, Mr. Obama and his minions refused to comment for months, citing the \u201cinvestigation.\u201d That led to then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton uttering her infamous line when forced to testify before Congress months later: \u201cWhat difference at this point does it make?\u201d\n\nThis latest of many scandals is exactly the same. Dozens of America\u2019s veterans died waiting for health care, and reports have emerged that government employees actively covered up the scandal. So, Mr. Obama deftly dodged the press for weeks, sending out his flack Jay \u201cCircus\u201d Carney to cover for him with his pals in the White House briefing room.\n\nThen, the president held a meeting with the prime culprit in the latest scandal \u2014 behind closed doors. Which, of course, led to the press conference in which the milquetoast commander in chief expressed his outrage, as he did Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear allegations of misconduct \u2014 any misconduct \u2014 whether it\u2019s allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books, I will not stand for it. Not as Commander-in-Chief,\u201d the piqued president peeped.\n\nWhile Mr. Obama harangued Bush over the VA as far back as 2007, pledging to fix the system if elected president, more than five years in office later he once again blamed his predecessor.\n\n\u201cSome of the problems with respect to how veterans are able to access the benefits that they\u2019ve earned, that\u2019s not a new issue,\u201d he said. \u201cSo today, I want every veteran to know we are going to fix whatever is wrong.\u201d\n\nLastly, the president announced \u2014 The Probe. \u201cBut we have to let the investigators do their job and get to the bottom of what happened,\u201d he said. Queried by reporters, he dodged: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of the IG report or the other investigations that are being done.\u201d\n\nJust like in Fast and Furious, the IRS scandal, the phone records scandal, the spying scandal, the Obamacare website scandal, no heads rolled. No one was ever held accountable, least of all the president \u2014 the CEO.\n\nBut asked who is to blame for this latest scandal, Mr. Obama said Wednesday: \u201cYou know, the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me, as the president and commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nAnd he pledged, once again: \u201cI am going to make sure that there is accountability throughout the system \u2014 after I get the full report.\u201d\n\nSo, maybe he\u2019ll fire himself?\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, the American people should hold him accountable and fire him, quick.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
