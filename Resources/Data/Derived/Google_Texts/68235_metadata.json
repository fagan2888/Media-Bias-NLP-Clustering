The comment period on the recommendations ends May 18.\n\nThe USPSTF's recommendations contradict those of the American Cancer Society, which recommends that every woman age 40 and over get a mammogram every year. Such screening is currently provided at no out-of-pocket cost for most insured women.\n\n\n\n\"The USPSTF is working to balance the lifesaving benefits of breast cancer screening against the potential risks for overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment for lower-risk women,\" said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere Health. \"By linking the ACA rules to USPSTF decisions, coverage for preventive services will continue to evolve as new research and evidence becomes available.\"\n\n\n\nRead MoreHow to save $500M in Rx spending?
