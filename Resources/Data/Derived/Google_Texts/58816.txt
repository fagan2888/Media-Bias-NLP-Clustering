Sunday, the family of Diamoney Green held a wake to remember her life.

"I remember her laughing, make you laugh, and loved to dance and cheer," Terris Green, Diamoney's father said.

At Timerberland High School, Diamoney Green played volleyball, basketball, and soccer and was a cheerleader.

Deputies say last weekend, Diamoney Green was shot to death by her boyfriend, 21-year old Brandon Early, in her apartment in Columbia before he killed himself.

As a 20-year-old student at USC, Diamoney Green majored in criminal justice.

"She just wanted to be like her dad," Demetria Smalls, Diamoney Green's cousin, said.

Green's father is a SLED agent in Columbia and also works as an officer in St. Stephen.

"I was almost home when I got the call,” Terris Green said. "They just basically said there's been an incident with my daughter and her friend."

He says being in law enforcement since 2006, he knew how the phone call would end.

"When they mentioned the units from Richland County sheriff's office that were responding, I knew it was bad. I knew it was bad,” Terris Green said.

The family says they never sensed any trouble between Diamoney Green and her boyfriend.

She was also a mother, and her daughter Caleah-Abagail turns three on Tuesday.

The family said they don't have any anger or resentment for Early's family.

"I'm not mad at Brandon,” Terris Green said. “I don't have any bad feelings towards the family. I'm not going to let the pull of a trigger or the pierce of a bullet deter my faith in God."

Diamoney's funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. Monday morning. A vigil will also be held Monday at the University of South Carolina's campus. You can donate to the family through the funeral site.
