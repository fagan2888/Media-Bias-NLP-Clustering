(NASDAQ: PINC), a leading healthcare improvement company, and Oncobiologics, Inc., a clinical-stage U.S. developer and manufacturer of biosimilar pharmaceuticals, are working together to accelerate the industry\u2019s understanding of high-quality, cost-efficient biosimilars and advance the adoption of these complex drugs.\n\nIn addition, Oncobiologics has entered into an agreement with Premier\u2019s real-world research and analytics division, Premier Research Services, to leverage the scale, expertise, and integrated quality and cost information across Premier\u2019s alliance of approximately 3,600 U.S. hospitals. Premier and Oncobiologics will also conduct analyses to advise Oncobiologics\u2019 decision making regarding market dynamics.\n\nBiosimilars \u2013 also known as follow-on biologics \u2013 are innovative treatments for chronic and sometimes life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, HIV and rheumatoid arthritis. Comprised of complex molecules made from living organisms, biosimilars can increase the number of options available to patients while offering billions of dollars in overall industry savings when compared to the cost of their biologic parent drugs, which often carry price tags from $30,000 up to $1 million over the course of treatment. According to research, biologic and other specialty drugs are projected to account for 50 percent of total U.S. drug expenditures by 2018 even though just 1 to 3 percent of the population uses these therapies.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of biologics is having a profound effect on patients and providers alike,\u201d said Premier COO Michael J. Alkire. \u201cPremier believes in the power of competition as the best means to bring down prices while preserving a healthy market, and biosimilars present a key pathway to do just that. However, providers need a better understanding of these new products before they can begin prescribing them to patients. We look forward to collaborating with Oncobiologics and our members to develop best practices around the optimal use of these cost-effective treatments.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oncobiologics CEO Pankaj Mohan, Ph.D., \u201cOncobiologics\u2019 primary goal is to efficiently provide high-quality, commercially attractive biosimilars to providers and patients. This collaboration with Premier will allow us to leverage real-world evidence to better understand the needs of health systems and the patients they serve as we work to develop treatments that can increase care value.\u201d\n\nThe organizations will also work closely to inform providers, prescribers and the public sector on complexities involved in bringing biosimilar drugs to market.\n\nLegislation in the Affordable Care Act allows the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve follow-on biologics demonstrated to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-licensed biological product.\n\n\u201cPremier has a long history of working with both the private and public sectors to promote solutions that address drug pricing and shortages,\u201d Alkire said. \u201cGetting the policy right is a critical first step to unleash the potential of biosimilars to improve everyday quality of life and save lives.\u201d\n\nThe financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\n\nAbout Oncobiologics, Inc. and its BioSymphony\u2122 Platform\n\nOncobiologics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing, manufacturing and commercializing complex biosimilar therapeutics.
