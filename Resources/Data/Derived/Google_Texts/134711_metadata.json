A court dismissed murder and corruption charges first brought against Hosni Mubarak after the Arab Spring revolution created a Muslim Brotherhood government that attempted to impose Islamist rule in Cairo. The military overthrew the Mohamed Morsi regime and installed its top general to replace Morsi, and now a court has let Mubarak off the hook:\n\nAn Egyptian court on Saturday dismissed murder charges against former President Hosni Mubarak in connection with the killing of hundreds of protesters in the 2011 uprising that ended his nearly three-decade rule, citing the \u201cinadmissibility\u201d of the case due to a technicality. The ruling marks another major setback for the young activists who spearheaded the Arab Spring-inspired uprising nearly four years ago \u2014 many of whom are now in jail or have withdrawn from politics. It will likely reinforce the perception that Mubarak\u2019s autocratic state remains in place, albeit led by a new president, former military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Saturday\u2019s verdict concludes Mubarak\u2019s retrial along with his two sons, his security chief and six top security commanders, who were all acquitted. Also acquitted was businessman Hussein Salem, a longtime Mubarak friend tried in absentia.\n\nThe court didn\u2019t consider the dismissal an endorsement of Mubarak\u2019s regime, but suggested that he should have been allowed to retire rather than get hauled before a tribunal because of his advanced age:\n\nPresiding judge Mahmoud al-Rashidi made clear that the dismissal of the charges did not absolve Mubarak of the corruption and \u201cfeebleness\u201d of the latter years of his 29-year rule and praised the 2011 uprising, saying that its goals \u2013 freedom, bread and social justice \u2013 were legitimate. Al-Rashidi said Mubarak, like any other human, erred at times and suggested that his old age should have spared him a criminal trial. He also cited Mubarak\u2019s long years in public service and what he called the enshrinement of \u201cconstitutional legitimacy\u201d following the ouster of Mubarak\u2019s successor, the Islamist Mohammed Morsi.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood protested the dismissal, and warned that the outcome will change again once they return to power in a new revolution:\n\n\u201cThe fascist putschists may continue to summon Mubarak\u2019s gang back to life but this will not change the reality on the ground,\u201d said Abdullah El-Haddad from the London Muslim Brotherhood press office. \u201cThe next trial for Mubarak and his corrupt cronies will be a revolutionary one. Justice will prevail and the revolution will have its say,\u201d said El-Haddad. Hefni agrees that another revolution is inevitable. \u201c[Al-Sisi\u2019s] character is his doom. Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are increasing. The more injustice, the more the truth becomes clear.\u201d Al-Sisi may be winning the police and the military, but he is losing the support of the people, said Hefni. \u201cThere are daily/weekly protests all over Egypt. Protesters are defiant, determined and they welcome anyone who wants to join,\u201d El-Haddad added.\n\nIronically, Morsi remains in prison, facing similar charges related to protester deaths during his short reign in Cairo. Will a court in the military-supported government find similar technical impediments to convictions as this court did with Mubarak? I\u2019d bet no.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Technically, the military doesn\u2019t want him in prison.", "title": "Video: Egyptian court dismisses charges against Mubarak on a \u201ctechnicality\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/29/video-egyptian-court-dismisses-charges-against-mubarak-on-a-technicality/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T19:31:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-29T16:25:21+00:00"}, "keywords": "Arab Spring, corruption, Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, Mohamed Morsi, Muslim Brotherhood,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Will a court in the military-supported government find similar technical impediments to convictions as this court did with Mubarak?\nA court dismissed murder and corruption charges first brought against Hosni Mubarak after the Arab Spring revolution created a Muslim Brotherhood government that attempted to impose Islamist rule in Cairo.\nSupporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are increasing.\nVideo: Egyptian court dismisses charges against Mubarak on a \u201ctechnicality\u201dposted at 2:31 pm on November 29, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyIf anyone harbored doubts about the re-emergence of military rule in Egypt, the decision to acquit its former dictator should remove all of the blinkers still remaining.\nIronically, Morsi remains in prison, facing similar charges related to protester deaths during his short reign in Cairo."}
