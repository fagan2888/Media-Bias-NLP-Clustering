GRAND RAPIDS, MI - Saint Mary's Foundation is marking its 50-year anniversary with a new office space that bears the name of longtime donors John and Marie Canepa.

The foundation has awarded more than $65 million to projects and services at Mercy Health Saint Mary's since it was founded in 1964 as the Doran Foundation for Medical Education, hospital officials said. It has backed capital campaigns for the Lacks Cancer Center, Hauenstein Neurosciences Center and Sophia's House.

The new headquarters occupies a three-story, red-brick house at 307 Jefferson Ave. SE, across the street from the hospital, and includes office space and areas for donor gatherings and special events.

A dedication ceremony Thursday, May 15, for the new office space was attended by John Canepa, retired Old Kent Bank president, and his wife, Marie, as well as foundation board members and donors and hospital administrators.
