That includes all services essential for national security and public safety\u2014such as the military and law enforcement\u2014as well as mandatory government payments such as Social Security and veterans\u2019 benefits.\n\nThe key fact, as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) itself has said, is that when there is a short-term lapse in appropriations, \u201cthe federal Government will not be truly \u2018shut down\u2019\u2026because Congress has itself provided that some activities of Government should continue.\u201d In fact, any claims that not passing a CR will result in a \u201cshutting down\u201d of the government \u201cis an entirely inaccurate description\u201d according to the DOJ.[1]\n\nSuch a lapse in funding would be neither catastrophic nor unprecedented, but it would pare down government services to those most essential for \u201cthe safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d That would not include the hundreds of billions of dollars in the federal budget that are constantly squandered and wasted on frivolous, unnecessary, and unneeded programs.\n\nWhat the Law Says\n\nThe effect of a veto of appropriated funding by the White House or the failure of the Senate to pass a CR is governed by the Constitution, federal law, DOJ legal opinions, and planning memoranda issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nUnder Article I of the Constitution, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d This constitutional limitation is implemented by the federal Antideficiency Act (ADA), which makes it illegal for federal officials to spend money in excess of appropriations or to obligate the government to enter into contracts before an appropriation has been passed to pay for such a commitment.\n\nThe ADA also prohibits the federal government from accepting voluntary services, which is why federal employees (except those deemed \u201cessential\u201d) have to be furloughed\u2014they cannot volunteer their services during a shutdown even if they want to.[2] The ADA contains a very expansive exception, however, \u201cfor emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d\n\nAlthough that exception has been broadly interpreted by the OMB and the DOJ[3] to give executive agencies wide discretion over how to spend their remaining funds, the statute was amended by Congress in 1990 in response to a 1981 opinion issued by Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti to make it clear that the term emergencies does \u201cnot include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d\n\nA 1995 opinion by the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel over that amendment confirmed the earlier DOJ opinions, although it slightly narrowed the interpretation of \u201cthe safety of human life or the protection of property\u201d to mean that they must be \u201ccompromised in some significant degree\u201d by the lack of funding.[4]\n\nA 2011 OMB memorandum also confirmed that the executive branch still views those DOJ opinions as establishing the guidelines for the continued operation of the government during a lapse in funding.[5]\n\nThe OMB refers to those government functions that can continue to operate because they meet the emergency definition as \u201cexcepted\u201d functions. Federal employees who \u201care needed for the performance of those \u2018excepted\u2019 functions\u201d can continue to be employed even in the absence of a CR or an appropriations bill.[6] In fact, the OMB says that federal employees can continue to work who are necessary not just to protect life and property but to perform activities \u201cexpressly authorized by law\u201d or \u201cnecessarily implied by law,\u201d an extremely broad standard.[7]\n\nMany \u201cEssential\u201d Functions\n\nAs a recent report by the Congressional Research Service[8] points out, an OMB memorandum from 1981 lays out examples of the many government functions of federal agencies that may continue during a funding lapse:\n\nNational security, including the conduct of foreign relations essential to the national security or the safety of life and property;\n\nBenefit payments and the performance of contact obligations under no-year or multi-year appropriations or other funds remaining available for those purposes;\n\nMedical care of inpatients and emergency outpatient care and activities essential for the safe use of food, drugs, and hazardous materials;\n\nAir traffic control and other transportation safety functions;\n\nBorder and coastal protection and surveillance;\n\nProtection of federal lands, buildings, waterways, and other property of the U.S.;\n\nCare of prisoners and others in federal custody;\n\nLaw enforcement and criminal investigations;\n\nEmergency and disaster assistance;\n\nActivities essential to the preservation of the money and banking system of the U.S., including borrowing and tax collection;\n\nProduction of power and maintenance of the power distribution system; and\n\nProtection of research property.\n\nIn its 2011 memorandum, the OMB also provided other instances of \u201cexcepted\u201d situations where federal agencies would continue to function. For example, operations where a \u201cstatute or other legal requirement expressly authorizes an agency to obligate funds in advance of appropriations\u201d such as a Civil War\u2013era law that \u201cprovides authority to the Defense Department to contract for necessary clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation or medical and hospital supplies\u201d or another federal law authorizing the Bureau of Indian Affairs to continue to contract for goods and supplies.[9]\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s 1995 opinion again confirmed that essential government benefit payments continue because they operate \u201cunder indefinite appropriations provisions that do not require passage of annual appropriations legislation.\u201d It pointed out that \u201cSocial Security is a prominent example of a program that operates under an indefinite appropriation. In such cases, benefit checks continue to be honored by the Treasury, because there is no lapse in the relevant appropriation.\u201d\n\nAnd all government employees necessary to continue to make those benefit payments will continue to be employed to do so even though their salaries would normally be paid through the CR because they are \u201cnecessary to disburse the Social Security benefits that operate under indefinite appropriations.\u201d This same rule would obviously apply to other such government benefits such as Medicare and for military veterans, as well as \u201cthe performance of emergency services that continue under that separate exception.\u201d[10]\n\nThe 2011 OMB memorandum confirmed that there would be no cessation in any government functions necessary for President Obama to carry out his \u201cconstitutional duties and powers (e.g., Commander-in-Chief or conducting foreign relations).\u201d So, for example, the President would be able to continue his very extensive (and very expensive) foreign travels in the interests of \u201cconducting foreign relations,\u201d even if he decides to cause a lapse in government funding with a veto of a CR.\n\nRegarding the President\u2019s duty as commander in chief, the Department of Defense has issued guidance outlining that \u201cthe legal authority for critical military operations to continue\u201d is clear. Among the units and activities exempt from a funding lapse are \u201cforward based combat, combat support and combat service support units.\u201d[11] So \u201coperations such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan would continue, units preparing for deployment would carry on their training and other deployment preparations, and activities needed to support operations and training would continue.\u201d There would also be no suspension or furlough of \u201cunits identified for deployment in plans for major regional contingencies\u201d as well as \u201cunits assigned to carry out strategic nuclear operations.\u201d[12]\n\nRecent History\n\nThere have been 17 funding gaps since 1977 ranging in duration from one to 21 days.[13] In November 1995, when President Bill Clinton vetoed a CR and there was a funding gap for five days, only about 800,000 out of a total of 4.475 million federal employees were furloughed.\n\nOnly about 280,000 federal employees were furloughed during the December 1995 to January 1996 funding gap.[14] During this time, the Social Security Administration initially retained about 5,000 employees and then called back an additional 50,000 employees within three days to continue paying benefits and processing new claims, keeping over 80 percent of the total employees of the agency employed despite the lack of a CR.[15]\n\nNot Much Shut Down\n\nBased on past experience, one may safely conclude that a very large number of federal employees would continue to provide services during any government \u201cshut down,\u201d and essential services necessary to safeguard the country will continue, as will the crucial benefit payments on which many Americans depend.\n\nBut this would still not allow the full, continued implementation of Obamacare. As outlined in a prior Heritage Issue Brief, \u201c[E]ven if a government shutdown occurs without a defunding bill, while the Administration may have some funding available from other sources to continue to implement parts of Obamacare that fall within exceptions to the ADA, it would not be able to legally implement all of the many different parts of the law, and it is doubtful it would have the funds to implement all of the law.\u201d[16]There are many parts of the law that could not be deemed \u201cemergencies\u201d even under the broad reading given that term by the executive branch. And the more parts of the law that are stopped, the better off the American people will be.\n\nHans A. von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a former Justice Department lawyer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Crucial services will continue without interruption.", "title": "What happens during a government \u201cshutdown\u201d?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/United_States_Capitol_Building-630x418-480x318.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/19/what-happens-during-a-government-shutdown/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Crucial services will continue without interruption.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/United_States_Capitol_Building-630x418-480x318.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Crucial services will continue without interruption."}}, "article_summary": "The ADA also prohibits the federal government from accepting voluntary services, which is why federal employees (except those deemed \u201cessential\u201d) have to be furloughed\u2014they cannot volunteer their services during a shutdown even if they want to.\nOnly about 280,000 federal employees were furloughed during the December 1995 to January 1996 funding gap.\nThat includes all services essential for national security and public safety\u2014such as the military and law enforcement\u2014as well as mandatory government payments such as Social Security and veterans\u2019 benefits.\nIn its 2011 memorandum, the OMB also provided other instances of \u201cexcepted\u201d situations where federal agencies would continue to function.\nFederal employees who \u201care needed for the performance of those \u2018excepted\u2019 functions\u201d can continue to be employed even in the absence of a CR or an appropriations bill."}
