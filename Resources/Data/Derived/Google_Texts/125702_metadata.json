(NSDQ:PINC) says business is booming thanks to the Affordable Care Act and newly passed legislation reforming the Medicare provider payment process.\n\nThe North Carolina-based group purchasing organization said that both pieces of legislation are pushing providers away from fee-for-service payment models and toward value-based healthcare. Those systems, which rely on bundled payments based on performance, are pushing healthcare providers to sign on to the health management strategies Premier offers, the company said.\n\nPremier said it inked 5 deals this year with providers in New York, Maryland and Arizona to develop clinically integrated care networks, and also put into place Medicare shared savings and state-based Medicaid payment models.\n\nSeparately, Premier is working with a number of New York hospitals to help them develop and launch alternative payment models through the state\u2019s Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program, a Medicaid program designed to focus on health management and performance based payments.\n\nWes Champion, senior vice president of Premier Performance Partners, said providers realize that now is the time to change their systems.\n\n\"Premier members understand the need to build better partnerships with physicians to succeed under the new physician payment system,\" Champion said in prepared remarks. \"Alternative payment models take time to structure and implement. For those that have not started, it\u2019s clear that now is the time to build these capabilities.\"", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "og": {"site_name": "MassDevice", "title": "GPOs: Premier says ACA is pushing providers toward value-based healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.massdevice.com/sites/default/wp-content/uploads/logos/premierlogo3x2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-11T12:06:34-04:00", "url": "http://www.massdevice.com/gpos-premier-says-aca-pushing-providers-toward-value-based-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "", "creator": "@MassDevice", "image": "http://www.massdevice.com/sites/default/wp-content/uploads/logos/premierlogo3x2.jpg", "title": "GPOs: Premier says ACA is pushing providers toward value-based healthcare \u2013 MassDevice", "site": "@MassDevice", "card": "summary"}, "com.silverpop.cothost": "pod2.ibmmarketingcloud.com", "google-site-verification": "3L7z8HME5RuF4m9HDRNebfZxyJWuiEr5kr1xNv5U-Ng", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/massdevicejournal", "section": "Healthcare Reform", "tag": "Value-based healthcare", "published_time": "2015-05-11T12:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T12:06:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42d8\"", "article_summary": "The North Carolina-based group purchasing organization said that both pieces of legislation are pushing providers away from fee-for-service payment models and toward value-based healthcare.\nWes Champion, senior vice president of Premier Performance Partners, said providers realize that now is the time to change their systems.\nThose systems, which rely on bundled payments based on performance, are pushing healthcare providers to sign on to the health management strategies Premier offers, the company said.\n\"Premier members understand the need to build better partnerships with physicians to succeed under the new physician payment system,\" Champion said in prepared remarks.\n\"Alternative payment models take time to structure and implement."}
