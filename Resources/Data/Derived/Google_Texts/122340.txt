An 18-year-old in Muscatine has been accused of posting nude photos of minors on Twitter.

Muscatine County Attorney Alan R. Ostergren says Briar Jared Todd was arrested Wednesday. He faces five counts of sexual exploitation of a minor. Court records do not list an attorney.

Investigators say Todd used an account on Twitter to post five separate photos of nude female minors. Information on the account identified each minor by name.

Todd is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 15.
