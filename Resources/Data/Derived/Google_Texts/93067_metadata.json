(AP) \u2014 Wildlife officials have divvied up how many grizzly bears could be killed by hunters in the Yellowstone region of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho as the states seek control of a species shielded from hunting for the past 40 years, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press.\n\nThe region\u2019s grizzlies currently are under federal protection, but that could change in coming months, turning control over to the states. A draft agreement detailing the states\u2019 plans for the animals was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe agreement puts no limits on grizzly bear hunting outside a 19,300-square mile management zone centered on Yellowstone National Park. Inside the zone, which includes wilderness and forest lands adjacent to the park, hunters in Wyoming would get a 58 percent share of the harvest, a reflection that it\u2019s home to the bulk of the region\u2019s bears. Montana would get 34 percent and Idaho 8 percent.\n\nThe management zone has an estimated 717 bears. There is no estimate for how many live just outside the area, although biologists say the number is increasing as grizzly bears expand into new habitat.\n\nWildlife advocates say the bear population remains too small to withstand much hunting. That\u2019s a particular concern given the large numbers of bears already dying, including during surprise run-ins with hunters and after livestock depredations that prompt officials to trap and kill problem bears.\n\nIn 2015, at least 59 Yellowstone-area grizzlies were believed to have been killed or trapped and removed by government agencies. That\u2019s the most since the animal was given protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1975.\n\nDespite the deaths, state officials say the grizzly population has recovered from excessive hunting and trapping that exterminated grizzlies across most of the U.S. in the early 1900s. The officials have increased pressure on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe in recent months to revoke the animal\u2019s threatened status.", "article_metadata": {"description": "APNewsBreak: States divvy up Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt", "title": "APNewsBreak: States divvy up Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "APNewsBreak: States divvy up Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt", "title": "APNewsBreak: States divvy up Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/04/apnewsbreak_states_divvy_up_yellowstone_area_grizzly_hunt/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/hunting-grizzlies.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "APNewsBreak: States divvy up Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt", "title": "APNewsBreak: States divvy up Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/hunting-grizzlies.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Brown", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The agreement puts no limits on grizzly bear hunting outside a 19,300-square mile management zone centered on Yellowstone National Park.\nThere is no estimate for how many live just outside the area, although biologists say the number is increasing as grizzly bears expand into new habitat.\nThe region\u2019s grizzlies currently are under federal protection, but that could change in coming months, turning control over to the states.\nDespite the deaths, state officials say the grizzly population has recovered from excessive hunting and trapping that exterminated grizzlies across most of the U.S. in the early 1900s.\nIn 2015, at least 59 Yellowstone-area grizzlies were believed to have been killed or trapped and removed by government agencies."}
