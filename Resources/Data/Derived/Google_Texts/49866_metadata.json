The two Madisons will meet in the round of 16, meaning one of them will become a first-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist.\n\nThe last time four or more American women reached the second week in Australia was in 2003, when Keys\u2019 coach Lindsay Davenport was playing and Serena beat Venus in one of their Williams-sister finals. That can\u2019t happen this time, because they\u2019re in the same half of the draw.\n\nSerena Williams, who is aiming for her sixth Australian and 19th Grand Slam title, has long been the standard bearer and has been asked all too often what has happened to the depth of U.S. women\u2019s tennis.\n\n\u201cI think American women\u2019s tennis has come so far. We have so many options now, which is so great because for years I had to answer the question: \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,'\u201d the No. 1-ranked Williams said after her 4-6, 6-2, 6-0 win over No. 26-ranked Elina Svitolina. \u201cJust so many American players that are playing really, really well. So much to look forward to.\u201d\n\nNone more, in her mind, than Venus\u2019 return to the fourth round at a major for the first time since Wimbledon in 2011.\n\nWhen Serena walked onto Rod Laver Arena on Saturday, Venus was down a set and a break on nearby Margaret Court Arena. Venus, who was diagnosed with an auto-immune condition called Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in 2011 and has struggled at the highest level ever since, rallied for a 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-1 win over Camila Giorgi. And that was powerful inspiration.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, she\u2019s been through so much with her illness, with everything that she\u2019s had to do. Gosh, if she can do it, I\u2019m perfectly healthy, I\u2019m fine. I should be able to do it, too,'\u201d Serena Williams said.\n\nOn the men\u2019s side, top-ranked Novak Djokovic and defending champion Stan Wawrinka advanced with straight-set wins, while U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori and Wimbledon semifinalist Milos Raonic continued their quests for a first major title.\n\nFour-time Australian Open winner Djokovic beat Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (8), 6-3, 6-4 in the first night match on Rod Laver, then asked the crowd of 15,000 to help him sing Happy Birthday to his mother, Dijana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s birthday, can you sing happy birthday?\u201d he asked the crowd. He sang the whole song live on camera and then left the court to start preparing for a match against Gilles Muller, who beat No. 19 John Isner 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6), 6-4.\n\nWawrinka had a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over Jarkko Nieminen and will have a score to settle in the next round against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, who beat him in the first round of the French Open last year.\n\nNo. 5 Nishikori beat Steve Johnson 6-7 (7), 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 and will next meet former French Open finalist David Ferrer, who struggled to finish off No. 18 Gilles Simon in four sets. No. 8 Raonic fired 22 aces in a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over Benjamin Becker and will next play No. 12 Feliciano Lopez.\n\nSerena Williams will have to be top of her game when she meets No. 24 Garbine Muguruza, who beat her in the second round at the French Open last year.\n\nIn the other fourth-round match in that quarter, two-time champion Victoria Azarenka will meet 2014 finalist Dominika Cibulkova.\n\nAzarenka, who is unseeded because of an injury-interrupted 2014, had a 6-4, 6-4 win over No. 25 Barbora Zahlavova Strycova, while Cibulkova beat No. 19 Alize Cornet 7-5, 6-2.\n\nVenus Williams was delighted after her win, beaming a smile as she turned to wave to all sides of the stadium and doing some dance moves to the loud music. She said Serena had helped her, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the fortunate relationship to be able to motivate each other and grow from each other,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 34-year-old, seven-time major winner is determined to make sure her run doesn\u2019t end in the next round against sixth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska.\n\n\u201cI like to win titles \u2026 that\u2019s what I play for,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
