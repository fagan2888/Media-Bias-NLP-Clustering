WASHINGTON -- One by one, House Republican leaders lined up on Tuesday to trash the president's health care law.

The Affordable Care Act "continues to wreak havoc" on families, warned House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the health care law is "plagued with problems," while House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) cited a poll suggesting people who know more about it are less inclined to support it.

But their criticisms came just as the White House unveiled new statistics showing exploding interest in the Obamacare enrollment website. One million people visited healthcare.gov on Monday -- shattering previous levels of visits to the site. In addition, problems with the site are way down, with the administration pointing to more than 380,000 visits to the site by noon on Tuesday, with nobody being queued to wait in line.

More than 380k visits to http://t.co/1MVLQtMu72 as of noon, EST. Site stable, high traffic, no queuing. — HealthCare.gov (@HealthCareGov) December 3, 2013
