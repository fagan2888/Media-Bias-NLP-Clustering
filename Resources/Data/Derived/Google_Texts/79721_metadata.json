In Georgia alone, a state whose Republican governor has critiqued Obamacare as \u201canything but affordable,\u201d a team of enrollment experts has visited each of the state\u2019s 600 AME churches.\n\nEnroll America, a nonprofit advocacy group with a \u201cGet Covered America\u201d campaign, has partnered with faith-based groups representing more than 20 million members, said spokesman Justin Nisly. Much of their work is focused on 11 states with high concentrations of uninsured people, and has found willing partners in the National Council of Jewish Women, the group American Muslim Health Professionals and NETWORK, the Catholic social justice group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hosted over 700 outreach and enrollment events at churches, mosques, synagogues and faith centers to engage communities to learn about the options that are available to them,\u201d Nisly said.\n\nFaith leaders have promoted Enroll America\u2019s \u201cHealth Care in the Pulpit\u201d program, which includes training volunteers and having information tables after worship services.\n\nPICO National Network, a consortium of faith-based community organizations, has a \u201cBring Health Care Home\u201d initiative with education or enrollment events planned through March 30. As of mid-March, its member congregations hosted 157 events and reached more than 92,000 people who were either uninsured or likely did not have insurance.\n\nThough experts say it\u2019s impossible to say how many of the 5 million newly enrolled Americans signed up as a result of a religious recruitment effort, the White House views religious leaders as key players. More than 20,000 people participated in webinars that have been hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 faith-based office, and Obama joined a March 10 conference call to ask religious officials to reinforce their efforts.\n\nThe sign-up campaigns come against a backdrop of deep opposition to the law in some religious corners, fueled by a sense that the law interjects government into people\u2019s private lives, or widespread religious aversion to a controversial contraception mandate included in the new law. The Supreme Court will hear a central challenge to the mandate on March 25.\n\nThe Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, has spearheaded information sessions at predominantly Latino churches around the country and radio spots on Hispanic Christian radio stations.\n\nSalguero noted that one in four persons who are eligible but uninsured are Latino. \u201cIt\u2019s an urgent need in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real service to that underserved community.\u201d\n\nSalguero said he shares other evangelicals\u2019 concerns about Obamacare\u2019s coverage for what they consider to be abortifacients but nevertheless wants to make sure people have a chance to be educated about what the law does and does not include.\n\n\u201cMy position is I\u2019m a pro-life person so I don\u2019t want anybody dying of preventable diseases if they can get health care,\u201d he said.\n\nLikewise, in a rare move, the Roman Catholic bishop of San Bernardino, Calif., wrote a letter that was read at Masses in his diocese on March 15-16, noting that undocumented parents should \u201csign your child up for health insurance immediately\u201d and that opting out could result in fines that will increase over time.\n\n\u201cIt is true that our Church has raised objection to elements of the law that relate to contraception and abortion services that might be provided through it,\u201d Bishop Gerald R. Barnes wrote in the March 11 letter, adding that he \u201cfully\u201d supports those objections.\n\n\u201cHowever, these factors do not mean that we, as Catholics, should disobey the new health care law. If we happen to have an insurance plan that includes services that are objectionable to our faith, which most plans in California do, our response is to not utilize these services.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Gary R. Gunderson, a public health science professor who has worked with the Bush and Obama administrations, said faith groups are key on-the-ground partners in the enrollment push because they often work with the most vulnerable populations.\n\nGunderson, who teaches at Wake Forest University Divinity School and is a vice president at its related Baptist medical center, recalled a contract worker who told him he was grateful for the health insurance he now had under the Affordable Care Act even though he is a Republican and didn\u2019t vote for Obama.\n\n\u201cThe ministry trumps the politics,\u201d Gunderson said. \u201cSigning up for the Affordable Care Act is not like drinking alcohol. It\u2019s not a sin.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 10 Facts About The Transforming Global Religious Landscape 10 Facts About The Transforming Global Religious Landscape\n\n1 of 10 1.
