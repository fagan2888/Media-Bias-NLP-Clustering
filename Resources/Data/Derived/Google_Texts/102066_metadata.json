It took him a quarter and change, longer than you\u2019d think it would take some football god poised to smash a record would take to get started.\n\nIt ended with the precision that only Peyton Manning possesses, with a 5-yard pass, those yards being exactly \u2014 exactly \u2014 what the Broncos star needed to get the NFL season record for yards passing a week ago in Oakland.\n\nIn between, from the opening- night victory over the Ravens to the season-ending rout of the Raiders, there were bullets, lobs and lasers, even the occasional run. There was Julius Thomas, the nobody who caught Manning\u2019s first touchdown pass of the season, and Demaryius Thomas, who caught the last one. There were 55 touchdown passes and 16 touchdowns rushing for a total of 71 touchdowns by the offense, en route to Denver scoring 606 points, another NFL record.\n\nIn the process, five Broncos \u2014 Demaryius Thomas (14 touchdowns), Knowshon Moreno (13), Julius Thomas (12), Eric Decker (11) and Wes Welker (10) \u2014 scored at least 10 touchdowns, setting yet another NFL record.\n\nYeah, yeah. Records. Only a team like this could make them seem almost trivial.\n\nRecords, you see, have become the currency of these Broncos. Yardage, touchdowns, scoring \u2026 the list goes on and on. But most records are fleeting. These Broncos know that, most of all Manning, who took about 4\u00bd seconds after setting the league season record for touchdown passes to remind everyone of just how soon it would fall.\n\nThese five players and their double-digit TDs, though, might last a long time. It\u2019s an unusual record, the product as much of an elite quarterback as it is of circumstance, timing and an utter lack of jockeying for superiority.\n\n\u201cTeam success is better than the records, but of all the records, in my opinion, the one that\u2019s going to probably last a while is I call it the 5-10 group,\u201d said Denver wide receivers coach Tyke Tolbert. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be broken for a while. To have five guys with at least 10 touchdowns, that tells you about the guys we have on our team. \u2026 It\u2019s just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nBefore the 2013 season, 10 teams had three players score 10 or more TDs apiece in the same season. (Three teams were Manning\u2019s Colts, in 2004, 2007 and 2009.) No team had ever had four players hit such a mark, let alone five, and here the Broncos are, heads and shoulders above the pack.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m the worst person to ask,\u201d said Julius Thomas, a tight end. \u201cLast game, we had the opportunity to have the most points scored in the regular season. I had no idea. Nobody told me. I\u2019m the worst.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not something talked about in the meetings. It\u2019s not something we talk about in a group. It\u2019s not something that we pushed for. It\u2019s just something that happened, and it speaks to the level we\u2019ve been executing at this season.\u201d\n\nEveryone knew wide receivers Demaryius Thomas, Welker and Decker were going to be a force this season. But Moreno\u2019s breakout year at tailback was nothing short of a shock, and Julius Thomas had played only 50 regular- season offensive snaps before opening night. They were going to be good, but this good? No way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a credit to all of those guys,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s a credit to \u2026 the wide receivers and tight ends coaches getting those guys ready. But (there were) certainly some great individual efforts from all of those guys\u2019 parts. \u2026 A lot of credit goes to them and their work ethic. They\u2019ve distributed this year. I\u2019m certainly proud to call all those guys teammates.\u201d\n\nSome might say it\u2019s too good to be true. A more accurate description would be that it\u2019s too good to last. Moreno and Decker will be free agents this year, and they earned themselves plenty of future cash with their performance this season. It remains to be seen whether the Broncos will \u2014 or, considering the financial ramifications, even want to \u2014 keep the 5-10 club together.\n\nWho knows? For now, enjoy the playoffs and know that long after Marshall Manning or Benjamin Brady sets the next NFL season touchdown pass record, the names of Thomas, Moreno, Thomas, Decker and Welker may still be etched in the record book.\n\nThe 5-10 club Five Broncos scored at least 10 touchdowns this season:\n\nWR Demaryius Thomas\n\n14 touchdowns\n\n92 receptions\n\n1,430 yards\n\nRB Knowshon Moreno\n\n13 touchdowns\n\n60 receptions\n\n548 yards, plus 1,038 yards rushing\n\nTE Julius Thomas\n\n12 touchdowns\n\n65 receptions\n\n788 yards\n\nWR Eric Decker\n\n11 touchdowns\n\n87 receptions\n\n1,288 yards\n\nWR Wes Welker\n\n10 touchdowns\n\n73 receptions\n\n778 yards", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Equal opportunity powering Denver Broncos\u2019 record-setting offense", "title": "Equal opportunity powering Denver Broncos\u2019 record-setting offense", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/04/equal-opportunity-powering-denver-broncos-record-setting-offense/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__20140105_C9_SP05FBNBRONXp5.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__20140105_C9_SP05FBNBRONXp5.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T16:58:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:46:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c5b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m the worst person to ask,\u201d said Julius Thomas, a tight end.\nThere was Julius Thomas, the nobody who caught Manning\u2019s first touchdown pass of the season, and Demaryius Thomas, who caught the last one.\nIn the process, five Broncos \u2014 Demaryius Thomas (14 touchdowns), Knowshon Moreno (13), Julius Thomas (12), Eric Decker (11) and Wes Welker (10) \u2014 scored at least 10 touchdowns, setting yet another NFL record.\nBut Moreno\u2019s breakout year at tailback was nothing short of a shock, and Julius Thomas had played only 50 regular- season offensive snaps before opening night.\nThere were 55 touchdown passes and 16 touchdowns rushing for a total of 71 touchdowns by the offense, en route to Denver scoring 606 points, another NFL record."}
