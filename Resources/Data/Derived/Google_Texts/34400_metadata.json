However, CFPB officials note there is no legal restriction against collecting the data.\n\nFurther, the GAO concluded that the CFPB has taken steps to \u201cprotect and secure\u201d the data it collects. The agency has developed a system to consider statutory limits and privacy implications of their data collection efforts, and has a process for \u201canonymizing\u201d the material involving identifiable individuals.\n\n\u201cThe report puts to rest the idea that CFPB has been improperly using consumers\u2019 personal financial data,\u201d Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nRepublicans disagreed, pointing to a series of 12 GAO recommendations intended to further safeguard sensitive information at the CFPB\u2019s disposal.\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, who championed legislation requiring the GAO study, said the shear magnitude of the data being collected at the consumer board is enough to warrant concern.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems the CFPB is trying to out-NSA the NSA when it comes to accumulating information on Americans,\u201d Hensarling said. \u201cThis is, without a doubt, an unwarranted and shocking intrusion into the privacy of American citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The consumer board\u2019s practices have raised questions about privacy from conservatives.", "description": "The consumer board\u2019s practices have raised questions about privacy from conservatives.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ben Goad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The consumer board\u2019s practices have raised questions about privacy from conservatives.", "title": "GAO: Nothing unusual in CFPB data collection", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/218529-data-collection-at-cfpb-in-line-with-other-agencies-gao-finds", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/218529-data-collection-at-cfpb-in-line-with-other-agencies-gao-finds", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-22T15:52-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T15:52:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/218529-data-collection-at-cfpb-in-line-with-other-agencies-gao-finds", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The consumer board\u2019s practices have raised questions about privacy from conservatives.", "card": "summary", "title": "GAO: Nothing unusual in CFPB data collection"}, "dcterms.title": "GAO: Nothing unusual in CFPB data collection"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe69\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe report puts to rest the idea that CFPB has been improperly using consumers\u2019 personal financial data,\u201d Rep.
