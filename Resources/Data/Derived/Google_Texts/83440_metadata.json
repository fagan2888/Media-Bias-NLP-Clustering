Facing a backlash from the students, MU rescinded that decision for this school year, and a task force began work to examine MU\u2019s options for assisting with premium costs in future years.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page.

Since then, the group has worked to advocate for better graduate student benefits, including better pay, guaranteed subsidized health insurance and on-campus graduate student housing.\n\nScott and co-chair Connor Lewis have hosted multiple union informational sessions this semester and started a union signature drive that aimed to collect a supermajority of graduate worker signatures.\n\nA union will give graduate students more say, Lewis said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, pretty much all we can do is tell the administration what we want, and they may or may not listen,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWhat this does is put the entire process into a legally designed process where they have to sit down with us as equals and both sides have to negotiate with good faith.\u201d\n\nThe group wants to collect signatures from two-thirds of the about 2,800 graduate student workers on campus, Scott said. Just fewer than 2,000 signatures will get the group to its goal and allow it to hold a union election.\n\nScott and Lewis will consult with the National Education Association, a national teachers union with which graduate students have associated their potential union, during the holiday break to plan a strategy for union efforts during the spring semester. Scott said the signature drive has picked up significantly the past two weeks. He doesn\u2019t expect they will have to collect signatures long in the spring to get the number they need.\n\nInitially, the Coalition of Graduate Workers \u2014 the potential graduate student union \u2014 aimed to have enough signatures to hold a vote by the end of the fall semester. Scott said it is possible the recent unrest on campus slowed the group\u2019s progress.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"site": "@columbiatribune", "description": "More than 1,000 University of Missouri graduate students have added their signatures to a list calling for a union election.", "card": "summary", "title": "MU grad students collect more than 1,000 signatures calling for union election"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/education/mu-grad-students-collect-more-than-signatures-calling-for-union/article_5a3f5ce5-7d8e-53bb-a236-87936c05e409.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "More than 1,000 University of Missouri graduate students have added their signatures to a list calling for a union election.", "title": "MU grad students collect more than 1,000 signatures calling for union election"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "university of missouri,graduate students,petition,union election,union,student union,health insurance", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "More than 1,000 University of Missouri graduate students have added their signatures to a list calling for a union election."}, "article_summary": "More than 1,000 University of Missouri graduate students have added their signatures to a list calling for a union election.\nInitially, the Coalition of Graduate Workers \u2014 the potential graduate student union \u2014 aimed to have enough signatures to hold a vote by the end of the fall semester.\nSince then, the group has worked to advocate for better graduate student benefits, including better pay, guaranteed subsidized health insurance and on-campus graduate student housing.\nGraduate students started considering forming a union in August after MU said it could no longer subsidize health insurance premiums for graduate student workers because of a recent IRS interpretation of the Affordable Care Act.\nA union will give graduate students more say, Lewis said."}
