UCSB has the most expensive health insurance plan in the UC system at around $2,568 per year ($856 per quarter) for the next academic year, and up to 50 percent of students waive this plan every school year.\n\nGHI Advisory Committee Budget Officer Mike Anderson said the plan exists to better allocate financial aid resources to students in need.\n\n\u201cIf a student already has insurance then the financial aid office will take that money and give it to others who are financially struggling,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThey need the GHI Plan and can increase their financial aid package. I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy, the Financial Aid Board wrongly assumes students receiving financial aid do not need the money given for health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you remove the funding for health insurance because you waived the Gaucho Health Insurance does not mean you have the money for health insurance. You may still need that money to pay for the other health insurance,\u201d Guthy said. \u201cStudents who waive out of health insurance are not incurring that cost for health insurance or have a family plan.\u201d\n\nProviding less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn\u2019t really anything new \u2014 fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can\u2019t really say that I\u2019m surprised. \u2014Andrew Okeh\n\nA.S. is currently working with the Financial Aid Office to reach an agreement to avoid cutting the financial aid benefits for student health insurance.\n\nFirst-year computer science major Andrew Okeh said he believes the plan does not benefit students and instead profits the university.\n\n\u201cSince when are less benefits ever good?\u201d Okeh said. \u201cThe people who are involved with the board, it\u2019s good for them because providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn\u2019t really anything new \u2014 fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can\u2019t really say that I\u2019m surprised.\u201d\n\nFirst-year environmental studies major Navpreet Khabra said she also opposes the proposal because she believes that the aid students receive specifically allocated to health insurance is valuable to students who opt out of GHI.\n\n\u201cBy lowering their financial aid award, it could offset the money that they would have saved,\u201d Khabra said. \u201cI personally was able to use the money saved from waiving GHI for other educational expenses such as textbooks and transportation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Anderson, however, if students waive GHI it implies they have more affordable health insurance plans.\n\n\u201cIf people waive out then they have other health insurance, it\u2019s already in the family budget and calculated for,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBecause they have health insurance, they\u2019ll waive out. There\u2019s a large percentage of students who don\u2019t have health insurance like students overseas. It\u2019s something we\u2019re exploring. It may or may not happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Guthy, she and the Internal Vice President Angela Lau have reached a compromise with the Financial Aid Board that would allow students to possibly alter their financial aid award under certain financial circumstances.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the industry average is $1,500 and if you pay more than that, you could go to the financial aid office to adjust that,\u201d Guthy said. \u201cWe reached a verbal agreement on our meeting on Friday so I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAnderson said the plan will be ultimately beneficial because it will help students who are financially struggling by expanding the available limits on general financial aid funding.\n\n\u201cFinancial aid offices run out of money. They give out grants and scholarships and then are left with loans. They could give those grants to those who are having a tougher time and I think that would be a good thing,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.\u201d\n\nFirst-year economics and accounting major Paige Donaldson however said the plan is \u201cterrible\u201d because it does not help students save money.\n\n\u201cI waived the health insurance because I couldn\u2019t afford it, so how would cutting my financial aid do any good?\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cEither way it\u2019s a trap to make us pay more and make money off of us, but students are not to be treated like walking money bags to make a profit.\u201d\n\nHaving to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI. \u2014Willie Roman\n\nWillie Roman, a first-year English and economics double major said he\u2019s surprised the plan is even being considered.\n\n\u201cPersonally, as a student from a low income household, my financial aid is absolutely critical, and stretched thin as it is,\u201d Roman said. \u201cHaving to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.\u201d\n\nAccording to Guthy however, the Financial Aid Board has been open to working with the student body to enact reasonable financial aid policy and are hoping students participate in the upcoming surveys.\n\n\u201cFinancial Aid Office is sending out a survey to gauge the industry average and collect more data. They won\u2019t erase the funding entirely but will lessen it to the industry average,\u201d Guthy said. \u201cWe encourage people to do the survey to give students time to prepare for this change. I think we\u2019ve reached a good conclusion.\u201d\n\nAnderson, said a decision regarding the proposal, whose rising costs are due to the Affordable Health Care Act, will be made in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to wrap it up here in the next few weeks,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThere used to be caps on the benefits of each person. It\u2019s getting expensive because the Affordable Health Care act put no caps on the benefits.\u201d\n\nA version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, February 12, 2015\u2019s print edition of the Daily Nexus.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/", "site_name": "The Daily Nexus", "type": "article", "description": "The Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016 academic year.", "title": "Waive Goodbye to Your Financial Aid"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016 academic year.", "title": "Waive Goodbye to Your Financial Aid", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/", "image": "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eb9ee80d39f13cbbad56da88ef3a6ee?rating=PG&size=75", "site": "@dailynexus", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd069\"", "article_summary": "Proposal considers lowering financial aid for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance, replacing it with \u2018industry average\u2019 aidThe Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016 academic year.\n\u2014Andrew OkehA.S. is currently working with the Financial Aid Office to reach an agreement to avoid cutting the financial aid benefits for student health insurance.\nIt may or may not happen.\u201dAccording to Guthy, she and the Internal Vice President Angela Lau have reached a compromise with the Financial Aid Board that would allow students to possibly alter their financial aid award under certain financial circumstances.\n\u201cIf you remove the funding for health insurance because you waived the Gaucho Health Insurance does not mean you have the money for health insurance.\nLow key, fuck GHI.\u201dAccording to Guthy however, the Financial Aid Board has been open to working with the student body to enact reasonable financial aid policy and are hoping students participate in the upcoming surveys."}
