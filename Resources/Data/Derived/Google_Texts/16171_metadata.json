Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell agreed on Monday.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz \u2014 a likely 2016 presidential candidate like Paul, and the ringleader of the aggressive House Republican caucus from his perch in the Senate \u2014 told the Washington Post on Sunday that if the Republicans win the Senate this Election Day, they should \u201cpursue every means possible to repeal Obamacare,\u201d including exploiting various parliamentary procedures to avoid a Democratic filibuster.\n\n\u201cWe ought to concentrate just on winning\u201d the election, Paul said when asked about Cruz\u2019s comments on Monday after a stop on the campaign trail with McConnell in Kentucky. \u201cThere are a lot of things I want to do, and everybody has their own sort of agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think one of the most important things we can do that has bipartisan support is to lower the tax on American money overseas and try to invite it home,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBarbara Boxer supports it, I support it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna have to be things we can agree to,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t have a vote on repealing Obamacare; we should have a vote. I\u2019m not sure how far that goes but we should have a vote on it. But I also want to pass some stuff and one of the things I think would help the country would be to bring all that American profit home and create jobs.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after his campaign stop in Bowling Green, McConnell echoed Paul, saying that there is little chance that the president would sign a repeal bill, though his conference will try to take apart the Affordable Care Act piece by piece.\n\nA GOP-led Senate \u201cwould certainly be voting on things like repealing the medical device tax, restoring the 40-hour work week, discontinuing the individual mandate,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cWith the president in the position that he\u2019s in, I can\u2019t imagine he would sign a full repeal, but there\u2019s various parts of it that are very unpopular and we will be voting on them.\u201d\n\nIn his Washington Post interview, Cruz also declined to promise to back McConnell for Republican leader in the Senate.\n\nAsked if this concerned him, McConnell said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question who\u2019s gonna be the leader of the Republicans in the Senate,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe only question is whether we\u2019ll be in the majority or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our conference we have everybody from Susan Collins to Ted Cruz, we have lots of different opinions, and we\u2019ll all sit down together and figure out the way forward,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nAsked about Cruz\u2019s stance on McConnell as leader, Paul declined to comment but said that he would support McConnell for leader. Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, campaigned for McConnell all day on Monday, and the two lavished praise on each other on the trail.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3500006, "userid": 229172}, "description": "\"I also want to pass some stuff.\"..", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
