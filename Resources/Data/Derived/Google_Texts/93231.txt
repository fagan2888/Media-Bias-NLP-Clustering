George Clooney just made himself the personification of Hollywood hypocrisy by denouncing big money in politics in quick succession after having exacerbated the “problem” he identified. Does the man have self-awareness at all? Has playing fantasy characters in the movies destroyed all hold on reality in his mind? Or is he signaling that he really supports Bernie Sanders and is only running fundraisers for Hillary out of a sense of obligation (or fear?). Was this statement, delivered on today’s Meet the Press the equivalent of US prisoners in North Korea blinking SOS in Morse Code?

One thing is certain: nobody should ever take seriously any political pronouncement from George Clooney.
