Farron accused Humphreys of focusing on \u201cthe shocking revelation that a Christian says his prayers,\u201d but Humphreys continued to press Farron on the issue.\n\nLater that day, Farron appeared on Channel 4 News where presenter Cathy Newman spent 40 seconds asking him about UK military involvement in Syria before spending the next four minutes talking about his views on abortion and gay sex.\n\nOn abortion, Farron said that he thought \u201cevery abortion constitutes a tragedy\u201d but he would not seek to change the law.\n\nThen, when continually pressed on whether he thought gay sex was sinful, Farron said \u201cto understand Christianity is to understand that we are all sinners.\u201d He added: \u201cPerhaps the Bible phrase that I use most \u2013 particularly with my kids, but actually on myself \u2013 is \u2018You don\u2019t pick out the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye when there is a plank in your own.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe interview led to The Guardian splashing with \u201cTim Farron avoids saying whether he considers gay sex as a sin,\u201d an article that at one point today was the most read on the entire site. It focused on the fact he abstained from voting when gay marriage was passing through the House of Commons. Farron has since issued a mea culpa, proclaiming his support for \u201cequal marriage\u201d, but this was clearly not enough for The Guardian and Channel 4.\n\nAt no point has Farron indicated his faith will determine his party\u2019s policies; in fact he has often said the exact opposite. But the fact he can even privately hold Christian values is too much for some in the liberal-left commentariat.\n\nMeanwhile, the message for everyone else is clear \u2013 if you hold any religious conviction, especially if you\u2019re a Christian \u2013 expect to be subjected to the New Inquisition lest you dare to commit heresy against liberal-left secularism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christian Elected Party Leader - Media Freak Out", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Christian Elected Party Leader - Media Freak Out", "title": "Christian Elected Party Leader - Media Freak Out - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4261, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/GettyImages-480949344.jpg", "height": 2884}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/18/christian-elected-party-leader-media-freak-out/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Christian Elected Party Leader - Media Freak Out", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/GettyImages-480949344.jpg", "title": "Christian Elected Party Leader - Media Freak Out - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron,Breitbart London, Faith,tim farron", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "Tim Farron", "published_time": "2015-07-18T10:25:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "On abortion, Farron said that he thought \u201cevery abortion constitutes a tragedy\u201d but he would not seek to change the law.\nHowever, instead of focusing on his plans for future party policy and strategy, Britain\u2019s left-wing media has been obsessing about the fact Farron is \u2013 shock horror \u2013 a practising Christian.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne news event that may have passed most people by last week was the election of Tim Farron as leader of the Liberal Democrats.\nFarron accused Humphreys of focusing on \u201cthe shocking revelation that a Christian says his prayers,\u201d but Humphreys continued to press Farron on the issue.\nBut the fact he can even privately hold Christian values is too much for some in the liberal-left commentariat."}
