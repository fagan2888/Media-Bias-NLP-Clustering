Every major Supreme Court decision has two parts: a written opinion and an oral announcement. The former is made public immediately, but the latter is only accessible to the few who are gathered in the courtroom on the day a decision is announced.

You could take a trip to the National Archives and listen to the the audio files there. Or you could wait until each fall and find them online.

This week, The Oyez Project, an initiative at the IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law, posted audio for the opinion announcements for all the major cases the Supreme Court heard in its October 2014 term, which ended in June.

That means you can now hear, download and share what happened inside the courtroom the moment every big case was handed down -- including what Chief Justice John Roberts said when he saved Obamacare a second time, when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced it's a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, and how Justice Samuel Alito affirmed Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol.
