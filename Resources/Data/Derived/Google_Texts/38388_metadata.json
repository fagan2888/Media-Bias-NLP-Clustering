His parents, Richard and Carrie Morchesky, own Export Fuel Co., and he remembers hanging out in garages and tinkering with cars ever since he was a kid.\n\n\u201cIt's always fun to do something your parents are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you're a little kid, your dad is really the only guy you know.\u201d\n\nRichard Morchesky, 55, has a collection of vintage muscle cars, including a Chevrolet Camaro, a Ford Mustang and the 1976 Bricklin that was the second car he ever owned. The first was lost in a fire.\n\nHe said his son has always shared his hobby.\n\n\u201cHe's the old-school gearhead kid. A lot of kids his age are interested in ones they call the \u2018tuner cars,' but he's always been more interested in the \u2018American muscle cars,' \u201d he said.\n\nRick Morchesky never planned to make his hobby a career until his grandfather, Dick Morchesky, spotted a magazine ad for McPherson College in Kansas. McPherson is the nation's only college to offer a four-year program in automotive restoration.\n\nRick enrolled after graduating from Hempfield Area High School. He has been in the program three years now, and according to one of his professors, quickly impressed the faculty with his dedication.\n\n\u201cHe really stood out among his colleagues for his dedication and his passion for automobiles and the quality of his work,\u201d said professor Ed Barr. \u201cIt's funny. I can always tell who the really serious ones are on a Friday afternoon with me in the sheet metal lab, trying to improve their skills.\u201d\n\nMorchesky said he is just happy for the chance to learn.\n\n\u201cYou learn everything \u2014 from paint, upholstery, machinery, to sheet metal,\u201d he said.\n\nSince 1999, the college has awarded one promising student an annual $20,000 Jay Leno/Popular Mechanics scholarship. Most years, at least two or three students are considered for the award, but when Morchesky was nominated, he was an obvious choice, Barr said.\n\n\u201cI remember nominating him, and there wasn't a word from anybody. It was all instantaneous agreement,\u201d Barr said.\n\nMorchesky was later asked to speak on behalf of the school at a car show, where he met Leno, the scholarship's sponsor and namesake. The two talked about McPherson, classic cars and the small race car Morchesky is building out of aluminum for his senior project.\n\n\u201cHe was, honestly, one of the nicest guys,\u201d Morchesky said of Leno, who owns about 80 rare, exotic cars, 80 motorcycles and a fire truck, according to media reports.\n\nMorchesky is spending his summer working in a shop in Wisconsin, restoring the sheet metal on vintage Ferraris.\n\n\u201cI've really taken a liking to sheet metal restoration,\u201d he said. \u201cMetal can do basically three things. It can shrink, it can stretch and it can bend. By taking advantage of those combinations, you can reproduce all the curves on the car.\u201d\n\nWhen he graduates next year, he plans to go wherever he can find work, preferably one of the big auto restoration companies on the West or East coasts.\n\nBarr believes Morchesky will have no trouble putting his skills to work.\n\n\u201cWe know when he goes out there, he'll be able to do whatever he wants to do and represent us well,\u201d Barr said.\n\nJacob Tierney is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
