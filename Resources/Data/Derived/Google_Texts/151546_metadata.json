That allowed them to approve, for instance, Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The GOP had blocked him because they opposed the agency, not Cordray.\n\nMcConnell's opposition Thursday cannot stop Burwell's confirmation, but it does allow him to make a political point while he's facing a tough reelection campaign in which he has repeatedly used Obamacare as a talking point. He has argued over and over again that the law is a disaster that is hurting people, although he recently suggested Kentucky could keep its Obamacare program -- Kynect -- even if he succeeded in ending Obamacare.\n\n\"In my view, the Senate shouldn't be focusing on a new captain for the Titanic. It should focus on steering away from the iceberg,\" said McConnell, suggesting he won't support anyone to head the nation's health programs unless Obamacare is repealed.\n\n\"Her embrace of this disastrous law is reason enough to oppose her confirmation,\" McConnell said. \"So I'll be voting against this nominee because I think we need to focus on repealing and replacing this law, not trying to do the impossible by pretending we can make it work.\"\n\nShortly after McConnell spoke, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) also took to the floor to excoriate Obamacare problems. He said he would support Burwell, explaining \"hopefully she can correct them.\"\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
