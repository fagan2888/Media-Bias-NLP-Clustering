Gary \u2014 a type 2 Diabetic with congestive heart failure \u2014 and Suzanne \u2014 who has rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia \u2014 say their medical expenses account for nearly 30 percent of their monthly income, most of which comes from Social Security and disability assistance.\n\nEven with Medicare coverage, the New Jersey couple often finds it difficult to purchase and refill their 20 different prescription medications. In recent years, they\u2019ve explored alternatives, including looking for medicine in Canada. They also forwent three-month packages for cheaper monthly refills. At one point, Gary skipped out on his heart medication for three months, a decision he said landed him in the emergency room last year when his chest filled up with excess liquid.\n\nAs the Weiners inch closer to falling within the Medicare \u201cdonut hole\u201d \u2014 a threshold when out-of-pocket costs dramatically increase \u2014 questions remain as to how they will finish out the year in good health with an annual tab that\u2019s at $5,000.\n\n\u201cThe medication just seems to be getting more expensive. Our dosages and medicines have changed over the years so it\u2019s been a constant battle to measure cost,\u201d Gary Weiner told ThinkProgress. \u201cWe know doctor bills will be high so we limit eating out, going to the movies, and other expenses. This dilemma also makes us constantly shop around for auto insurance. We\u2019re always looking for things that will help lessen the costs of everything else.\u201d\n\nOur dosages and medicines have changed over the years so it\u2019s been a constant battle.\n\nThe Weiners aren\u2019t the only people struggling with this. Prescription drug costs increased by 13 percent last year, reaching $374 billion, according to a report recently compiled by the Center for American Progress. Generics have even suffered under this model, with their prices increasing by more than 1,000 percent during the same year.\n\nAdvocates and lawmakers \u2014 including Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 place the blame on drug companies hungry to make a profit. Indeed, this issue has been a prominent topic of discussion this week, thanks to controversy swirling around hedge fund owner and pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli, who has been called \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d after his controversial decision to charge $750 per pill for a drug that treats severe infections in AIDS patients, pregnant women, and infants.\n\nDrug costs count as just one part of the puzzle in our country\u2019s labyrinth of a financially burdensome medical system, even with tenets of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in place. A survey conducted by consumer assistance agency NerdWallet Health showed that nearly 60 percent of American patients accumulated medical expenses that surpassed their expectations in 2012, and families doled out $21 billion in payments to third-party collection agencies. The majority of those costs were related to prescription medication and medical procedures.\n\nDesperate to avoid paying out of pocket for a medical procedure, Gary said he changed his diet and starting exercising for the past year. Through the dietary changes, his doctor said he no longer had to go under the knife. Not many people, however, are so fortunate. This year, hospitals are expected to carry out $50 billion worth of care that patients won\u2019t be able to pay.\n\nHowever, the unpredictability of drug costs has thwarted the Weiners\u2019 efforts to spend smartly.\n\nI never know how much my medication will cost until I pay for it.\n\nSuzanne said it\u2019s difficult to find out the cost of her medicine at the pharmacy each time, especially when it comes to specialty medication. Right now, her prescription regimen includes Actemra, an injectable specialty rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Before, she tried taking other specialty and generic non-specialty brands, none of which she said worked. Although Medicare couldn\u2019t reimburse her purchase of the medicine, Suzanne has been able to refill her prescription free of charge through a pharmceutical manufacturer assistance program. Without it, she would have to shell out $800 per week for pain relief.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the donut hole with 11 other prescriptions that I have to refill,\u201d Suzanne told ThinkProgress. \u201cWhen your out-of-pocket costs reach a certain amount, Medicare reduces the coverage and that makes it hard to plan. I never know how much my medication will cost until I pay for it.\u201d\n\nHigh prices for specialty medications have received the most national attention, in part because of insurers\u2019 strategy of placing those drugs in a different category that allows them to circumvent rules outlined in the ACA. That way, patients may be responsible for shouldering as much as 50 percent of the out-of-pocket cost of the drug. This has been the case for HIV and Hepatitis C medications \u2014 some of which now cost as much as $1,000 per pill.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have also taken advantage of the demand for specialty drugs by purchasing the rights for niche medications and significantly raising their price tags. That\u2019s why, under Shkreli, the drug treatment in question jumped from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill practically overnight. Similarly, the Purdue Research Foundation reversed a deal with Rodelis Therapeutics under which the latter would\u2019ve increased the price of Cycloserine, a tuberculosis medication, more than 20-fold. Public health officers said the price hike would burden Medicaid agencies that would pay more than $780,000 in a two-year span.\n\nIt feels like these companies are punishing you for taking medications.\n\nIn response to his critics, Shrekli said the change would cover research and development costs, an explanation commonly used by pharmaceutical companies. That reasoning, however, hasn\u2019t pacified patient advocacy organizations and lawmakers. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the ranking member of the House Committee On Oversight And Government Reform, has called Shrekli\u2019s actions \u201ccriminal\u201d and suggested he should testify before Congress.\n\nPresidential candidates have also chimed in. Earlier this month, Sanders introduced a bill that would allow patients to import cheaper drugs from Canada. Medicare could also negotiate with companies on drug costs and pharmaceutical companies would also have to reveal research and development costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Clinton revealed a plan of her own that would cap monthly out-of-pocket costs at $250 and lower the monopoly marketing period for biologics, a costly new class of drugs, from 12 to seven years. Another portion of Clinton\u2019s plan aligns with part of a proposal the Center for American Progress unveiled last week that would require companies benefitting from federally funded research to cap their research and development costs.\n\nWhile it remains to see if these changes would come to fruition, the Weiners said some of those policies could alleviate some of their financial burden for an expense they said has become essential to their livelihood. \u201cIt feels like these companies are punishing you for taking medications,\u201d Suzanne Weiner told ThinkProgress. \u201cMy doctors want me to be on this medication so I can manage my rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions. It\u2019s important to have it so I can function.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"It feels like these companies are punishing you for taking medications.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"It feels like these companies are punishing you for taking medications.\"", "title": "For Everyday Americans, This Is What It Looks Like When Drug Companies Jack Up Prices", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/09/25/3705373/high-prescription-drug-costs/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/25121057/the-weiners.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It feels like these companies are punishing you for taking medications.\"", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/25121057/the-weiners-321x214.jpg", "title": "For Everyday Americans, This Is What It Looks Like When Drug Companies Jack Up Prices", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/25121057/the-weiners.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/25121057/the-weiners.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-25T08:10:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Medicare could also negotiate with companies on drug costs and pharmaceutical companies would also have to reveal research and development costs.\nPrescription drug costs increased by 13 percent last year, reaching $374 billion, according to a report recently compiled by the Center for American Progress.\nAdvocates and lawmakers \u2014 including Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen.
