The AHA advocated for an exception to be created under the anti-kickback statute to help advance the efficiency of new alternative payment models.\n\nThe Committee requested value-based payment model feedback regarding the Stark Law \u2013 a significant facet of healthcare regulation about physician self-referral regulations. The AHA, in turn, offered suggestions for the Committee to consider. Legal impediments, team-based care that helps alternative payment models flourish and thrive, and a focus on the reduction of healthcare fraud and abuse were some of the AHA\u2019s key focal points.\n\nProviders face financial penalties from Stark Law violations\n\nThe Stark Law is a strict liability statute banning physicians from making referrals for designated health services. These services are payable by Medicare \u2013 if a financial relationship exits, without a matched exception.\n\nStark Law violations have been a primary recent concern, especially regarding technical compliance violations, private whistleblower suits, and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA\u2019s) self-referral disclosure protocol.\n\n\u201cBecause of its strict liability, regardless of intent, if there's a technical violation of the Stark Law, there can be significant repercussions for providers resulting in financial penalties,\u201d explained Kristen A. Larremore, Partner at Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, to RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\n\u201cIt also prohibits specifically the entity from filing claims for reimbursement for services provided as a result of the physician's referral. That requirement places compliance with the Stark Law as a precondition to reimbursement of claims submitted to Medicare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause penalties are assessed on a per-claim basis, that can lead to significant damages going along with the non-compliance.\u201d\n\nLast summer, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), published proposed revisions to the Stark Law. Larramore said CMS was being stretched far too thinly for its own good. CMS was experiencing a massive backlog in the midst of processing technical violations under the law, she asserted.\n\n\u201cAs of mid-January 2015, there were 529 disclosures that had been recorded, only 128 of which had been resolved.\"\n\nAHA to Congress: break free from silos to improve new payment models\n\n\u201cCongress should adopt a single broad exception to federal fraud and abuse laws for financial relationships designed to foster collaboration, efficiencies and improvements in health care,\u201d wrote AHA within a news release.\n\nThe Committee specifically requested input about two specific types of changes:\n\n\u00b7 What changes in the Stark law are needed to implement the MACRA in its current form, as well as accountable care organization (ACO)/shared savings programs; and \u00b7 Where to draw the line between technical and more serious violations of the law.\n\nThe Stark Law does not align with the needs of new payment models, retorted Tom Nickels, AHA\u2019s Executive Vice President, when the committee asked for specific feedback about Stark Law improvement.\n\n\u201cHospitals, physicians and other health care providers must break out of the silos of the past and work as teams to achieve the efficiencies and care improvement goals of the new payment models,\u201d Nickels explained.\n\n\u201cTo do that, a legal safe zone for those efforts is needed. In our view, the Stark law is not suited to the new models and should not be the locus of oversight for these new arrangements. The statute and its complex regulatory framework are designed to keep hospitals and physicians apart \u2013 the antithesis of the new models.\u201d\n\nThe Stark Law approaches compensation arrangements from a fee-for-service perspective, said Nickels, \u201cwhere physicians were self-employed, hospitals were separate entities, and both billed for services on a piecemeal basis.\u201d\n\nNickels added the Stark Law\u2019s primary provisions \u201cmicro-manage compensation arrangements on a strict liability basis that has proved unworkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recommend that [an] exception be created under the anti-kickback statute and arrangements protected under the exception be deemed compliant with the Stark law and relevant [civil monetary penalties].\u201d\n\nPhysician payment models are focused on using financial incentives to influence behavior, he added.\n\n\u201cAchieving Congress's goals for the government health care program and beneficiaries can be accomplished only through teamwork among hospitals, physicians and other health care providers across sites of care.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn essential component for the success of their efforts is also the use of financial incentives \u2013 specifically, arrangements that align incentives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress should focus on strengthening the future of alternative payment models, said the AHA to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committee.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/aha-stark-law-exception-advances-alternative-payment-models", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-08-12-data-trends.png", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "AHA: Stark Law Exception Advances Alternative Payment Models"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress should focus on strengthening the future of alternative payment models, said the AHA to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committee.", "title": "AHA: Stark Law Exception Advances Alternative Payment Models", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-08-12-data-trends.png"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The AHA advocated for an exception to be created under the anti-kickback statute to help advance the efficiency of new alternative payment models.\nProviders face financial penalties from Stark Law violationsThe Stark Law is a strict liability statute banning physicians from making referrals for designated health services.\nThe Stark Law does not align with the needs of new payment models, retorted Tom Nickels, AHA\u2019s Executive Vice President, when the committee asked for specific feedback about Stark Law improvement.\nThe Committee requested value-based payment model feedback regarding the Stark Law \u2013 a significant facet of healthcare regulation about physician self-referral regulations.\nIn our view, the Stark law is not suited to the new models and should not be the locus of oversight for these new arrangements."}
