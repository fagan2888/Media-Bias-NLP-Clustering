Dominick Moreno, D-Commerce City, would put Colorado\u2019s law in line with federal requirements for changing information on passports, reports The Denver Post\u2019s Jennifer Brown.\n\nBut the bill also calls for sealing the former birth certificates and all documents related to the request for the gender change, out of a concern for privacy. These documents could be retrieved only through a court order or upon a written request.\n\nThis goes too far.\n\nSealing records that are a part of a person\u2019s past \u2014 even if it never aligned with who they thought they were \u2014 amounts to trying to rewrite the past. The government makes records and changes records but shouldn\u2019t hide records.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado transgender bill goes one step too far", "title": "Colorado transgender bill goes one step too far", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/03/colorado-transgender-bill-goes-one-step-too-far/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__OP06GENDERp1.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__OP06GENDERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T17:22:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:56:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd594\"", "article_summary": "Colorado lawmakers should certainly pass current legislation to remove any and all complications for transgender people trying to get birth certificates that reflect how they see themselves.\nBut the bill also calls for sealing the former birth certificates and all documents related to the request for the gender change, out of a concern for privacy.\nThe government makes records and changes records but shouldn\u2019t hide records.\nBut House Bill 1265 isn\u2019t perfect and contains an issue that should be remedied.\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep.
