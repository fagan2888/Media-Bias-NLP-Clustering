Brent explained that he didn't vote for the President in either election - in fact, he actively campaigned against him. But after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and draining his bank account to the point where he could no longer afford the care he needed, Brent says the Affordable Care Act saved his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaren George\n\nKaren George wrote to the President in August about her family's story, their struggles and successes, and the ways in which the policies pursued by the President - from the Affordable Care Act to the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) - have helped make things a little easier for them. Originally from West Allis, Wisconsin, the Georges recently moved to Springfield, Illinois. Karen wrote: \"Your presidency has had a direct, important, personal impact on our lives.\"\n\nKaren and Sharon Szyszko\n\nKaren Szyszko sent a letter in March to the President on behalf of the Szyszko family to thank him for the Affordable Care Act, which allowed Karen's sister Sharon to get ankle surgery she needed but had to put off for years. Today, Sharon is without pain and according to Karen \"a walking testament\" to the President's \"understanding and care for all Americans.\"\n\nSusan Campbell\n\nSusan Campbell, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, wrote to the President in February of 2015 as a relatively healthy adult whose basic medical expenses had previously threatened to wipe her out financially. Through the Affordable Care Act, her expenses have become much more manageable, something that makes her feel empowered. In her letter, Susan cautions against those seeking to overturn the law, stating that doing so would prevent her from ever seeking medical attention again. During the most recent open enrollment, Susan served as an ACA Ambassador - individuals who had written the President to thank him for the ACA and wanted to share their stories with others. Susan wrote a letter to other Milwaukee residents, sharing her experience and encouraging them to spread the word about open enrollment.\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Cartillier\n\nAFP White House Correspondent\n\nCell: 202-xxx-xxxx\n\n@jcartillier\n\nUnsubscribe [ http://messages.whitehouse.gov/accounts/USEOP... ]\n\nThe White House \u00b7 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \u00b7 Washington DC 20500 \u00b7 202-xxx-xxxx\n\nPublic Pool is an automated feed of White House press pool reports.
