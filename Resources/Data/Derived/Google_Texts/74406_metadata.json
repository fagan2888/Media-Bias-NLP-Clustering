The Republican candidate and celebrity, familiar to the spotlight, started his day in Reno by filming a phone interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly. Shortly after, he began his speech.\n\nTrump started the rally off by discussing the success of the debate the night before.\n\nThe crowd was supportive. They were cheering loud and interactive the entire time, something that he noted throughout.\n\n\u201cThe American dream isn\u2019t dead, but we can make it bigger, better, stronger,\u201d Trump said, assuring people he had big plans to accomplish if he were to win the election.\n\nAs a man known for his money, he said he plans to bring America out of debt. One way he would do this is by removing ObamaCare.\n\nTrump said he plans to build a wall on the southern border of the United States. He said Mexico is one of the hardest countries to become a legal citizen in, and that we as Americans need to follow their example and be more strict on who we let into our country. He plans to build a wall to change this, and at the expense of Mexico.\n\n\u201cI may be a lot of things, but I\u2019m a good deal guy,\u201d Trump said. He plans to use his deal-making skills if he wins the presidency.\n\nMultiple times in his speech, Trump said he is a phenomenal communicator. He knows how to talk to people, including those of other countries and political parties.\n\nAt the end of the speech, Trump turned to the audience for questions.\n\nSomeone asked if he would be taking a salary while president and he said he would not.\n\n\u201cI wish I could start tomorrow, I really do,\u201d he explained to a cheering crowd. Trump was very enthusiastic and explained that for the past eight years he has sat back and waited for someone to change the country. He was tired of this and decided to run so he could do it himself.\n\nMany students from the University of Nevada, Reno, were in attendance. A few students were wearing hats with Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d and were interested to see him speak.\n\nStudent Amanda Bliss, 18, attended the speech with an open mind, but was unsure on where she stood with Donald Trump running for presidency.\n\n\u201cHe is a very good businessman and with his skills, he could definitely turn America around,\u201d Bliss explained. She agreed with many of his points and is going to keep him in mind in the future election.\n\nAnother college student, Tyler Valley, 21, was also in attendance. Although he thinks that Trump is a great speaker, he is unsure on his capability to be the next president. He believes that his ability and power to run his own companies might conflict with his ability to run our country.\n\n\u201cAmerica is the biggest world power and I just think there is a huge difference between being the head of America compared to the head of a company,\u201d Valley said.\n\nHe said he worried that Trump\u2019s cockiness will affect the relationships America has with other countries in the future.\n\nJordy Addeo is a junior at the Don Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno.
