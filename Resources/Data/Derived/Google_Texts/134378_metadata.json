Up to 129 million Americans \u2013 that\u2019s nearly one in two people \u2013 could be discriminated against because of a pre-existing condition like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer, or for that matter pregnancy or even something as ridiculous as acne.\n\nAnd for the rest of Americans, they knew that coming down with any illness could mark them with that scarlet letter, where they could be unable to get affordable coverage, be trapped in a job, or even be dropped from their coverage because they got sick and have nowhere to turn. As the Vice President said in a speech to this morning, every family was one job loss or one illness away from seeing the worst of the insurance system \u2013 \u201cThere but for the grace of God.\u201d Just consider some of these headlines \u2013 from before the health care law\u2019s provisions took effect:\n\nFrom The Washington Post in 2009: \"Acne, Pregnancy Among Disqualifying Conditions\"\n\nFrom USA Today in 2007: \"People Left Holding Bag When Policies Revoked\"\n\nFrom The New York Times in 2004: \"Cost of Benefits Cited as Factor in Slump in Jobs\u201d\n\nAnd in 2002: \"Hard Decisions for Employers as Costs Soar in Health Care\"\n\nThose headlines weren\u2019t flukes, they were emblematic of broad, systemic problems. That\u2019s why we put together this presentation as a reminder of what we\u2019ve left behind now that the Affordable Care Act has come into full effect. You can also find a lot of that same information in this shareable infographic.\n\nThis was the individual insurance market before the ACA. This insecurity was a profound hindrance to the American ideal that every American can make it if they work hard. For a family that didn't have coverage, or adequate coverage, or guaranteed coverage, it was a constant worry in the back of their minds, if not an immediate source of financial strain or outright disaster. Even those who felt their health insurance was fine for years often suddenly found out it was an illusion when serious illness came to their families.\n\nNow that is changing. No longer will health insurance be a source of perpetual doubt, no longer will those with pre-existing issues be uninsurable. If you lose coverage or lose a job that had coverage, there will be a way to access care. There is a new way for families to have peace of mind about finding care.\n\nAnd again, this is not just for the previously uninsured, or even the half of Americans with pre-existing conditions \u2013 it is for every American that was one illness or one job-loss away from health coverage purgatory. Which is every American \u2013 it is you, it is me, it is our families, colleagues, friends and neighbors.\n\nWhile progress is being made day by day, more and more Americans are enrolling and transitioning into new plans, it is important to remember we are moving away from a very broken system and what life was for millions of Americans before the ACA. As the Vice President said in closing his speech today, \u201cWe will not go back to the day when patients lying in a hospital bed, fighting for their lives are told that, sorry, your coverage is over. We cannot cover you anymore. We will not go back. America will not go back.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"title": "Health Coverage Before the ACA, And Why All Americans Are Better Off Now", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/01/23/health-coverage-aca-and-why-all-americans-are-better-now", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240, "width": 240}, "creator": "@WhiteHouse", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "More and more Americans are enrolling and transitioning into new plans, it is important to remember we are moving away from a very broken system and what life was for millions of Americans before the ACA.
