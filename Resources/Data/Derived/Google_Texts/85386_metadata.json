The secretary told the president that the March 31 deadline for sign-ups under the health care law \u2014 and rising enrollment numbers \u2014 provided an opportunity for change, and that he would be best served by someone who was not the target of so much political ire, Mr. McDonough said.\n\n\u201cWhat was clear is that she thought that it was time to transition the leadership to somebody else,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s made clear in other comments publicly that she recognizes that she takes a lot of the incoming. She does hope \u2014 all of us hope \u2014 that we can get beyond the partisan sniping.\u201d\n\nRepublicans seized on Ms. Sebelius\u2019s departure to heap even more criticism on the law she helped pass and carry out. \u201cNo matter who is in charge of H.H.S., Obamacare will continue to be a disaster,\u201d said Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said her resignation was \u201ccold comfort to the millions of Americans who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families\u201d under the health care law.\n\nThe resignation is a low point in what had been a remarkable career for Ms. Sebelius, who as governor of Kansas was named by Time magazine as one of the five best governors in the country and was even mentioned as a possible running mate for Mr. Obama in 2008. The two had bonded when Ms. Sebelius endorsed his presidential bid early in 2008, becoming one of the highest-profile Democratic women to back him over Hillary Rodham Clinton, and helping him deliver a big win in the Kansas caucus.\n\nWhite House officials were quick to point out the many successes during Ms. Sebelius\u2019s tenure: the end to pre-existing conditions as a bar to insurance, the ability for young people to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance, and the reduction in the growth of health care costs. In addition, Ms. Sebelius helped push through mental health parity in insurance plans and worked with the Department of Education to promote early childhood education.\n\nMs. Sebelius said in an interview on Thursday that she had always known that she would not \u201cbe here to turn out the lights in 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy balance has always been, when do you make that decision?\u201d she added.\n\nThe president had been under pressure for months to fire Ms. Sebelius. But he had resisted, in part because he did not want the Department of Health and Human Services to undergo more upheaval amid all the problems plaguing HealthCare.gov, and in part because of his general reluctance to publicly rebuke top officials.\n\nIn November, Mr. Obama defended the secretary, saying in an interview with NBC News that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t write code; yeah, she wasn\u2019t our I.T. person.\u201d As recently as last week, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, rejected any suggestion that Ms. Sebelius would be fired.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. McDonough praised Ms. Sebelius as \u201ca fierce advocate,\u201d and said she had been \u201ctenacious in her belief\u201d in the president\u2019s health care law. \u201cShe\u2019s fearless in her defense of this idea at the heart of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has commented to me countless times how much he admires that.\u201d\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act faces a range of obstacles, political and otherwise, in the months ahead, and Mr. Obama is hoping that Ms. Burwell can smoothly steer the department and bring stability to its operations. In addition to the midterm elections, in which the health care law is the target of a flood of negative ads, the administration is grappling with policy questions: how it will levy the penalty on individuals who lack insurance, how much premiums will go up in the coming year, and how ultimately to administer the requirement that employers provide insurance.\n\nMs. Sebelius was not Mr. Obama\u2019s first choice to lead the department; he wanted former Senator Tom Daschle in the job, but Mr. Daschle withdrew after acknowledging that he had underpaid his taxes for several years. She was hailed as a gifted political leader in Kansas who could work with legislators of both parties. But those skills were less evident in Washington, and she became a more distant figure within the administration.\n\nIn addition to the political battles over the passage and carrying out of the Affordable Care Act, she clashed with conservatives over contraception, and faced frequent calls for her political head by Republicans after the health care website failed to function properly last year.\n\nIn hearings on Capitol Hill, Ms. Sebelius sometimes grew rattled under questioning by lawmakers. In one hearing at the end of October, Ms. Sebelius declared that HealthCare.gov \u201chas never crashed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is functional,\u201d she added, \u201cbut at a very slow speed and very low reliability, and has continued to function.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe made that statement even as large screens in the hearing room showed a live shot of the website with a page that said: \u201cThe system is down at the moment. We are experiencing technical difficulties and hope to have them resolved soon.\u201d\n\nAn appearance on \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart\u201d last October went even worse. Mr. Stewart challenged her to \u201csign up for Obamacare\u201d before he could download every movie ever made. \u201cWe\u2019ll see which happens first,\u201d he joked. She struggled to defend the website and the law.\n\nThe television appearance prompted headlines like \u201cKathleen Sebelius\u2019s \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Disaster\u201d and accusations from Republicans that she was being misleading. Democrats squirmed at her stiff and halting performance, which did little to inspire confidence.\n\nBut Ms. Sebelius has not been at the center of public attention in recent weeks. Her national television exposure has been limited after the poor public performances, but she has continued to make small appearances and has been active on Twitter to press for people to sign up for insurance. She submitted to another questioning before a Senate committee on Thursday and later acknowledged that the idea of not doing \u201ca hearing every three weeks sounds pretty good to me.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s choice of Ms. Burwell to lead the Department of Health and Human Services places a relative outsider at the helm of one of the government\u2019s largest bureaucracies. Ms. Burwell has led the president\u2019s budget office since taking over for Jacob J. Lew, who is now the Treasury secretary.\n\nMs. Sebelius said she hoped \u2014 but did not expect \u2014 that her departure would represent the beginning of a more cooperative period in Washington to make health care better.\n\n\u201cIf I could take something along with me,\u201d she said, it would be \u201call the animosity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140410183147, "twitter": {"description": "Ending a stormy five-year tenure marred by the disastrous rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, Kathleen Sebelius is resigning as secretary of Health and Human Services.", "title": "Sebelius Resigns After Troubles Over Health Site", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/us/politics/sebelius-resigning-as-health-secretary.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002819429"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "shearm", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/us/OBAMA/OBAMA-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/us/politics/sebelius-resigning-as-health-secretary.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002819429", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/us/politics/sebelius-resigning-as-health-secretary.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 10, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Health and Human Services Department", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Appointments and Executive Changes,Office of Management and Budget (US),Sebelius  Kathleen,Burwell  Sylvia Mathews,Obama  Barack,Health and Human Services Department", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael D.
