Coach Jay Gruden confirmed Amerson broke a team rule but did not share what he did when asked, saying only that \u201cit\u2019s just an in-house deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my decision not to play David,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to play for us for a very long in the future, but, you know, unfortunately, it was not today.\u201d\n\nAmerson, who started the first 10 games of his second season and has 42 tackles, will be available next week for the Redskins\u2018 game at Indianapolis. He joined the rest of his teammates on the trip from the team hotel in Palo Alto to Levi\u2019s Stadium on Sunday morning, even going so far as to warm up before the game.\n\nWith Amerson out, Tracy Porter started alongside rookie Bashaud Breeland, with strong safety Trenton Robinson serving as the nickelback for most of the game. The Redskins began with Porter sliding over to cover the slot receiver with E.J. Biggers assuming Porter\u2019s role on the right side, but Biggers left the game with 12:46 remaining in the first quarter \u2014 the 49ers\u2019 third offensive snap \u2014 after colliding with inside linebacker Perry Riley and sustaining a concussion.\n\nBut then Porter left the game in the third quarter after sustaining a right shoulder injury, leaving Breeland and Greg Ducre, an undrafted rookie who joined the Redskins prior to their game at Arizona on Oct. 12, as the only healthy corners. Ducre, who had not played a snap on defense in two games, intercepted a pass intended for Anquan Boldin on his third play.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amerson had started the Redskins' first 10 games and had played roughly 90 percent of snaps this season.", "Author": "Zac Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Amerson had started the Redskins\u2019 first 10 games and had played roughly 90 percent of snaps this season.", "title": "David Amerson misses Redskins\u2019 game at San Francisco", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/23/david-amerson-will-miss-redskins-game-san-francisc/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/04/redskins-vikings-footballjpeg-08ac1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/04/redskins-vikings-footballjpeg-08ac1.jpg", "title": "David Amerson misses Redskins\u2019 game at San Francisco", "description": "Amerson had started the Redskins' first 10 games and had played roughly 90 percent of snaps this season.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Redskins, David Amerson, Jay Gruden"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d74\"", "article_summary": "With Amerson out, Tracy Porter started alongside rookie Bashaud Breeland, with strong safety Trenton Robinson serving as the nickelback for most of the game.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Amerson, one of the Redskins\u2018 two starting cornerbacks, was not present for the start of the meeting or missed it altogether.\nThe Redskins began with Porter sliding over to cover the slot receiver with E.J.\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 David Amerson did not play for the Washington Redskins in their 17-13 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday because he missed at least part of a team meeting late last week, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.\nDucre, who had not played a snap on defense in two games, intercepted a pass intended for Anquan Boldin on his third play."}
