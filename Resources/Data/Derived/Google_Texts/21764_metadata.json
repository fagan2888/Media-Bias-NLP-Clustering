Ross Douthat\u2019s Sunday column, as it so often does, offers the least unreasonable iteration of the deranged state of conservative thinking on Obamacare. While no longer collapsing spectacularly, Obamacare is now sadly limping along in disappointing fashion, remaining just healthy enough not to expire.\n\nTo bolster this case, Douthat makes four points against the law. Here they are in order. Individually, and collectively, they present a wildly misleading picture of a law that continues to work very well. Douthat:\n\n\n\nFirst, after the initial surge, Obamacare\u2019s enrollment numbers have mostly disappointed. Not in a catastrophic way \u2014 the law has knocked down the U.S. uninsured rate to about 11-12 percent, compared to a pre-Great Recession level of 14-15 percent. But depending on how you cut the numbers, it looks like the Obamacare exchanges will fall at least four million enrollees short of the target for 2016.\n\nFirst, note that Douthat compares the uninsured rate to its level before the recession \u2014 which assumes it would have returned to that level on its own. This is unlikely, since the uninsured rate has been rising for decades. If you want a complete, non-cherry-picked measure of the change in the uninsured rate, here it is:\n\nAnybody who actually cares about expanding access to insurance \u2014 as opposed to wanting to troll people who do \u2014 would consider that a historic success.\n\nWhat about the exchanges? Yes, they have fallen somewhat below projections, in part because employers have dumped fewer workers onto the exchanges. Sign-ups on the exchanges in advance of the 2016 deadline have accelerated over last year\u2019s rate, up 29 percent; the unexpected spike in sign-ups drove hospital stocks higher this week.\n\nDouthat continues:\n\n\n\nMoreover, the people who are enrolling are sicker and more heavily-subsidized than either the White House or the participating insurers had hoped; the healthy uninsured are often choosing to pay the fine (sorry, Chief Justice Roberts, I mean tax) and go without coverage. Which means the initially lower-than-expected premiums charged on the exchanges are headed upward, and major insurers may end up following United Healthcare for the exits if the numbers don\u2019t improve.\n\nWhen Obamacare started, health-care premiums came in far, far lower than expected. As Jonathan Cohn explains, they have floated back up to correct for the initial error, but still remain lower than forecast. And as Cohn also explains, United Healthcare is just one relatively small player in the exchange markets. Provider interest overall has risen, not fallen, as Cohn point out: \u201cMeanwhile, the average number of companies selling insurance on the marketplaces in each state rose from eight in 2014 to nine this year, and will be 10 next year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\u201d Exchange sign-ups among young customers have doubled this year over last, making Douthat's projection of sicker, more expensive risk pools look highly far-fetched.\n\n\n\n.@HHSGov says that more young Americans are signing up for Obamacare marketplace plans this year than last. pic.twitter.com/vp5qNlAxTW \u2014 Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) December 22, 2015\n\nDouthat:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the excited liberal claim that Obamacare has bent the overall health care cost curve downward looks, well, premature. After five years of slower-than-expected growth, cost growth spiked higher in 2014, a new Health Affairs paper indicates \u2014 driven, in part, by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansion.\n\nThis is just horribly misleading. Bending the cost curve was always designed to mean slowing the long-term growth of health-care costs. Designers of Obamacare expected and intended for overall health-care spending to spike in the first few years benefits became available \u2014 because millions of people who were denied medical care would now be able to get it! Obamacare is trying to restrain the price of medical care, not spend less by denying it to people who are too poor or sick to afford it on their own.\n\nThe difference between price and total spending level is essential to the entire theory of bending the cost curve. It is jaw-dropping to watch conservatives treat them like they\u2019re the same. Douthat and other leading intellectuals of the right, including Yuval Levin, have all cited this Health Affairs paper as evidence that Obamacare is failing to bend the curve. The headline of the paper reads, \u201cNational Health Spending in 2014: Faster Growth Driven by Coverage Expansion and Prescription Drug Spending.\u201d The point about prescription drug costs is a bit of a sidelight \u2014 drug-makers go through cycles, and currently a handful of very expensive new drugs have boosted prescription spending. But \u201cfaster growth driven by coverage expansion\u201d is not Obamacare failing to succeed. It\u2019s Obamacare succeeding! If we had faster growth driven by higher prices, it would be Obamacare failing to bend the curve. That is not happening:\n\nHealth care prices up 0.7% last 4Qs, very slow growth. Greater utilization by newly insured driving total spending. pic.twitter.com/u4xOodV2YW \u2014 Jason Furman (@CEAChair) December 22, 2015\n\nMore Douthat:\n\n\n\nThe bill delays not only Obamacare\u2019s medical-device tax, much hated by industry lobbyists, but also the so-called \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on high-cost insurance plans, which was crucial to the health care law\u2019s ambitions to be a deficit-reducing, cost-bending success. When Obamacare first passed, many conservatives expressed skepticism that its \u201ctaxes to be implemented later\u201d would actually be implemented; now we have evidence that they were right.\n\nThis is a real piece of bad news for Obamacare. The law created several mechanisms both to finance the cost of coverage and to bend the curve. The Cadillac Tax does both these things. The tax is really a withdrawal of the tax break for employer-provided insurance, applying only to the most expensive category of plans. The rationale for taking away the tax break for expensive insurance is to encourage employers to shop for cheaper plans for their workforce, and spend the money they would have used on insurance on wages, which would also be taxed as income, raising revenue.\n\nEconomists love this idea. Unfortunately, politicians hate it. The worst thing that\u2019s happened to Obamacare is that Democrats have revolted against the Cadillac Tax. President Obama had to agree to delay the tax\u2019s implementation for two years as part of the recent budget deal, in return for lots of good liberal policy (like tax breaks for green energy and low-income families). The Cadillac Tax would be in decent shape if Obama could just use his veto to keep it in place two years from now. The trouble is that Hillary Clinton, pressured by unions, has also come out against the Cadillac Tax. So now you have pro-union Democrats and anti-tax Republicans forming a coalition that looks like it can prevail starting in 2017, regardless of which party wins the election.\n\nSo, yes. Bad news for Obamacare, which looks like it has lost one of its many cost-control elements. But as bad as this news is for Obamacare, it\u2019s absolutely catastrophic for Obamacare replacement. Every Republican plan to replace Obamacare relies on the same financing mechanism: limiting or repealing the tax break for employer-sponsored insurance. The Cadillac Tax is a smaller, more painless version of this same policy. If both parties can\u2019t abide a partial rollback of the tax break for the most expensive health plans, they\u2019re never, ever going to go along with eliminating the entire tax break for all health plans. The conservatives cackling over the demise of the Cadillac Tax are delusional \u2014 it\u2019s as if they\u2019re watching the backlash against the Iraq War in 2008 with fingers tented, anticipating that this will encourage war-weary Americans to support a land invasion of Russia. The bipartisan support for maintaining the tax break for employer insurance will hurt Obamacare, but it can survive. The Republican plans to replace it would all be wiped out.\n\nThe Cadillac Tax debacle illustrates a crucial underlying reality of the politics of health-care reform: Change is incredibly difficult. That is why the United States staggered along for decades with a system that simultaneously spent far more per citizen than any other system in the world and cruelly denied treatment to millions. The compromises in the law are a function of this reality. Obamacare\u2019s drafters could not draw up a blue-sky plan as though they were free to design the system anew. They had to work around an entrenched reality, making the system more humane and efficient without unduly burdening those who feared change. That they managed to pass and implement such a reform in the face of hysterical opposition is a historic triumph, one with which the opposition, five-and-a-half years later, has not come to grips.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "We will stop correcting you when you stop being wrong.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "We will stop correcting you when you stop being wrong.", "title": "Sorry, Conservatives, Obamacare Is Still Working", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/sorry-conservatives-obamacare-is-still-working.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/22/22-obamacare.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We will stop correcting you when you stop being wrong.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/22/22-obamacare.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Sorry, Conservatives, Obamacare Is Still Working", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, ross douthat", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,ross douthat", "published_time": "2015-12-23T12:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, ross douthat", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "The trouble is that Hillary Clinton, pressured by unions, has also come out against the Cadillac Tax.\nThe worst thing that\u2019s happened to Obamacare is that Democrats have revolted against the Cadillac Tax.\nThe Cadillac Tax would be in decent shape if Obama could just use his veto to keep it in place two years from now.\nThe Cadillac Tax debacle illustrates a crucial underlying reality of the politics of health-care reform: Change is incredibly difficult.\nThe Cadillac Tax is a smaller, more painless version of this same policy."}
