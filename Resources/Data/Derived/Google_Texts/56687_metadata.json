Thanks, Adorable Care Act!\"\n\nThe Adorable Care Act social media campaign features several images of puppies, ponies and other baby animals alongside supportive messages of Obamacare, but the Obama administration insists it\u2019s not behind the precious political move.\n\nThe White House issued a statement Thursday saying it\u2019s not responsible for the cute campaign, but that \"the Adorable Care Act was highlighted by official White House channels as a creative way to raise awareness around the Affordable Care Act and HealthCare.gov.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked about the Adorable Care Act during his daily briefing, but he said he wasn\u2019t aware of it. However, he said he could understand the meme\u2019s popularity.\n\n\"Everybody loves cute animals,\" he said.\n\nCheck out some of @AdorableCareAct's too-cute tweets below.\n\nRT to spread the word\u2014healthcare till age 26 is good for cute kittens and human kids alike! pic.twitter.com/IpMoiIko0O \u2014 Adorable Care Act (@AdorableCareAct) September 26, 2013\n\nDon't be a sad panda - health insurance marketplaces open in just 5 days! pic.twitter.com/dKvanSJUxb \u2014 Adorable Care Act (@AdorableCareAct) September 25, 2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "The creative \u2014 and positively precious \u2014 social media campaign features baby animals alongside supportive messages of Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "MNN - Mother Nature Network", "description": "The creative \u2014 and positively precious \u2014 social media campaign features baby animals alongside supportive messages of Obamacare.", "title": "White House isn't behind 'Adorable Care Act'", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/stories/white-house-isnt-behind-adorable-care-act", "image": "http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2013/09/mouse.jpg.600x315_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.mnn.com", "description": "The creative \u2014 and positively precious \u2014 social media campaign features baby animals alongside supportive messages of Obamacare.", "title": "White House isn't behind 'Adorable Care Act'", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/stories/white-house-isnt-behind-adorable-care-act", "image": {"src": "http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2013/09/mouse.jpg.560x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg"}, "site": "mothernaturenet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Adorable Care Act, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, White House, Obama, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook"}, "article_summary": "The White House issued a statement Thursday saying it\u2019s not responsible for the cute campaign, but that \"the Adorable Care Act was highlighted by official White House channels as a creative way to raise awareness around the Affordable Care Act and HealthCare.gov.\"\npic.twitter.com/IpMoiIko0O \u2014 Adorable Care Act (@AdorableCareAct) September 26, 2013Don't be a sad panda - health insurance marketplaces open in just 5 days!\nThanks, Adorable Care Act!\"\nEarlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked about the Adorable Care Act during his daily briefing, but he said he wasn\u2019t aware of it.\npic.twitter.com/dKvanSJUxb \u2014 Adorable Care Act (@AdorableCareAct) September 25, 2013"}
