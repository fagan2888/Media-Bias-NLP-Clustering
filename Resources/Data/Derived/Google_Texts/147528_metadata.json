Cornyn referred to the president as \"AWOL.\"\n\n\"Don't Republicans also have to do their job?\" Shieffier shot back. \"[It's] almost like I\u2019m going to throw a brick through your window unless you give me $20.\"\n\nCornyn disagreed, saying that \"Ted [Cruz] and I share the concern about what Obamacare is doing to our economy.\"\n\nThe CBS host responded: \"But that's besides the point. The law has been passed. Why not keep the government running and then everybody can sit down and decide what they want to do about it?\"\n\nCornyn again tried to lay the blame on Democrats for not allowing Obamacare cuts to be part of a shutdown solution, but Schieffer quickly cut him off.\n\n\"Senator, isn\u2019t there something wrong when you say \"I won\u2019t fund the government unless I can attach my personal wish list to the legislation every time we vote? I\u2019d love to see the government find a cure for cancer, but I don\u2019t think you can say I\u2019m not going to pass and pass any funds for the rest of the government until the NIH finds a cure for cancer. I mean, isn\u2019t that just kind of the same thing here?\"\n\nSunday marks the sixth day since the government shutdown began, with Democrats and Republicans barely any closer to a compromise.\n\nWatch the 'Face The Nation' exchange above, and read more about the shutdown here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Face The Nation' host Bob Schieffer grilled Republican Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the government shutdown on Sunday.\n\nCornyn repeatedly blamed P...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-07 17:05:35 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "'Face The Nation' host Bob Schieffer grilled Republican Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the government shutdown on Sunday.\n\nCornyn repeatedly blamed P...", "title": "CBS Host Bursts Key GOP Talking Point", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/bob-schieffer-john-cornyn_n_4054600.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1391912/images/o-FACE-THE-NATION-CORNYN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Face The Nation' host Bob Schieffer grilled Republican Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the government shutdown on Sunday.\n\nCornyn repeatedly blamed P...", "creator": "achorowitz", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1391912/images/o-FACE-THE-NATION-CORNYN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "CBS Host Bursts Key GOP Talking Point", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-06 17:05:35 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4054600", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "bob schieffer face the nation,video,obamacare,Government Shutdown,Bob Schieffer tom cornyn,Face The Nation,Affordable Care Act,Bob Schieffer,government shutdown 2013,tom cornyn", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "bob schieffer face the nation,video,obamacare,Government Shutdown,Bob Schieffer tom cornyn,Face The Nation,Affordable Care Act,Bob Schieffer,government shutdown 2013,tom cornyn", "published_time": "2013-10-06 17:05:35 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-10-07 12:49:41 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "'Face The Nation' host Bob Schieffer grilled Republican Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the government shutdown on Sunday.\nCornyn again tried to lay the blame on Democrats for not allowing Obamacare cuts to be part of a shutdown solution, but Schieffer quickly cut him off.\nCornyn disagreed, saying that \"Ted [Cruz] and I share the concern about what Obamacare is doing to our economy.\"\nSunday marks the sixth day since the government shutdown began, with Democrats and Republicans barely any closer to a compromise.\nCornyn repeatedly blamed President Obama for refusing to negotiate on defunding or delaying the Affordable Care Act in exchange for raising the debt ceiling and ending the government shutdown."}
