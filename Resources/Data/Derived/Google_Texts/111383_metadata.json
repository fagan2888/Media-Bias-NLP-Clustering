I don\u2019t want us to go home until we get this done,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nSEE ALSO: Paul Ryan says Congress may miss Friday funding deadline\n\nThe bills already are two months overdue, with the fiscal year having begun on Oct. 1. The government has been operating on a \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d extending last year\u2019s spending levels in the meantime, but that authority expires Friday.\n\nCongress cleared the way for a full-year deal when it agreed to a new budget cap in late October, but both parties now are sparring over the policy add-ons, or \u201criders,\u201d attached to the $1.1 trillion spending bill.\n\nDemocrats said Republicans are pushing \u201cpoison pill\u201d riders that place a partisan agenda above sound fiscal policy, attempting to roll back President Obama\u2019s environmental agenda or freeze his plans to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S.\n\nSEE ALSO: Health official insists Obamacare exchanges are sustainable; GOP critics skeptical\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, blamed Democrats for pushing Congress to the budgetary brink by protecting Mr. Obama\u2019s regulatory overreach.\n\nThe parties also are struggling to meet halfway on a package to reauthorize certain tax breaks known as \u201cextenders.\u201d Though members would like to make many of the breaks permanent, House leaders filed a fall-back bill late Monday that extends them for two years.\n\nRepublican leaders have declined to reveal what deals they would have to strike to get Democrats\u2019 buy-in on GOP priorities, such as ending the ban on U.S. oil exports or adding a provision that hamstrings a part of Obamacare that protects insurers against heavy losses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna negotiate the deal with you,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican told reporters.\n\nFor their part, the White House and its Democratic allies accused Republicans Tuesday of putting special business interests ahead of Democrats\u2019 push to make permanent a child tax credit for families.\n\nThey also vowed to block any spending deal laden with GOP-favored riders that roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cUnless our Republican colleagues can move forward with a proposal that is bipartisan, it looks like we\u2019re heading toward another Republican shutdown of government,\u201d said Rep.
