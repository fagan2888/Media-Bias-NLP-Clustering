(WFSB)\n\nHere is the recipe for pecan shortbread cookies from Matthews 1812 House:\n\nMakes about 2 dozen cookies\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 cup flour\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n2 sticks of butter, room temperature\n\n2/3 cup powdered sugar + extra for decoration\n\n1 tsp vanilla\n\n2 tsp water\n\n2/3 cup chopped pecans\n\npecan halves for decoration\n\nInstructions:\n\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees.\n\nWhisk flour and salt together, set aside.\n\nCream butter and sugar together until well mixed.\n\nAdd vanilla and water , mix until combined.\n\nAdd flour mixture- combine well.\n\nAdd pecans, mix until the dough comes together. Keep mixing until dough is smooth and not crumbly.\n\nUse a 1\u201d cookie scoop to create level scoops (scrape excess on sides of bowl), or roll dough into 1\u201d balls. Scoops will create a rougher texture that shows off the pecans, rolled cookies will have a smoother top.\n\nGently push a pecan half onto the top of each ball for decoration, or leave plain if planning to roll in powdered sugar later.\n\nBake for 20 minutes or until bottom edges are slightly golden.\n\nIf you have not topped with a pecan, you can roll the cookies in powdered sugar immediately after taking them out of the oven. Roll warm cookies in sugar, set aside, move to the next cookie. Repeat, rolling each cookie 2-3 times until desired level of coating is achieved. Let cool.\n\nFor more information on Matthews 1812 House, click here.\n\nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
