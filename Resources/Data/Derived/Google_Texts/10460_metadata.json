( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images )\n\nYou may remember that San Francisco voters rejected a soda tax last fall. The tax failed to get the two-thirds vote it needed, but did get a solid majority \u2014 55 percent.\n\nThree San Francisco supervisors are taking that voter sentiment and moving ahead with proposed ordinances that \u2014 while short of a tax \u2014 would still regulate soda and other sugary beverages in other ways.\n\nYesterday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors Land Use Committee passed three ordinances with a \u201cpositive recommendation,\u201d meaning they recommend the full board pass all three.\n\nThe ordinances would require warning labels on advertising for soda and other sugary drinks, ban ads on city property and bar city departments from buying or selling the drinks.\n\nSupervisor Scott Wiener, one of the authors of the soda tax proposal, cited research showing negative health effects of the beverages.\n\n\u201cThese drinks are making our community less healthy and helping to accelerate disease in our community, Type 2 diabetes first and foremost,\u201d Wiener said.\n\nSpeakers lined up to testify in favor of the proposals, including doctors and advocates. But the American Beverage Association was represented as well, and dietitian Liz Katic, a consultant with the group, testified against the ordinances.\n\nShe said she agreed that obesity and related health problems are serious issues, \u201cbut I want to say it\u2019s overly simplistic, not to mention potentially misleading, to single out sugar-sweetened beverages as the driving cause of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.\u201d\n\nLocal moves like these ordinances in San Francisco are having some success where statewide efforts are stalling.\n\nBerkeley passed the first soda tax in the country last fall. Last week, the Davis City Council approved an ordinance requiring that all restaurants serving children\u2019s meals make milk or water the first choice offered \u2014 although parents can still request soda.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sacramento last month, both a statewide soda warning label and a 2-cents-an -ounce soda tax failed to get out of committee", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposed ordinances include a warning label on advertising -- and a ban on using city funds to buy or sell sugary beverages.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"San Francisco Supervisors Moving to Regulate Soda\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/06\\/02\\/san-francisco-supervisors-moving-to-regulate-soda\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-02 11:34:36\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-05-17 14:54:41\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":32798,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Soda\",\"Sugar-Sweetend Beverage\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/06\\/RS12629_166756038-e1433269916904.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Proposed ordinances include a warning label on advertising -- and a ban on using city funds to buy or sell sugary beverages.", "title": "San Francisco Supervisors Moving to Regulate Soda", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/06/02/san-francisco-supervisors-moving-to-regulate-soda/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/06/RS12629_166756038-1440x976.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "soda,sugar-sweetend beverage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO, CA - APRIL 16: Bottles of Coca-Cola sit in a cooler at a market on April 16, 2013, in San Francisco, California.\n( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images )You may remember that San Francisco voters rejected a soda tax last fall.\nMeanwhile, in Sacramento last month, both a statewide soda warning label and a 2-cents-an -ounce soda tax failed to get out of committee\nThree San Francisco supervisors are taking that voter sentiment and moving ahead with proposed ordinances that \u2014 while short of a tax \u2014 would still regulate soda and other sugary beverages in other ways.\nYesterday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors Land Use Committee passed three ordinances with a \u201cpositive recommendation,\u201d meaning they recommend the full board pass all three."}
