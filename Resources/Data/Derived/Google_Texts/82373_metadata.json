In other words, it\u2019s a failure of the imagination \u2014 which is a kind of arrogance \u2014 that\u2019s really to blame. \u201cI\u2019ve got my hammer, and that\u2019s all I need. Besides, have you ever seen a problem that didn\u2019t look like a nail?\u201d\n\nThis is a version of what academics call \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d \u2014 the tendency to accept only the facts that buttress your closely held views. It\u2019s a hot topic these days. Ezra Klein, a young liberal writer, has launched a news website, Vox.com, that purports to be the vanguard of something called \u201cexplanatory journalism\u201d (which is something of a redundancy, like culinary cooking or belligerent war). In his inaugural essay, Klein argues that conservatives and liberals alike are prone to confirmation bias, which he is here to fix.\n\nThis is a very old idea. Legendary journalist and one-time progressive intellectual Walter Lippmann argued the same sort of thing nearly a century ago. Like many progressives, Lippmann was an often deeply ideological advocate of purging competing ideologies from public life. We needed \u201cdisinterested\u201d servants who were free of the partisan or ideological bias.\n\nThe problem, as we discovered, was that disinterested public servants were deeply interested in their jobs and expanding the power of the state. The government was their hammer and we the people were the nails.\n\nThat went for newspapers, too. Lippmann wrote that \u201cgood reporting requires the exercise of the highest of the scientific virtues.\u201d Klein\u2019s effort seems like a newer version of the same thing. It has slideshow presentations telling the reader, for instance, \u201cEverything you need to know about the Internet\u201d (Al Gore sort of did invent it after all). Even his introductory essay, \u201cHow politics makes us stupid,\u201d focused heavily on what he finds to be conservative examples of confirmation bias, but Mr. Klein couldn\u2019t muster much of an effort to find examples of liberal confirmation bias.\n\nAt least he concedes it exists. Even that much of a concession New York Times columnist Paul Krugman cannot abide. He insists conservatives are more prone to confirmation bias because he and all the liberals he knows are so much more open-minded than conservatives.\n\nOf course, President Obama has the same mindset. He often talks about how he\u2019s not an ideologue but a pragmatist, and how he\u2019s essentially a disinterested public servant pushing no agenda other than what all the experts agree is the best policy \u2014 on health care, the environment, the economy, etc. He likes to say how he\u2019s open to new ideas from everywhere, but the new ideas he takes seriously just happen to come from the left and always involve more government. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s liberal, he\u2019s just right. Or, as Krugman once put it, \u201cThe facts have a liberal bias.\u201d\n\nSuch arrogant groupthink not only leads to bad policies, but it also reinforces a mass psychology that simply takes it for granted that liberals have sole access to the Truth. It\u2019s like having God on your side without having to believe in God.\n\nThis attitude isn\u2019t reserved for small technocratic squabbles. Sometimes government takes an active role, as when the Obama administration unilaterally decides that religious exemptions to Obamacare are illegitimate, at least for a bunch of nuns or companies such as Hobby Lobby.\n\nOther times, the truth-is-liberal crowd thinks it\u2019s okay to use government to punish the un-liberal philistines. No agency is supposed to be more disinterested than the IRS, but it appears that Lois Lerner considered neutrality to be something reserved for her ideological tribe.\n\nAnd sometimes this stuff spills out into the culture. As defenders of Brendan Eich\u2019s defenestration from Mozilla are right to note, the government didn\u2019t force him out. The company merely exercised its rights in a free society. The same goes for Brandeis University, which rescinded Ayaan Hirsi Ali\u2019s invitation for an honorary degree because she\u2019s considered politically incorrect for her criticism of Islam.\n\nBut the liberal tribe seems to champion such freedoms only when they line up with its own worldview. You can have all the freedom and autonomy you want, so long as it yields progressive ends. But if you don\u2019t want to bake a wedding cake for a gay wedding, or if you\u2019re a nun who doesn\u2019t want to pay for something you don\u2019t need and are morally opposed to, that\u2019s too bad. The right to be wrong, in liberals\u2019 eyes, is a right only liberals should have, even if, like Paul Krugman, you never need to exercise it. And, all too often, when you are wrong, that\u2019s when liberals bring out their hammers.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"title": "Liberals Have a Biased View of Confirmation Bias | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/04/14/biased_views_of_confirmation_bias_122252.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "title": "Liberals Have a Biased View of Confirmation Bias | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Liberals Have a Biased View of Confirmation Bias | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "media,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde878\"", "article_summary": "Even his introductory essay, \u201cHow politics makes us stupid,\u201d focused heavily on what he finds to be conservative examples of confirmation bias, but Mr. Klein couldn\u2019t muster much of an effort to find examples of liberal confirmation bias.\nIn his inaugural essay, Klein argues that conservatives and liberals alike are prone to confirmation bias, which he is here to fix.\nHe insists conservatives are more prone to confirmation bias because he and all the liberals he knows are so much more open-minded than conservatives.\nIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s liberal, he\u2019s just right.\nBesides, have you ever seen a problem that didn\u2019t look like a nail?\u201dThis is a version of what academics call \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d \u2014 the tendency to accept only the facts that buttress your closely held views."}
