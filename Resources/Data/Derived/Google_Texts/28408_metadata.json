On her own, Bacall, who died Aug. 12, figured out how to plant her chin against her long neck, look upward into the camera with those heavy-lidded eyes, and give what became known simply as \u201cThe Look.\u201d\n\n>> Photos: Famous People We\u2019ve Lost in 2014\n\nOperating on equal parts talent and instinct \u2013 and assisted by a $100-a-week contract from producer Howard Hawks \u2013 Bacall positioned herself as Hollywood\u2019s Next Big Thing, then launched herself on a career that spanned eight decades. In the months before she died, she was reportedly planning to play a role in Trouble Is My Business, a film noir inspired by the classic movies Bacall made in the 1940s with the love of her life, Humphrey Bogart.\n\nShe was 18 when she set foot on the set of her first film, To Have and Have Not, and there to greet her was her costar, the very famous and quite married Bogart. She was 19; he was 44. The men in the audience melted when she turned to Bogart and cooed:\n\nBogart was a goner, too. Hawks later said that Bogie fell in love with the strong-willed, world-wise character Bacall played, \u201cso she had to keep playing it the rest of her life.\u201d\n\nThe persona selection served her well. Bacall\u2019s tough-girl act saw her through a decade\u2019s worth of gritty dramas, including four with Bogart, whom she married in 1945. Films like The Big Sleep (1945), Key Largo (1948) and Young Man With a Horn (1950) cemented Bacall as the first lady of rain-swept streets, smoke-filled speakeasies and body-choked gutters.\n\nAfter her beloved Bogie died in 1957, she had a quick fling with Frank Sinatra (then again, didn\u2019t everybody?). In 1961 she married another gruff actor, Jason Robards Jr., but it appeared the married-to-a-hard-drinking-tough-guy thing was wearing thin. When they divorced in 1969, she attributed it to Robards\u2019 alcoholism.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nGood roles began to dry up for Bacall in the 1950s, and she turned to the New York stage, where over the next two decades she starred in four plays and won two Tony Awards. When she made a movie, it was usually a star-studded vehicle like Sex and the Single Girl (1964) or Murder on the Orient Express (1974). Whether she worked a lot or a little, though, Lauren Bacall\u2019s star status remained utterly untarnished. Nominated just once for an acting Oscar (The Mirror Has Two Faces in 1996, directed by Barbra Streisand), she was finally presented with an honorary statuette in 2009.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky in my life,\u201d the 84-year-old Bacall told the Academy. \u201cProbably luckier than I deserve.\n\n\u201cI feel very grateful that I\u2019m alive \u2026 I\u2019m here to stay, and you\u2019d better get used to the idea.\u201d\n\nAs usual, Lauren Bacall was right. She\u2019s here to stay.\n\n>> Visit (And Like!)
