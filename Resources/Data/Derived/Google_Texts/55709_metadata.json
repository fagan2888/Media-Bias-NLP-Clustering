Yet, citing the potential for injury, he has decided the game is just not worth it.\n\nLinebacker Chris Borland of the San Francisco 49ers, one of the top rookies in the N.F.L. last season, is the latest case, and perhaps the most noteworthy. He said Monday that he was retiring because of concerns about his safety, and his decision may have ripple effects well beyond the professional ranks. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve researched and what I\u2019ve experienced, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk,\u201d Borland told ESPN, referring to the multiple concussions he had sustained.\n\nWith his decision, Borland joins fellow 49er Patrick Willis, 30, who also announced that he would retire because of safety concerns. Willis was a seven-time All-Pro linebacker. Last year, it was 27-year-old Seatlle Seahawks wide receiver Sidney Rice who left the NFL because of weariness over the dangerous hits he was dealt. Cornerback Cortland Finnegan, 31, of the Miami Dolphins, quarterback Jake Locker, 26, of the Tennessee Titans, and linebacker Jason Worilds, 27, of the Pittsburgh Steelers have also said rather early goodbyes to the game this month, although they did not specify it was due to the risk of injury.\n\nSome would consider this a waste of talent. Others, like President Obama, would more than likely applaud their decision.\n\n\"I would not let my son play football,\" the president said in an interview with The New Yorker last year. \u201cAnd I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence. \u201cIn some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players, and those of us who are fans maybe won\u2019t have to examine our consciences quite as much.\u201d\n\nActually, most football fans aren\u2019t worried about their consciences \u2013 they\u2019re worried about the next touchdown.\n\nFootball certainly comes with a little more than bangs and bruises. Concussions are serious injuries and have the potential to develop into something worse. Some have proposed new helmets with stronger materials to help make the game safer.\n\nBut, the truth is, there are risks in any sports profession. Hockey players are slammed against the boards, soccer players run grueling miles every match, and tennis players often suffer from tendinitis.\n\nWhy do they continue taking the abuse? They love the game.\n\nIn her Townhall piece featured last year, \u201cWelcome to the No Fun Left,\u201d Elisabeth Meinecke quoted former NFL player Burgess Owens on his decision to choose passion over panic.\n\nThe bottom line, however, is injury in any activity is neither unavoidable nor guaranteed. \u201cAt the end of the day, there are risks, there\u2019s no question, in any sport, any activity,\u201d says Owens, who played defensive back and was taught to hit the old-fashioned\u2014and far more dangerous\u2014way before he retired in 1982. \u201cEveryone has to decide the risk factor,\u201d he continues later. \u201cThings are going to happen that you cannot foresee. You have to decide whether the risk is worth the enjoyment, and what you\u2019re getting out of it. Personally, the risk was so worth it for me, because of what I learned from the sport.\u201d\n\nPlayers like Owens don\u2019t only step on the field to score touchdowns. A few of the valuable lessons football players take away from the sport include: running toward challenges, not shrinking from them, the value of teamwork, dealing with adversity and developing a tough-as-nails spirit.\n\nThe positive effect of the game is perhaps best summed up in this Chicago Tribune reporter's poignant analysis:\n\nOn the football field, adversity comes with every snap. The game teaches kids that when they get knocked down, the only response is to get up.\n\nChris Borland and his fellow ex-NFLers certainly have the right to do what they think is best for them and their families. Yet, I hope remaining NFL stars are listening to their heart, and not their fears. If they love what they do, I hope they don't follow suit. Instead, I hope they suit up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fear mongering in the NFL..05/26/2016 4:00:27AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Fear mongering in the NFL.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Obama Would be Proud: Talented Players Leave NFL Citing Safety Concerns", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/03/24/obama-would-be-proud-promising-rookies-leave-nfl-citing-safety-concerns-n1974785", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/76/2015-03-17T234504Z_1_LYNXMPEB2G14P_RTROPTP_3_NFL.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Fear mongering in the NFL.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Obama Would be Proud: Talented Players Leave NFL Citing Safety Concerns", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/03/24/obama-would-be-proud-promising-rookies-leave-nfl-citing-safety-concerns-n1974785", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/76/2015-03-17T234504Z_1_LYNXMPEB2G14P_RTROPTP_3_NFL.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Would be Proud: Talented Players Leave NFL Citing Safety Concerns, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcddd6\"", "article_summary": "Hockey players are slammed against the boards, soccer players run grueling miles every match, and tennis players often suffer from tendinitis.\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve researched and what I\u2019ve experienced, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk,\u201d Borland told ESPN, referring to the multiple concussions he had sustained.\nSan Francisco 49er Linebacker Chris Borland is a talented young player who had a promising career in the NFL.\nWith his decision, Borland joins fellow 49er Patrick Willis, 30, who also announced that he would retire because of safety concerns.\nYet, citing the potential for injury, he has decided the game is just not worth it."}
