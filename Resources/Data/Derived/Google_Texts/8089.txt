The Jersey City Reservoir will be home to two free activities for the whole family this weekend from hanging out with birds of prey to kayaking.

Today the Jersey City Police Department will bring some red-tailed hawks, osprey and other birds into this urban setting for “Raptors at the Res,” and from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. attendees can get a close look at the beautiful birds.

Tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., the Hoboken Cove Boathouse will provide kayaks for anyone to come take a ride on the water. Quick-drying synthetic clothing is recommended for safety and comfort.

Both events will take place at Jersey City Reservoir No. 3, south gate on Jefferson Avenue between Central and Summit avenues.

All minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. There is no charge for either event, but donations will be accepted.

The events are sponsored by the City of Jersey City and the Department of Recreation. For more information, visit facebook.com/jcreservoir.
