(NEW YORK DAILY NEWS) – Russian authorities have opened an investigation after CCTV footage surfaced showing a doctor punching a patient to death in a hospital.

The Dec. 29 video, pulled from a hospital in Belgorod, shows a man — who The Telegraph identified as Ilya Zelendinov – dragging a shirtless patient off an exam table and pushing him into another room.

Allegedly, the patient kicked a nurse earlier in the day, so when Zelendinov confronts him, he demands, “Why did you touch the nurse?”

A second man in a black coat tries to interfere and the surgeon, who Russian media have dubbed “the boxer doctor,” hauls off and beats him in a corner.

Then, he does an about-face and goes after the patient again, landing a quick one-two punch that leaves the victim apparently dead in the middle of the examination room.

The man in the black coat tries to step in again, and the purple-shirted doc tosses a chair out of the way and punches him till he’s curled up in fetal position.

The doctor turns to leave, but then comes back to interrogate the still-conscious man in fetal position as the nurses flee the room.
