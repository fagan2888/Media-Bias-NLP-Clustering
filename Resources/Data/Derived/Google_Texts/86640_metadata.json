Billy Long was not a very effective legislator in the last Congress, according to a new analysis examining lawmakers\u2019 legislative success.\n\nAmong Missouri\u2019s nine House members, Long, R-Springfield, earned the lowest score from the Legislative Effectiveness Project, a new website developed by two political scientists at Vanderbilt University and University of Virginia.\n\nLong scored \u201cwell below expectations,\u201d said Craig Volden, one of the website\u2019s creators and a professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nLong strongly defended his record in Congress, noting that he sits on one of the most powerful committees in the House \u2014 the Energy and Commerce Committee \u2014 which has held a bevy of hearings and cranked out substantive legislation.\n\n\u201cI am an active member of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee,\u201d Long said in a statement to the News-Leader.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the data from Legislative Effectiveness Project does not capture every aspect of a House members\u2019 job. For example, it doesn\u2019t take into account lawmakers\u2019 efforts to help their constituents with Social Security benefits or Veterans Affairs\u2019 claims. It also doesn\u2019t include lawmakers\u2019 efforts to hold federal agencies accountable for how they spend taxpayer dollars and how they implement government regulations.\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress serve lots of different roles,\u201d said Volden. \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on is the lawmaking role.\u201d\n\nAnd at a time when Congress is divided and deadlocked, it is particularly difficult to be effective.\n\n\u201cAn average bill, once sponsored, has about a 4 percent chance of becoming law,\u201d said Volden. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be an effective member.\u201d\n\nOnly one Missouri lawmaker \u2014 Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth \u2014 landed in the website\u2019s highest category of \u201cabove expectations.\u201d Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, and others were in the middle \u2014 earning a \u201cmeets expectations\u201d label.\n\nThe website, unveiled at a news conference last week, uses 15 factors to calculate how successful lawmakers are in pushing their legislative priorities. Among other things, the yardsticks include: the number of bills each lawmaker has introduced, how substantive those proposals are, and how far in the legislative process each measure has gone.\n\nVolden and his partner on the effectiveness project, Alan Wiseman, an associate professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, also took into account how much seniority and power each lawmaker has. For example, they set a lower expectations \u201cbenchmark\u201d for someone like Long, who was in his first term in the 112th Congress and did not chair any committees or subcommittees.\n\nVolden and Wiseman did not examine senators\u2019 effectiveness, saying the rules of that chamber made it more difficult to track bills at different stages of the legislative process.\n\nIn the new analysis, Long received a \u201clegislative effectiveness score\u201d of .162. His benchmark \u2014 where the two political scientists said Long should score given his seniority and other factors \u2014 was set at .829.\n\nHartlzer had the same benchmark, and she earned a score of .580. There is no data available yet on Rep. Jason Smith, R-Salem, who won a seat in the House in June 2013, after GOP Rep. Jo Ann Emerson retired.\n\nThe data shows that Long introduced four bills in the 112th Congress, but only one of those received any committee action, such as a hearing or a vote. Hartzler introduced five bills and one passed the House, although it did not become law.\n\nSteve Walsh, a spokesman for Hartzler, said his boss is effective in many ways that this analysis doesn\u2019t measure \u2014 from hosting job fairs and youth leadership summits to listening to voters at roundtables and other forums. He said another accomplishment not reflected in the data was pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change a management plan for a hydroelectric plant at the Lake of the Ozarks, which could have led to the destruction of 1,200 homes.\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness of a lawmaker entails more than bills a legislator has sponsored and passed,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt means making a difference for the people she serves by fighting for the people of her district \u2014 taking their views and values to DC, plus helping them in tangible ways to make government work for them; not against them.\u201d\n\nLong said he has \u201cprovided active oversight\u201d of the Obama administration\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act and worked diligently to advance bills sponsored by other lawmakers on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nLong\u2019s spokesman also noted that the congressman is among a handful who have not missed any House votes in this Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen legislation is debated and voted on in the House it is imperative that the 7th district is heard, and their voice is heard through my votes,\u201d Long said.\n\nVolden said that lawmakers who are the most effective in pushing their legislative priorities showed perseverance, media savvy, and the ability to build coalitions, among other traits.\n\nAlthough the Legislative Effectiveness Project leaves out many elements of how lawmakers exercise power and shape policy, it offers one of the most comprehensive ways to measure effectiveness. Other organizations and advocacy groups rate lawmakers on certain votes, but those often have a partisan slant and relate to a single issues or narrow agendas, such as gun rights or abortion.\n\nReporter Deirdre Shesgreen writes for The News-Leader from Gannett\u2019s offices in Washington, D.C.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nRep.
