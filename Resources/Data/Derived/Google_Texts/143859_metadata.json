Obamacare is killing jobs. There are fewer people working, but that\u2019s okay because the unemployment rate still dropped last month. Obamacare is good because it helps the poor.\n\nAre you fed up with the U.S. federal government\u2019s \u201cspin\u201d and never-ending efforts to make the politicians\u2019 plans work, while our plans to create a livelihood and a future get trampled? Americans have enabled their politicians to impose some very selfish and destructive public policy, and most all of us are suffering the consequences of it. Meanwhile, our needs for work and sustenance press on.\n\nLast week, Author Michael Snyder of TheEconomicCollapseBlog.Com published a striking editorial exposing grave realities for America\u2019s youth, entitled \u201c30 Statistics About Americans Under The Age of 30 That Will Blow Your Mind.\u201d The data points are easy enough for anyone to locate and verify, but Snyder compiled quite a succinct list.\n\nHarsh realities like \u201cthe labor force participation rate for men in the 18 to 24 year old age bracket is at an all-time low,\u201d and \u201cin 2007, the unemployment rate for the 20 to 29 year old age bracket was about 6.5 percent,\u201d yet today the unemployment rate for that same age group is about 13 percent - these and other staggering statistics provide a grim picture for America\u2019s future. Snyder also notes that adults under the age of 30 face, in many ways, far less economic opportunity than previous generations. This is a very new development, indeed \u2013 America\u2019s best days have always been yet to come.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news: some of the same young Americans caught in this horrific statistical picture are taking it upon themselves to make changes. While many of them played by the rules and went to college and are now discovering that the degree wasn\u2019t actually \u201cjob training,\u201d some of them are humbling themselves and offering to, in essence, work for free as an intern for a period of time, with the hopes of gaining some valuable work experience and an \u201cedge\u201d in the already slim job market.\n\nThe ambition of these frustrated young Americans is admirable. But it also raises a question: why should the concept of \u201cinternship\u201d only be applied to college students and recent graduates? Why not get junior high and high school students \u201cinterning\u201d as well?\n\nOver the past twenty years or so, K-12 educators in the U.S. have almost universally begun to encourage kids in the ways of \u201cvolunteerism.\u201d While the emphasis is usually on volunteering in some sort of non-profit context \u2013 the animal shelter, the blood bank, the rescue mission \u2013 the goal of getting kids focused on other people\u2019s needs is noble, and the activity can pay great dividends.\n\nBut why most \u201cvolunteerism\u201d and \u201cinterning\u201d be so separate? Why, when we commonly think of college students as being good for internships, must we think of junior high and high school kids as only good for non-profit \u201cvolunteerism?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to begin thinking in terms of \u201cvolunteer interning\u201d \u2013 that is, getting school kids in the door at both commercial businesses and non-profit organizations, to offer help when and where they can, but to also learn as much as they can. As both a parent and a business owner, I\u2019ve had some experience with this.\n\nWhen, as a 7th grader my son went to his junior high school teacher and said \u201cI\u2019d like to complete my volunteerism assignment at a commercial business,\u201d he was initially met with explanations as to why that was not acceptable.\n\nBut after a few parent-teacher meetings and with some careful planning and navigation, my son\u2019s \u201cvolunteer internship\u201d went on to be a great success, not only paying great dividends for him but also changing some hearts and minds among the school staff.\n\nAmerica desperately needs to raise up new generations of young people who both appreciate, and understand for \u2013profit, private enterprise, and getting kids in the door at such operations is a good start. But consider and follow these guidelines, so as to avoid hardship down the line.\n\nA) Parents must take the lead on this - school counselors are accustomed to getting students involved in charity efforts, but generally not getting kids placed in \"internships\" in for profit businesses. Moms and dads have to take the initiative to get their kids involved in this type of endeavor -just as they might do with their kids\u2019 sports activities \u2013 and not simply \u201cleave it to the school.\u201d If after getting a volunteer internship set-up it makes sense to involve school officials, then so be it. But parents who want this for their child need to plan on initiating it.\n\nB) Keep it within the confines of the law - parents and business owners must investigate and see if an internship for an under-age minor is legal in their jurisdiction, and under what terms. In today\u2019s climate business owners are always at risk for city, county, state and federal authorities fining them for being \u201cout of compliance,\u201d even for the most innocuous of matters. Parents and business owners should seek legal guidance to make sure their plans for a volunteer internship are in full compliance.\n\nC) Parents and kids, both, should search for opportunities \u2013 a child who is sufficiently articulate and confident to \u201ccold call\u201d a business is a child who stands out among others. But parents should guide the process of finding a business that will help develop an internship, and take full responsibility for the child\u2019s safety in the process.\n\nAmerica\u2019s economic future is daunting, especially for younger generations. Are today\u2019s parents willing to take the initiative and try to make things better?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The jobs report wasn\u2019t as bad as anticipated..05/26/2016 19:46:13PM EST.", "author": "Austin Hill", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The jobs report wasn\u2019t as bad as anticipated.", "title": "- Let\u2019s Ensure A Productive Future For America\u2019s Youth", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2013/10/06/lets-ensure-a-productive-future-for-americas-youth-n1718099", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/278/33de220e-cd2d-4d71-8f79-422777480b2c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The jobs report wasn\u2019t as bad as anticipated.", "title": "- Let\u2019s Ensure A Productive Future For America\u2019s Youth", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2013/10/06/lets-ensure-a-productive-future-for-americas-youth-n1718099", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/278/33de220e-cd2d-4d71-8f79-422777480b2c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Let\u2019s Ensure A Productive Future For America\u2019s Youth, Austin Hill, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Why not get junior high and high school students \u201cinterning\u201d as well?\nParents and business owners should seek legal guidance to make sure their plans for a volunteer internship are in full compliance.\nSnyder also notes that adults under the age of 30 face, in many ways, far less economic opportunity than previous generations.\nThis is a very new development, indeed \u2013 America\u2019s best days have always been yet to come.\nAmerica\u2019s economic future is daunting, especially for younger generations."}
