We have two kids. He never had insurance,\u201d said Kleinmann, president of the hospitality trade organization Industree. \u201cI just kept thinking, something has to change. Something has to get better.\u201d\n\nLast week Kleinmann, 33, rolled out Industree Exchange, a private insurance exchange geared at Washington-area restaurants and bars with more than 100 employees.\n\nThe idea, she said, was to make it as simple \u2014 and affordable \u2014 as possible for local eateries and bars to comply with new employer mandates that go into effect next year. Under the Affordable Care Act, businesses with 100 or more full-time workers must provide health-care benefits by Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cEvery single option has been designed, negotiated and built specifically for the demographics of the restaurant industry,\u201d Kleinmann, founder and chief executive, said. \u201cThey keep you in compliance with Obamacare and they\u2019re completely affordable.\u201d\n\nAlisia Kleinmann, founder and chief executive of Industree Exchange. (Jeffrey MacMillan/For The Washington Post )\n\nIn addition to more than 15 full-coverage options by United Healthcare and Cigna, the exchange offers a number of \u201cskinny plans.\u201d Those options, which are provided by Loomis, range from $61 to $91 per month and offer the bare minimum: Preventative care, flu shots, prescription medication and a handful of outpatient procedures.\n\n\u201cUp until now, you get offered two or three different choices, or you get offered nothing,\u201d Kleinmann said. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s out there is completely unaffordable to a huge part of the restaurant industry, specifically the back-of-the-house guys.\u201d\n\nRW Restaurant Group, which has 250 full-time employees and oversees seven restaurants including Brasserie Beck and Marcel\u2019s, was one of the first local companies to sign on.\n\n\u201cWhen Obamacare was passed, we became very concerned about how we were going to pay for coverage for our employees,\u201d said Frank T. Shull, a partner and chief operating officer at the company.\n\nUnder the restaurant group\u2019s current plan (which is offered to executives and other select employees), the company must pay $400 per month per employee for health-care benefits.\n\n\u201cYou take that figure, $400, and multiply it by 250 people \u2014 that\u2019s $100,000 per month we\u2019d be spending,\u201d Shull said. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t something we could do.\u201d\n\nInstead, the company will offer basic insurance \u2014 for about $100 per month \u2014 from Industree Exchange to its 250 full-time employees.\n\n\u201cWe want our employees to have health-care, but it had to be affordable,\u201d Shull said. \u201cWe have seven restaurants, but we\u2019re not a big company like IBM.\u201d\n\nIt took about six months for Kleinmann to set up the exchange, which is a joint project between Industree and M&T Insurance Agency, a subsidiary of M&T Bank. Liazon, which operates private exchanges, provided the back-end technology and invoicing systems.\n\nKleinmann, formerly a private chef and meeting planner, got licensed as an insurance broker in early 2013 so she could oversee the process. Kleinmann said she did not invest any money up front because M&T and Liazon footed start-up costs for the exchange.\n\n\u201cThe good news was that Liazon had already built the model, so it didn\u2019t take long to get the store up and running,\u201d said Kevin Gannon, vice president at M&T Insurance Agency.\n\nMany of the plans, Kleinmann said, are tailored to hospitality workers, who tend to be relatively young and in good health. Some of the exchange\u2019s providers, such as Loomis, also provide extended customer service hours to accommodate workers\u2019 schedules.\n\n\u201cA lot of exchanges have everything on the shelves of their stores \u2014 hundreds and hundreds of products,\u201d said Kleinmann, who purchases health insurance for herself through Maryland\u2019s public exchange. \u201cI wanted to trim it down for a very specific demographic.\u201d\n\nThe first round of enrollments will go into effect Aug. 1.\n\nKleinmann plans to create a companion Web site in Spanish and expand to other parts of the country. But for now, she said she\u2019s focused on getting local restaurants to sign up.\n\n\u201cWashington has been a great launchpad,\u201d Kleinmann said. \u201cThere is a real need for something like this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The exchange, which debuted last week, is tailored for local restaurants with more than 100 employees.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abhabhattarai", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The exchange, which debuted last week, is tailored for local restaurants with more than 100 employees.", "title": "Restaurant-specific insurance exchange debuts in D.C.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/restaurant-specific-insurance-exchange-debuts-in-dc/2014/07/03/a6a709c4-fb12-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/26/Others/Images/2014-06-26/DR2A37311403804225.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@abhabhattarai"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/restaurant-specific-insurance-exchange-debuts-in-dc/2014/07/03/a6a709c4-fb12-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiznews", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abhabhattarai"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a6a709c4-fb12-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiznews"}, "article_summary": "Something has to get better.\u201dLast week Kleinmann, 33, rolled out Industree Exchange, a private insurance exchange geared at Washington-area restaurants and bars with more than 100 employees.\n\u201cThey keep you in compliance with Obamacare and they\u2019re completely affordable.\u201dAlisia Kleinmann, founder and chief executive of Industree Exchange.\n\u201cIt just isn\u2019t something we could do.\u201dInstead, the company will offer basic insurance \u2014 for about $100 per month \u2014 from Industree Exchange to its 250 full-time employees.\n\u201cThe good news was that Liazon had already built the model, so it didn\u2019t take long to get the store up and running,\u201d said Kevin Gannon, vice president at M&T Insurance Agency.\nHe never had insurance,\u201d said Kleinmann, president of the hospitality trade organization Industree."}
