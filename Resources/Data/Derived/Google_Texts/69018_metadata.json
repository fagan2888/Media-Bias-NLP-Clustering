But afterward, Murthy shared his thoughts with the news media.\n\n\u201cI think Roanoke is a great example of a community that is facing big challenges \u2026 but is actually doing something about it,\u201d Murthy said, referring to the level of collaboration he saw among the public, nonprofit, educational and community groups that he met with.\n\nAs the federal official tasked with giving Americans the best information on how to improve their health, Murthy said he saw evidence here of what he considers the country\u2019s most pressing public health concern: the prevalence of obesity and chronic illnesses such as diabetes.\n\n\u201cI believe those are generating the greatest toll for us in terms of lives lost, in terms of disabilities, in terms of dollars spent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe medical costs for people who are obese are 42 percent higher than for those who are not, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roanoke\u2019s obesity rate of 34 percent is higher than the state rate of 28 percent, a recent community health needs assessment reported.\n\nMurthy cited two local programs that impressed him: an emphasis on nutrition in public schools and a \u201cFarmacy Garden\u201d at the New River Valley Community Health Center, where patients are prescribed fresh produce grown just behind\n\nthe clinic as a way to combat obesity and chronic health problems.\n\nRoanoke was the third stop on Murthy\u2019s tour. He visited Birmingham, Alabama, last week and Richmond earlier Tuesday.\n\nNew to the job, Murthy was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in December after being nominated by President Barack Obama. At 37, he is the second youngest surgeon general in the country\u2019s history.\n\nMurthy said his age gives him the opportunity to reach out to both the young and old. \u201cWe need to bridge the gap between generations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to speak to both the older and younger generations.\u201d\n\nAs part of his tour, the surgeon general is also promoting the Affordable Care Act and encouraging people to sign up for health insurance, which is available through a government website at subsidized rates for those who cannot afford it.\n\nHe politely sidestepped a question about uncertainties with the law, which is under attack by Republicans in Congress while also facing a legal test before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI approach this as a physician,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a legislator, and I\u2019m not a judge.\u201d\n\nBut with insurance plans that are currently available and affordable, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we get the message out to people.\u201d\n\nJanine Underwood, who sat in on the discussion as executive director of the Bradley Free Clinic, said she was impressed by what she saw and heard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very refreshing to see him come down to the community level and see the challenges that we face,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cHe took lots of notes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "America\u2019s doctor made a house call to Roanoke on Tuesday.", "title": "U.S. surgeon general checks the pulse of Roanoke area", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/virginia/u-s-surgeon-general-checks-the-pulse-of-roanoke-area/article_a7dc254e-9cc3-5f9a-b660-bfc0a0b79b7e.html", "image": {"width": 271, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/ed/eed1f6d8-4273-5968-8cf1-1e509404ee30/54c8230b17671.preview-200.jpg?resize=271%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "America\u2019s doctor made a house call to Roanoke on Tuesday.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "virginia,med_beat", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "virginia,med_beat"}, "article_summary": "Surgeon General Vivek Murthy spent about an hour speaking with officials from more than a dozen health care and community organizations.\nAt 37, he is the second youngest surgeon general in the country\u2019s history.\nTuesday\u2019s hour-long session was closed to the general public.\nRoanoke\u2019s obesity rate of 34 percent is higher than the state rate of 28 percent, a recent community health needs assessment reported.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very refreshing to see him come down to the community level and see the challenges that we face,\u201d Underwood said."}
