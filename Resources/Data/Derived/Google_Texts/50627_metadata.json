But you do not need to be a government or Fortune 100 company to #AidRefugees,\u201d the White House\u2019s director of product Joshua Miller wrote in a blog post.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKickstarter, the crowdfunding website, on Tuesday launched a campaign for the coming week to encourage donations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The company recently reincorporated as a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d company, and its chief executive said the Syria campaign was meant to \u201cbring the most basic necessities to people who need them dearly.\u201d\n\nPeople can spend anywhere from $15 to provide someone with a sleeping bag, to $600 to provide a year of education to a child.\n\nInstacart is a company that allows people to order groceries online for delivery. When checking out, customers on the site will also be encouraged to buy groceries for refugee families, with donations going to the UN.\n\nAirbnb is providing housing credits to aid workers in and around Syria and matching others' donations. Twitter also recently unveiled its donate button for nongovernmental organizations. The White House said the feature was unveiled early at the president\u2019s call.\n\nThe four-year-old civil war in Syria has displaced millions of people in the region and put a strain on neighboring countries.\n\nThe White House recently announced its intention to allow 85,000 refugees into the country in 2016 \u2014 a 15,000-person increase from this year. That number is expected to reach 100,000 in 2017.\n\nThe government has also donated $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid.\n\nOnly about 1,600 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States, and only a fraction of the expanded refugee population will come from Syria. Republicans, however, have questioned the cost and safety of allowing Syrian refugees into the country.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "At Obama's urging, Kickstarter and others are launching campaigns to aid refugees.", "description": "At Obama's urging, Kickstarter and others are launching campaigns to aid refugees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "At Obama's urging, Kickstarter and others are launching campaigns to aid refugees.", "title": "Obama pushes tech firms to aid Syrian refugees", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/256034-white-house-pressures-tech-on-syrian-refugee-aid", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/syrianrefugees09212015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/256034-white-house-pressures-tech-on-syrian-refugee-aid", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-06T10:12-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Syria, Syrian refugees,,Kickstarter, Instacart, Twitter, Airbnb", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-06T10:12:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/256034-white-house-pressures-tech-on-syrian-refugee-aid", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "At Obama's urging, Kickstarter and others are launching campaigns to aid refugees.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama pushes tech firms to aid Syrian refugees"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama pushes tech firms to aid Syrian refugees"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd67f\"", "article_summary": "The White House recently announced its intention to allow 85,000 refugees into the country in 2016 \u2014 a 15,000-person increase from this year.\nTwitter also recently unveiled its donate button for nongovernmental organizations.\nThe White House is pushing technology companies \u2014 from Kickstarter to Instacart \u2014 to roll out campaigns to help with the refugee crisis in Syria.\nPresident Obama wants the tech campaigns to encourage ordinary citizens to help out, calling it a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d that extends past government aid and Fortune 100 companies.\nOnly about 1,600 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States, and only a fraction of the expanded refugee population will come from Syria."}
