Flying high had obvious advantages, allowing for evasion of enemies as well as quicker travel time through thin air at high altitudes.\n\nBut it also posed serious risks \u2014 perhaps not as much to the planes as to the people inside them.\n\nDr. Jay Dean, a physiology professor at the University of South Florida and the director of its Hyperbaric Biomedical Research Laboratory, said there were two enemies during the war: the enemy with gunfire, and the environment.\n\n\u201cWinning the air war was dependent on getting enough oxygen and not freezing,\u201d Dean said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this in the movies. Hollywood doesn\u2019t always work this in.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlying back then was a rough deal,\u201d Dean added. Most planes were not pressurized, so as they climbed the skies, the oxygen level dropped, and with oxygen masks only in their infancy, airmen (and women) were at risk of passing out and even death. Decompression sickness, similar to divers\u2019 bends, was also common.\n\nUnpressurized planes also meant flying unprotected through subzero temperatures (as low as minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit) for several hours at a time. \u201cPhysiologists helped them at least survive and tolerate the conditions better,\u201d Dean said.\n\nDean will speak about the evolution of aviation medicine during WWII at a lecture Thursday titled \u201cYour Body in Flight During World War II: How American Physiologists Learned to Protect the Health of Airmen in the World\u2019s First High Altitude, High Speed Air War,\u201d at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition Evening Lecture Series in Pensacola.\n\nAt the start of the war, U.S. aviation medicine was behind Germany\u2019s, but by the end of the war, researchers had contributed to the development of game-changing technologies like the oxygen mask and the G-suit, a puffy pantsuit that inflates with air to prevent blood pooling that occurs when planes accelerate and gravitational pull increases.\n\n\u201cAs (the plane) is pulling a sharp turn, your heart has a hard time pumping blood to your head and eyes, so you could lose vision and consciousness in a matter of seconds,\u201d Dean said. G-suits prevented blood pooling, keeping airmen clear-headed enough to wage war.\n\n\u201cWhen we started using G-suits, we doubled our kill numbers,\u201d Dean said. \u201cWe could outperform our enemy in a dog fight and turn sharper than they could.\u201d\n\nCrane is IHMC communications manager.\n\nWant to go?\n\nWhat: IHMC\u2019s Evening Lecture Series.\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. Thursday (reception at 5:30).\n\nWhere: IHMC, 40 S.
