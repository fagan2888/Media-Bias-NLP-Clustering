View Full Caption DNAinfo/Andrea V. Watson\n\nCHATHAM \u2014 While 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he shares residents' concerns about loitering and littering by patients of a local methadone clinic, he said that it\u2019s up to the community to find middle ground with the clinic's owner.\n\nTo that end, both community members and the owners of the clinic, Nuway Community Services, agreed to serve on a task force that will try to come up with solutions to the problem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in this being my task force, this is the community\u2019s initiative,\" Sawyer said. \"This is not anything I\u2019m trying to take credit for, this is the community\u2019s problem, this is the community\u2019s solution.\"\n\nLoitering and littering outside Nuway Community Services, 110 E. 79th St., has upset some residents. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Andrea V. Watson\n\nTensions rose at a town hall meeting called by Sawyer and held Saturday at the Greater Institutional Church, 7800 S. Indiana Ave. Sawyer invited the owner of Nuway Community Services, at 110 E. 79th St., to come out and listen to the concerns and complaints of the residents.\n\nSawyer said that while many people call his office to complain, few are making their concerns known to the city\u2019s Business Affairs and Consumer Protection office. There wasn\u2019t a single registered complaint when he checked recently, he said.\n\nWhile the community's concerns about the methadone clinic have come up before, Saturday\u2019s meeting was an opportunity to figure out how both sides can coexist, Sawyer said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on here that we need to clear the air about,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s air this out and discuss openly and honestly, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll get anything done.\"\n\nThat wasn\u2019t an issue for anyone who attended Saturday's meeting.\n\nSawyer was interrupted several times throughout the meeting by upset residents who want the clinic to leave the area; they say its patients loiter outside excessively and leave trash on the streets.\n\nOne woman said it\u2019s \u201cnot fair\u201d that the clinic is located near her home because she believes it lowers property values. Others shouted that the clinic should move because it\u2019s an eyesore and the owner can\u2019t control the people who use it.\n\nBut Nuway president Olajide Solola told residents he has the neighborhood's best interest in mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from the community. I live in this community, and I want the best for this community. That is why I moved the program to 79th Street, so that I could help,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that 95 percent of the center's clients come from the area.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the community to go down,\u201d Solola said.\n\nSheila Chew, an office manager with IMAGES, a counseling agency that works with Nuway, said that the organization has had a positive influence on many of its clients and deserves to stay.\n\nBut Cee Powell, vice president of the Greater Chatham Alliance, said she was concerned about the safety of children in the area.\n\nWhile she has a 13-year-old daughter, there are schools and day care centers nearby, she said.\n\nSheila Chew is an office manager with IMAGES, a counseling agency that works with Nuway Community Services. She said that the organization has had a positive influence on many of its clients and deserves to stay. She spoke at a town hall meeting Saturday. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Andrea V. Watson\n\n\u201cI understand there\u2019s a need for this, but I don\u2019t feel that right down the street from an elementary school and 5 million day care centers is a place for it,\u201d she said\n\nShe said her organization has met with Solola in the past, but no solution has been found.\n\nBut she warned, \u201cHe will get it together, or he will have a protest in front of his business every day.\"\n\nSawyer\u2019s challenger in the upcoming aldermanic election, Richard Wooten, said that he believes the clinic is good for the community, but that it should be moved to an area with fewer children.\n\nThe other candidate for alderman, Brian Garner, said Nuway's owner needs to find a way to work with the community because he has a track record of not resolving concerns about his business.\n\nCatherine Gross, 85, who has lived in Chatham since 1956, said while she isn\u2019t opposed to the methadone clinic, the owner needs to find a way to keep his clients from wandering through the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to him to get rid of the bad apples and let them understand it\u2019s a business, you go there and you get your methadone and then you go back to where you came from, that\u2019s it,\u201d Gross said.\n\nAt the end of the meeting the Greater Chatham Alliance agreed to spearhead a task force to try to address the community's concerns about the clinic. The committee will include community groups and a representative from Nuway.\n\nCraig Thomas, the alliance's president, said he\u2019ll start contacting community organizations in the coming week to serve on the task force.\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "Residents want the Nuway clinic to move if its owner can&#39;t keep clients from loitering and littering.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150125/chatham/taskforce-address-complaints-about-chatham-methadone-clinic", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/chicago_photo/2015/01/chatham-methadone-clinic-1422231798.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo Chicago", "description": "Residents want the Nuway clinic to move if its owner can&#39;t keep clients from loitering and littering.", "title": "Task Force To Address Complaints About Chatham Methadone Clinic"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfoCHI", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Englewood,West Englewood,Auburn Gresham,Grand Crossing,Chatham,Avalon Park,Pill Hill,Business & Economy,Health & Wellness,Roderick Sawyer,Olajide Solola,Cee Powell,Nuway Community Services", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "business-economy,health-wellness", "places": "nuway-community-services", "people": "roderick-sawyer,olajide-solola,cee-powell"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ed3\"", "article_summary": "Cee Powell, vice president of the Greater Chatham Alliance, speaks during a meeting Saturday to address concerns about Nuway Community Services, a methadone clinic.\nAt the end of the meeting the Greater Chatham Alliance agreed to spearhead a task force to try to address the community's concerns about the clinic.\nLoitering and littering outside Nuway Community Services, 110 E. 79th St., has upset some residents.\nTo that end, both community members and the owners of the clinic, Nuway Community Services, agreed to serve on a task force that will try to come up with solutions to the problem.\nSheila Chew is an office manager with IMAGES, a counseling agency that works with Nuway Community Services."}
