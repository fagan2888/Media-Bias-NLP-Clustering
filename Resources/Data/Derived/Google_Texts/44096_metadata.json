However, despite the occasionally wandering eyes, Jada says her husband is very much aware that she would never cheat on him, shared the Magic Mike XXL star. Explaining her internal conflicts, Jada said,\n\n\u201cThe good Jada says, \u2018Boo boo, you\u2019re married, OK, so we need to shut it down. But the bad Jada goes, \u201cWow, procreate! Procreate! Procreate!'\u201d\n\nDespite such strong emotions battling inside her, she will never act on them, continued the sultry actress,\n\n\u201cAfter you\u2019ve been with somebody for 20 years, you think there\u2019s any room for [jealousy]? He knows he got me on lockdown.\u201d\n\nWhat Jada clearly implied was the strong bond that the celebrity couple shares. Married since 1997, Jada and Will have never revealed a single chink in their marriage. Apart from apparent marital bliss, the couple\u2019s son Jaden is being groomed with utmost creative freedom any celebrity couple\u2019s offspring can hope for. Such relationships unbridled by orthodox conventions is the primary reason Jada and Will Smith stay together without the proverbial lockdown, she shared with SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern.\n\n\u201cWe have traveled and you\u2019ve gotta be strong. It takes work \u2014 you know that! Here\u2019s the deal, Howard. You\u2019ve gotta trust who you\u2019re with. And at the end of the day, right, I\u2019m not here to be anybody\u2019s watcher. I\u2019m not his watcher. He\u2019s a grown man.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly to promote her latest movie Magic Mike XXL, Jada Pinkett Smith categorically complimented the amazing physical transformation of her many gorgeous co-stars, including Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello. Jada plays the owner of the strip club owner under whose employment the studs operate. Speaking about her co-stars, Jada added with a twinkle,\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something, (I like) all of them, because it\u2019s all different\u2026 there\u2019s a variation, there\u2019s a variety. We like variety.\u201d\n\nWhat keeps the relationship going is perhaps the acceptance of the base nature and yet wholeheartedly keep the relationships going, said Jada. Rumors about the state of their marriage have been rising and falling ever since they got married, but Jada perhaps has the most profound realization that will undoubtedly keep her relationship with Will Smith going on for quite some time to come.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s real: I\u2019m not the kind of woman that believes a man is not going to be attracted to another woman. Just because a man is attracted to another woman does not mean that he does not love you. And it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s going to act on it.\u201d\n\n[Image Credit | Gilbert Carrasquillo / Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jada Pinkett Smith candidly shared husband Will has her \u201con lockdown\u201d.
