It did not require much critical thought to find anti-Bernie Sanders bias and overt support for Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn the pamphlet, each presidential candidate has four bullet points to outline \u201cnoteworthy policy positions.\u201d The first three bullets for Clinton begin with \u201csupports\u201d health care, \u201copposes\u201d the TPP and \u201csupports\u201d equal pay. The first three bullets for Sanders begin with \u201cwants\u201d Medicare for all, \u201cwants\u201d to tax financial transactions and \u201cwants\u201d to raise payroll taxes.\n\nAs if this linguistic bias \u2014 suggesting that Clinton\u2019s policies are rooted in solid positions while Sanders\u2019 are moonshots \u2014 is not enough, the specific positions focused on are also deeply problematic.\n\nClinton is lauded for supporting equal pay for women, yet Sanders has the same position. Clinton receives praise for her support of \u201chealthcare policy that builds upon the Affordable Care Act,\u201d yet Sanders also supports the ACA and has outlined comprehensive plans to build on it. The only \u201cfirm\u201d position that Sanders is said to hold is his belief \u201cthat global warming is the largest threat to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nWhile some enlightened progressives acknowledge climate change to be an existential threat, the Orange County Democratic Party should not be so willing to rely on anti-climate science stigma to discredit Sanders\u2019 campaign.\n\nOur local party should not play games with voters. The party will support the candidate that the people choose. North Carolinians should pick that Democratic candidate, not a party controlled by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nMax Levin\n\nSenior\n\nComparative literature", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was troubled to see official Orange County Democratic Party election materials chock-full of bias and misinformation when I went to vote.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "description": "I was troubled to see official Orange County Democratic Party election materials chock-full of bias and misinformation when I went to vote.", "title": "Letter: \u200bDemocratic voting guide misinformed", "url": "http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2016/03/letter-democratic-voting-guide-misinformed", "image": "http://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/201604217ygrp9dscZ/dist/img/DTH-fb-icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.dailytarheel.com", "site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary"}, "publish_date": "2016-03-20 22:09:00", "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytarheel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Letter: \u200bDemocratic voting guide misinformed| Published 03/20/16 10:09pmTO THE EDITOR:I was troubled to see official Orange County Democratic Party election materials chock-full of bias and misinformation when I went to vote.\nNorth Carolinians should pick that Democratic candidate, not a party controlled by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nIt did not require much critical thought to find anti-Bernie Sanders bias and overt support for Hillary Clinton.\nThe first three bullets for Sanders begin with \u201cwants\u201d Medicare for all, \u201cwants\u201d to tax financial transactions and \u201cwants\u201d to raise payroll taxes.\nThe party will support the candidate that the people choose."}
