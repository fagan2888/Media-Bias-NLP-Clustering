Jim Jordan said, \u201cAll the momentum is in our direction. Warren Buffett said yesterday, \u2018Scrap the bill.'\u201d\n\nMore recently, Rep. Tom Graves said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sept. 22: \u201cWarren Buffett says stop it now and start over.\u201d A day later, former Rep. Joe Scarborough, on his MSNBC show \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d said: \u201cWarren Buffett came out last week and said \u2026 Obamacare is not going to work. We need to start all over.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nThe confusion stems from a Sept. 17 blog item on a website called Money Morning that carried the headline \u201cBuffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over.\u201d The Weekly Standard blogged about that article with a similar headline, \u201cWarren Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start Over.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans tweeted about the Weekly Standard blog post and linked to it, helping to spread the misinformation. One such re-tweet \u2014 which was later deleted \u2014 came from Rep. Tim Griffin of Arkansas: \u201cRT: #ar2 RT @weeklystandard: Warren Buffett: Scrap #Obamacare and Start Over http://t.co/4vstDPlpEk.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: The Weekly Standard did not disclose \u2014 until it updated the story later \u2014 that Buffett\u2019s remarks were more than three years old. Even then, his words were taken out of context by the bloggers, as Buffett himself said in a Sept. 17 interview with the Omaha World-Herald. \u201cThis is outrageous,\u201d Buffett told the World-Herald. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent wrong \u2026 totally false.\u201d\n\nTo trace the history of this false claim, let\u2019s first go back to March 1, 2010, when Buffett gave an interview to CNBC. It came at a time when the Affordable Care Act was nearing final approval in Congress. Obama signed the bill into law 22 days later.\n\nIn the CNBC interview, Buffett talked about the high cost of health care in the United States \u2014 which he correctly said consumes about 17 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. He compared health care costs to \u201ca tapeworm eating, you know, at our economic body.\u201d He then said the Senate bill would do little to address the cost of health care.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we came up with a bill that really doesn\u2019t attack the cost situation that much. And we have to have a fundamental change,\u201d Buffett said.\n\nThe host, Becky Quick, asked Buffett if he was \u201cin favor of scrapping this and going back to start over.\u201d He said: \u201cI would be if I were President Obama.\u201d But he also said that he wasn\u2019t changing his mind on the bill and he preferred it to the status quo.\n\nQuick, March 1, 2010: This is different than what you\u2019ve said when we\u2019ve talked to you in the past. I mean, even a couple months ago when I sat down and talked to you, you said that you would vote, I believe, for the bill if it were in front of you. Buffett: I\u2013if it\u2019s a choice\u2026 Quick: When did you change your mind? Buffett: No, if it was a choice today between plan A, which is what we\u2019ve got, or plan B, what is in front of\u2013the Senate bill, I would vote for the Senate bill. But I would much rather see a plan C that really attacks costs. And I think that\u2019s what the American public want to see. I mean, the American public is not behind this bill. And we need the American public behind the bill, because it\u2019s going to have to do some tough things. But in\u2013if it doesn\u2019t bring down costs significantly\u2013and you can say, well, you\u2019re bringing down costs by raising a tax over here or cutting\u2013improving Medicare, but you can do those things anyway. That\u2019s got nothing to do with what\u2019s being proposed in the bill. So I\u2013if the only choice I had in the world was the present system or the present bill, I would take the bill. But I think it\u2019d be far better to say cost is it. We\u2019re going to go back and we\u2019re not going to come back to the American people until we have something that is going to take this 16 or fraction and it\u2019s going to bring it down somewhat toward what other countries are doing.\n\nSo, Buffett at the time supported the bill and would have voted for it, despite its flaws.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act became law, Buffett has reiterated his support for it. In an interview with Betty Liu of Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cIn the Loop\u201d last year, Buffett was asked if the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision to uphold the constitutionality of the law. He said yes and called the law a \u201cstep in the right direction in many ways\u201d while also once again expressing his concern about the high cost of health care.\n\nLiu, July 13, 2012: A few weeks ago we heard from the Supreme Court, they upheld the health care reform act, the Affordable Care Act. Was that the right decision? Buffett: Well I think it\u2019s the right decision, but I think that the health care problem is the number-one problem of America and of American business. If we have 17 or 18 percent of our GDP going to health care and we\u2019re competing with countries that have 10 percent. That\u2019s seven or eight points. There\u2019s only 100 points in the dollar. And to have a seven- or eight-point disadvantage is huge. And a lot of businessmen complain about corporate taxes. Liu: Yes. Buffett: Corporate taxes are less than two percent of GDP. So if you eliminated all the corporate taxes you\u2019ve got seven points against you on health care. It\u2019s the tapeworm essentially of the American economy. And we have not dealt with that yet. Obamacare is a step in the right direction in many ways, but in terms of cost \u2014\n\nIn their recent efforts to defund Obamacare, some Republicans have cast the president\u2019s own allies as opponents of the law. They frequently cite a letter, for example, from three union leaders that asked Democratic congressional leaders to amend the law, warning that if implemented as written, the law \u201cwill shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle class.\u201d\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Graves, a two-term congressman from Georgia, cited union leaders and Buffett as examples of \u201cwidespread\u201d opposition to Obamacare.\n\nGraves, Sept. 22: Warren Buffett says stop it now and start over. You have the three top leaders of the unions in our country saying this is not what will work. It\u2019s going to create a new underclass of workers that are under 30 hours. It\u2019s not just Republicans, this is widespread \u2026\n\nBut Buffett isn\u2019t one of those critics. In his interview with the Omaha paper, which is owned by his company Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett called reports that he wants to scrap the bill and start over \u201c100 percent wrong.\u201d\n\nOmaha World-Herald, Sept. 17: Buffett said the stories took his comments out of context and added the \u201cscrapped\u201d wording. \u201cI\u2019ve never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped,\u201d said Buffett, who has supported Obama\u2019s political campaigns. \u201cI support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought should be done for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nBuffett himself goes too far in saying that he \u201cnever suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped.\u201d He did answer in the affirmative when asked that very question in March 2010. But his words were taken out of context, and he did not say the law should be scrapped now. He indicated his support for the bill in that interview as an improvement over the current health care system. And, after the bill became law, he reiterated that position last year and again this year.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda894\"", "article_summary": "'\u201dMore recently, Rep.
