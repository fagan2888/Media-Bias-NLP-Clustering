The language, section 1124, would allow HIPAA-protected information to be shared with researchers. Currently law limits it to treatment, payment or operations. But the Cures language isn\u2019t included in bills to be marked up Wednesday by the Senate HELP Committee and circulated Monday. Supporters of the change, backed by groups like the Association of Clinical Research Organizations, say it would expedite medical research. Privacy advocates say it's a giveaway to drug companies. Of course, it could still be included when the House and Senate bills are conferenced\u2026assuming the Senate passes a bill. HELP Chair Lamar Alexander is pushing for that as soon as next week.\n\nFEEDBACK ON OTHER SENATE BILLS: As the Senate works to give legs to the president\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative, Health IT Now and its members like Oracle and NextGen Healthcare, have suggestions. In a letter to committee leaders, the groups urge common open-data standards and formats; clearly defined requirements for data sharing and use; and use of a common, volunteer consent form that will protect privacy and lower administrative costs.

Send your spring-minded news to dpittman@politico.com and connect with us on Twitter @David_Pittman, @arthurallen202, @DariusTahir @ POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.\n\neHealth tweet of the day: Melissa M. Martin @martinmelissama: We need better ways to get PATIENTS their data @GetMyHealthData answering #AdvocacyDC\n\nAHIMA TAKES TO THE HILL: Members of the American Health Information Management Association will take to Capitol Hill today as part of its Advocacy Leadership Symposium. HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander will talk to them this morning, according to the agenda.\n\nSOME WORK LEFT TO DO: AHIMA still needs more than 94,000 signatures to reach the 100,000 needed for its online petition to have the Obama administration act on a national voluntary patient identifier, a way to spur the accurate matching of patient records as they are increasingly shared. AHIMA launched the online petition March 21 and has until April 19 to get the signatures needed to ensure a response from the White House. However, Congress \u2014 not the White House --\u2014 continues to leave the ban in place through annual appropriations bills.\n\nTALKING PROVIDER DIRECTORIES: ONC and the Federal Health Architecture will gather in McLean, Va., over two days to discuss ways to further provider directories; a sort of phone book of doctors with which to share patient records when needed. The issues has been a bugaboo to solving interoperability. http://bit.ly/1UJ0zgg\n\nOPTOMETRISTS SEEK FDA OVERSIGHT OF ONLINE VISION TESTS: The nation\u2019s optometry lobby on Monday asked the FDA to take a closer look (so to speak) at an online vision test that Newt Gingrich has touted of late. The American Optometric Association wants Opternative's self-administered, home eye tests to submit pre-market approval, which it doesn\u2019t have to do as a Class I device, as we told you last week. The company\u2019s products are unproven, miss cases of eye disease, and provide inaccurate prescriptions for glasses and contacts, the AOA says. The optometry lobby has twice before asked the FDA to take another look without much apparent luck. Their letter to the FDA: http://bit.ly/1qlEVli\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe AOA\u2019s claims are false and mischaracterize the proven safety and effectiveness of Opternative\u2019s technology. We are very clear throughout the patient experience that Opternative is not a replacement for an eye health exam. It's on our website, in the exam itself, and repeated to the patient in any necessary follow up care,\u201d Aaron Dallek, Opternative CEO and co-founder, told Morning eHealth. \u201cOpternative\u2019s electronic technology operates under the supervision of trained professional and is registered as a medical device with the [FDA]. All examinations are conducted and all prescriptions are issued basis on the independent clinical judgement of the ophthalmologist consistent with the prevailing standard of care.\u201d\n\nSENATOR WANTS ANSWERS ON HHS DATA BREACH: Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is demanding answers from HHS about the personal information of children\u2019s records contained on a stolen laptop and portable hard drives. The devices in question were stolen from the Office of Child Support Enforcement in Olympia, Washington in early February. \"It is unclear from the information HHS provided how many of those children's records were compromised, and the potential risk to those children, despite a statutory requirement that you provide that information to Congress,\" Johnson said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. The devices contained between 2 million and 5 million names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and phone numbers, the AP said.

She talks about her company\u2019s founding, consumerism in health care, Theranos and FDA regulation. Wojcicki said consumers are most interested in their risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIt was really interesting to me to see all of these doctors talking about consumers, they don\u2019t want their Alzheimer\u2019s [information]. It\u2019s scary for them. But the reality is consumers really want that information,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the system is providing isn\u2019t necessarily what the consumers want.\u201d 23andMe isn\u2019t able to predict Alzheimer\u2019s yet. The full podcast: http://on.recode.net/1RYb5ze\n\n\u2014 Wojcicki talks Theranos around the 24-minute mark where she says she is pulling for the company. She added that 23andMe worked hard at first to win over the scientific community, knowing it needed to do that before making a bigger splash publicly.\n\nDTC TELEMED COMPANIES GRADED: A JAMA Internal Medicine study published Monday examined the quality of direct-to-consumer telemedicine companies like American Well and MDLive. Researchers reviewed nearly 600 visits from eight companies. Some highlights:\n\n\u2014 The antibiotic prescribing rate were similar to in-person settings.\n\n\u2014 Naming the correct diagnosis in videoconferencing and telephone care was superior to webchats and furthermore doesn\u2019t appear to support limiting video-based care.\n\n\u2014 14 percent of visits were referred to local brick-and-mortar providers for follow-up.\n\n\u2014 Some companies performed considerably better than others.\n\nThe full study: http://bit.ly/1qk5Yxq\n\nYELP AS MEASURE OF QUALITY: Yelp hospital reviews correlate to government survey data and may be a reliable source of information missed by traditional hospital quality surveys, a study published Monday in Health Affairs found. In fact, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems may be missing out on key patient experiences that are gathered by open-ended Yelp reviews.
