Well it took a while, but Marilyn Tavenner joins Kathleen Sebelius and the ObamaCare website glitch girl in departing the sinking ship. Tavenner became famous for her clumsy explanations for the unexplainable in Congress.

Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), wrote in a letter to House Republicans on Thursday that the system had “inadvertently” double-counted nearly 400,000 people.

That miscount helped push the enrollment total past 7 million, a milestone that was celebrated by the administration at the time.

The final tally for enrollments last year was 6.7 million, officials said Thursday.

In her first public statement about the error, Tavenner repeated a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that “a mistake was made.” She also hinted that still-unbuilt parts of the website played a role.

“Once the automated system for effectuated enrollment is functional, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be able to more easily report the number who has paid their premiums,” Tavenner wrote in the letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which first discovered the error.

CMS spokesman Aaron Albright repeatedly declined to clarify whether the website had caused the error, deferring to the agency’s earlier statements.
