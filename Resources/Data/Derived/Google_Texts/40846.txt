NEW DELHI — A Malaysia Airlines plane ran into a flock of ducks late Friday night just as it landed at Tribhuvan International Airport in Nepal, shattering its two right windshields, officials said.

No one was injured on the plane, a Boeing 737, which was carrying 180 passengers. But it was taken out of service for several hours while mechanics replaced the cockpit glass.

At least 10 ducks were killed in the collision. Collisions between birds and aircraft, or bird strikes, have become a serious problem at Nepal’s sole international airport, with more than 75 reported since 1990, according to the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority. Previously, two other planes were badly damaged because of bird strikes.

Officials said the ducks probably came from Taudaha, a local bird-watching site.

The bird strike occurred as international efforts to locate Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, entered their third week.
