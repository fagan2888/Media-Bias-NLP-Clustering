The hotel, which operates a location in Perrysville, Ohio, is planned as an adults-only getaway. However, one of the larger issues with the project is its location next to Antioch Baptist Church.\n\n\u201cWhen the property was sold, we learned that there was going to be a hotel that was being proposed to be built next to the church,\u201d said the Rev. Travis Bridgeman, the church\u2019s pastor. \u201cThe property actually adjoins the side of our church and comes around behind the church as well, so it\u2019s actually over half the area of our church.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we learned the type of the hotel, which we didn\u2019t know existed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bridgeman, the hotel would sit between the church, nonprofit The Place of Forsyth County and Ga. 400. He and a number of residents, some of whom have started an online petition against the hotel, feel it would bring undesirable elements to the area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just concerned that a hotel, especially an adults-only facility being built directly across from our church is not good for our community,\u201d Bridgeman said. \u201cReally to be located next to a church is somewhat disrespectful, I think, knowing what the church stands for.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just concerned about the traffic in and out and the potential [it might] be a meeting place for other than honest, legal activity, you\u2019d say, and possibly illegal activity and possibly crime and so forth.\u201d\n\nEthan Underwood, the attorney working with Belamere owner John Kranjec, said he has heard several people misrepresent the hotel. Its Ohio location has been in business for more than a decade without issue, even winning awards from family magazines.\n\n\u201cWe want to clear up some information,\u201d Underwood said during the recent commission meeting. \u201cFour weeks ago, I sat in this first pew and listened to someone accuse [Kranjec] of facilitating illegal activity at his business that\u2019s been in operation for 11 years. He operates Belamere Suites in Perrysburg, Ohio.\u201d\n\nUnderwood said the location featured many amenities, including a personal chef and concierge service, but that many have just assumed the worse.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been accused of preposterous allegations\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just be blunt \u2014 someone sat here and accused him of facilitating prostitution and drug use. Can you imagine your businesses being accused of facilitating prostitution and drug use?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous and defamatory and it\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/27466/", "type": "article", "description": "CUMMING \u2014 A proposed couples\u2019 only hotel on Antioch Road northeast of Cumming has angered both supporters and opponents this spring.", "title": "Plan for adults only hotel stirs opposition in Forsyth"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Plan for adults only hotel stirs opposition in Forsyth"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9435\"", "article_summary": "CUMMING \u2014 A proposed couples\u2019 only hotel on Antioch Road northeast of Cumming has angered both supporters and opponents this spring.\nThe proposal from Belamere Suites was on the agenda for a recent meeting of the Forsyth County commission, but was postponed until August.\nThe hotel, which operates a location in Perrysville, Ohio, is planned as an adults-only getaway.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just concerned that a hotel, especially an adults-only facility being built directly across from our church is not good for our community,\u201d Bridgeman said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just be blunt \u2014 someone sat here and accused him of facilitating prostitution and drug use."}
