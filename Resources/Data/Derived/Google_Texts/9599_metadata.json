And I read Zero Hedge.\n\nI\u2019d say that he doesn\u2019t get out enough \u2014 you can get much, much dumber. Still, the piece in question is a diatribe against seasonal adjustment, and is so amazingly ignorant that you might wonder how it got published in the Journal. You might wonder, that is, if you didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening: we\u2019re witnessing the coming of the employment truthers.\n\nWhen Obama and the Fed began their efforts to rescue the economy from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, the right knew, just knew, what was going to happen. Inflation was going to soar thanks to money-printing and deficits; private employment would stagnate because of Obamacare, and also because Obama was hurting the feelings of job creators.\n\nWhen inflation failed to take off, in came the inflation truthers, insisting that the official numbers were wrong and probably a deliberate fake.\n\nNow, how\u2019s that employment prediction doing? Witness the terrible effect of a socialist who trash-talks capitalism:\n\nPhoto\n\nHence the eagerness to publish any argument claiming that the numbers are somehow fake.
