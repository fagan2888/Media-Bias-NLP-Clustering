Mr. Weissman\u2019s message in person the next morning was blunt: The Justice Department was blowing up the 2012 deal.\n\nThe unprecedented move to void a settlement with a major financial institution comes after more than a year of talks between UBS UBS, +0.52% and the Justice Department. It is a sign of the department\u2019s increasingly aggressive negotiating posture with financial institutions, and calls into question the staying power of past bank settlements if they run into trouble.\n\nThe negotiations with the Justice Department are expected next week to result in UBS paying a fine of about $200 million to the Justice Department and pleading guilty to allegations that UBS traders manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, prior to 2012, according to some of the people.\n\nThose allegations were previously resolved by the December 2012 settlement, in which the U.S. agreed not to prosecute the bank on the condition that it \u201ccommit no United States crime whatsoever\u201d for the two-year term of the agreement. Prosecutors later extended that agreement by a year as they continued to investigate whether the foreign-exchange allegations ran afoul of the earlier deal.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice may tear up a 2012 deal not to prosecute UBS AG over alleged interest-rate rigging.", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM060_UBS_05_ZG_20150515023457.jpg", "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Devlin Barrett", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice may tear up a 2012 deal not to prosecute UBS AG over alleged interest-rate rigging.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/justice-department-to-tear-up-past-ubs-settlement-2015-05-15", "author": "Christopher M.
