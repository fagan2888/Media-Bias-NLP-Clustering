We are not there today, but we are not that far away from that.\u201d\n\nThe key findings of the bipartisan study are: lower cost hospitals are being squeezed out of the market; market consolidation is resulting in higher costs for payers and consumers with greater price disparity between providers and Connecticut lacks critical information regarding costs, quality and access.\n\nBecause the state failed to implement a statewide health information exchange, the senators said this has resulted in a fragmented system that leaves out patients and providers.\n\nOn a bill that would look to state standards on Accountable Care Organizations, the Yale New Haven System said standards are already set by federal authorities and further regulation could inhibit prevent ACOs from reducing costs of managing chronic ailments\n\nAnother proposed bill addresses hospital conversions and realignments. Tenet, a for-profit entity, withdrew a plan to partner with five hospitals in Connecticut, citing excessive regulation.\n\nGayle Capozzalo, the chief strategy officer for the Yale system, said these conversions and partnerships already undergo review by as many as five bodies.\n\n\u201cAdditional conditions will very likely prevent hospital alignment relationships, nonprofit and for profit, at a time when many community hospitals are no longer able to meet the challenges of the fast changing landscape on their own,\u201d Capozzalo said.\n\n\u201cHealth care providers need to have ability to deal with the changing environment and these bills could reduce or eliminate this ability. At Yale New Haven, we will continue to focus our energy and resources on quality, efforts that improve care efficiency, and those that maintain access and add value,\u201d she testified.\n\nState Comptroller Kevin Lembo\u2019s office was charged by the legislature to look into the impact of facility fees on the state employees\u2019 retiree health plan and thus the impact on state spending.\n\nA facility fee is a charge in addition to a professional services fee that has been traditionally used by hospitals to cover overhead. The concern was charging it at doctor offices that have been purchased by hospitals where a patient receives the same care at the same place, but faces an additional fee.\n\nLembo found the practice of attaching a facility fee was not as widespread as had been anticipated for state workers, but charges increased by 400 percent in two speciality areas at two separate hospitals.\n\nSpending by the state for retirees\u2019 cardiology care at Yale-New Haven Hospital went from a base of $310,000 to $1.2 million, while state spending on dermatology at the University of Connecticut Health Center jumped from $40,000 to $445,000, Lembo told the committee.\n\nLembo said state employees, because of their comprehensive insurance coverage, are largely shielded.\n\nHe told the Public Health Committee, however, consumers in a high deductible plan or those who pay cash for doctor\u2019s visits, \u201cthis is a real impact on those people to getting care. ... many may walk away from care because they simply can\u2019t afford it because it has doubled.\u201d\n\nIt was this group of consumers who have submitted complaints to the state\u2019s health care advocate, Vickie Veltri, where she reported fees as high as $5,000. One consumer reported a charge for chemotherapy went from $2,500 to almost $12,000 after a doctor\u2019s practice was purchased.\n\nPatrick McCabe, senior vice president of finance for Yale New Haven Hospital System, in testimony before the bipartisan roundtable in December said the charging of these fees has to be understood in the context of declining governmental reimbursements.\n\nMcCabe also said facilities the system owns that now charge these fees also must apply the hospital free and charity care rules, where applicable.\n\nThe official said the main reason to purchase a practice is to provide an adequate network. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a situation where the facility fee opportunity has driven physician acquisition,\u201d McCabe said.\n\nA 2014 report by state Attorney General George Jepsen found 22 out of the state\u2019s 29 hospitals charge facility fees, while a federal study predicted by 2021 facility fees for routine doctor visits and cardiac imaging will cost Medicare an extra $2.3 billion and patients an extra $590 million in out-of-pocket expenses annually.\n\nLembo said there is more work to do on the issue of facility fees, but the full report from his office is not due until October.\n\nOne of the bills offered by Looney and Fasano would cap the facility fee at $100, require insurance coverage for the fees and not allow them for services that can be safely performed outside a hospital.\n\nThe Connecticut Hospital Association in submitted testimony said the bills submitted on facility fees are confusing. It told lawmakers to vote against them because it feared it would put reimbursements from Medicare in jeopardy.\n\nFasano said it is not true that the Affordable Care Act promotes consolidation of services and mergers, but it does promote cooperation. Both the senators and Lembo pointed to studies that found consolidation increases costs.\n\nThe bipartisan report said the primary motivation for hospital consolidations and purchasing doctor practices is monetary tied to reimbursement policies and to enhance bargaining power.\n\nIn addition to the facility fees paid by Medicare to hospitals, Medicare also pays 70 percent more for an office consultation with a hospital based provider than an independent physician and twice as much for an echocardiogram or colonoscopy, according to the report.\n\nA study by The Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University found that the most efficient model of providing care is a small group of 7 to 10 physicians.\n\nOn sharing electronic medical records, the senators have proposed a bill where hospitals would contribute to a program where all providers would be able to access these records. It would offset this with tax credits against a hospital\u2019s provider tax.\n\nThe senators said potentially, Connecticut could hook up with a system that is already operating successfully in Rhode Island.\n\nThe Yale New Haven Hospital System submitted testimony on electronic records, pointing out ways it already shares records.\n\nThe system said the proposal \u201ccauses some concerns, and we encourage the legislature to avoid an unintended consequence of nullifying the efforts of many Connecticut hospitals that are already providing access to their electronic health record systems.\u201d\n\nThe Connecticut Hospital Association was equally concerned and said the state should let the federal agencies take the lead. One report concludes it will take another 10 years for interoperability among systems\n\n\u201cConnecticut law cannot mandate a faster reality. These IT changes must be undertaken in a measured manner consistent with the federal roadmap,\u201d it said. The CHA said the goals of the bill can be met through \u201ca cooperative, planned approach,\u201d according to the CHA.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, New Haven Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Looney, Fasano want more transparency in hospital costs, cap on facility fees", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150311/NEWS/150319868", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150311/NEWS/150319868/AR/0/AR-150319868.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1120px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Looney, Fasano want more transparency in hospital costs, cap on facility fees"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "HARTFORD >> As the legislature looks to rein in medical expenses, state Senate leaders blamed hospital consolidations and the purchase of physician practices for ballooning costs and an increasing threat to physicians who may want to remain inde", "title": "Looney, Fasano want more transparency in hospital costs, cap on facility fees", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150311/NEWS/150319868", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150311/NEWS/150319868/AR/0/AR-150319868.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, New Haven Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "HARTFORD >> As the legislature looks to rein in medical expenses, state Senate leaders blamed hospital consolidations and the purchase of physician practices for ballooning costs and an increasing threat to physicians who may want to remain inde"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb69c\"", "article_summary": "The Yale New Haven Hospital System submitted testimony on electronic records, pointing out ways it already shares records.\nThe Connecticut Hospital Association in submitted testimony said the bills submitted on facility fees are confusing.\nLembo said there is more work to do on the issue of facility fees, but the full report from his office is not due until October.\n\u201cHealth care providers need to have ability to deal with the changing environment and these bills could reduce or eliminate this ability.\nThe second largest system, Hartford Health System, had excess revenues in 2013, according to data filed with the Office of Health Care Access, of $98.5 million, or 16.5 percent of all profits."}
