Though it may sound counterintuitive, a new study claims that active video games could boost kids\u2019 moderate and vigorous activity levels. Instead of yelling at kids to get off the TV or video games, researchers wanted to see if they could use video games to their advantage.\n\nIn fact, children who played active video games along with undergoing a weight management program were more likely to lose weight than kids who simply followed the weight management program. \u201cWe thought \u2014 if you received active games \u2014 maybe we could turn this lemon into lemonade,\u201d Dr. Deneen Vojta, one of the authors of the study, told Reuters. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if instead of beating on kids about screen time we turned screen time into a positive?\u201d\n\nThe study involved 75 overweight and obese children from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Texas. They were placed into two separate groups throughout 16 weeks. Both groups underwent a proven weight loss program at local YMCAs, but one group received an Xbox and two active games, Kinect Adventures! and Kinect Sports, which both use a Kinect device that is able to track the movements of the players to operate the game.\n\nMost of the kids were between 8 and 12 years old, and weighed between 123 and 132 lbs. Those who played the active games ended up adding about seven minutes of moderate to vigorous activity to their daily routines during the course of the experiment. This is a small difference, but the authors of the study claim that it could ultimately mean an extra four pounds lost over the course of a year.\n\nHowever, substituting regular exercise with a game system is probably not the best choice, either. Previous studies have showed that active games don\u2019t help much in losing weight. In order to reach the best results, it\u2019s important to follow a regimented daily exercise schedule, and simply add active games on the side as a fun addition to the workout.\n\n\u201cMaybe the Wii isn\u2019t going to increase physical activity a whole heck of a lot,\u201d exercise scientist Jacob Barkley of Kent State University told Reuters. \u201cBut it might increase caloric expenditure a little bit more than a traditional sedentary video game, and if you do that on a daily basis that could have a cumulative effect that might be beneficial.\u201d Another study found that among postpartum women, active video games did help in increasing \u201cspare physical activity.\u201d\n\nIn other words, as Kevin Short of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center says, \u201cjust because you can play soccer on the Wii doesn\u2019t mean you should stop playing it outside.\u201d\n\nSource: Trost S, Sundal D, Foster G, Lent M, Vojta D. \u201cEffects of a Pediatric Weight Management Program With and Without Active Video Games.\u201d JAMA Pediatrics, 2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "physical activity, childhood obesity, active video games, playing video games to lose weight, obese children play video games, video games,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Active video games that involve movement could actually be a useful way for kids to get several extra minutes of exercise in every day.", "title": "Check This: Video Games Can Make Kids More Active", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/video-games-can-make-kids-more-active-along-weight-management-programs-271310", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/kids-playing-games.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Active video games that involve movement could actually be a useful way for kids to get several extra minutes of exercise in every day.", "title": "Check This: Video Games Can Make Kids More Active", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/video-games-can-make-kids-more-active-along-weight-management-programs-271310", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/kids-playing-games.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/kids-playing-games.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-15T15:13:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T15:13:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Active video games that involve movement could actually be a useful way for kids to get several extra minutes of exercise in every day."}, "article_summary": "In fact, children who played active video games along with undergoing a weight management program were more likely to lose weight than kids who simply followed the weight management program.\nInstead of yelling at kids to get off the TV or video games, researchers wanted to see if they could use video games to their advantage.\nThough it may sound counterintuitive, a new study claims that active video games could boost kids\u2019 moderate and vigorous activity levels.\nActive video games that involve movement could actually be a useful way for kids to get several extra minutes of exercise in every day.\nVideo games: the cause of your children\u2019s laziness and lack of outdoor activity \u2014 or so we think."}
