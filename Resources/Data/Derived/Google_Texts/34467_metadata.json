The cost of surgery itself has dramatically risen in the United States in recent years, mainly due to the fact that the per capita surgery rate in the country is so high, according to FierceHealthFinance.\n\nExperts disagree about how common adverse events in ASCs actually are, according to the Kaiser report. \"There's not much known about what happens within the walls of these places by regulators or by the public,\" Lisa McGiffert, director of Consumers Union's Safe Patient Project, told the publication.\n\nBut anesthesiologist David Shapiro, M.D., former president of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association, told Kaiser that the industry is \"very, very tightly regulated\" and as a result, \"we have an exceptional, exceptional success rate.\"\n\nIndeed, the ASC Quality Collaboration, an industry group, releases a quarterly safety report that tracks five quality measures--patient burns; patient falls; wrong-site, wrong-patient surgeries; hospital transfers/admissions; and antibiotic administration timing--to comply with regulations from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In 2014, CMS took it a step further by requiring the facilities to pay a Medicare payment penalty if they don't successfully report their safety measures to the agency, Hospitals & Health Networks Magazine reported.\n\nBut the most recent national study of healthcare-acquired infections associated with ASCs was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2010, and as the growth of the surgery centers continues, calls for more independent studies on the industry are likely to increase as well.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\n- check out the ASC report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nJoan Rivers' death renews scrutiny of office-based surgeries\n\nImprovements needed in ambulatory patient safety, infection control\n\nAre hospitals safer than ambulatory surgical centers?\n\nAmbulatory surgery centers more efficient, affordable\n\nAmbulatory surgical centers cheaper than hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rise in popularity of\u00a0ambulatory surgery centers\u00a0as an alternative to hospitals have made safety concerns about the facilities difficult to ignore, according to a\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0article.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The rise in popularity of\u00a0ambulatory surgery centers\u00a0as an alternative to hospitals have made safety concerns about the facilities difficult to ignore, according to a\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0article.", "title": "Just how safe are ambulatory surgery centers?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/just-how-safe-are-ambulatory-surgery-centers/2014-12-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Ambulatory Surgery Centers,Care Delivery,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),Outpatient Centers,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda75e\"", "article_summary": "Ambulatory surgery centers more efficient, affordableAmbulatory surgical centers cheaper than hospitals\nTo learn more:- read the article- check out the ASC reportRelated Articles:Joan Rivers' death renews scrutiny of office-based surgeriesImprovements needed in ambulatory patient safety, infection controlAre hospitals safer than ambulatory surgical centers?\nThe rise in popularity of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) as an alternative to hospitals have made safety concerns about the facilities difficult to ignore, according to a Kaiser Health News article.\nExperts disagree about how common adverse events in ASCs actually are, according to the Kaiser report.\nBut anesthesiologist David Shapiro, M.D., former president of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association, told Kaiser that the industry is \"very, very tightly regulated\" and as a result, \"we have an exceptional, exceptional success rate.\""}
