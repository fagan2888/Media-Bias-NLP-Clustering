We all know lightning is dangerous. Its erratic nature makes it unpredictable.

Tragically, people die every year due to lightning strikes, including 20 so far this year in the U.S. All of those lightning deaths had something in common: The victims were outside during the storm.

The national weather service tracks information on each case. The strikes happened while people were doing mainly typical, everyday activities. Walking the dog, riding a motorcycle, fishing, camping, hiking, playing volleyball, and the latest incident in South Dakota at a disc golf course in Spearfish Canyon.

Getting inside and out of the elements may be a simple thing to do during a thunderstorm, but it substantially drops your risk of being killed by lightning.

There's a simple 30/30 lighting rule that's easy to remember when it comes to lightning safety.

If you see a flash of lightning and hear the rumble of thunder in 30 seconds or less, seek shelter. Once the storm passes, wait 30 minutes after the last rumble of thunder is heard to go back out. That's hard to do sometimes, but is the best way to stay out of harm's way with summer storms.
