We have thousands of people on a no-fly list. They get put on there based on credible information and suspicion that they should not be put on a plane inside our country or coming into our country,\u201d Clinton said at a campaign event in Sioux Falls, Iowa. \u201cI got to tell you -- if you\u2019re too dangerous to fly in America, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.\u201d\n\nThe gun-control measure was voted down by the Senate on a 45-54 procedural hurdle.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota voted against the proposed amendment, while Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois voted in favor.\n\nThe proposal from Sen. Dianne Feinstein. D-California, was an amendment to the Obamacare repeal bill, which would allow the attorney general to block efforts to sell or transfer of a gun or explosive to a suspect or known terrorists if the individual is believed to use the weapon in an act of terrorism.\n\nAs the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced today it was officially investigating the mass shooting in San Bernardino as an \"act of terrorism,\u201d Clinton doubled down on her call for gun control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning more literally by the hour, there certainly is much more support for the view that this was a terrorist act,\u201d Clinton said at the Carpenters Training Center in northwest Iowa. \u201cI have a great deal of confidence with law enforcement, local, state, federal. I am convinced that they will do everything they can to run down every lead no matter where it might take them anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nDespite the timing, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, responded with an alternative proposal that would better protect the Second Amendment right of people who mistakenly end up on the nation\u2019s terrorist watch list.\n\nThe Texas senator\u2019s proposal also called for restricting funding to \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d areas where local law enforcement officials do not comply with federal immigration law.\n\nCornyn\u2019s alternative was also rejected by the Senate by a 55-44 vote.\n\nSenate also voted down a second proposal to the amendment to the Obamacare repeal bill, from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, to expand background checks for guns purchased online and at gun shows by a 48-to-50 vote.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said background checks would not have helped prevent the California killings.\n\n\u201cUltimately, there\u2019s no background check in the world that would have identified them,\u201d Rubio said today at a campaign event with the Seacoast Republican Women at the Portsmouth Country Club. \u201cThis man was not on any terrorist watch list,\" he said referring to Syed Farook, one of the suspects.\n\nWhen asked specifically about no-fly list legislation, Rubio pushed back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about denying people a Second Amendment, Constitutional right because the federal government made a mistake,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Clinton Rebukes Senate for Voting Down Gun Control Proposals", "description": "Clinton sharply criticized members of the U.S. Senate.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Clinton sharply criticized members of the U.S. Senate.", "title": "Clinton Rebukes Senate for Voting Down Gun Control Proposals", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-rebukes-senate-voting-gun-control-proposals/story?id=35586187", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_hillary_clinton_ml_151203_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton sharply criticized members of the U.S. Senate.", "creator": "@pychavez", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-rebukes-senate-voting-gun-control-proposals/story?id=35586187", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_hillary_clinton_ml_151203_4x3t_240.jpg", "title": "Clinton Rebukes Senate for Voting Down Gun Control Proposals", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,35586187", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,35586187", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-rebukes-senate-voting-gun-control-proposals/story?id=35586187"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-04", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,35586187", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-rebukes-senate-voting-gun-control-proposals/story?id=35586187"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-rebukes-senate-voting-gun-control-proposals/story?id=35586187", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,35586187", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-12-04 16:36:09", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, San Bernardino, guns, gun control, no fly list, terrorism, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "Date": "2015-12-04", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, San Bernardino, guns, gun control, no fly list, terrorism"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLast night, the Senate voted down a law to block suspected terrorists from buying guns.\nDemocratic Sen.
