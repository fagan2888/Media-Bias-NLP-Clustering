Had the Court sided with the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell, more than 6 million Americans in 34 states that rely on the federal marketplace would have lost their subsidies.\n\nMaluf is one of these Americans. She holds down three part-time jobs in physical therapy and pilates instruction but does not make enough money to afford insurance on her own. Like Maluf, eighty percent of the people receiving Obamacare subsidies have jobs. This is the group of workers that the law was intended to help.\n\n\"I do make money but not enough to be able to fund my entire insurance. So, yeah, I work a lot, but I have also a lot of bills to pay,\" she told CBS News in an interview.\n\nSo when she found out that the Supreme Court had ruled that Obamacare consumers in all states are eligible for the subsidies - Maluf was ecstatic, calling it \"a victory, relief.\" Most of those receiving the subsidies were uninsured before the law passed, and if the Court had ruled against Burwell, those recipients would most likely have been uninsured again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For months, some Americans have been dreading the high Court&#039;s decision the health care tax credits.
