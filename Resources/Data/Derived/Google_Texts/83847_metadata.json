This year's \u201cXtreme Eating 2015\u201d awards were given to the top nine unhealthiest dinners, drinks, and desserts that a customer could possibly order.\n\nMost of the orders were loaded with different types of fats, sugars, sodium, and accumulated to more than 2,000 calories. If the average adult were to eat the recommended 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day, the breakdowns would go well beyond a person\u2019s daily intake in one sitting, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIt\u2019s important to watch for the nutritional breakdowns of each meal you order when dining out at restaurants, whether it\u2019s a chain or the mom-and-pop shop down the road, for the sake of your long-term dietary health. Using CSPI's list of tips for ordering foods with a healthful, careful, and educated eye, you'll learn to automatically order from the \"light\" menu, choose thin crusts for pizza, and skip the beef, burgers, and fried foods.\n\nClick \"View Slideshow\" to see the worst of the worst this year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "eat, healthy, and, avoid, these, 9, diet, ruining, restaurant, foods, when, you, dine, out", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Restaurant outings can cost you an overload of calories, fat, sugar, and salt, if you don't order carefully.", "title": "9 Unhealthiest Restaurant Meals That Can Ruin Your Diet", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eat-healthy-and-avoid-these-9-diet-ruining-restaurant-foods-when-you-dine-out-336548", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/04/dickeys-extreme-platter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Restaurant outings can cost you an overload of calories, fat, sugar, and salt, if you don't order carefully.", "title": "9 Unhealthiest Restaurant Meals That Can Ruin Your Diet", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eat-healthy-and-avoid-these-9-diet-ruining-restaurant-foods-when-you-dine-out-336548", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/04/dickeys-extreme-platter.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/04/dickeys-extreme-platter.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-06-05T10:41:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T10:51:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Restaurant outings can cost you an overload of calories, fat, sugar, and salt, if you don't order carefully."}, "article_summary": "Most of the orders were loaded with different types of fats, sugars, sodium, and accumulated to more than 2,000 calories.\nClick \"View Slideshow\" to see the worst of the worst this year.\nThis year's \u201cXtreme Eating 2015\u201d awards were given to the top nine unhealthiest dinners, drinks, and desserts that a customer could possibly order.\nUsing CSPI's list of tips for ordering foods with a healthful, careful, and educated eye, you'll learn to automatically order from the \"light\" menu, choose thin crusts for pizza, and skip the beef, burgers, and fried foods.\nIt\u2019s important to watch for the nutritional breakdowns of each meal you order when dining out at restaurants, whether it\u2019s a chain or the mom-and-pop shop down the road, for the sake of your long-term dietary health."}
