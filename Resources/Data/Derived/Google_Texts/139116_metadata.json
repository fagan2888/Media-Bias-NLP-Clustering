Wait a second, isn\u2019t this supposed to be free?\n\nWell yes\u2026and no, it turns out. The Affordable Care Act says healthcare plans must cover contraception prescribed by a woman\u2019s doctor without a copayment or coinsurance (they\u2019re considered preventative services). That means most private plans must cover the 18 methods of contraception approved by the FDA (including hormonal methods like birth control pills and vaginal rings, barrier methods like diaphragms, implanted devices, emergency contraception, and sterilization) as well as counseling appointments related to birth control.\n\nBut, as Health previously reported, insurers only have to cover one form of product in each category, which means they might only cover one type of hormonal birth control pill when there are several available, or only cover generic versions.\n\nThe thing is, there was another catch. Recent reports from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC) discovered that insurance companies were interpreting the law differently and denying coverage in some cases.\n\nRELATED: 15 Factors That Affect a Woman\u2019s Fertility\n\n\u201cWe found not all of the plans were covering every single method of birth control,\u201d says Alina Salganicoff, Kaiser Family Foundation vice president and director of women\u2019s health policy. Two big gaps: coverage of the hormonal ring or patch, as well as certain IUDs. \u201cInsurers interpreted the guidance to mean if they covered a hormonal combination that was available in an oral contraceptive, they didn\u2019t have to cover the patch or ring because they were the same hormone,\u201d she tells Health. Or, if they covered a hormonal IUD, they wouldn\u2019t have to cover a non-hormonal version.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that women need a wide range of choices. Contraception is not one-sized-fits-all,\u201d Salganicoff says. In addition, \u201ccost shouldn\u2019t be a barrier for women to get contraception. Many of the most expensive methods are the most effective,\u201d she says. (She\u2019s talking about long-acting birth control, like the IUD or implants.)\n\nIn light of these issues, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently released a set of Frequently Asked Questions intended to close potential gaps in coverage. On Monday, the HHS reiterated that all 18 FDA-approved contraceptive methods for women must be covered without cost.\n\nRELATED: 7 Common Birth Control Side Effects\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t providing enough detail about the scope of coverage provided. This seeks to eliminate any ambiguity,\u201d said Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a conference call with reporters on Monday.\n\nThe move doesn\u2019t change the policy\u2014just clarifies it\u2014but it should help more women get covered.\n\n\u201cThis makes us very happy for women,\u201d says Mara Gandal-Powers, council for Health and Reproductive Rights at the NWLC.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean your Rx will suddenly be free tomorrow. Salganicoff explains that insurers have time to phase in the guidelines, and you\u2019ll notice this change on an employer\u2019s plan during open enrollment, likely starting around January 2016, but college-issued plans may kick in earlier.\n\nRELATED: 10 Things That Mess With Your Period\n\nUntil then, if you\u2019re still charged for birth control, you can do something about it. Gandal-Powers says the first step for women is to contact Cover Her (online or at 1-866-745-5487), which is a resource from the NWLC that teaches women about the law. \u201cWe\u2019ll help them figure out what the issue is with their coverage,\u201d she says. (They also have a handy list of common questions and answers, including what to do if your employer objects to coverage on religious grounds.)\n\nFor example, your plan might only cover the generic version or you may be going to an out-of-network pharmacy. The NWLC would advise you to ask your doctor for a prescription which specifies you have a medical need for the brand name or help you identify a new pharmacy, says Salganicoff. (The HHS recommends asking your doctor to contact your insurance company directly.)\n\nBut if your insurance company isn\u2019t following the law, you may need to take it a step further and appeal\u2014a process that can be incredibly daunting. The NWLC will show you how to contact your insurer; they also have templates you can use to send an appeal letter. \u201cWe want to help women put their best foot forward in getting the coverage they need,\u201d says Gandal-Powers.\n\nRELATED: 10 Surprising Health Benefits of Being a Woman\n\nWith additional reporting by Julie Mazziotta.", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "You go to the drugstore to pick up your birth control and the pharmacist tells you it\u2019s $50.
