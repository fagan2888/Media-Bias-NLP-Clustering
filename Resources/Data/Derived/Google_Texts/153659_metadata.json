The racially inspired murders of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney and eight of his parishioners at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church had sparked national outrage, but they also put Republican leaders, including a number of the party\u2019s presidential hopefuls, in a precarious position. Calling for the flag to be removed risked offending some South Carolina voters who embraced it as part of their past and their tradition. Saying it should stay, risked offending much of the rest of the country \u2014 or being seen as pandering to voters in an early primary state.\n\nThe result this time, as it was so many times before, was mealy-mouthed statements about the flag from GOP presidential contenders.\n\nFrom Jeb Bush: \u201cMy position on how to address the Confederate flag is clear\u2026. Following a period of mourning there will rightly be a discussion among leaders in the state about how South Carolina should move forward, and I'm confident they will do the right thing.\"\n\nFrom Marco Rubio: \u201cUltimately the people of South Carolina will make the right decision for South Carolina, and I believe in their capacity to make that decision.\u201d\n\nFrom Rick Perry: \u201cI think a governor\u2019s job should be one to bring people together, not to divide them, and I think the Confederate battle flag is clearly one of those that divides people.\u201d\n\nRelated: Charleston Shooting Makes Confederate Flag a GOP Issue\n\nScott Walker, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina all held off on voicing their own opinions, saying the decision should be left to the people of South Carolina.\n\nContrast those positions with the statement issued by Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, who had also refused to pander to South Carolina voters on the flag issue during his previous campaign for the White House, in 2007:\n\nTake down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) June 20, 2015\n\nBy speaking up and speaking so bluntly \u2014 with none of the hedging, hemming or hawing we\u2019re so used to from our politicians \u2014 Romney added pressure on his fellow Republicans to take a stand as well. And some of those Republicans, in turn, offered \u201csubtle encouragement\u201d to Haley to ditch the flag, as The Times reports.\n\nRelated: Disbelief, Defiance in South Carolina Town Once Home to Shooting Suspect\n\nShe had little choice now, especially after it came out that Dylann Roof, the young white supremacist allegedly behind the church slayings, had taken up the flag as a symbol of hate in pictures posted online. \u201cThe events of this week call upon us to look at this in a different way,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans who had tiptoed around the issue in the past couldn\u2019t anymore, so Haley did what she needed to do. She did the right thing \u2014 for herself, her state and her party. Preserving the status quo at this point would have been politically impossible.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nikki Haley on Monday did something that The New York Times said just a week ag", "title": "Confederate Flag: A Small Step for Nikki Haley, a Big Move for the GOP", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/23/Confederate-Flag-Small-Step-Nikki-Haley-Big-Move-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/South_Carolina_Confederate_Flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/23/Confederate-Flag-Small-Step-Nikki-Haley-Big-Move-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/South_Carolina_Confederate_Flag.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nikki Haley on Monday did something that The New York Times said just a week ag", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "From Jeb Bush: \u201cMy position on how to address the Confederate flag is clear\u2026.\nCalling for the flag to be removed risked offending some South Carolina voters who embraced it as part of their past and their tradition.\nAnd some of those Republicans, in turn, offered \u201csubtle encouragement\u201d to Haley to ditch the flag, as The Times reports.\nThe result this time, as it was so many times before, was mealy-mouthed statements about the flag from GOP presidential contenders.\nRepublicans who had tiptoed around the issue in the past couldn\u2019t anymore, so Haley did what she needed to do."}
