Presidents don't write laws, Congress does,\u201d Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told ABC. \u201cExecutive orders are one thing, but executive orders that actually change the statute, that's totally different.\u201d\n\nIn his State of the Union on Tuesday, the president pledged to work with Congress where they could find common ground, but he also said he\u2019d enact his agenda via executive order where possible if lawmakers proved unable to act.\n\nThough he\u2019s said much the same thing before, the president\u2019s continued reliance on his administrative authority has sown fresh outrage among congressional Republicans.\n\nConfronted with statistics showing that Mr. Obama has issued fewer executive orders than his recent predecessors, Ryan said it not the \u201cnumber\u201d but rather the \u201cscope\u201d of the executive orders that troubled him.\n\nStill, Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and an influential voice among conservatives in the GOP caucus, shied away from any talk of impeaching the president over his alleged overreach.\n\n\n\nRyan also said the president\u2019s executive actions \u2013 particularly his decision to delay several deadlines in the Affordable Care Act \u2013 have made Republicans skeptical that he\u2019ll respect the full scope of future legislation.\n\nAsked about the House GOP\u2019s approach to immigration reform, which was laid out in a set of draft principles this week by Republican leaders, Ryan explained, \u201cIt's appropriate you brought this subject up after talking about these executive orders. Here's the issue that all Republicans agree on \u2013 we don't trust the president to enforce the law.\u201dHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., seconded Ryan on that point , telling CBS \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d that Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions have made immigration reform a tougher sell among Republicans.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of distrust of this administration in implementing the law and we just heard the president in his State of the Union address say, you know what, if he can\u2019t work with Congress, he's going to do it his own way,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cAnd that sort of breeds this kind of distrust and I think we're going to have to do something about that in order to see a way forward on immigration.\u201d\n\nThe White House, for its part, has explained the president\u2019s emphasis on executive action as a consequence of a Congress that simply can\u2019t do its job.\n\nAmericans \u201cwant clear, discernible, concrete actions that he can take so that he can move this thing forward, not wait for Congress,\u201d White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told NBC, saying the current Congress is \u201cquite slow\u201d and hasn\u2019t \u201clived up to\u201d the legislative accomplishments inked by past congresses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top House Republicans slam the president&#039;s reliance on executive action to advance his agenda, but W.H. says Congress is too dysfunctional to wait", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-obama-presidency-increasingly-lawless/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/02/c61acc50-1c20-429f-833e-2224fc7218cb/thumbnail/1200x630/a9f6ef06dd0f5e0264cf7270acf03eef/ap296292099970.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Top House Republicans slam the president's reliance on executive action to advance his agenda, but W.H. says Congress is too dysfunctional to wait", "title": "Paul Ryan: Obama presidency \"increasingly lawless\""}, "twitter": {"description": "Top House Republicans slam the president's reliance on executive action to advance his agenda, but W.H. says Congress is too dysfunctional to wait", "title": "Paul Ryan: Obama presidency \"increasingly lawless\"", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/paul-ryan-obama-presidency-increasingly-lawless/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/paul-ryan-obama-presidency-increasingly-lawless/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-obama-presidency-increasingly-lawless/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/02/c61acc50-1c20-429f-833e-2224fc7218cb/thumbnail/1200x630/a9f6ef06dd0f5e0264cf7270acf03eef/ap296292099970.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-obama-presidency-increasingly-lawless/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/paul-ryan-obama-presidency-increasingly-lawless/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd639\"", "article_summary": "Confronted with statistics showing that Mr. Obama has issued fewer executive orders than his recent predecessors, Ryan said it not the \u201cnumber\u201d but rather the \u201cscope\u201d of the executive orders that troubled him.\n\u201cWe have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and new laws without going through Congress.\nPresidents don't write laws, Congress does,\u201d Rep.
