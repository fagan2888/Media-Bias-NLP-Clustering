Now the millennials are out to upend marriage as well. Wedding planners and finger-wagging moralists are beside themselves. But maybe the kids are on to something \u2014 as long as it doesn\u2019t go too far.\n\nThe millennials are the much-maligned generation born in the 1980s through the early 2000s, raised on Harry Potter and 9/11, tech-savvy children of doting parents now entering a work world shaking from the Great Recession. They are, supposedly, too focused on self-actualization and not enough on making money for others. They expect the workplace to kowtow to them. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a bad thing, but I understand critics blaming those same doting parents for continuing to provide them with a place to live and free health care coverage until they\u2019re 26 (thanks, Obamacare!). With goodies like these, who needs to work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now comes a new report from researchers at the Urban Institute: Millennials aren\u2019t getting married either. The percentage who will be unmarried by the time they hit age 40 could be as high as 30 percent, predicts the study. Of course, that still means 70 percent will get married, but that figure is well below the marriage rates for early baby boomers (91 percent), late boomers (87 percent), and Gen Xers (82 percent). The Urban Institute researchers appropriately offer a caveat \u2014 these are forecasts, after all \u2014 and acknowledge that what might really be going on is that millennials are just postponing marriage rather than forswearing the institution altogether.\n\nLet\u2019s hope so. Not getting married at all could prove tragic.\n\nThe onset of adulthood \u2014 post-college until age 30 or so \u2014 has historically been settling-down time: finding a job, coupling up, getting married, having kids. It\u2019s a world thoroughly plumbed by television shows from \u201cFriends\u201d to \u201cHow I Met Your Mother.\u201d For those of that age, there are times when it seems as if weddings dominate the social calendar, as one friend after another becomes engaged, plans the event, and then insists everyone show up. Too much money is spent on all of this; indeed, the wedding business is a major $52 billion industry, with the average now costing almost $30,000. The day itself leaves parents of the bride financially broken (an antiquated tradition, by the way), friends of the bride with dresses they\u2019ll never again wear, and everyone else with a mixture of aching heads and embarrassed regrets.\n\nAnd for all that, there\u2019s a strong chance they\u2019ll just divorce anyway.\n\nI overstate my cynicism. I\u2019ve been to a number of great weddings, some quite recently. Still, one can\u2019t help think that postponing wedlock would, for many, be a smart thing. Older adults would doubtless embark upon marriage with a greater seriousness of purpose. The day would be less about celebration and more about commitment. And who knows? With both parties steadily employed, perhaps mom and dad wouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we should worry if the postponement is permanent. The Urban Institute data suggest that, straight or gay, people continue to couple up; they just don\u2019t get married. That\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s not only the legal benefits of marriage \u2014 such as better tax treatment, visitation rights, and inheritance. Marriage is also a shield against poverty; the married are economically more secure (even when it comes to divorce). Then too \u2014 and of great consequence \u2014 children thrive better when raised in stable households.\n\nTroubling too is that marriage rates \u2014 including for millennials \u2014 break along demographic lines. Better off and white individuals tend to get married far more frequently than those who are less well off or minorities. It\u2019s a \u201cmarriage gap,\u201d argues social observer Kay S. Hymowitz, creating a kind of matrimonial underclass \u201cdestined for separate and unequal futures.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Millennials waiting for marriage is probably to the good. But they \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 will regret it if they wait too long.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.395661009", "eomportal-id": 191437, "description": "It\u2019s not enough that they want to upend the modern workplace.
