This time he almost outdid his past inane cracks with the zinger that the Affordable Care Act is worse than slavery. Carson has parlayed his zany potshots into a plum spot as a Fox News Network commentator. This is the sorry case of a man who at one time had the respect of many for his moving, inspiring story of overcoming hardships to become a highly respected medical professional and who now has prostituted himself to grab a quick headline from a sound bite driven, titillation media that hungrily eats up anything that someone like a Dr. Ben Carson dishes out.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the case of a man such as Dr. Ben Carson and his ilk that serve a calculating purpose. They get attention for the GOP. While they are zany, they also touch a deep, dark, and throbbing pulse among legions of ultra-conservatives who think that Obama and many Democrats are communists, gays are immoral, and that the health care reform law is exactly what Carson called it \u201cslavery,\u201d meaning the tyrannical intrusion by big government into their lives. Carson actually went even further than the slavery dig and likened the health care law to the old communist dictatorship in the Soviet Union run by Lenin.\n\nMainstream GOP leaders can\u2019t utter these inanities. They must always give appearance that they are above the dirt, mud, and hate slinging fray. So they leave it to a well-paid stalking horse like Carson to do their dirty work for them. But that\u2019s only part of Carson\u2019s worth to conservatives.\n\nHe gives the illusion that the GOP is a race neutral party that has a plethora of big name, African-Americans as their visible point men and women, and who speak with authority. The cast of shameless black panderers and hucksters that the GOP has trotted out and plopped in front of the TV cameras during the past few years has been both endless and embarrassing. But they still keep them coming.\n\nThe idiotic comparison of the Affordable Care Act to slavery was a perfect example of how the GOP craftily manages to weld race and its current signature hit issue of Obama, the health care law, into one package to play on rightwing hysteria over the law. The GOP understands the fundamental political axiom that self-interest rules politics as well, if not better, than the Democrats. Party leaders have long known that blue collar white voters, especially male voters, can be easily aroused to vote and shout loudly on the emotional wedge issues; abortion, family values, anti-gay marriage and tax cuts.\n\nFor months before passage, they whipped up mania and borderline racism against the health care law. This was glaringly apparent in ferocity and bile spouted by the shock troops that the GOP leaders in conjunction with the tea party brought out to harangue, harass and bully Democratic legislators on the eve of the health care vote. For the months after passage of the act and its upholding by the Supreme Court the GOP has never relented in the drumbeat attack up on it. That includes the dozens of House votes to defund or outright kill it. And then everything it making it the prime bargaining chip in its fresh assault on government with the partial shutdown.\n\nDr. Ben Carson fits neatly into this script. He\u2019s an African-American with name identification and some admiration among blacks, though that\u2019s dwindling fast. We can be sure then that this won\u2019t be the last crackpot quip that we\u2019ll hear from Dr. Ben Carson. Sadly, he\u2019ll continue to be the worst thing that happened to us since he opened his mouth.\n\nWritten By Earl Ofari Hutchinson\n\nOne can find more info about Mr. Hutchinson over at the following site; TheHutchinson ReportNews.\n\nAlso feel free to connect with him through twitter; http://twitter.com/earlhutchinson\n\nMore Articles:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://thyblackman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DrBenCarson.jpg"}, "language": "en", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ae4\"", "article_summary": "You are here: Home Health / Dr. Ben Carson is the Worst Thing to Happen to Us since He Opened His Mouth.\nDr. Ben Carson is the Worst Thing to Happen to Us since He Opened His Mouth.\nWe can be sure then that this won\u2019t be the last crackpot quip that we\u2019ll hear from Dr. Ben Carson.\nBut it\u2019s also the case of a man such as Dr. Ben Carson and his ilk that serve a calculating purpose.\nSadly, he\u2019ll continue to be the worst thing that happened to us since he opened his mouth."}
