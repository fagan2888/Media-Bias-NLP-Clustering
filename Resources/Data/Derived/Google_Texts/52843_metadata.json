That\u2019s triple the share who expected this higher growth rate in the previous survey figure. As before, none of the survey respondents expects growth to be negative.\u201d\n\nRelated: Skills Gap \u2013 Why Employers Can\u2019t Fill Jobs\n\nThe majority of survey participants represents businesses with 100 employees or more, and 40 percent represent firms with more than 1,000 workers.\n\nOne of the most encouraging findings was that in the second quarter of 2014, only 22 percent of respondents reported that they faced a shortage of skilled workers, down dramatically from the 33 percent who reported problems finding workers this time last year.\n\nWhen you think about it, though, that finding is pretty counterintuitive. One of the biggest complaints from the business community for the past several years has been the difficulty of attracting skilled workers. If they are so in demand, surely they ought to be scooped up the moment they become available.\n\nRelated: No Job Loss in Most States the Raised Minimum Wage\n\nThe U.S. economy has produced something like 1.2 million new jobs in the last year, meaning that more and more of the unemployed have found work. Indeed, the unemployment rate in the U.S. fell from 7.5 percent this time last year to 6.1 percent today.\n\nIf more people have found jobs, though, and a smaller percentage of the population is out of work, it seems at first glance that firms should be finding it harder, not easier, to attract skilled workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of what I would have expected,\u201d conceded Simonson in an interview after the teleconference, though he said that he still hears complaints about the difficulty of finding skilled construction workers.\n\nBrookings Institution Economist Gary Burtless says the mysterious appearance of more skilled workers might be explained by another finding of the NABE study: After years of barely keeping pace with inflation, wages have been starting to rise.\n\nRelated: Millennials vs. Robots \u2013 Who Will Win the Jobs?\n\nAccording to the study, 43 percent of respondents \u201creported that their firms raised wages last quarter, the third straight quarterly rise in that share and more than double the share reporting increases a year ago.\u201d It also found that an additional 35 percent expect to raise wages in the third quarter.\n\nWith unconcealed sarcasm, Burtless wondered whether the sudden availability of skilled workers, \u201cmight be linked\u201d to rising wages.\n\n\u201cThe story that there is a structural mismatch between the needs of expanding employers and the skills of the people waiting on the sideline\u2026is based mainly on anecdotal evidence from individual companies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen business owners complain about having difficulty filling jobs, Burtless said, \u201cWhat\u2019s always surprised me is the business journalists who decline to ask the obvious follow-on question: Have you tried offering them more money? Better benefits?\u201d\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t Ignore Janet Yellen\u2019s Stock Market Warnings\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheap to say there is a mismatch in skills. It\u2019s a little more expensive to pay workers more,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the increased availability of skilled workers is that Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen has been correct in her assessment that discouraged workers will return to the workforce as the economy improves.\n\nYellen has said a number of times that she expects labor force participation to improve, at least somewhat, as the economy grows, and businesses seeing more skilled laborers available for hire might be a function of skilled individuals who had given up looking for work finding their way back into the labor market.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the seeming truisms of the economic recovery \u2013 that there\u2019s a major skills mismatch between workers and job openings \u2013 may not be exactly true.", "title": "Wages Rise and \u2013 Surprise \u2013 Skilled Workers Are Now Easier to Find", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/22/Wages-Rise-and-Surprise-Skilled-Workers-Are-Now-Easier-Find", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/22/Wages-Rise-and-Surprise-Skilled-Workers-Are-Now-Easier-Find", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One of the seeming truisms of the economic recovery \u2013 that there\u2019s a major skills mismatch between workers and job openings \u2013 may not be exactly true.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85f1\"", "article_summary": "With unconcealed sarcasm, Burtless wondered whether the sudden availability of skilled workers, \u201cmight be linked\u201d to rising wages.\nOne of the biggest complaints from the business community for the past several years has been the difficulty of attracting skilled workers.\nAnother possible explanation for the increased availability of skilled workers is that Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen has been correct in her assessment that discouraged workers will return to the workforce as the economy improves.\nBrookings Institution Economist Gary Burtless says the mysterious appearance of more skilled workers might be explained by another finding of the NABE study: After years of barely keeping pace with inflation, wages have been starting to rise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of what I would have expected,\u201d conceded Simonson in an interview after the teleconference, though he said that he still hears complaints about the difficulty of finding skilled construction workers."}
