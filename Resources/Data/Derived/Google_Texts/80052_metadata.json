Mary Landrieu (D) sat down with The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker earlier this month for about a half hour to talk about why she thinks she her new position as Energy and Natural Resources chairwoman can help her win reelection this fall in solidly Republican Louisiana; what she thinks of Obamacare; why she could deliver more for Louisiana than her likely opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R); and whether she wants campaign help from the Clintons or the Obamas. A lightly edited transcript of the conversation is below.\n\n\n\nIn this Oct. 3, 2013, file photo Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., speaks at a news conference and Capitol Hill in Washington. Landrieu\u2019s quest for a fourth Senate term will turn on whether she can attract just enough support from independents an (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci, File)\n\nThe Washington Post: What is your argument for a fourth term? Why should the voters of Louisiana keep you there? What is the case you\u2019re trying to make?\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu: \u201cThe voters over 18 years have established great clout in Washington. It doesn\u2019t belong to me; it belongs to them. As chair of the energy committee, they sit at the head of the table with the gavel. As chair of homeland security, the state sits at the head of the table with the gavel. It\u2019s not easy -- you can\u2019t just be awarded those gavels. It comes with time and it comes with persistence. So I think, you know, the state has clout that it should really think carefully about before giving up. It turns into jobs and opportunities and projects and funding that comes to the state.\n\n\u201cI also think my ability to work across party lines is important to people today. People are saying nothing\u2019s working in Washington, but despite all the gridlock and partisanship, I\u2019ve been able my whole career to pass really significant pieces of legislation that have benefited the state. Whether it was the additional $3 billion after Katrina that wasn\u2019t going to come unless I put my shoulder to the wheel and made that happen. Or passing GOMESA, the first-ever revenue sharing from off-shore rigs that people said should\u2019ve happened decades ago but never did, and I helped and led that. More recently, the flood insurance bill, which people said would never happen and [I] put a great coalition together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the combination of the state having the clout with the seniority, Energy Committee, homeland security, Appropriations Committee, and with my own individual record of delivering with Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, in tough times, good times, regardless of who\u2019s been governor, been able to really deliver for the state things that matter and turn into jobs and opportunity for the people here.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cWhen you talk about your clout on the Energy Committee\u2026\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cWell, it\u2019s not my clout. It\u2019s really the state of Louisiana\u2019s clout.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cWhy do you think that resonates with people here? And what is it about that committee that speaks to people\u2019s economic anxieties and concerns?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cLouisiana\u2019s traditionally been an energy state, an oil and gas state, and we have other sources of energy but primarily oil and gas. And we\u2019re really proud of the role that we\u2019ve played in developing the technology \u2013 both on shore, off shore, shallow, deep-water off shore, conventional, unconventional gas and oil. And the industry itself employs over 300,000 people, so once you put oil and gas and petro-chemical together, it really is the base of our economy, along with agriculture and tourism. And it\u2019s been over 18 years [since] our state has had the chairmanship of this committee. Bennett Johnson, whose seat I took, was the chair. And more significantly, this committee is usually chaired by a westerner. So Bennett was an exception to that rule and I\u2019m an exception to that rule\u2026 so it puts not just Louisiana, it puts the Gulf Coast in a leadership position, and the Gulf Coast is America\u2019s energy coast.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have a very deep and basic understanding of how important that industry is and they like that somebody from Louisiana would be in a leadership position to shape those priorities. I\u2019m for the Keystone pipeline, I\u2019m for building more energy infrastructure, I\u2019m for more domestic drilling. I\u2019m going to use that platform to argue that the North American continent should be energy self-sufficient, between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, which has never been really possible before.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople understand that in Louisiana, it\u2019s not a hard sell, and I think they\u2019re proud that I\u2019m the chair of that committee, happy that Louisiana has clout on that committee, happy that Louisiana\u2019s helping to shape the energy policy for the nation. And I think being the first woman chair is not lost on some of our folks here as well.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cYou mentioned Keystone. How, if you\u2019re chairman of the committee and you look ahead to the next two years, how do you get anything done there when the president and his administration have not green-lighted the Keystone pipeline? And indeed, there\u2019s a lot of hostility to that in your party.\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI\u2019m helping to lead the building of the Keystone pipeline, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of Democrats and Republicans at every level from other parts of the state to come together. My goal right now is to get this presented in the Senate, to get it voted on in the Senate. The president could veto it. I mean, it\u2019s his right. I would argue that he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cHow to convince him to change his mind when he hasn\u2019t changed it already?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my job. I wish I could. And I\u2019m going to do everything I can to try. But, you know, [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell has more power than I do and he hasn\u2019t been able to. The Chamber of Commerce has a tremendous amount of power; they\u2019ve not been able to change the president\u2019s mind. The president knows that there\u2019s some Democrats and some Republicans that are really strong for the Keystone pipeline. We\u2019ve presented so much evidence to him, we think. But, you know, he\u2019s got a job to do, I\u2019ve got a job to do and the Senate\u2019s got a job to do and I hope that we can eventually get that pushed through. But it takes time. It\u2019s been five years, I think it should\u2019ve been done three years ago. But we\u2019re going to continue to push. And I\u2019m going to push for additional infrastructure.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cAll around the country, people are fed up with Washington. There\u2019s been this throw-the-bums out attitude that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of cycles. [Former Democratic Sen.] Blanche Lincoln ran and made a big deal out of being chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee and that didn\u2019t convince voters in Arkansas. Is there something different about Louisiana and the relationship between the people here and the federal government that you think this clout message matters?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI am not making the argument that people should send me back just because I\u2019m chair of energy. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons, just because energy\u2026really is the lifeblood of this state. People work in the energy field, they understand it, and from petrochemicals to exploration and production to mid-pipe. But I\u2019m also saying, my record of delivering for this state \u2013 Washington is broken, but Mary Landrieu\u2019s record isn\u2019t. Washington might not work together well, but Mary Landrieu\u2019s been able to deliver, even with the gridlock, important things, a long list of things for the state. So people may be mad at Washington, but I think they look at me and they say, \u2018You know, she\u2019s an exception, she\u2019s actually been able to produce major pieces of legislation, even with the gridlock. That\u2019s the kind of person we want.\u2019 I think they look at my record and say, \u2018You know, she doesn\u2019t vote with the Democratic Party all the time, she\u2019s got a very independent voting record.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you list all the senators from literally the most liberal to the most conservative, I\u2019m right in the middle, and I\u2019m a proud centrist. I am. I\u2019m a proud centrist, and the record shows that over time, and it\u2019s been very consistent for 18 years. And people in my state, while they may be strong Democrats or strong Republicans, I think they admire people who will be willing, who are willing to cross party lines and get things done for the state. So I am not just running on 'I\u2019m chair of this committee, get me back.' And it\u2019s not me the chair. Louisiana has built up this clout where Louisiana can be in the forefront of designing an energy policy for the nation. Why would we want to hand that off to Oregon or to Washington state or to New York or to California? Why would we want to do that? Why can\u2019t Louisiana be in the driver\u2019s seat for a change?\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cYou talked about your record. If Republicans had their way, voters here would only vote based on one piece of that record, the health care vote, Obamacare. How do you make this campaign about something bigger than those national levels, bigger than the president\u2019s unpopularity and the health care law that you voted for.\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cWhen I\u2019m in this state, people talk to me about jobs, education, opportunity, housing, highways, energy policy. I know that there are outside forces that want to make the Affordable Care Act the issue, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not an important issue, but I believe that that is a good act that will provide opportunity for quality health care for people that needs to be improved, not repealed. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of outside money coming in here to make that the central issue, but I\u2019ve been the senator long enough to really know what the central issues are here. And when people talk to me, they really talk about jobs and education, they want to see their kids advance and get ahead, they want their kids to go to college, they don\u2019t like the huge debt burdens their kids are facing. Occasionally people will talk about health care to me, but it\u2019s not as central as you might believe from what you hear in Washington.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cDo you think you\u2019ve done enough to try to fix the law?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to do more, but I\u2019ve offered some really good suggestions. And I also think that the law, as it\u2019s being implemented, our insurance commissioner here, who\u2019s a Republican, allowed along with my urging and with the actions the president did after pushing him, allowed people to keep their policies, so we had 43,000 people who could keep their policies. I\u2019ve continued to urge our governor to expand Medicaid. I\u2019ve called it the 252,000 people in our state who work hard every day, in fact they work hard all week, some of them work 40 or 50 hours a week, have no access to health insurance because they fall into the \u2018Jindal Gap.\u2019 Governor Jindal has refused to expand health care opportunities even though the $16 billion that is our money, he\u2019s leaving it in Washington for other people to use instead of using it for our own hospitals and nurses and doctors and healthcare. Every newspaper in the state has editorialized for that position. It might not have passed the legislature, but the business community understands it and individuals that need the care and local doctors and hospitals understand how important that would be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t concede this healthcare issue to the other side. I think the Affordable Care Act is a good step forward. It needs to be improved. I\u2019m working to improve it \u2013 expanding Medicaid, lifting the voluntary limit to companies with 100 or less, and other things that I\u2019ve suggested. Allowing individual agents to be able to sell policies and not have that discounted. But at the end of the day, I think most Americans think that if you work, you should be able to afford health insurance and more importantly you should be able to take your health insurance with you wherever you want to work. And if you want to start your own business, you should have affordable healthcare and not be prevented from an entrepreneurial opportunity because your daughter has leukemia or your wife has cancer. I just think there are people in Washington making this issue much bigger or more complicated than it really is.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cHas the president explained to the people of Louisiana and really what this law is all about and what the benefits are? Do the people have a clear sense of what this law actually provides and doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the White House has done the best job on that. But as time goes on, people are really starting to understand and see in their own lives some of the benefits of this law \u2013 being able to get insurance when they\u2019re sick, being able to keep insurance when they need it the most, being able to get their kids on their insurance policies, not being able to get turned away. So it\u2019s not the centerpiece of my campaign, but it\u2019s also a law that I think is a step in the right direction, and it needs improvement, not repeal.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cAre the Clintons going to come help you?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI think so and hope so. They\u2019re both very popular in the state. Bill Clinton is a neighbor, that\u2019s the way people think of him here.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cI think everybody thinks of him as a neighbor.\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cYes, a chatty neighbor, friendly neighbor. People like him and hopefully he\u2019ll come in and be helpful.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cAnd President Obama?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the president\u2019s going to come in or not. Michelle Obama was just here, we loved having the first lady here. She was terrific. She was here for Dillard [University]. We were both together at the Dillard commencement. She gave the commencement and I received an honorary degree. And the first lady and I did a roundtable with veterans, with spouses of veterans, mostly women, about the trauma of their husbands coming home. And she\u2019s just been a tremendous advocate for military families.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, President Obama is popular with certain groups and segments in Louisiana, unpopular in others. So he\u2019ll help me where he can. But in some places his support would not be that helpful. In others, it would be very helpful.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cHas anything really surprised you so far in this campaign?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cYou\u2019re not surprised by the outside money or the early intensity?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not surprised. It\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever experienced before, but I was prepared for a very tough campaign and I\u2019m in a very tough campaign. I didn\u2019t\u2019 expect it to be anything less. I\u2019ve had very tough elections. I always do. I prepare for them and I think it makes me a better leader, actually. I learn a lot through them and I think I do a better job at the other end. But I feel a tremendous amount of support in the state right now, contrary to the national this and that. I just feel it on the ground.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cHow do you feel it?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI feel it because people come up to me. I can look at data, but I also can feel when I\u2019m out in groups, they may be aggravated at this or they may be aggravated at that, they may not like so and so or so and so, but when they look at my record, I think they think we need to keep her there, she\u2019s really done a good job for our state and she\u2019s delivered time and time again on projects that mean jobs and opportunity for our state. And I don\u2019t like her vote on this, but I do like all these other things. Or I don\u2019t like that, but I like all of this. Louisianans can be kind of practical in their politics. And because I\u2019m one of the few senators that has a centrist record and can prove it \u2013 not just say it, but actually prove it \u2013 I think that\u2019s what people are looking for. Bridge builders and people that can work across party lines. And I think nothing shows that better than this flood insurance whole effort that I led and helped develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, they called me the \u2018Paul Revere of flood insurance.\u2019 Nobody wanted to touch it, nobody thought it was a problem and I kept saying, \u2018Yes, this is a terrible problem.\u2019 Sure enough, when these bills came out people literally were hysterical and I don\u2019t blame them. When your insurance goes up from $400 a year to $30,000, that\u2019s something to get upset about. It\u2019s crazy. And then when you have the federal government saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to change it. You all shouldn\u2019t live there. Why do you people live there anyway?\u2019 That was what I got a lot of. So I like explaining to people why we live here and how hard we work here and what a great contribution we make to the economy of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think people see in me a fighter that never quits, never gives up, always puts the state first \u2013 may not agree with me on every one of my positions, but I think they think, \u2018Gee, Louisiana does have this clout, particularly in energy. At the time of the energy renaissance, when for the first time in like 50 years people really believe that there\u2019s a great enough supply for us to become truly energy independent and self-sufficient, why when Louisiana could help be in the lead of writing that energy policy for the nation, why would we walk away from that?\u2019\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cCould [Rep. Bill] Cassidy not be a fighter? Could he not be a bridge builder? Could he not over time get enough clout and respect in the Senate to run the Energy Committee?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cIf he was that kind of person, he would\u2019ve shown it already. He\u2019s been there long enough to show it and he\u2019s given no indication of an ability to do that.\u201d\n\nPost: \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\nLandrieu: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can point to one major piece of legislation, not one, that he\u2019s passed that\u2019s been a Democratic-Republican major piece of legislation. He\u2019s been there, what, three terms? He\u2019s been there almost six years\u2026. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really passed a major piece of legislation that I can think of that he really did lead and put together. There are other members of our delegation that have been a lot more powerful within their networks, but he would not be. I think he\u2019s shown very limited ability so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could grow into the clout, I guess. I don\u2019t think he could necessarily. But a person more able could potentially, but it would take 18 years. You\u2019re talking about 2032 to get back to where you are today. But, you know, he has his own. That\u2019s how I\u2019m framing this race: This is about Louisiana, it\u2019s not about Washington. It\u2019s about delivering for the state consistently, having a record as a centrist and bipartisan bridge builder and having spent enough time delivering for this state the clout we need to be in the forefront and I have every confidence that that message is resonating, will continue to resonate and I think I\u2019m most certainly going to win. It might not be by this great margin, but I feel very confident\u2026 I\u2019ll take one vote plus 50, and I\u2019m not overly confident, but I\u2019m confident in the record, the team that I\u2019ve put together and that the message really is and always has been about Louisiana. It\u2019s not about Washington, it\u2019s not about the president\u2019s record, it\u2019s about my record, it\u2019s not about anybody else but about me and my ability to deliver for the state and what I think the people of Louisiana want to see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Louisiana senator covers topics ranging from her reelection challenge to Obamacare to the Clintons", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Louisiana senator covers topics ranging from her reelection challenge to Obamacare to the Clintons", "title": "16 questions for Mary Landrieu", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/05/27/16-questions-for-mary-landrieu/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/21/National-Politics/Images/Senate_Louisiana-09f02-4472.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilipRucker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/05/27/16-questions-for-mary-landrieu/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Mary Landrieu, Clintons, Louisiana, Obamacare:,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Mary Landrieu, Clintons, Louisiana, Obamacare:,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5a0\"", "article_summary": "But I\u2019m also saying, my record of delivering for this state \u2013 Washington is broken, but Mary Landrieu\u2019s record isn\u2019t.\nSen.
