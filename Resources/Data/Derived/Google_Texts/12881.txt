Broncos’ slot receiver Wes Welker is expected to be reinstated from his suspension by 8 a.m. Wednesday, according to an NFL source.

The 11th-year veteran would then be able to join the Broncos’ practice session for the first time in two weeks.

Coaches across the league no doubt wish the NFL and players union could have finalized their revised drug policy sooner rather than later. Another game-planning Tuesday went by with the Broncos’ coaching staff half-thinking they would have Welker for their next game Sunday at Seattle and half-thinking not.

To be fair, Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll had to half-plan to defend Welker and half-not. Not that anyone around Denver feels sorry for Carroll and the Seahawks.

As of Tuesday night, league management and the players union were closing in on a reaching agreement on a revised drug policy, according to an NFL source. The new policy would feature testing for illegal performance-boosting, human growth hormone.

Then again, ratification of the revised drug policy has been expected the past two weeks. It got so close Friday, the NFL Players Association had its 32 team union representatives vote to approve the league’s revised drug policy — ordinarily a final step to an agreement.

But now it appears a deal is imminent, which means Welker’s four-game suspension would be reduced to the two games he already has served because his infraction for testing positive in the offseason for an amphetamine would shift from the zero-tolerance, performance-enhancement program to the substance-abuse jurisdiction which essentially places first-time violators on probation.

Welker has been training in Denver and is ready to join the Broncos at Dove Valley on a moment’s notice.

He suffered a concussion in the Broncos’ third preseason game on Aug. 23 but he was cleared two weeks ago by an independent doctor for a return to full football activities, including contact.
