SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) - Francis Alemo hit a two-run double and also earned the win pitching as Uganda opened the Little League World Series Friday with a 4-1 win over the Dominican Republic.

Uganda reliever Jovan Edaku earned the save in two innings of relief, coaxing a bases-loaded groundout in the bottom of the fifth inning and a 4-6-3 double play turned by shortstop Joshua Olara in the bottom of the sixth.

Olara also scored two runs from the leadoff spot.

The team from Kampala represents Uganda’s second appearance in the series. In 2012, a team from Lugazi went 1-2, dropping its first two games before winning a consolation crossover game.

This is also the Dominican Republic’s first appearance here since 1996. The Dominican Republic played without one of its coaches, Victor Bernabe, who was suspended indefinitely Friday by Little League International for an unspecified conduct violation. Little League spokesman Brian McClintock says the tournament committee is reviewing the situation.
