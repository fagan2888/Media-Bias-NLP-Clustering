These casualty figures are not exceptional, however, but reflect the daily status quo of a simmering conflict that, despite the Feb. 12 cease-fire, continues to kill soldiers and civilians and devastate Ukraine\u2019s economy.\n\nA U.N. report released Monday, which compiled casualty data through May 30, said 6,417 soldiers and civilians have died in the Ukraine war, up from 6,100 on April 17. In the intervening six weeks, the war has killed, on average, more than seven people a day.\n\nThe war costs Ukraine from $5 million to $10 million a day, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said May 2. Ukraine reported a year-on-year 15.2 percent drop in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine.\n\nThe situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine starkly contrasts, however, with the Kremlin\u2019s softening tone regarding the conflict.\n\nIn a May 20 interview with the Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that separatist-controlled territories should remain part of Ukraine. That same week, Alexander Kofman, foreign minister of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, one of the separatist territories, said plans to unite the Ukrainian separatist movement under the common flag of Novorossiya had been sidelined.\n\n\u201cThe Novorossiya project is frozen until a new political elite emerges in all these regions that will be able to head the movement,\u201d Kofman told the Vechernyaya Makeyevka newspaper, according to The Moscow Times.\n\nNovorossiya is a historical reference to a portion of the Russian empire under Catherine the Great, which comprised territory now a part of modern Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin first used the term in reference to the Ukraine crisis last April.\n\nSkepticism\n\nSome claim Russia\u2019s recent rhetorical backtracking is a ploy to secure sanctions relief in the run-up to the European Council meeting on June 26.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion this is pure Russian posturing,\u201d said Luke Coffey, Margaret Thatcher fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cMoscow knows that Europe is divided on the issues of EU sanctions,\u201d he added. \u201cSince decisions of this nature are decided unanimously in the EU, all it takes is one member to block everything resulting in a watered-down compromise \u2026 we will see Russia trying to calm things down in Ukraine with the hope that it leads to a loosening or removal of EU sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose statements prove that the Russian aggressors are only changing tactics,\u201d Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told The Daily Signal. \u201c \u2026 We know that Russia will not change its position overnight; it doesn\u2019t want to look weak. Social tension in Russia is growing every day because of the economic tensions.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Ukrainian officials have pointed to the tens of thousands of Russian troops stationed near Ukraine\u2019s borders and the influx of Russian weapons and personnel into Ukraine as proof of a possible summer offensive.\n\n\u201cI have no illusions about Putin\u2019s intentions,\u201d Marcel H. Van Herpen, director of the Cicero Foundation, a Dutch think tank focusing on the integration of former Soviet countries into the Europe Union, wrote in an email to The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cPutin never speaks about the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine and that\u2019s what it is all about,\u201d he added. \u201cBefore a new wave of aggression the Kremlin would be happy to reduce Western sanctions that begin to bite. So we can expect more talk about the Kremlin\u2019s \u2018peaceful intentions\u2019 while the military build-up at the frontier continues.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in official statements posted to its website, it denies that Russia is aiding the separatists or has soldiers fighting in Ukraine on its orders.\n\nTotal War\n\nUkrainian military officials are primarily concerned about a separatist offensive at two locations on the front line.\n\nFirst, they anticipate an attack to take the power plant near the village of Shchastya, outside Luhansk. The power plant is capable of supplying 98 percent of the Luhansk Oblast\u2019s energy needs, according to a May 21 Kyiv Post report.\n\nThe second area of concern is Mariupol, which is home to Illich Steel and Iron Works, the second largest metallurgical plant in Ukraine. The industrial city on the Sea of Azov (with a pre-war population of 500,000) is a valuable port and the key to a land bridge from Russia to Crimea.\n\nUkrainian forces have been preparing to defend Mariupol for months. Minefields, trenches, tank barriers and machine gun nests ring the city. The beaches have also been fortified, and mines have been placed offshore to defend against an amphibious attack, according to residents.\n\nBut the consensus within the Ukrainian military, both among officials in Kyiv and soldiers on the front line, is that the separatist forces will most likely try to encircle Mariupol in a push to invade west toward Crimea. If successful, such a move would trap thousands of Ukrainian troops inside the city, setting up a potentially catastrophic showdown. Ukrainian soldiers frequently and acerbically reply \u201cGrozny\u201d when asked to describe how such a battle would play out.\n\nThe massacre of Ukrainian troops during previous retreats from the towns of Ilovaisk and Debaltseve have left many vowing to fight to the death if Mariupol is surrounded.\n\nThis grinding, static war, in which many soldiers on both sides of the conflict have seen comrades killed or wounded, has also generated levels of antipathy that make a peaceful outcome less likely the longer such conditions exist.\n\nMany of the Ukrainian troops holding the line in nearby Shyrokyne (about 10 miles east of Mariupol) have weathered daily heavy weapons attacks and sniper fire for months while sitting in trenches and holed up in abandoned homes. They are currently under orders to not attack and can return fire only under restricted circumstances.\n\nAt night in Shyrokyne, separatists crawl up to within meters of the Ukrainian trenches and challenge the Ukrainian soldiers to hand to hand combat. Ukrainians in the trenches refer to the separatists as \u201canimals,\u201d and say months of close proximity to the enemy and the constant casualties have made it easier to kill.\n\nShyrokyne is not unique. Throughout the conflict area, cease-fire violations continue daily, including the use of heavy weapons, which are banned according to the Feb. 12 cease-fire\u2019s terms.\n\nOn May 26, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the multinational group charged with monitoring the cease-fire, reported more than 200 heavy munitions explosions around the Donetsk airport. On that same day, Ukrainian forces said separatists launched 45 artillery shells at their positions near Avdiivka, setting fire to a nearby coke-chemical plant.\n\nOSCE monitors are responsible for inspecting the approximately 230-mile-long contact line with SUVs and a fleet of drones supplied and operated by private contractors.\n\nIn the wide-open seaside steppe around Shyrokyne, the OSCE\u2019s white armored Toyota Land Cruisers are visible from a distance. When the convoys approach, the firing stops and the lines become mute. Once the monitors leave and are out of sight, the firing resumes as if on cue. This repeated obfuscation of the true nature of the conflict has left many soldiers with little faith in the truce and the mechanisms in place to enforce it.\n\nThe OSCE is also unable to monitor the front lines at night, which is when many heavy weapons attacks occur. The concussions of artillery and mortars from fighting in Shyrokyne are a nightly staple in Mariupol.\n\nCalm Before the Storm\n\nWhile the fighting is consistent, its overall intensity has decreased since the Feb. 12 truce. Lysenko said cease-fire violations in April were down from March. Rather than a bellwether of peace, however, the lull in fighting has been used by both sides as an opportunity to reposition and resupply their forces and brace for the resumption of a war that many see as inevitable.\n\n\u201cI predict a new summer offensive which could take place in July or August in order to make the DPR and LPR more viable,\u201d Van Herpen said, referring to the two separatist republics. \u201cKeep an eye on what will happen around Shchastya and Mariupol.\u201d\n\nUkraine announced last week it now has 50,000 troops deployed to the conflict areas\u2014higher than at any other point of the conflict.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about a full-fledged advance, we are ready for that at any moment,\u201d Lysenko said. \u201cThe Donbas was and will be a territory of Ukraine. The presence of pro-Russian mercenaries and the Russian military there is a temporary phenomenon. Ukraine will do everything to get those territories back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite Moscow\u2019s warming rhetoric in recent weeks, the Ukraine conflict is showing little evidence of cooling off this summer.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Despite Moscow\u2019s warming rhetoric in recent weeks, the Ukraine conflict is showing little evidence of cooling off this summer.", "title": "Despite Russian Denials, Ukraine Bracing for Violent Summer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SummerOffensive.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-02T12:48:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1M7ZAhM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Despite Moscow\u2019s warming rhetoric in recent weeks, the Ukraine conflict is showing little evidence of cooling off this summer.", "title": "Despite Russian Denials, Ukraine Bracing for Violent Summer", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SummerOffensive.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-06-02T10:21:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-02T12:48:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, Novorossiya, Mariupol, Shyrokyne, Donetsk"}, "article_summary": "KYIV, Ukraine\u2014Despite Moscow\u2019s warming rhetoric in recent weeks, the Ukraine conflict is showing little evidence of cooling off this summer.\nThe presence of pro-Russian mercenaries and the Russian military there is a temporary phenomenon.\nIf successful, such a move would trap thousands of Ukrainian troops inside the city, setting up a potentially catastrophic showdown.\nUkrainian soldiers frequently and acerbically reply \u201cGrozny\u201d when asked to describe how such a battle would play out.\nAt night in Shyrokyne, separatists crawl up to within meters of the Ukrainian trenches and challenge the Ukrainian soldiers to hand to hand combat."}
