Put it all together, as the Minnesota commerce department did, and you get a 4.5 percent hike.\n\nBut a closer look at the numbers shows a much different picture. The one company to lower its rates, UCare, had just 549 exchange customers in 2014 \u2014 out of over 55,000. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, by comparison, has 23 percent of the exchange\u2019s customers and raised their rates. The commerce department\u2019s analysis weighs Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s over 12,000 customers\u2019 rate hikes the same as UCare\u2019s 549 enrollees.\n\nWhen the number of customers affected is taken into account, Minnesotans who bought plans on their Obamacare exchange can expect their plans to increase 11.8 percent on average. There\u2019s a lot of variation in there \u2014 smokers can expect the biggest increases, a small number of customers are up for a rate cut \u2014 but many people who bought plans will see their costs rise by double-digits.\n\nMinnesota commerce department commissioner Mike Rothman defended his office\u2019s calculations to Minnesota\u2019s Star Tribune.\n\n\u201cThe Commerce Department put out a calculated straight average for people to be able to compare the average that was per company,\u201d Rothman said, \u201cso that people understood that for those companies going back, that that\u2019s what the average was, just straight up.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not counting the options that aren\u2019t available anymore. PreferredOne, which attracted the most exchange customers and the lowest prices, pulled out for 2015, calling the cost of insuring exchange customers at the prices the state wanted \u201cunsustainable.\u201d (RELATED: Minnesota\u2019s Biggest (And Cheapest) Obamacare Insurer Drops Out Over Overwhelming Costs)\n\nPreferredOne\u2019s exit complicates things: their plans covered 60 percent of all Minnesota\u2019s exchange enrollees. And, a new insurer, Blue Plus, is beginning to offer plans on the exchange for the first time in 2015. That makes it difficult to compare prices by the number of customers attached to each plan.\n\nBut with the lowest-cost plan departing the exchange, at the very least, the 60 percent of Minnesota customers who purchased PreferredOne\u2019s plans are in for an even bigger rate hike than usual if they switch over to a more expensive competitor.\n\nAnd if customers decide to stay with PreferredOne and purchase their same plan off the exchange in 2015, they can expect an average rate hike of 63 percent, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nThe takeaway for Obamacare customers nationwide: if you want to keep your insurance plan from year to year, expect premium hikes.\n\nThe Star Tribune noted that although Democratic Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said that rate increases would not be released until mid-November \u2014 after midterm elections \u2014 the department caved to GOP criticism and released its questionable statistics in early October. Dayton is running for reelection against Republican challenger Jeff Johnson, who has criticized the Commerce Department\u2019s analysis.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Another state with double-digit hikes", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Minnesota state officials initially claimed that their Obamacare exchange's premiums were going up just 4.5 percent on average, but a more accurate estimate is an almost 12 percent rate hike.
