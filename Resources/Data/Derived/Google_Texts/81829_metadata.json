(Source: Maricopa Fire Department)\n\nSix people were stung, one of them nearly 300 times, in a massive bee attack in Maricopa Saturday afternoon.\n\nTwo firefighters were also stung but did not require treatment..\n\nVictims were screaming and running for help in the attack that extended for two blocks, Maricopa Fire Capt. Chip Wright said.\n\nThe bees began attacking at 5 p.m. in the 21000 block of N. Van Loo Drive in the Rancho El Dorado subdivision.\n\n[Tip sheet: Africanized honeybees safety information]\n\nParamedics took three adults and three children to the hospital.\n\n\u201cFirefighters were able to wear the bee veils for protection before stepping out of the engine as the extremely aggressive bees immediately attacked them as they rescued the residents,\u201d Wright said.\n\nFire hoses with foam were deployed while victims were quickly moved to a safer location for evaluation by paramedics.\n\nThe hive was located in an opened water valve box at the one of the homes in the neighborhood, Wright said.\n\nThe bees were sprayed with foam and the hive was contained and destroyed.\n\nThe whole operation lasted two hours.\n\nA parent of one of the children stung, Becky Check, posted the following message on the Maricopa Fire Department's Facebook page:\n\n\"Would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to the Maricopa Fire Dept and Paramedics responding to the bee swarm tonight. My son was one of the kids that was stung and due to their response and attention he was only in the ER a few hours and is now home resting. We hope the others recover quickly as well.\"\n\nWright advised if you are ever attacked, cover your face and get out of the immediate area.\n\nHe said bees may follow victims for up to a half mile in some cases. Be aware of your surroundings, as hives can be found in many different places, he added.\n\nAggressive Bee Attack Sends 6 To The Hospital https://t.co/yciMTOxFo3 \u2014 City of Maricopa FD (@MaricopaFirePIO) November 1, 2015\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
