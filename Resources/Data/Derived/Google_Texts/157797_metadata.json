Stuart Shea, the contractor\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nWhen the two companies split, \u201cthe promise was ... that Leidos would be in the fastest-growth areas,\u201d said William Loomis, an analyst with financial services firm Stifel Nicolaus.\n\nNeither company reported growth in its most recent quarter earlier this month \u2014 but it was Leidos that had a tougher start out of the gate, surprising some analysts.\n\nLeidos earlier this month said revenue for the three-month period ended Nov. 1 fell about 15 percent to hit $1.4 billion. The company reported a $3 million loss in income for the quarter, as compared to a $112 million profit in the same period last year.\n\nThe contractor opted to make a leadership change in its health and engineering segment, which saw operating income fall 165 percent. Joe Craver, the head of the group, has stepped down, and Jumper has become the unit\u2019s acting head as Leidos searches for a new executive.\n\nJumper said earnings were hurt by declining hospital IT budgets and \u201cgeneral turbulence\u201d associated with the Affordable Care Act registration process. Additionally, the company was weighed down by costs associated with two commercial health care acquisitions.\n\nIn an interview last week, Shea acknowledged that \u201cthere was an expectation that we would come out stronger,\u201d but said the contractor faced multiple one-time charges.\n\n\u201cShort-term performance is interesting, but it\u2019s really the long-term value proposition,\u201d he added. \u201cThe best interest of the shareholders, long-term, was to position both companies for success.\u201d\n\nSAIC, on the other hand, had a similar experience with its revenue for the three-month period ended Nov. 1. The company\u2019s sales fell about 18 percent to $974 million.\n\nBut profit dipped less dramatically, falling about 51 percent to hit $22 million. SAIC officials declined to comment for this story.\n\nMichael S. Lewis, managing director of the Silverline Group, a defense industry consulting firm, said SAIC\u2019s declining sales were expected; it was Leidos\u2019s results that were lower than some analysts anticipated.\n\n\u201cThere is a higher level of uncertainty with regard to what\u2019s the strategy of Leidos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe health care component of Leidos has been a big negative surprise to investors.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s early to draw conclusions about the two businesses, which both said they were hurt by separation costs as well as the government shutdown in the fall. And the two have only been separate companies since late September.\n\nLoren Thompson, a defense industry consultant, said it\u2019s too soon to judge which business will do better.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t judge these enterprises for the long-term based on how they fared in a single quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the long-term, Leidos is likely to do better, but its near-term problems may make SAIC look like the better investment.\u201d\n\nLewis too said any short-term declines will be forgotten if the companies regain their footing. Investors \u201chave a short memory,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "capbiztopnews, government contracting, SAIC, John Jumper, Stu Shea, Joe Craver, Loren Thompson, Michael Lewis, William Loomis, health care, profit, sales, revenue, investors", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "When McLean-based Science Applications International Corp. split into two companies \u2014 one that retained the SAIC name and the other called Leidos \u2014 some assumed Leidos would fare better.
