The officer who mounted and repeatedly punched a homeless grandmother in the face on the side of the I-10 Freeway in July could face “potentially serious charges” the California Highway Patrol announced on Wednesday. While an internal investigation is ongoing within the department, the CHP has turned its criminal investigation over to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office for further review.

The incident, captured by a passerby on video and uploaded to YouTube, shows officer Daniel Andrew tackling 51-year-old Marlene Pinnock, who had been walking on the side of the highway not far from the La Brea Avenue exit on July 1. A struggle ensued, culminating in Andrew straddling Pinnock and punching her repeatedly in the face and the head.

The video quickly went viral.

Andrew claimed in his police report that he was attempting to protect Pinnock. Upon arresting her, Andrew put Pinnock on a 72-hour mental health hold for posing a threat to herself and others.
