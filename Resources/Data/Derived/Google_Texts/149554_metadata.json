(AP) - Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs made quite a statement with his late-season surge last fall, but his offseason arguably was even more impressive.\n\nDobbs traveled to Florida in May for an internship helping test aircraft engines at Pratt & Whitney\u2019s West Palm Beach branch. Dobbs says the experience offered lessons he could carry over to football.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting to see the dynamics,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cI was working as part of a team working on an engine. They\u2019ve got the same daily obstacles and barriers that any football team has. It was interesting seeing the parallels between the workplace and the athletic field.\u201d\n\nNow the aerospace engineering major is eager to take Tennessee to heights it hasn\u2019t reached in several years. The 25th-ranked Volunteers open their season next Saturday against Bowling Green at Nashville\u2019s Nissan Stadium.\n\nThe Vols believe they can contend for their first Southeastern Conference East Division title since 2007. Their hopes depend on whether Dobbs stays healthy and builds on the momentum he established last season.\n\nThe junior savors that responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cWe talk about playing quarterback at the University of Tennessee with the \u2018Power T\u2019 on your chest. It\u2019s an honor and privilege every day. I never take it lightly. I know all eyes are on me everywhere I go.\u201d\n\nEven his mentor at Pratt & Whitney, Tennessee alum David Fisher, couldn\u2019t help but ask him questions about new offensive coordinator Mike DeBord, the state of the offensive line and the potential of the Vols\u2019 freshman class.\n\nAfter working with Dobbs for a month, Fisher didn\u2019t have any questions about the poise of the QB. Dobbs spent his internship assisting in accelerated mission tests for the F135 engine, which powers the F-35 fighter jet.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a first-class kid, very bright and polite and eager to learn,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI was very impressed. You could see he was brought up right.\u201d\n\nIn a year when so many of Tennessee\u2019s SEC rivals are breaking in new quarterbacks or still sorting out their quarterback situations, the Vols know what they have in Dobbs.\n\n\u201cThe way he\u2019s a leader is great,\u201d senior offensive tackle Kyler Kerbyson said. \u201cHe\u2019s always positive out there, but if he needs to get in somebody\u2019s face, he will. If the protection isn\u2019t good, he\u2019ll go up to the tackles and guards and be like, \u2018Hey what are you doing? You need to protect me,\u2019 which is great out of a leader and what you really want.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of Dobbs and what he\u2019s done and how he\u2019s taken over that role of starting quarterback.\u201d\n\nDobbs has come a long way in a short time.\n\nTennessee originally expected to redshirt Dobbs last season, but those plans changed after Justin Worley tore the labrum in his right shoulder. Tennessee went 4-1 in the five games he started to end a string of four straight losing seasons.\n\nIn an overtime victory at South Carolina, Dobbs became the first Tennessee player to throw for over 300 yards and rush for over 100 yards in the same game. Dobbs was named the most valuable player of Tennessee\u2019s TaxSlayer Bowl victory over Iowa.\n\nDobbs said the late-season emergence didn\u2019t necessarily boost his confidence because he\u2019s always had plenty of belief in his abilities. But teammates and coaches say they\u2019ve noticed a difference in him.\n\n\u201cI really think Josh has taken the next step in leadership,\u201d coach Butch Jones said. \u201cYou can see it. He\u2019s out there. He\u2019s in command. He has been a CEO of this camp, and I\u2019ve been very proud of him. He\u2019s been much more vocal than he\u2019s been in the past. He\u2019s holding individuals accountable. It starts with himself.\u201d\n\nDobbs\u2019 emergence has Tennessee feeling optimistic that the program\u2019s headed back in the right direction. The future may be even brighter for Dobbs himself.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great representative for the university,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI have no worries at all about his character as well as his intelligence. I think he\u2019s going to do great, whether he makes it to the NFL or not.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be a success at whatever he does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs made quite a statement with his late-season surge last fall, but his offseason arguably was even more impressive.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs made quite a statement with his late-season surge last fall, but his offseason arguably was even more impressive.", "title": "QB Joshua Dobbs has No. 25 Tennessee\u2019s hopes soaring", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/qb-joshua-dobbs-has-no-25-tennessees-hopes-soaring/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/9126413eccb08126800f6a7067004f55.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/9126413eccb08126800f6a7067004f55.jpg", "description": "Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs made quite a statement with his late-season surge last fall, but his offseason arguably was even more impressive.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "QB Joshua Dobbs has No. 25 Tennessee\u2019s hopes soaring"}, "Author": "STEVE MEGARGEE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1b0\"", "article_summary": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn.
