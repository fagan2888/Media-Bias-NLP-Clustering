Some businesses and tourism have rebounded but nature hasn\u2019t, with oil-poisoned fish and waterfowl washing ashore. Yet while the oil industry has developed technologies to tap once-unreachable reserves far deeper than BP\u2019s two-mile floor, safety has stayed right where it was in 2010 \u2013 meaning no new ways to prevent a blowout or contain a spill up to five miles down. Here is your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in less time than it takes to order shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e at a New Orleans bistro:\n\nParty of One Percent: Hillary Clinton, the Democrats\u2019 most powerful \u2013 and only \u2013 contender for the 2016 presidential nomination, makes her way to New Hampshire this week, selling her fresh, newly-launched 2016 presidential persona as The People\u2019s Champion. Just in time, a Republican-affiliated super PAC pushed the start button on a Granite State ad campaign painting her as a Wall Street wolf in blue-collar clothing. Also, Benghazi and private email server.\n\n[READ: Why Hillary Clinton's Campaign Rollout Worked]\n\nReagan Told Us To: Last week, several Republican 2016 contenders went to New Hampshire themselves to drum up support ahead of the nation\u2019s first primary. Strictly observing the letter, if not the spirit, of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s unofficial (and errantly attributed) Eleventh Commandment \u2013 criticize no other Republican \u2013 they instead conducted a Hillary bash-fest. Because the only way to look like the front-runner is to attack the GOP\u2019s favorite target?\n\nTake That: Yet for all the hatin\u2019 on Hillary by the boys on the right, a new CNN/ORC poll shows Madame Secretary still puts the hurt to all her potential Republican challengers. She leads each one by double digits, ranging from 14 points (Marco Rubio, the GOP\u2019s current It Boy) to 17 points (Jeb Bush, the narrow Republican front-runner) to more than 20 points (Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson, among several).\n\nYour Morning Video(s):\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has posted a cool video documenting her post-announcement Iowa road trip in 100 seconds:\n\nHey, Big Spenders: Having seized power in the 2014 midterms, Capitol Hill Republicans declared a new era of fiscal responsibility and congressional productivity. Last week, the GOP passed two items of legislation \u2013 the Medicare doc fix and a rollback of the estate tax \u2013 that will staple a half-trillion dollars to the federal budget, as well as ending budget sequestration that\u2019s still in effect. Seems to be a tacit admission that \u201creining in spending\u201d and \u201cgetting things done\u201d go together like ice cream and horseradish, and hypocrisy is just a state of mind.\n\nGifted Hands, Running Feet?: Retired neurosurgeon and rising GOP presidential star Dr. Ben Carson is going to Iowa after what\u2019s being billed as a major speech May 4. Wonder what he\u2019s got on his mind? Probably nothing all that significant, if the polls are to be believed (see above).\n\nLynch-Mentum?: Perhaps responding to President Barack Obama\u2019s remarks that Republicans\u2019 shelving of attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch is \u201cembarrassing,\u201d the GOP reportedly is going to schedule a confirmation vote for her this week. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says he\u2019s confident his party can cut a deal with Democrats over anti-abortion language inserted in an anti-human trafficking bill \u2013 the latest of many reasons Lynch\u2019s confirmation has been side-tracked \u2013 and get her a confirmation vote within two to three days.\n\n[ALSO: Harry Reid Could Force a Vote on Loretta Lynch Confirmation]\n\nToday in the Second Amendment: It\u2019s the 16th anniversary of the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, a horrific event that arguably ushered in the era of American spree shootings. Although the killings reached a crescendo with the slaughter of 6- and 7-year-old children at a Connecticut elementary school three years ago, the gun control debate has moved towards even crazier laws. Exhibit A: Cruz, the GOP presidential candidate, wants to allow U.S. service members to carry concealed weapons on highly-secure military bases.\n\nStat of the Day: Number of the 23 health insurance co-ops created under the Affordable Care Act that reported losses last year: 22 (courtesy of Harper\u2019s Index)\n\nDuly Noted: On this date in 1861, Col. Robert E. Lee resigned his commission in the United States Army. Lee went on to command the Army of Northern Virginia, and eventually became general-in-chief of the Confederate forces. Boston's Fenway Park hosted its first professional baseball game in 1912, while Tiger Stadium (nee Navin Field) opened in Detroit. The Ludlow Massacre took place in 1914 when the Colorado National Guard opened fire on a tent colony of striking miners; about 20 (accounts vary) strikers, women and children died. In 1945, during World War II, allied forces took control of the German cities of Nuremberg and Stuttgart. In 1972, Apollo 16's lunar module, carrying astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke Jr., landed on the moon. Ten years ago: President George W.
