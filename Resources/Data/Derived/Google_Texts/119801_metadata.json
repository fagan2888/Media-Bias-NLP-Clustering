Oft-times, you don\u2019t know they\u2019re there until you hear their guttural snarl. They love to gorge on your innards and transform their victim into one of them. The latest iteration of a mindless Walking Dead legislator just happened right in my backyard.\n\nState Senator Thomas D. \u201cTom\u201d Corbin is one of South Carolina\u2019s political \u201cWalking Dead.\u201d He just \u2018gorged on the innards\u2019 of every woman in America. While dining with colleague Lexington Senator Katrina Shealy, he referred to women as \u201cA lesser cut of meat than men.\u201d Some sites are throwing in \u201cbarefoot and pregnant\u201d references in the same sit-down. I guess that qualifies as social gorging. Shealy was not amused. She has sat beside Corbin for the last two years in the Senate Chamber and said that this was not the first such comment. He considers his virtual hate speech to be an \u201congoing joke\u201d between them. She had previously requested that he stop.\n\nNow, she\u2019s gone public. While a staunch Republican herself, Senator Shealy seems to \u201cget it\u201d in her public support of women. Her activist CV includes board membership of a Girl Scout Council, the Presidency of West Metro Republican Women, membership of the Advisory Board of the Women of Hope of the Lexington County Medical Foundation, The South Carolina Federation of Republican Women\u2019s 2013 Women of the Year, The Lexington County Republican\u2019s Outstanding Female Statesman of the same year, the South Carolina State Directorship of Women in Government and last, but far from least, the South Carolina State Director for the National Foundation for Women Legislators. Could Corbin have picked a worse foil for his baboonish comments? No offense to baboons.\n\nCorbin is not to be confused with recently retired U.S. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who has battled three different cancers in recent years. No, Tom Corbin is battling a different kind of cancer; the Republican sexist cancer of being an enemy of women. A cancer that has been allowed to metastasize to an unfathomable degree.\n\nThe state senator represents District 5, covering Greenville County and part of Spartanburg County. He\u2019s a 50-year-old social conservative and remarkably (or maybe not) a Deacon and Sunday school teacher at Clearview Baptist Church in his hometown of Travelers Rest. There are three women on the staff of the church. I wonder if Corbin shares his \u201cjokes\u201d with them?\n\nOn the Clearview site, under the heading of Core Beliefs, we can perhaps find the genesis of Corbin\u2019s cluelessness about women. Here\u2019s a partial quote expounding on the man and women\u2019s biblical role in marriage (quotation marks mine): \u201cHe has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to \u201clead\u201d his family. A wife is to \u201csubmit herself graciously\u201d to the \u201cservant leadership\u201d of her husband. Wow! So maybe teaching Sunday school is where a guy like Corbin belongs after all.\n\nAs proof that repression of women is not the only indication that Corbin is as right-wing as they come, consider two pieces of legislation that he primarily sponsored.\n\nIn a blatant and potentially dangerous attempt to skirt federal law, Corbin is one of four senators to push S. 247. It\u2019s a nullification law that forbids the federal government from interfering in something called the \u201cUnorganized Militia.\u201d The whole issue is best explained on the John Birch Society\u2019s online daily website, The New American.\n\nThen there was his anti-immigration Senate Resolution that made claims like this one: \u201cOver fifty percent of illegal aliens currently in the United States arrived here with visas and overstayed them upon expiration. These include radical Islamic Jihad students who come here under the pretext of study only to instigate acts of terror.\u201d So, in his mind, Corbin apparently believes most Muslim students in the U.S. are terrorists. Here\u2019s another revealing \u2018whereas\u2019: \u201cWhereas, the burden placed upon our nation\u2019s governmental services, taxpayers, environment, and infrastructure is on a disastrously unsustainable path due to massive population growth directly attributable to immigration\u2026\u201d\n\nCorbin is a paranoid hater of the first order. Women appear to lead the pack, while Muslims and immigrants are not far behind. And he wants to make sure that every able-bodied South Carolinian is armed to the teeth when his imagined New Testament showdown with the feds rises up in the final political Armageddon.\n\nThe senator is the archetypal extremist right-winger. Everything is black and white with him. There is no nuance in his thought processes. He\u2019s tiresomely predictable; Project Vote Smart shows a 100% position rating from the Greenville Tea Party. The Spartanburg Tea Party hosted a \u2018meet and greet\u2019 for Corbin. He scores a meager 25% rating from Conservation Voters of South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly off-putting given his membership of the Senate Fish, Game and Forestry Committee. As a South Carolina House member, he voted to prevent implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHere\u2019s a message to those cave dwellers who didn\u2019t get the \u201cwomen are equal to men\u201d memo. It\u2019s time to be a real man. Because the position of superiority adopted by an unacceptable percentage of right-wing males, many citing the bible as their unalterable source, is simply wrong, selfish, unfair and enormously counter-productive. There is nothing remotely masculine about adopting the role of servant leadership. Right-wing preachers and theologians fall all over themselves trying to twist the passages into acceptance. \u201cWhy that simply means man is a leader in general, not a leader of his wife,\u201d is a popular response. The husband is still told to \u201clove his wife and not be a dictator\u201d is another pretzeling.\n\nHere\u2019s what a husband, or any man should be in relation to women. He should shout from the highest rooftops for equality in the workplace and equal pay. He should concede that reproductive decisions are hers to make. He should start by voting for women in Representative legislatures, state offices and local councils. He should see that the glass corporate ceiling is shattered once and for all. He should never lay a violent hand on a woman. Men who do are the biggest cowards and sissies among us.\n\nBe a man! If you\u2019re a Christian man, recognize interpretations of scripture are exactly that \u2013 fluid interpretations that change with the times and circumstances, not to mention the interpreter. As for women; vote your own mind; not how you think your man wants you to vote. Republican women, in particular, have cast votes that make no sense for the betterment of their sisters. Professional women, especially teachers; vote!!!\n\nGive Corbin credit. There exists no better proof that the male-dominated right-wing legislatures are paving the way to destruction of women\u2019s rights.\n\nFor those cave dwellers who didn\u2019t get the memo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Senator Thomas D. \"Tom\" Corbin is one of South Carolina's political \"Walking Dead.\" While dining with colleague Lexington Senator Katrina Shealy, he referred to women as \"A lesser cut of meat than men.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Dennis S", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "State Senator Thomas D. \"Tom\" Corbin is one of South Carolina's political \"Walking Dead.\" While dining with colleague Lexington Senator Katrina Shealy, he referred to women as \"A lesser cut of meat than men.\"", "title": "Yet Another Mindless Walking Dead Republican Demeans Women", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/14/mindless-walking-dead-republican-demeans-women.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tom-corbin.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-14T17:45:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Advisory Board of the Women,Greenville Tea Party,National Foundation for Women Legislators,South Carolina Federation of Republican Women,South Carolina House,Spartanburg Tea Party,State Director,Thomas D.,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-02-14T17:45:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-14T17:45:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Advisory Board of the Women, Greenville Tea Party, National Foundation for Women Legislators, South Carolina Federation of Republican Women, South Carolina House, Spartanburg Tea Party, State Director, Thomas D."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd395f\"", "article_summary": "Republican women, in particular, have cast votes that make no sense for the betterment of their sisters.\nState Senator Thomas D. \u201cTom\u201d Corbin is one of South Carolina\u2019s political \u201cWalking Dead.\u201d He just \u2018gorged on the innards\u2019 of every woman in America.\nWhile a staunch Republican herself, Senator Shealy seems to \u201cget it\u201d in her public support of women.\nAs a South Carolina House member, he voted to prevent implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nNo, Tom Corbin is battling a different kind of cancer; the Republican sexist cancer of being an enemy of women."}
