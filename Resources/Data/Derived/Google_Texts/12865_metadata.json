State regulators who signed off on the regional replacement hospital refused to approve the larger number.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re still going to have some challenges with the size of the hospital,\u201d Hays said, \u201cbut it won\u2019t be as bad.\u201d Complaints about capacity rose early when patients had to wait in the emergency room for a bed to become available, and some were given the option to go to other area hospitals.\n\nHe said he expects that challenge to increase, in the short term, particularly through the flu season.\n\nThe hospital had seen some good results after consolidating inpatient beds from the Thayer campus in Waterville and the former Augusta hospital on East Chestnut Street in the new 640,000-square-foot hospital at the north end of Augusta. The Thayer Center for Health underwent a $16 million renovation, but now it provides only outpatient treatment.\n\nHays said data collected from surveys showed higher levels of patient satisfaction, much lower instances of falls and a 20 percent lower incidence of hospital-acquired infection.\n\nThe hospital was designed to address some of those issues. All the 192 beds are in private rooms, handrails help steady a patient moving from the bed to the bathroom, and the average number of times a patient is relocated within the hospital generally is limited to moving from one level of care to another.\n\n\u201cAll the indicators we\u2019ve measured have improved,\u201d Hays said, adding that it will take a year and a half for those to show up on some national databases. \u201cOne year later, we\u2019ve gotten much more efficient.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most outside agencies measuring hospital metrics have data relating to MaineGeneral\u2019s performance in its previous hospital facilities. The most recent records end in June 2013, five months prior to the opening of the consolidated facility. Patients offered mixed reviews of the new hospital, with some offering praise peppered with a little criticism.\n\nA LONG TIME COMING\n\nRay Veilleux, of Smithfield, said he encountered \u201cwonderful doctors and wonderful treatment\u201d for himself and for his 101-year-old father, who was admitted there after breaking his hip.\n\n\u201cThe service and the people were unreal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem I had was getting them to answer the darn telephone when it rings,\u201d he said, specifically citing the emergency room and the cardiac care unit. \u201cIt\u2019s the only complaint I have.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, he said, he and his late father received polite and professional treatment.\n\n\u201cI told my wife, \u2018Bring me there; that\u2019s where I want to go,'\u201d Veilleux said.\n\nThe new hospital had been a long time coming and actually had been envisioned in at least one other location. MaineGeneral Health had operated two full-service hospitals within 21 miles of each other since the 1997 merger of Kennebec Valley Medical Center in Augusta and MidMaine Medical Center in Waterville. Portions of the former hospital campus on East Chestnut Street date to back to at least 1900.\n\nIn August 2005, the hospital bought more than 100 acres just off Old Belgrade Road as a place to build its $25.6 million Alfond Center for Cancer Care, an outpatient-only facility that opened in July 2007. With some adjacent land added, it became the natural location for the new regional hospital, and construction on that started in the summer of 2011.\n\nThe new hospital brought ancillary projects, including a $13 million road improvement project that connected the hospital to exit 113 of Interstate 95.\n\nAs soon as the new hospital opened, work began on Thayer, and that $16 million project was showcased for the public on Oct. 25.\n\nThe former hospital in Augusta and the former Seton campus in Waterville were bought by companies led by developer Kevin Mattson.\n\nJack and Anita Smart, formerly of Readfield and now at Granite Hill Estates in Hallowell, visited the hospital in late October with a $10,000 donation in gratitude for care Anita Smart received after suffering a stroke.\n\n\u201cWe were happy to do it; it\u2019s money well spent,\u201d Jack Smart said. \u201cAnita, my wife, was in the hospital for a week and then a week in therapy. All the nurses, doctors, all the rest of the staff, they all had smiles on their faces. It was very nice. They took care of her.\u201d\n\nOn their way out, the couple hugged Vinnie Lord, a physical therapist who worked with Anita Smart.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very positive guy and likable fellow,\u201d Jack Smart said.\n\nER LAGS REPORTED\n\nWhen the new hospital opened, the emergency room generated the most complaints, and some of those continue.\n\nMary Sprague, of South Gardiner, said her husband, Timothy L. Sprague, had a bad experience in the emergency room in May when he sought treatment for his sore foot.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do nothing,\u201d she said, adding that his problem was both diagnosed and treated at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.\n\nDennis Horton, 69, of Gardiner, said he experienced both the good and the bad at the hospital. He had cancer surgery in September, which was delayed for hours, but the nurse kept him abreast of events and offered apologies for the unforeseen delay.\n\n\u201cA month prior to that, I had a chance to use the emergency room,\u201d Horton said. \u201cIt was probably one of the worst experience I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d\n\nHorton said he went there seeking treatment for something that had gotten into his eye. He was triaged about 9 p.m. when he described the pain level as a 9 out of 10, and was told he was up next for care. Horton was particularly worried because a similar eye problem previously turned into an ulcer and effectively blinded him for three months.\n\nAfter midnight, he asked how much longer it would take, and was told that cases were prioritized. He said he cut his wrist band off, saying he was going elsewhere for service, and received a laugh in response.\n\n\u201cI found out later everything that was done was not done right,\u201d he said. \u201cI ended up coming home and we treated it with some more medicine,\u201d he said. In the future, he will head to Lewiston for emergencies unless he hears something has changed.\n\nThe hospital is responding to the concerns, and it has a patient advocate department to help patients with complaints.\n\n\u201cWe are making ongoing improvements to our Emergency Department to reduce waiting times, including a (streamlining) project focus in the Emergency Department and will initiate a similar effort for inpatient flow,\u201d hospital spokeswoman Joy Leach said via email on Friday.\n\nNot all people reported problems in the emergency room.\n\nCandace Sloma, of Augusta, was treated in the emergency room two days after the Nov. 9 opening.\n\n\u201cI was in and out of there in a matter of six hours,\u201d she said. \u201cI was amazed at the speed. They seemed to know what to do and where to go to get it. They were very efficient.\u201d\n\nBritt Holstrom-Salisbury, of Benton, and her family found great care for her daughter, Emma, then 11, a week after the hospital opened. Taken initially to the Emergency Department at the Thayer Center for Health, Emma was diagnosed with a kidney infection and sent by Delta Ambulance to the new hospital.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a child with autism doing something different and out of routine \u2014 such as being an inpatient at a hospital \u2014 it can be very anxiety-provoking for both the child and the caregivers. The doctors and nurses at both MGMC sites were open to hearing my suggestions on how to approach things with my daughter, and this made me feel as though she was in great hands,\u201d Holmstrom-Salisbury said.\n\nIMPROVED CARE FOR BABIES\n\nNikkia Veilleux, 30, of Waterville, and her husband, Timothy, had the first babies born at the hospital just after it opened.\n\n\u201cMy experience was amazing from the very first time we walked through the doors,\u201d Nikkia Veilleux said. \u201cWe were coming in as the patients were.\u201d In fact, she had to wait a little for some hot water.\n\nThe twins, Hannah and Samuel, were delivered about six weeks before their due date.\n\nA few hours earlier, and the babies would have been born in Portland; but the new hospital has a Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, allowing it to handle such births and babies.\n\nVeilleux said they were glad to be only 20 minutes from their home and son Isaiah Vear, now 8.\n\nOver the past year, Veilleux and the twins visited the maternity ward so the staff could see how the twins were doing, and the hospital recently hosted an early birthday party for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re part of the MaineGeneral family,\u201d Veilleux said.\n\nAnother new mother, Brittany Adams, also enjoyed her experience there.\n\n\u201cMy third son Gannon Noah was born at the new hospital,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cFirst of all it was great to have my (obstetrician) in the hospital. It made it easier to just go to labor and delivery when need be.\u201d\n\nThrough Oct. 21, the hospital has delivered 1,036 babies.\n\nBUDGET LOSS EXPECTED\n\nAlong with a number of physicians\u2019 practices, housed in the Scott Bullock Medical Office Center, Hays said the new hospital also allows most administrators to be in the same building and much more readily available to meet, which is more efficient.\n\n\u201cWe used to be in 10 different buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nDollar figures, too, are on par with what the hospital anticipated.\n\nHays said the expectation was an initial two-year loss and a return to being 1 percent to 2 percent in the black by next year. The operating budget for the medical center itself is about $414 million for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, and includes the adjacent Alfond Center for Cancer Care, the Thayer Center for Health and the hospital\u2019s physician practices. Hays also said the hospital anticipates a $5 million loss this year. Hays said a $16.4 million loss was anticipated last year, which ended up being $14.3 million.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30. The hospital owned the former Seton campus of MaineGeneral Medical Center in Waterville until handing it over to the new owner, developer Kevin Mattson.\n\nThe hospital is a nonprofit organization and under the parent corporation MaineGeneral Health, which includes long-term care facilities and other health care operations.\n\nIt put out bonds to cover the vast majority of the $312 million in construction costs plus an additional $10 million to renovate Thayer and convert it to an outpatient facility with a 24-hour emergency department.\n\nAnnual repayment over as many as 30 years will average some $25.4 million, Hays said.\n\nThe hospital announced in June that it was cutting some 128 full-time positions, 16 of which were filled, as it prepared to enter a new budget year. It also trimmed discretionary accounts, such as travel. Those moves were necessary, Hays said at the time, because of lower Medicare reimbursement rates and anticipated decreases in patient volume as well as overstaffing that occurred when the hospitals were consolidated.\n\nMore recently, the hospital notified its 600 or so per diem staff members \u2013 nurses, maintenance, laboratory technician, house-keeping personnel, and others who are on call and who work less than full-time \u2013 that they would no longer receive a 10 percent differential beginning in January 2015.\n\n\u201cThe majority of hospitals don\u2019t pay a differential per diem,\u201d Hays said. He said those workers have the ability to pick when and if they want to work.\n\nInstead, Hays said, it will be adjusting its benefits plan to meet requirements of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nMaineGeneral Medical Center employs about 2,400 people, of which about 1,700 full-time employees work at the hospital itself.\n\nThe hospital has had to make some adjustments for those workers as well, such as expanding the employee parking lot by 50 spaces in order to accommodate all the vehicles.\n\nFEAR EASED BY CARE\n\nThe Rev. Lawrence \u201cBud\u201d Merckens, 79, of Manchester, pastor of Riverside Congregational Church in Vassalboro, spent a week in the hospital with pneumonia last March.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have gotten better services,\u201d he said. \u201cI was kind of worried about the hospital. I\u2019m very suspicious of big things. I was completely wrong. It was very pleasant. Everyone went out of their way. I really felt quite relieved to be there.\u201d\n\nHe said he enjoyed the meals; the fact that his wife, Hilda, could stay in the room with him; and even returning daily for two weeks for intravenous therapy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to have it in the community,\u201d Merckens said.\n\nShelly Simpson, of Oakland, talked about care the hospital provided to her mother, Dolores Champine, 90, who had been living in Lakewood Longterm Care in Waterville for six months until she was hospitalized Oct. 7-24 in Augusta.\n\nSimpson said she and Champine saw every aspect of the hospital from the emergency room, surgery, recovery, medical/surgical units and food service.\n\n\u201cI have nothing but wonderful things to say about the care she received in her final days,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cI was there every day, all day, and some nights as well.\u201d\n\nSimpson described her mother, a former director of nurses at Waterville Osteopathic Hospital (now Inland Hospital) as a \u201cspitfire just till the very end.\u201d\n\nWhen three nurses took care of her at MaineGeneral, she told her daughter, \u201cThis is like private-duty care when I was a nurse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that comment didn\u2019t speak volumes, I don\u2019t know what does,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cBeing there and being an advocate for my mom, the compassion was amazing. You felt you were the only person in that hospital.\u201d\n\nBetty Adams \u2014 621-5631\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @betadams", "article_metadata": {"description": "A year after the new hospital opened in north Augusta, patients report some problems in the emergency room, but hospital officials say statistics show improved care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "A year after the new hospital opened in north Augusta, patients report some problems in the emergency room, but hospital officials say statistics show improved care.", "title": "MaineGeneral a year later still lacks beds, but reviews positive - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/341947_285125-20141106-hospitalbda.jpg", "height": 562}, "updated_time": "2014-11-08T18:36:31-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/11/08/mainegeneral-a-year-later-still-lacks-beds-but-reviews-positive/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/341947_285125-20141106-hospitalbda.jpg", "description": "A year after the new hospital opened in north Augusta, patients report some problems in the emergency room, but hospital officials say statistics show improved care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MaineGeneral a year later still lacks beds, but reviews positive - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-11-08T17:27:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-08T18:36:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Staff photo by Andy Molloy Physical therapist Vinny Lord hugs Anita Smart recently while shaking hands with her husband, Jack, in the rehabilitation facility at MaineGeneral Medical Center.\nMaineGeneral Health had operated two full-service hospitals within 21 miles of each other since the 1997 merger of Kennebec Valley Medical Center in Augusta and MidMaine Medical Center in Waterville.\nMaineGeneral Medical Center employs about 2,400 people, of which about 1,700 full-time employees work at the hospital itself.\n\u201cThe good news is at least there\u2019s nobody waiting in the emergency department for a bed,\u201d said Chuck Hays, CEO of MaineGeneral Medical Center.\nThe hospital owned the former Seton campus of MaineGeneral Medical Center in Waterville until handing it over to the new owner, developer Kevin Mattson."}
