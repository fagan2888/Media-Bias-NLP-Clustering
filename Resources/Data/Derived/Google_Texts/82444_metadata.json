We want that for our own enjoyment and to attract our precious visitors and friends. There is an eyesore, blight and a hideous trashy item that makes our community look terrible and second rate.\n\nWhat am I talking about? The illegal junk signs that litter our roadways and intersections.\n\nThe other day I counted 9 such signs on the corners of Colonial and Metro, Plantation. They\u2019re everywhere.\n\nI have called the County and the City about this and I know that they are busy helping solve this problem. The County pulled over 5,000 last year and over 1,600 this year alone.\n\nThis practice is against the law, it is litter and a safety hazard. I would hate to have to mow with these out there with the wires that they use. These are mostly put up by repeat offenders. I personally take down 20-30 of these signs per week just to see them reappear.\n\nCan I get help with this? I am on a mission to rid the county of this blight. Let us all get behind this and take them down!\n\n- Robert Fowler, Fort Myers\n\nRepublicans for Social Security\n\nAge 50-plus voters lean Republican, to save Social Security?\n\nSo I was reading in the AARP news of May 2016 that \u201c50+ Voters Lean Republican, Demand Social Security Plan\u201d.\n\nDoes that mean I\u2019ll vote Republican and that\u2019ll mean Social Security will be saved?\n\nThis, the same Republican Party that hates Social Security, and by the way Medicare, that they have been trying their best for decades to defund both programs.\n\nDo you not remember George W. Bush\u2019s push to marginalize Social Security, by the privatization of Social Security?\n\nThey, your Republicans, are continuously introducing bills in Congress to undermine both. Pushed by the likes of The Heritage Foundation.\n\nYou know, they pay no taxes, but are paid by the \u201c1 percent\u201d to influence and write legislation. So you are going to vote for them to save your Social Security? Interesting!\n\nIf you are part of the \u201c1 percent\u201d I can understand that you already have the wherewithal, but I would venture a guess that 100 percent of AARP members lack membership in that group.\n\nSocial Security is nowhere near collapsing, except in the rants by the conservatives. With a modest increase in revenue, any future shortfalls could easily be covered.\n\nSo vote your conscience \u2026 or their pocket book. \u201cYou decide.\u201d\n\n- Jim Hebert, south Fort Myers\n\nTax returns vs. transcripts\n\nHillary Clinton raves on how Donald Trump will not release his tax returns yet refuses to release any of the transcripts of the speeches she makes to the big banks of Wall Street.\n\nThe tax returns do not affect me in the least and I do not care if Mr. Trump ever releases them. As far as I am concerned, some things are personal and can remain that way.\n\nHowever, the promises made to Wall Street do affect me and I would like to know what is in them. In my opinion, Hillary is not trustworthy, lies, and speaks out of both sides of her mouth.\n\nWhile I am not a big Trump fan, I will probably write-in Bernie Sanders in November.\n\n- Elliott S Nathanson, Fort Myers\n\nTrivial bathroom law\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s insistence on transgender people using the bathroom for the gender they were born with is ridiculous. Many transgenders have had physical work which makes them look like the gender they identify with. Can you imagine how confusing and possibly scary it would be for children (or adults) to see someone who looks like a man enter the ladies room, or for someone who looks like a woman try to use the mens restroom?\n\nJust how would this law be enforced anyway? Perhaps transgenders or almost anyone would have to carry their birth certificate with them and show it to a \u201cbathroom inspector\u201d to indicate what their birth sex is. If they don\u2019t have proof, would the \u201cinspector\u201d have to check their private area? How degrading and what an invasion of privacy that would be!\n\nWith all the other important issues going on in this world, this particular one is plain silly.\n\n- Marilyne Roth, Cape Coral\n\nRecurring scenario\n\nBen Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, in an interview with David Samuels of The New York Times expressed the assessment that the foreign bureaus of newspapers were inexperienced and, thus, open to being misled on policy and international affairs by government briefings. He is quoted as saying \u201cThey literally know nothing.\u201d This weakness was exploited to sell the Iran nuclear deal as (paraphrasing) the narrative was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. (The aspiring novelist who became Obama\u2019s foreign-policy guru, The New York Times)\n\nDoesn\u2019t this scenario sound familiar?\n\nConsider that Jonathan Gruber, professor at MIT and highly paid consultant and architect of Obamacare, stated in forums between 2010 and 2013 the \u201clack of transparency is a huge political advantage.\u201d So it was used to take advantage of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d in selling Obamacare to the American public.\n\nThe major policy achievements of the Obama administration are Obamacare in his first term and the Iran nuclear agreement in his second term. Both share the common approach of misleading the American people because we are treated as \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cknow-nothings.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama can claim achievements, or history can prove harm has been imposed on our country through deception. A great legacy!\n\n- Frank Ryan, south Fort Myers\n\nRead or Share this story: http://newspr.es/1Vh6DvD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "With all the other important issues going on in this world, this particular one is plain silly.", "og": {"site_name": "The News-Press", "description": "With all the other important issues going on in this world, this particular one is plain silly.", "title": "Mailbag May 25: Trivial bathroom law", "url": "http://www.news-press.com/story/opinion/readers/local/2016/05/24/wednesdays-letters-editor-nc-bathroom-law-social-security-tax-returns/84865088/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-press.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With all the other important issues going on in this world, this particular one is plain silly.", "creator": "@thenewspress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/161030113fb1b2a6f9d6cee2d542d9175efa1799/c=304-0-2097-1793&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/24/FortMyers/B9322296419Z.1_20160524154110_000_GHIEFPP6P.1-0.jpg", "title": "Mailbag May 25: Trivial bathroom law", "site": "@thenewspress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600073397", "fb": {"app_id": 149631068421067}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "North Carolina, bathroom law, transgender, Social Security, Donald Trump, Tax Returns"}, "article_summary": "Do you not remember George W.
