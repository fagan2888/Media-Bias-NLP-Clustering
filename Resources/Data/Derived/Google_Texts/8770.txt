A teenager with severe stomach pain prompted search-and-rescue teams from two counties to deploy Monday.

The 14-year-old was backpacking with his grandfather near Kings Lake off of Rollins Pass Road in Boulder County when he fell ill. His grandfather left him to hike out of the backcountry, about six miles, to Nederland to get help, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Department said.

Members from Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, based in Boulder, and Grand County Search and Rescue coordinated efforts to reach him, because of the terrain and access to the area, the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.

After receiving medical help at the site, the teen was able to walk out on his own, but was then was transported by ambulance for additional care.

The nature of his illness and his name were not released.
