Under this new ordinance, private sector unionized employees working in Lincolnshire will now have the choice of whether or not to pay union dues, and a union worker cannot be fired for not paying dues.\n\nEarlier this year, Lincolnshire became one of a group of suburbs to formally endorse a plan, in line with Rauner\u2019s turnaround agenda, to make payment of private sector union dues voluntary (\u201cempowerment zones\u201d). According to the Illinois Policy Institute, under RTW laws unions, workers and their employers can still collectively bargain over wages, hours, benefits and all other working conditions. RTW also does not affect the ability to organize.\n\nIn a packed meeting room filled with more non-residents than residents, attendees were given two minutes each to comment for or against the proposed ordinance. One attendee accused trustees of supporting RTW simply to \u201ccurry favor with the Governor,\u201d while another union member stated he \u201calready was free, never forced to join a union.\u201d A Local 50 equipment operator praised union health benefits, stated \u201cif I wasn\u2019t in a union, I\u2019d have to rely on Obamacare.\u201d\n\nUnion employees described how joining a union had improved their standard of living: Chicago\u2019s Schwinn\u2019s bicycle plant was lauded for improving the lives of union employees, while a supporter of the RTW ordinance pointed out the Schwinn factory was eventually shut down due to high costs, moved out of state and then overseas. Another union member stated \u201cwe didn\u2019t pick this fight,\u201d and predicted if Lincolnshire pursues RTW its detractors would stop shopping in the town or dining in its restaurants.\n\nEarlier this year, Illinois AG Lisa Madigan issued a legal opinion stating Rauner\u2019s ideas for local RTW zones would violate federal labor laws, and that RTW laws could only be adopted statewide. However, Jacob Huebert, senior attorney at the Liberty Justice Center, argued at the meeting that \u201cnothing prevents local governments from passing this type of ordinance under the \u2018home rule\u2019 provision,\u201d and local governments can \u201cenact any law they see fit.\u201d\n\nLawsuits against Lincolnshire\u2019s RTW ordinance are expected by both supporters and non-supporters. At the close of the RTW vote, it was announced the Liberty Justice Center would be representing the Village of Lincolnshire in any future lawsuits on a pro bono basis.\n\n[RECOMMENDED]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lincolnshire on Dec. 14 became the first municipality in Illinois to make itself a right-to-work zone.
