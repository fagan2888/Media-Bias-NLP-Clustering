According to a report published Friday in the The Wall Street Journal, health insurers are requesting the right in many states to increase premiums by upwards of 50%. Health Care Service Corp.\u2013the leading health insurer in New Mexico, has asked state regulators to allow it to increase its premiums on average by 51.6%, for instance. Customers of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield in Maryland may face an average premium increase of 30.4%.\n\nInsurers will have to submit their premium-hike proposals to their state regulators, and potentially the federal government. Regulators will review the requests, and may deny the insurers requests if rising costs don\u2019t justify premium increases. But big rate hikes could be necessary to prevent insurers from taking a loss. According to the report:\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee . . . said it lost $141 million from exchange-sold plans, stemming largely from a small number of sick enrollees. \u201cOur filing is planned to allow us to operate on at least a break-even basis for these plans, meaning that the rate would cover only medical services and expenses\u2014with no profit margin for 2016,\u201d said spokeswoman Mary Danielson.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, however. Obamacare insurers in some states\u2013like Indiana, Connecticut and Maine\u2013are asking for minimal or no increases to their premiums.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare premiums are going up.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Health insurers on many state exchanges are requesting the right to increase premiums by upwards of 50%.", "title": "Got Obamacare?
