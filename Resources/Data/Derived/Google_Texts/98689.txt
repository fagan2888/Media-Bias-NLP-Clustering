The only thing coach Patrick Roy said was a negative in Friday’s 3-1 win over Nashville was his team’s power play. Roy said the players did not “battle” hard enough for the puck, that Nashville won too many physical battles for it and that it must improve, “no doubt about it.”

Roy also had some criticism for the play of young Avs D-man Tyson Barrie:

“Tonight, I was not 100 percent happy with Barrie. That’s why I put Parenteau (at the point) sometimes there. Tyson needs to keep his game more simple. When he’s losing the puck at the blue line or he’s making a bad decision at the blue line, this is not what we’re looking for. I think he could be a little bit better in that area.”

Right now, Andre Benoit is the quarterback of the power play on the first unit, and I like the fact that he puts a lot of pucks on net. His slap shot isn’t overpowering, but it gets to the net and he gets rid of the puck quickly. Barrie has tended to hold on to the puck a little too long, but the kid will learn.
