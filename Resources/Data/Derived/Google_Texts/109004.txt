PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” A majority of Oregon's health insurance companies are proposing rate hikes for the individual and small group markets in 2017.

The Oregonian/OregonLive.com reports (http://bit.ly/1NUkDcY ) that every state insurer, excluding Health Net Health Plan of Oregon, is proposing a double-digit percentage rate increase for the individual market next year. For the small-group market, seven of 12 insurers plan to raise rates.

The increases come after the Oregon Insurance Division reported that the state's seven largest insurers lost $171 million in 2015.

If the rates get approved, it'll mark the second straight year of significant increases since implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The proposed rates apply to small businesses and people buying their own coverage, which accounts for about 10 percent of Oregon's insurance customers.

The state will announce final rates July 1.

Details can be found at http://www.oregonhealthrates.org, with full technical rate filings to be posted by the end of the week, officials said.
