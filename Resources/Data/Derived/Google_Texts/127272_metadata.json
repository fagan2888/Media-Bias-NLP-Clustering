The GDPNow forecast is constructed by aggregating statistical model forecasts of 13 subcomponents that comprise GDP. Other private forecasters use similar approaches to \u201cnowcast\u201d GDP growth.However, these forecasts are not updated more than once a month or quarter, are not publicly available, or do not have forecasts of the subcomponents of GDP that add \u201ccolor\u201d to the top-line number. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model fills these three voids.\"It is important to emphasize that the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is a model projection not subject to judgmental adjustments. It is not an official forecast of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, its president, the Federal Reserve System, or the FOMC,\" the Atlanta Fed's website notes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Atlanta, Fed, Economic Growth, Expectations", "pubdate": "2015-10-02T08:15:13", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The U.S. economy is on track to grow 0.9 percent in the third quarter after a bigger-than-expected widening of the trade gap for goods in August, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Thursday.", "title": "Atlanta Fed Sees 50 Percent Drop in GDP Growth Estimate for Q3", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Atlanta-Fed-Economic-Growth-Expectations/2015/10/01/id/694272/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=fecb2ce1-6e8d-4208-b58f-50bab878d2c3&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Atlanta-Fed-Economic-Growth-Expectations/2015/10/01/id/694272/", "title": "Atlanta Fed Sees 50 Percent Drop in GDP Growth Estimate for Q3", "description": "The U.S. economy is on track to grow 0.9 percent in the third quarter after a bigger-than-expected widening of the trade gap for goods in August, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Thursday.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1443773713, "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs", "keywords": "Atlanta, Fed, Economic Growth, Expectations", "article": {"section": "StreetTalk", "published_time": "2015-10-02T08:15:13"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Atlanta-Fed-Economic-Growth-Expectations/2015/10/01/id/694272/", "description": "The U.S. economy is on track to grow 0.9 percent in the third quarter after a bigger-than-expected widening of the trade gap for goods in August, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Thursday."}, "article_summary": "\"It is important to emphasize that the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is a model projection not subject to judgmental adjustments.\nThe Atlanta Fed GDPNow model fills these three voids.\nThe GDPNow forecast is constructed by aggregating statistical model forecasts of 13 subcomponents that comprise GDP.\nIt is not an official forecast of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, its president, the Federal Reserve System, or the FOMC,\" the Atlanta Fed's website notes.\nThe U.S. economy is on track to grow 0.9 percent in the third quarter after a bigger-than-expected widening of the trade gap for goods in August, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Thursday.This was a much slower rate from the regional Fed bank's prior estimate of 1.8 percent on Monday, the Atlanta Fed said on its website."}
