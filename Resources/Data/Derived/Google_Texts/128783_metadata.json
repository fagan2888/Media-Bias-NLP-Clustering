When she couldn\u2019t find Alise among them, she searched the pool and found her underneath a raft. Jamie pulled Alise out of the pool, but her body was blue and lifeless. Jamie had asked Alise to wear a life vest, but Alise had apparently taken it off.\n\nJamie and another party guest performed CPR until paramedics arrived, and they finally heard a heartbeat on the way to the hospital.\n\nWithout oxygen getting to her brain for that amount of time, doctors feared that Alise may have suffered long-term brain damage. \u201cFor her brain to come through this and be as functional as possible is astounding,\u201d Dr. Jeremy Garrett said to KVFS. She stayed in an intensive care unit and was fully conscious within a week. Two weeks after the incident, Alise returned home after achieving a full recovery.\n\nAlise Nipper, 3-Year-Old Missouri Girl Comes Back To Life After \u2018Drowning\u2019 In Pool And... http://t.co/vBFyspXJEk pic.twitter.com/vzy1nYhYkF \u2014 Inquisitr News (@theinquisitr) September 20, 2015\n\n\"I'm thankful every night,\" said Alise\u2019s father, Chris Nipper. \"I'm extremely grateful we have more of a chance to have her on earth with us.\"\n\nEarlier this year, another Missouri child survived a lengthy amount of time underwater with no apparent injuries.
