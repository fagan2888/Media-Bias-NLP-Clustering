Faced with congressional lawmakers who have opposed environmental regulation, the Obama administration has used its executive authority in the past year and a half to introduce sweeping greenhouse gas restrictions for power plants, tighten fuel economy standards for vehicles and curtail methane emissions for the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\n[READ: 2014 Was Earth's Hottest Year on Record]\n\nObama touted natural gas production as a key part of his administration\u2019s \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach to energy and environmental policy last year, and while taxes, the economy and immigration are expected to figure prominently in Tuesday night\u2019s remarks, experts predict oil, gas and climate change will also play a role.\n\n\"I believe that President Obama sees climate change as a legacy issue for his administration,\" says Steven Cohen, executive director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. \"President Obama will likely discuss America\u2019s renewed global environmental leadership: his use of executive power to regulate greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and the landmark agreement with China to reduce greenhouse gases.\"\n\n\n\n[ALSO: White House Moves to Rein In Methane Emissions]\n\nIn November, Obama struck a historic accord with Chinese President Xi Jinping, vowing to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, while also winning the first-ever commitment from China to reduce its own carbon emissions.\n\nAs part of that pledge, Obama has used the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department to take aim at emissions and institute new energy efficiency standards. The administration's support for and investment in renewable energy sources like wind and solar \u2013 such as through the Energy Department's loan guarantee program \u2013 might earn a mention Tuesday night, but it's more likely the recent collapse of oil and gasoline prices will be noted.\n\n\n\n[DATA MINE: Most Republican Voters Support Carbon Regs]\n\n\u201cHe may focus a bit on the price of oil and how the drop has a lot to do with it happening during his term,\" says Paul Sullivan, an economics professor at National Defense University.\n\nThe price of Brent crude oil, the benchmark for U.S. gas prices, has fallen below $50 a barrel, down from a high of more than $110 in June. As Sullivan points out, the drop in prices \"really has nothing to do with anything [Obama] has done,\u201d but instead stems from the shale oil and gas boom of the past decade.\n\nStill, the drop in oil and gasoline prices has proved an economic boon for motorists and manufacturers, and the shale revolution itself has helped spur hiring.\n\n\n\n[MORE: EPA to Complete 'Clean Power Plan' Carbon Rules by Summer]\n\n\u201cHe may claim success on the unemployment front,\u201d Sullivan says.\n\nHernandez Hammer's invitation to join the first lady at the speech may be symbolic in another way, too, Cohen says.\n\n\"The president is beginning to think about the lasting record he will leave as president,\" he says. \"A healthier America will be a theme \u2013 from the Affordable Care Act to a clean and healthy environment. The first lady\u2019s emphasis on wellness, exercise and nutrition, the Affordable Care Act and climate policy should be seen as a single central priority of the Obama years.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "EPA", "title": "Obama Likely to Tackle Oil Prices, Climate Change in State of the Union", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The president has made addressing climate change a central part of his second term, but will it figure into his address?", "title": "Obama Likely to Tackle Oil Prices, Climate Change in State of the Union", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/20/obama-likely-to-tackle-oil-prices-climate-change-in-state-of-the-union", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/af/53a99d19550280645ca8e12917ca2b/media:fba5d4fc56cf4fd08dd85d224730046dStateofUnion5Things.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obama Likely to Tackle Oil Prices, Climate Change in State of the Union", "description": "The president has made addressing climate change a central part of his second term, but will it figure into his address?", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Alan Neuhauser,Pulse,picks,energy policy and climate change,global warming,climate change,State of the Union,Obama, Barack,oil,gas prices,natural gas,energy,solar energy,energy efficiency,renewable energy,Department of Energy,EPA", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The president has made addressing climate change a central part of his second term, but will it figure into his address?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf202\"", "article_summary": "Her invitation to the address reflects President Barack Obama\u2019s intense second-term focus on mitigating and adapting to climate change.\n\"I believe that President Obama sees climate change as a legacy issue for his administration,\" says Steven Cohen, executive director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University.\nThe price of Brent crude oil, the benchmark for U.S. gas prices, has fallen below $50 a barrel, down from a high of more than $110 in June.\nNicole Hernandez Hammer, who leads the Florida chapter of Moms Clean Air Force, an advocacy group, has studied how cities most at risk from the effects of climate change and rising sea levels also have large Hispanic populations.\nDays after NASA confirmed 2014 was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, a leading climate scientist will sit with first lady Michelle Obama for the president\u2019s State of the Union address Tuesday night."}
