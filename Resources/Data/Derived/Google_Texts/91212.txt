Why sign up for Obamacare? The answer for young Americans is simple: Celebrities!

Well, that’s at least according to the Obama administration, which has recruited dozens of celebrities — from film stars to musicians to professional athletes — to tout the Affordable Care Act during the opening of the exchanges for 2015 health coverage.

Monday was the first in a series of “celebrity days of action” during which famous individuals tweeted about HealthCare.gov.

According to a White House official, the administration has drafted celebrities to appear in PSAs for Obamacare in addition to utilizing social media to communicate information about the law.

“We will work with celebrities from across the country that have a diversity of following to amplify open enrollment again to raise awareness, and to make sure consumers know that the plans are affordable,” explained the official. “Celebrities and athletes plan to film PSAs, create online content, utilize Twitter and Facebook, and participate in days of action.”

The move to tap Hollywood stars for the Obamacare campaign should come as no surprise, considering the administration did the same thing last year by recruiting big names — like LeBron James and Katy Perry — to raise awareness about the Affordable Care Act.
