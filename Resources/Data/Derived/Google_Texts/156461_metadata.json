That group has been shifted to plans under the federal Affordable Care Act. But healthcare advocates say the economics are more complicated. Jackie Young has more in her continuing series about the lingering health costs of U.S. nuclear testing in the South Pacific.\n\nStacy Woode is 32 and lives in Whitmore Village. She was recently switched to the HMSA plan under the Affordable Care Act. Stacy\u2019s husband and 4 children have Medicaid because they\u2019re U.S. citizens. But since Stacy was born in Rongelap, she no longer qualifies.\n\nHer grandmother, Almira Matayoshi, was one of the original nuclear Marshallese survivors who gave birth to 3 \u201cjellyfish babies\u201d. Those were deformed babies with no bones and translucent skin\u2014who died soon after birth. Almira also had thyroid cancer, and Stacy\u2019s mom had thyroid cancer. Stacy has hyperthyroidism, but is worried it might be cancer. \u201cSo I just thought that because my grandma had it, my mom had it, I had it because of genetics or from the fallout.\u201d\n\nStacy stopped going to the doctor at first because it was inconvenient, but now she\u2019s scared of not being able to afford the care because she\u2019s no longer on Medicaid. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know if I have to pay. I guess I\u2019ll take the chance, I don\u2019t know. \u2026If I did have Medicaid I would do all my doctor check-ups.\u201d\n\nDr. David Derauf, director of Kokua Kalihi Valley clinic, explains why he believes switching the mostly low-income Micronesian group from Medicaid to ACA plans with premiums and co-pays won\u2019t work. \u201c\u2026Oh, pay these co-pays, they seem reasonable to us\u2014middle-income people\u2014doesn\u2019t seem out of line to ask people to pay co-payments, but if you can\u2019t pay it and you don\u2019t get the care, why are we kidding ourselves that that insurance is going to make a difference, it really won\u2019t. \u2026X-rays the co-payment can be $100, specialty visits a $30 co-payment, medications $7 for generic, as much as $30 to $50 for brand-name products. If you\u2019re taking 4 or 5 medicines a day, and you\u2019ve got somewhere between $7 and $30 per medicine, what kind of income do you have to have to be able to make that a reality?\u201d\n\nAnother reality of healthcare economics is that those who cannot afford routine medical treatment often wind up in hospital emergency rooms\u2014at a higher cost to taxpayers. Derauf and some other advocates suggest there's a better way: having the state pick up the co-payments and deductibles for this group. \u201cI think we\u2019re being penny-wise, pound-foolish on this whole thing. If we run the numbers of what it would cost to subsidize the co-pays and deductibles for this group of people, my back-of-the-envelope calculations is somewhere in the neighborhood of $3- to $5-million-dollars per year for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn our final report tomorrow, we'll look at other options to deal with this growing problem of healthcare, costs, and the Micronesian population.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News Bites", "description": "Hawai\u2018i 's Department of Human Services projects it will save about 29-million dollars a year by not providing insurance coverage for so-called able-bodied", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://hpr2.org/post/micronesians-hawai-i-closer-look-part-2", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/khpr/files/styles/medium/public/201511/micronesian_girl.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hawai\u2018i 's Department of Human Services projects it will save about 29-million dollars a year by not providing insurance coverage for so-called able-bodied", "title": "Micronesians in Hawai\u2018i \u2013 A Closer Look (Part 2)"}, "story_id": 455801039, "twitter": {"site": "@hipubradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hipubradio"}, "author": "Jackie Young", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Micronesians in Hawai\u2018i \u2013 A Closer Look (Part 2)"}, "nid": 36011, "datePublished": "2015-11-12", "keywords": ", ,", "wordCount": 553, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Hawai\u2018i 's Department of Human Services projects it will save about 29-million dollars a year by not providing insurance coverage for so-called able-bodied Micronesians of working age.\nJackie Young has more in her continuing series about the lingering health costs of U.S. nuclear testing in the South Pacific.\nDerauf and some other advocates suggest there's a better way: having the state pick up the co-payments and deductibles for this group.\nHer grandmother, Almira Matayoshi, was one of the original nuclear Marshallese survivors who gave birth to 3 \u201cjellyfish babies\u201d.\nThat group has been shifted to plans under the federal Affordable Care Act."}
