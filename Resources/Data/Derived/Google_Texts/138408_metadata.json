Paul Ryan\u2019s new and very good book \u201cThe Way Forward: Renewing the American Dream.\u201d Perhaps there are several mysteries.\n\nMr. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, begins by writing at length about the place he has lived all his life, Janesville, a city of 60,000 in southern Wisconsin. It is rural, but it also has industry. Moreover, it has Ryans. Sixty-seven of his cousins live nearby. The Ryans have lived there for generations, along with other Catholics, Protestants and presumably citizens utterly oblivious to religion\u2019s call. The point, though, is that most of the citizens of Janesville are decent, law-abiding, can-do citizens. Mr. Ryan describes it as an ideal community to grow up in and to discover the American Idea. It is his idea of how we live as Americans. It is also the Founding Fathers\u2019 idea, and the basic idea of modern conservatism of which Mr. Ryan is a leading member.\n\nMr. Ryan grew up very religious, very moral and very can-do, but there were bumps along the way. At age 16, he found his father dead in bed, a victim of alcoholism and a heart attack. That is when the young man decided he could \u201csink or swim.\u201d He decided to swim, and while giving up his faith in college and taking aboard a bit too much recreational hooch, he applied himself to his studies in earnest and followed a regimen of strict physical fitness. Eventually, he gave up hard liquor, returned to the church, and increasingly threw himself into what he calls \u201cthe battle of ideas,\u201d first in college, then in Washington as a junior member of the conservative group Empower America, headed by Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick. He returned to Janesville in 1998, and ably assisted by a gang of Ryans, plus energetic others, he deposed his district\u2019s Democratic representative to the House of Representatives. Rep. Ryan was now ready to devote himself to public policy, a thing he loves almost as much as deer hunting.\n\nHence, the second part of this well-written and well-paced book, \u201cWhere We Go From Here,\u201d in which he makes his famous apology. In the 2012 campaign, fetched by the report that 60 percent of the American people took some form of government subsidy, he began talking about \u201ctakers\u201d and \u201cmakers.\u201d A listener objected to his characterization of \u201ctakers,\u201d and Mr. Ryan reflected: on the closing of General Motors\u2019 Janesville plant, leaving the town without its $220 million annual payroll, on the Social Security survival benefits that sustained him and his mother after his father\u2019s death, on his mother\u2019s receiving Medicare. He writes, \u201cI realized that I\u2019d been careless with my language. The phrase gave insult where none was intended. Ultimately, it was also ineffective, because the problem I was trying to describe was not about our people. Rather, it was rooted in a very different philosophy of government that I believe threatens to destroy the American Idea.\u201d\n\nThe philosophy of government threatening the American Idea is progressivism. In the second half of his book, Mr. Ryan writes lucidly about how progressive programs have grown beyond the limits of the sustainable. How with such new programs as Obamacare we are approaching national bankruptcy. Then Mr. Ryan outlines very clearly how these extravagant, mostly unmonitored programs can be replaced with sustainable programs. He would repeal Obamacare and replace it with \u201cmarket-based, patient-centered reforms.\u201d Before Social Security goes belly-up, he would reform it with personal retirement accounts, among other reforms. He would reform taxes, return to sound money, end crony capitalism and adopt regulatory reform. All of this will have to be done eventually because we are going broke. When Barack Obama took office, the national debt was $10.6 trillion. Today, it is approaching $18 trillion and growing. By 2024, the Congressional Budget Office predicts it will total $27 trillion. You could expropriate the wealth of the top 1 percent and you would still not cover our debt. What is more, the debt would continue to accumulate.\n\nPaul Ryan The Washington Times more >\n\nIn a word, progressivism is moribund, and it needs to be replaced. Mr. Ryan\u2019s book contains the blueprint to save the American Idea. Still, it is a mysterious book. In the memoir section of his book, he adumbrates a rising young man with near-perfect character. In the policy section of his book, he lays out very compelling programs for getting America out of its present drear. Did Mr. Ryan intend to give us his credentials for the presidency? In the past, he has convincingly argued that he is comfortable in the House of Representatives. Recently, I sense that he is wavering.\n\nAt dinner a month or so ago, there was a sense of urgency in his concern for the country. Now, in \u201cThe Way Forward,\u201d he quotes Mr. Romney as saying he is \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about the wobbly direction of the country. Mr. Ryan adds, \u201cThat\u2019s what motivates me, too.\u201d Read the book, and I think you will agree with me. Mr. Ryan has the character and the programs to lead us out of this mess.\n\nR.
