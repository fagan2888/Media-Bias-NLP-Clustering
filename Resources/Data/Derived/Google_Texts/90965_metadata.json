He says the Franciscan Alliance, like other health systems, must cut its costs of care delivery over the next 3 years by 15 percent to 20 percent to remain viable.\n\n\u201cMost of these cuts take place immediately, there may be some several day lags,\u201d Stuteville said.\n\nThe company cites shrinking reimbursements, new payer models and changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act and says the staff reductions are among several initiatives the alliance has taken to reduce costs.\n\nFranciscan Alliance is the newest health organization in Indiana to announce massive cuts. In September, IU Health Systems announced an 800 job reduction and also cited the Affordable Care Act as the reason for the layoffs.\n\nNetwork Indiana content is included in this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franciscan Alliance is laying off 275 workers at hospitals and health facilities around the state.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Franciscan Alliance is laying off 275 workers at hospitals and health facilities around the state.", "title": "Franciscan Alliance Health System Announces 275 Job Cuts | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/franciscan-alliance-announces-staff-reduction-57451/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/10/hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/10/hospital.jpg", "title": "Franciscan Alliance Health System Announces 275 Job Cuts", "site": "@wfiunews", "card": "summary", "description": "Franciscan Alliance is laying off 275 workers at hospitals and health facilities around the state."}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1", "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf358\"", "article_summary": "The Indiana-based health system Franciscan Alliance announced it will cut 275 jobs from the 11 St. Francis hospitals and health facilities around the state.\nFranciscan Alliance is the newest health organization in Indiana to announce massive cuts.\nFranciscan Alliance Spokesman Joe Stuteville says 83 of the 275 positions are in Indianapolis.\nIn September, IU Health Systems announced an 800 job reduction and also cited the Affordable Care Act as the reason for the layoffs.\nPhoto: TownPost Network (Flickr) The Franciscan Alliance says it has undertaken other measures to reduce costs, such as streamlining patient flow processes and coordinating care across the system."}
