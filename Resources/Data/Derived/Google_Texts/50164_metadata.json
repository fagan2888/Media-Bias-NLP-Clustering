She still wore the same clothes, a black skirt and a black-and-white blouse, crusty now.\n\nAn endless night before, Felicia Sanders had left her blood-soaked shoes with the dead in the fellowship hall of her beloved lifelong church, Emanuel AME.\n\nBarefoot as the sun rose, she trudged up the steps to her home, the one where 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders\u2019 bedroom waited silently, his recent college acceptance letter tacked onto a bulletin board beside his poetry. It was after 6 a.m., and she hadn\u2019t slept. She hadn\u2019t eaten, not since going to Emanuel AME\u2019s elevator committee meeting the evening before, then its quarterly conference and then its weekly Wednesday Bible study. There, 12 people met in God\u2019s midst. Nine of them died, 77 bullets in their midst.\n\nFelicia had answered questions all night from myriad authorities determined to find the killer. Now her phone rang. Her doorbell rang. Reporters, friends, family, strangers, an endless blare through the jangle of her muddled thoughts. Finally, in a delirious rage, she called an old friend, attorney Andy Savage.\n\n\u201cAndy, it\u2019s too much!\u201d she cried into the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nI'm tempted to copy and paste every other paragraph of this incredible story. However, I'll resist that urge and simply share a couple of key sections that illustrate the piece's ghost-free nature:\n\nFirst, there's this section on grappling with God:\n\nNext came the questions for God.\n\nThe Bible study\u2019s passage that June 17 evening was a widely known one from Mark 4 that discusses sowing spiritual seeds \u2014 and how seeds wither without nourishment. It made Felicia think of the killer.\n\n\u201cI want to know why the seed was sitting there for an hour. I want to know why he admitted the next morning he almost didn\u2019t do it because he thought we were nice. I needed somebody who knows. I didn\u2019t go to theology school,\u201d Felicia said. \u201cI just want answers. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\nHer therapist asked if she had a minister to talk to.\n\nBut five of them had died with her son.\n\n\u201cEverything I believe in has been shaken,\u201d Felicia said. \u201cI know God has been in the midst. But you ask yourself all these questions. Is it something I did?\u201d\n\nLater, Hawes deftly allows the survivors to confront \u2014 in their own words \u2014 questions of punishment and forgiveness:\n\nAnd now they face a trial. Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson announced last week she will seek the death penalty for the suspect.\n\nPolly, a warm grandmotherly presence, doesn\u2019t support the idea. Everyone, she believes, should have a chance to repent. Until retiring three years ago, she was a nurse at the detention center where Roof now is jailed.\n\n\u201cI would have been the one taking care of him,\u201d Polly said. \u201cI think I could have taken care of him with a smile. I know I would have.\u201d\n\nFelicia prefers to let Wilson hand out criminal justice.\n\n\u201cWhatever she decided, I respected,\u201d Felicia said. \u201cScarlett Wilson didn\u2019t give him the death penalty. He did that to himself. Scarlett Wilson didn\u2019t give him life in prison. He did that to himself.\u201d\n\nSitting with Felicia in her living room, Polly added: \u201cBut ultimately, God has the last word.\u201d\n\nIt's real. It's powerful. It's worth your time.\n\nGo ahead and read it all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you love good journalism and great storytelling, you absolutely must \r\nread Jennifer Berry Hawes'\u00a0latest front-page narrative on the Emanuel AME \r\nshooting in Charleston, S.C..\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, we have praised the Pulitzer Prize-winning Hawes' \r\nstrong, sensitive coverage in The Post and Courier,\u00a0Charleston's daily \r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the veteran Godbeat pro \u2014 now a projects writer \u2014 produces a \r\npowerful story mixing raw, chilling details with expert attention to \r\nrevealing religion details.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this narrative: Felicia Sanders and Polly Sheppard, who \r\nsurvived the massacre, along with Sanders' 11-year-old granddaughter.\r\n\r\nThe grab-your-attention-in-a-hurry lede:\r\n\r\n    The blood splattered on her legs \u2014 that of her son, an elderly aunt,\r\n    her pastors, nine people she loved \u2014 had dried.
