That was when she still was trying to compete against the men, when she didn\u2019t always look as if she was having fun and before injuries and criticism were a big part of her growing pains.\n\nOn another tough day at Pinehurst No. 2, the 24-year-old from Hawaii held it together Friday with two key par putts and finished with back-to-back birdies for a 2-under 68, giving her a three-shot lead going into the weekend at the U.S. Women\u2019s Open.\n\n\u201cI think you look at the way Michelle has played the last six months and you look at her differently,\u201d said Stacy Lewis, the No. 1 player in women\u2019s golf who was four shots out of the lead. \u201cI think she\u2019s become one of the best ball-strikers on tour. She hits it really consistent. She knows where the ball\u2019s going. And she\u2019s figuring out how to win. That\u2019s the big thing.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a familiar name, and another teen prodigy, who joined Wie as the only players still under par.\n\nLexi Thompson, who soundly beat Wie in the final round to win the Kraft Nabisco Championship for her first major title, powered her way out of the sand and weeds, running off three straight birdies to match Wie\u2019s 68, the low score Friday.\n\nFor all the interest in the men and women playing Pinehurst No. 2 in successive weeks, Wie and Thompson made the Women\u2019s Open more closely resemble the first LPGA major. Is it too early to start thinking rematch?\n\n\u201cDefinitely too early,\u201d Thompson said with a laugh. \u201cThirty-six holes in a major, that\u2019s a lot of golf to be played, especially at a U.S. Women\u2019s Open.\u201d\n\nFor now, Wie had control. Her three-shot lead is the largest through 36 holes in the Women\u2019s Open in 11 years.\n\nShe twice thought her shots were going off the turtleback greens, and twice she relied on her table-top putting stance to make long par saves. She finished with a 6-iron that set up a 12-foot birdie putt, and a 15-foot birdie on the par-5 ninth to reach 4-under 136.\n\n\u201cEnd of the day yesterday, I was thinking if I just did this again, that would be nice,\u201d Wie said. \u201cFinishing with two birdies is always great. It\u2019s a grind out there. It\u2019s not easy. Really grateful for the par putts that I made and some of the birdie putts that I made. I can\u2019t complain. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nJust when it looked as if this had the trappings of another runaway \u2014 Martin Kaymer led by at least four shots over the final 48 holes to win the U.S. Open \u2014 along came Thompson with a shot reminiscent of what Kaymer did last week.\n\nFrom the sand and bushes left of the fairway on the par-5 fifth hole, Thompson blasted a 5-iron from 195 yards just off the green, setting up two putts for birdie from about 60 feet. Kaymer was in roughly the same spot in the third round when he hit 7-iron from 202 yards to 5 feet, that pin position more toward the front.\n\nThat was her third straight birdie, and she closed with four pars to reach 139.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 wasn\u2019t in much of a giving mood on another warm day in the North Carolina sandhills, with a brief shower in the middle of the afternoon that didn\u2019t do much to soften a dry, crusty golf course.\n\nLewis, who opened with a bogey-free 67, picked up a bogey on her first hole in a wild round of six bogeys, three birdies and a tough 73. Even so, the two-time major champion managed to see the big picture.\n\n\u201cI hung around, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do at this tournament,\u201d said Lewis, at even-par with Amy Yang (69) and Minjee Lee, the 18-year-old amateur from Australia who played bogey-free on the back nine to salvage a 71.\n\nLucy Li, the precocious 11-year-old and youngest qualifier in the history of the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, isn\u2019t leaving town until Monday. She just won\u2019t be playing any more golf. The sixth-grader from the Bay Area started with a double bogey for the second straight day and shot another 78 to miss the cut by seven shots.\n\nThe cut was 9-over 149.\n\nNa Yeon Choi had a 70 and was at 1-over 141, followed by a Paula Creamer (72) at 2-over 142. The group at 143 included Karrie Webb (73) and So Yeon Ryu (74), who saved her hopes with three straight birdies on the front nine, and narrowly missing a fourth. All of them are former Women\u2019s Open champions.\n\nThis is a different Wie they are chasing. She already has won this year in Hawaii, and she has eight top 10s and is No. 2 on the LPGA money list.\n\nAttribute that to a putting stroke that she owns, no matter how peculiar it looks with her back bent severely, almost parallel to the ground. And she has learned to play the shot \u2014 she has a full allotment \u2014 instead of worrying about her score or her position on the leaderboard.\n\n\u201cI knew I could get better,\u201d Wie said. \u201cI knew I could improve. But that\u2019s the game of golf. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so fun about it. You work hard, you work hard, it\u2019s a challenging game. You can never quite perfect it. I love working on my game. I love working on different shots. Just trying to get better every day. I never really lost a sense of determination or drive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michelle Wie has three-shot lead in U.S. Women\u2019s Open at Pinehurst", "title": "Michelle Wie has three-shot lead in U.S. Women\u2019s Open at Pinehurst", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/michelle-wie-has-three-shot-lead-in-u-s-womens-open-at-pinehurst/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__michelle-wie-us-womens-open-pinehurstp1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__michelle-wie-us-womens-open-pinehurstp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T12:12:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:49:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01dc\"", "article_summary": "Her three-shot lead is the largest through 36 holes in the Women\u2019s Open in 11 years.\nLucy Li, the precocious 11-year-old and youngest qualifier in the history of the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, isn\u2019t leaving town until Monday.\n1 player in women\u2019s golf who was four shots out of the lead.\n2 in successive weeks, Wie and Thompson made the Women\u2019s Open more closely resemble the first LPGA major.\nShe captivated women\u2019s golf as a teenager, contending in three straight LPGA Tour majors when she was 16."}
