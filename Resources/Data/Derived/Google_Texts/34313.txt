A North Carolina real estate firm has that already owns two retail centers in the Charleston region has added a medical office building to its local portfolio.

An affiliate of Ferncroft Capital in a deal with Alexandria One Associates LP of Chevy Chase, Md., paid $5.25 million for the four-story corner property at 163 Rutledge St., in the peninsula’s hospital district.

The sale closed last week, according to Charleston County land records. The seller was 163 LLC.

The property, also known as the Calcote Building, was built in 2006 at Rutledge and Doughty streets. It is fully leased, with the Medical University of South Carolina as the anchor tenant.

Medical office buildings have become a hot commercial real estate asset.

The sector began to blossom during the last recession. Health care weathered the downturn better than most industries, ensuring investors with stable rent streams. The health care industry also has a captive audience in the rapidly growing senior population that will require more medical services in the years ahead.

At the same time, a growing number of procedures are being performed in offices. Also, Obamacare is expected to trigger a jump in patient visits as insurance coverage is expanded.

It is Charlotte-based Ferncroft’s third local commercial real estate acquisition.

In the past two years, the firm has bought two Summerville shopping centers: the 455,000-square-foot North Main Market near Interstate 26 and Highway 17-A, and the 121,000-square-foot Sawmill Village at 680 Bacons Bridge Road.

This month, the company announced it had purchased a newly redeveloped Publix-anchored grocery retail center on Highway 17 in Pawleys Island for $16.5 million.

Ferncroft said on its website that it has acquired more than 2 million square feet of real estate for more than $300 million since 2007.
