At least Pajama Boy is only in cyberspace, not sitting on an airplane at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\n\nI don\u2019t know what irritates me most about this phenomenon. Is it the lack of simple decorum? Or is it the infantilization of our popular culture?\n\nThe first time I saw a young woman wearing PJs in public, I assumed she was mentally ill or homeless or both. The flimsy cotton bottoms looked like they\u2019d been lifted from the local hospital and were held up by a tattered drawstring. But she had enough money to order a venti Frappuccino at Starbucks and sit sipping it in her T-shirt and pajama bottoms at a suburban mall. That was a few years ago, and since then the trend seems to have accelerated.\n\nWhat exactly are these sartorially challenged young people saying? For one, \u201cI make my own rules.\u201d\n\nGranted, it is only convention that says we wear one type of clothing for one purpose \u2014 sleeping, lounging around before we go to bed \u2014 and another for a different purpose \u2014 shopping, traveling across country, going to the office. But convention matters.\n\nHumans make rules that govern behavior. (Actually, all species do; ours are simply more numerous and elaborate.) Without those rules, we\u2019d have not only anarchy, but shorter, less pleasant, more dangerous lives.\n\nOne of the ways we transmit signals about how to behave is through dress. We\u2019ve gone from blue jeans in the workplace to pajamas at the mall. What\u2019s next? It\u2019s hard to imagine we could become more casual in our attire than we already are, but then I never thought I\u2019d see someone in his jammies in line at the supermarket.\n\nBut wearing pajamas in public isn\u2019t just unconventional \u2014 it\u2019s juvenile. It signals that the wearer is not a full-fledged adult. The message the wearer sends is \u201cI\u2019m lazy\u201d \u2014 and maybe a tad dirty, too. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone hopping out of bed and into the shower and then back into what he wore to sleep before heading out the door.\n\nIf you want to be taken seriously, try dressing the part.\n\nColumnist Linda Chavez is the chairman of the Center for Equal Opportunity and author of \u201cAn Unlikely Conservative: The Transformation of an Ex-Liberal.\u201d She may be contacted through ceousa.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The practice isn\u2019t just unconventional, it\u2019s juvenile and signals that the wearer is not a full-fledged adult, writes Linda Chavez.", "og": {"description": "The practice isn\u2019t just unconventional, it\u2019s juvenile and signals that the wearer is not a full-fledged adult, writes Linda Chavez.", "title": "Stop it with PJs in public", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20131222-stop-it-with-pjs-in-public.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131222-chavezdig.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/CHAVEZDIG.JPG", "height": 479}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-23T01:10:31Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-12-23T01:04:13Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Stop it with PJs in public\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20131222-stop-it-with-pjs-in-public.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131222-chavezdig.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/CHAVEZDIG.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1354549\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-23T01:04:13Z\", \"section\": \"Latest Columns\", \"author\": \"LINDA CHAVEZ\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131222-chavezdig.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/CHAVEZDIG.JPG", "publishtime": "2013-12-23T01:04:13Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b83\"", "article_summary": "The first time I saw a young woman wearing PJs in public, I assumed she was mentally ill or homeless or both.\nBut wearing pajamas in public isn\u2019t just unconventional \u2014 it\u2019s juvenile.\nAt least Pajama Boy is only in cyberspace, not sitting on an airplane at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nThe latest entry into the fashion craze is Pajama Boy, the now infamous, plaid-clad twerp pushing Obamacare on Twitter.\nThe flimsy cotton bottoms looked like they\u2019d been lifted from the local hospital and were held up by a tattered drawstring."}
