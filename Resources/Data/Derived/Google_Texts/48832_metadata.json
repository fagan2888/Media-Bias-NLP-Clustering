These centers serve nearly 23 million medically underserved individuals across the nation \u2013 that\u2019s one in 14 Americans.\n\nLeaders of HRSA\u2019s health centers program have been important partners in developing, implementing, and monitoring both the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the Viral Hepatitis Action Plan, working to ensure that the preventive and primary care services offered by health centers are aligned to support the health goals of these national plans.\n\nHealth Centers and the National HIV/AIDS Strategy\n\nThe National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Updated to 2020 [PDF 2,230 MB] observes that \u201cIncreased funding to HRSA\u2019s Health Center Program also expands the opportunities for integrating HIV testing, prevention, care, and treatment services into primary care.\u201d The updated Strategy calls on Federal agencies and health care delivery systems to support the integration of high-quality HIV services into health centers and other primary care settings by providing routine HIV screening, basic HIV care and treatment, referrals for more complex HIV care and treatment, and coordination of care across settings and providers.\n\nA current example of this integration is Partnerships for Care (P4C): Health Departments and Health Centers Collaborating to Improve HIV Health Outcomes , a 3-year cross-HHS demonstration project funded through the Secretary\u2019s Minority AIDS Initiative Fund and and the Affordable Care Act. The goals of the project are to build sustainable partnerships among CDC-funded state health departments and HRSA-funded health centers to support expanded HIV service delivery in communities highly affected by HIV, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. The state health departments in Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York are collaborating with a total of 22 health centers to increase the identification of undiagnosed HIV infection, establish new access points for HIV care and treatment, and improve HIV outcomes along the continuum of care for people living with HIV. At the conclusion of this project, best practices and other lessons learned will be shared widely among both health departments and health centers. Read more about the P4C .\n\nHealth Centers and the Viral Hepatitis Action Plan\n\nSimilarly, health centers are working to expand opportunities for viral hepatitis screening, hepatitis A and B vaccination, and improving linkage to care and treatment among individuals who are diagnosed.\n\nHRSA\u2019s Acting Associate Administrator for Primary Health Care, Ms. Tonya Bowers, recently shared in a blog post that in 2013 HRSA-supported health centers reported they had screened 317,647 patients for hepatitis B and provided services to 23,759 patients diagnosed with hepatitis B. That same year, 296,349 patients were screened for hepatitis C and 145,309 patients were diagnosed with hepatitis C. To support further expansion of these efforts, HRSA recently launched a viral hepatitis resource page for health centers, Hepatitis: Action Steps and Guidelines for Health Centers.\n\nAs HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell observed in her recent blog post, \u201cAt HHS, we\u2019re committed to building a health care system that delivers better care, spends our health care dollars more wisely, and puts empowered and engaged patients in the center of their care to keep them healthy. For 50 years, health centers have led the way with high-quality care for millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nPlease join us in saluting the nation\u2019s community health centers for their significant contributions to our nation\u2019s health, including their support for efforts to improve health outcomes related to HIV and viral hepatitis. We are grateful for their contributions to underserved populations and look forward to continued collaboration with them as they continue to expand HIV and viral hepatitis prevention, care, and treatment services.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
