REUTERS/Jim Young\n\n(Reuters Health) - A 25-year-old program named for Ryan White, who was expelled from school at age 13 because he had HIV, now provides essential services to nearly three-quarters of HIV-positive patients in the U.S., a new analysis shows.\n\nCompared to other outpatient HIV treatment facilities, those funded by the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) offer more case management, mental health and substance abuse support services, and those services make a difference in patient outcomes, according to researchers from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nFacilities that applied for and received funding through the RWHAP have served more vulnerable populations, including the poor or recently homeless or incarcerated, said lead author Dr. John Weiser of the CDC\u2019s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\u201cAs expected, patients receiving care at RWHAP-funded facilities, because they were more likely to experience life challenges, were less likely overall to achieve viral suppression than those receiving care at non-RWHAP-funded facilities,\u201d Weiser told Reuters Health by email.\n\n\u201cHowever, after taking those differences into consideration, poor patients were more likely to achieve viral suppression if they received care at RWHAP-funded facilities,\u201d he said.\n\nAchieving viral suppression by taking HIV medication means that levels of the virus in the body are so low that people have a nearly average life expectancy and are less likely to transmit the disease, according to the CDC.\n\nIn 1990, the RWHAP was established to fund states, metropolitan areas and clinics to increase access to high-quality HIV care and treatment for low-income, uninsured and underinsured individuals and families.\n\nCurrently reaching 500,000 people with HIV \u2013 more than half of those in the U.S. living with the disease \u2013 the RWHAP is a \u201cpayer of last resort\u201d for core medical services like medication that a facility could otherwise not afford, and also for support services like food, housing and transportation or counseling services.\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion increase access to HIV treatment for many Americans, the supportive services that the RWHAP funds are still often not covered by Medicaid and commercial insurance, Weiser said. So facilities without RWHAP funding would need to find another way to pay for them, he noted.\n\nFor the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Weiser\u2019s team looked at data from 2009 and 2011 covering a sample of 8,038 HIV-infected adults receiving medical care at 989 outpatient health care facilities across the U.S.\n\nThey found that 34 percent of facilities received RWHAP funding and 72.8 percent of patients were treated at one of these facilities.\n\nPatients getting care at RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to be young, female and black or Hispanic, to have less than a high school education, be at or below the poverty level and to lack health insurance.\n\nNonetheless, almost 75 percent of patients at RWHAP funded facilities achieved viral suppression, only slightly less than the 79 percent at other facilities.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have an increase in the number of cases, we\u2019re going to have to increase the proportion of people who are virally suppressed,\u201d said commentary author Stephen F. Morin of the University of California, San Francisco, who worked on the authorization of the Ryan White program as part of congresswoman Nancy Pelosi\u2019s staff in the 1980s.\n\nRyan White-funded programs are \u201cstretched to the limit\u201d in states that did not expand Medicaid, like Alabama, Morin told Reuters Health.\n\nMany states are having trouble financing important case management services, he said.\n\nRyan White died in 1990 at age 18, just months before Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1N36uXJ and http://bit.ly/1JNOA5Q JAMA Internal Medicine, online August 31, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ryan, white, hiv, aids, program", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 25-year-old program named for Ryan White, who was expelled from school at age 13 because he had HIV, now provides essential services to nearly three-quarters of HIV-positive patients in the U.S.", "title": "Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Offers Needed Patient Support", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ryan-white-hivaids-program-offers-needed-patient-support-351082", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/03/ryan-white-hivaids-program.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 25-year-old program named for Ryan White, who was expelled from school at age 13 because he had HIV, now provides essential services to nearly three-quarters of HIV-positive patients in the U.S.", "title": "Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Offers Needed Patient Support", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ryan-white-hivaids-program-offers-needed-patient-support-351082", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/03/ryan-white-hivaids-program.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/03/ryan-white-hivaids-program.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-03T11:02:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-03T11:02:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 25-year-old program named for Ryan White, who was expelled from school at age 13 because he had HIV, now provides essential services to nearly three-quarters of HIV-positive patients in the U.S."}, "article_summary": "Ryan White died in 1990 at age 18, just months before Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.\nU.S. President Barack Obama (C) signs the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 as Jeanne White-Ginder (2nd R), mother of Ryan White, looks on in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House in Washington, October 30, 2009.\nNonetheless, almost 75 percent of patients at RWHAP funded facilities achieved viral suppression, only slightly less than the 79 percent at other facilities.\nThey found that 34 percent of facilities received RWHAP funding and 72.8 percent of patients were treated at one of these facilities.\nSo facilities without RWHAP funding would need to find another way to pay for them, he noted."}
