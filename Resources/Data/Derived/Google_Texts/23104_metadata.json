He retired to San Diego in his late 50s, worked as a consultant, and was playing golf one day when an old Wellmark client, David Lyons, a former Iowa Farm Bureau Federation officer, called with a pitch he couldn\u2019t refuse \u2014 to help start a new cooperative plan under the ACA.\n\nGold was in, drawn to the vision of \u201creinventing nonprofit health insurance,\u201d and CoOportunity was founded in 2012.\n\nNow that vision is fodder for ACA critics and executives at large insurers skeptical that co-ops could ever compete.\n\nAfter garnering more than 120,000 members in two years, CoOportunity fell into a death spiral and state-ordered liquidation in early 2015. The insurer enrolled a lot of \u201chigh acuity\u201d members, particularly in Iowa, where the state experimented with a Medicaid \u201cprivate option\u201d eligibility expansion and allowed pre-ACA plans to be renewed.\n\nCoOportunity was paying out far more than it was taking in and, to make matters worse, the federal government ended up delaying risk adjustment payments by around six months, putting an expected source of revenue out of reach.\n\nIowa\u2019s decision to allow non-compliant plans to continue meant that a fair amount of healthy consumers did not enroll in exchange plans. Gold estimated that as many as 200,000 Iowans, including many independent farmers, kept their coverage in renewed pre-ACA plans \u2014 many of them sold by Wellmark, which also sat out the first two years of the exchange.\n\nAs Gold saw it, Wellmark\u2019s decision not to sell exchange plans and to keep renewing individual plans was a strategy to let the \u201cbad risk\u201d flock to the public exchange and competitors selling there, including the low capitalized co-op and Aetna subsidiary Coventry.\n\nSustainability issues\n\nBut CoOportunity won\u2019t be the last co-op to go bust, if Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini is correct.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the recent failure in Iowa and Nebraska is a precedent kind of transaction,\u201d Bertolini said earlier this year. CoOportunity, he argued, \u201cprobably is not the first and also not the last of these co-ops to have issues.\u201d\n\nWhile other co-ops are still a year or more away from turning a profit and sustaining themselves, \u201cCoOportunity\u2019s situation was influenced by a number of unique and specific factors, and is not a reflection on the co-op program or concept,\u201d said Martin Hickey, MD, the CEO of New Mexico Health Connections and chair of National Alliance of State Health Co-ops.\n\nSince CoOportunity went under, another co-op, Community Health Alliance in Tennessee had its enrollment frozen as a preventive measure by the state, but there do not appear to be any co-ops with an imminent risk of collapse, according to a report by Standard & Poor's. \u201cSome may have capital or liquidity issues, but most seem to have adequate liquidity at least to survive the near term,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Deep Banerjee.\n\n[Also: Provider-sponsored health plans rising to meet competition]\n\nAs of late March, more than one million Americans, drawn to typically lower premiums, have enrolled in co-op plans \u2013 especially in the first year of the exchanges.\n\nOne such co-op with strong enrollment is Land of Lincoln Health, a co-op created by a coalition of hospitals and businesses in greater Chicago. This co-op attracted 20 percent of new enrollees in the second year of Illinois\u2019 insurance exchange. The 50,000 new members amount to more than 10 percent of the statewide individual market.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nFor the 2015 open enrollment, Land of Lincoln Health dropped premiums by 20 to 30 percent and sold the lowest priced silver plan in most parts of Illinois, coming with the co-ops version of narrow networks \u2014 preferred partner plans. These plans offer members low cost-sharing for using hospital systems that are a part of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council that helped launch the co-op.\n\nElsewhere co-ops are trying to meet demand for a new kind of value proposition in healthcare.\n\nMaryland\u2019s co-op, Evergreen Health Cooperative, is operating its own primary care clinics, where members can come for personalized and comprehensive wellness, disease management and health coaching.\n\nAt the Evergreen Health Care clinics \u201cdoctors and nurse practitioners will spend twice as much time with you as in typical primary care settings, so that they can get to know you personally and focus on the things that are important to you,\u201d the co-op boasts.\n\nThe clinics also feature care coordination, 24/7 telephone access to clinicians for urgent concerns, lab services, \u201ccustomized wellness plans\u201d and online appointment scheduling, access to test results and email with providers. Along with a traditional provider network, Evergreen is pitching the clinics as part of its health plans to individuals, employers and military veterans.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cooperative-insurance-cliff-horizon", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/cliff-on-horizon-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The decline of CoOportunity Health of Iowa and Nebraska has Obamacare critics and executives at large insurers skeptical that co-ops can ever compete.", "title": "Is a cooperative insurance cliff on the horizon?"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/cliff-on-horizon-feature.gif"}, "description": "The decline of CoOportunity Health of Iowa and Nebraska has Obamacare critics and executives at large insurers skeptical that co-ops can ever compete.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is a cooperative insurance cliff on the horizon?"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Like other co-ops created under a loan program of the Affordable Care Act, the now defunct CoOportunity Health of Iowa and Nebraska was founded on the notion that health insurers \u2013 and Blue Cross plans specifically \u2013 had \u201cstrayed from their mission,\u201d according to CoOportunity CEO Cliff Gold.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad82\"", "article_summary": "Iowa\u2019s decision to allow non-compliant plans to continue meant that a fair amount of healthy consumers did not enroll in exchange plans.\nMaryland\u2019s co-op, Evergreen Health Cooperative, is operating its own primary care clinics, where members can come for personalized and comprehensive wellness, disease management and health coaching.\nGold was in, drawn to the vision of \u201creinventing nonprofit health insurance,\u201d and CoOportunity was founded in 2012.\nAlong with a traditional provider network, Evergreen is pitching the clinics as part of its health plans to individuals, employers and military veterans.\nThe decline of CoOportunity Health of Iowa and Nebraska has Obamacare critics and executives at large insurers skeptical that co-ops can ever compete."}
