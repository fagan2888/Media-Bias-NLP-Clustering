(Photo: McLaren Greater Lansing)\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the U.S. In fact, for 2015 alone, the ACS projects a total of 221,200 new lung cancer cases, as well as 158,000 deaths attributed to this deadly disease.\n\nMounting evidence regarding the benefits of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as a diagnostic test for lung cancer has prompted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take action. Consequently, effective Feb. 5, 2015, CMS agreed to start reimbursing for annual LDCT screenings provided that patients meet certain criteria. Additionally, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has given lung cancer screening a grade B. Ultimately, under the Affordable Care Act, this means most private insurers must cover (with no co-pays or deductible costs) annual lung cancer screenings for qualifying individuals at high risk of the disease. A prior authorization may be required by your insurer.\n\nThe criteria for annual lung cancer screenings have changed as well. To be eligible, patients must be the following:\n\nAged 55-77\n\nAsymptomatic of lung cancer (not experiencing a new or changing cough, hemoptysis, significant weight loss, pneumonia, etc.)\n\nA current or former smoker with at least a 30-pack-year history (former smokers need to have quit within the last 15 years)\n\nAn added criterion is the shared decision making visit, which must take place between the patient and the primary care provider. During this appointment, a physician will determine the patient's eligibility for annual LDCT, discuss the benefits and risks of screening, and provide related counseling. At this appointment, if it's determined a patient meets the requirements for a lung cancer screening, the provider can refer him or her for LDCT.\n\nIf you require a lung cancer screening, ask your doctor about having this diagnostic test performed at McLaren Greater Lansing's screening site. A long-trusted source for lung cancer care, McLaren offers only the highest standards.\n\nFor more information about lung cancer services, call McLaren Lung Cancer Institute at (517) 975-8030.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1JKDmEE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the U.S. In fact, for", "og": {"site_name": "Lansing State Journal", "description": "According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the U.S. In fact, for", "title": "Lung cancer screening: You could be eligible with no costs", "url": "http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/sponsor-story/mclaren-greater-lansing/2015/06/12/mclaren-lung-cancer-screening/71125722/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lansingstatejournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the U.S. In fact, for", "title": "Lung cancer screening: You could be eligible with no costs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee7a31ac5e6eef3b1e900c1adb9dd7bf7b04e81e/c=0-0-1680-1680&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/12/MIGroup/Lansing/635697107609815556-Lung-cancer-screening.jpg", "creator": "@LSJnews", "site": "@LSJnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOFOLLOW, NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=902480950", "fb": {"app_id": 155580771156105}, "Googlebot-News": "noindex, nofollow", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "LDCT,McLaren, McLaren Greater Lansing,American Cancer Society"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda818\"", "article_summary": "For more information about lung cancer services, call McLaren Lung Cancer Institute at (517) 975-8030.\nUltimately, under the Affordable Care Act, this means most private insurers must cover (with no co-pays or deductible costs) annual lung cancer screenings for qualifying individuals at high risk of the disease.\nTo be eligible, patients must be the following:Aged 55-77Asymptomatic of lung cancer (not experiencing a new or changing cough, hemoptysis, significant weight loss, pneumonia, etc.)\nConsequently, effective Feb. 5, 2015, CMS agreed to start reimbursing for annual LDCT screenings provided that patients meet certain criteria.\nThe criteria for annual lung cancer screenings have changed as well."}
