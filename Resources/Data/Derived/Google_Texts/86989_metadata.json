The nuclear power industry, meanwhile, is far safer, because it can't afford not to be given the catastrophic consequences of negligence, she says. After 1986's Chernobyl disaster, nuclear reactor leaders formed the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) to standardize industry-wide safety protocols.\n\nWhile the two industries operate in different ways, she says there are five reasons why healthcare can easily apply protocols from the nuclear power industry. Here are three:\n\nThe industry holds leaders accountable: Leaders within the nuclear sector are held accountable at every level, analyzing what went wrong and on whose watch whenever there is a mistake or error. \"At the end of the day, the station director is responsible for everything,\" Riccardo Chiarelli, senior program manager at WANO, told Binder.\n\nThe industry emphasizes outcomes: The WANO review process focuses on clear-cut performance objectives rather than checking off boxes during the process, according to the article. Meanwhile, the regulatory infrastructure within healthcare often forces hospitals to spend their time dotting I's and crossing T's rather than improving patient outcomes, which puts them at increased risk for burnout, Binder writes.\n\nIndustry leaders listen to frontline workers: The nuclear industry creates an environment where individual workers don't fear the consequences of speaking up about problems. And, unlike healthcare, where alarm fatigue remains a major problem, nuclear workers are expected to report every false alarm, according to the article.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBerwick advocates for new era of accountability\n\nHospital medical errors now third-leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n5 principles to help hospital leaders improve on the Triple Aim\n\nBerwick: CFOs must lead change to a better healthcare system\n\n8 recommendations for a culture of patient safety\n\nNationwide healthcare trends create urgent need for innovation\n\nRevisiting the patient experience balancing act: 3", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lessons for healthcare leaders turn up in numerous unexpected corners and industries, and on the all-important issue of patient safety, they can add one more: the nuclear power sector, Leapfrog Group CEO Leah Binder\u00a0writes\u00a0in\u00a0Forbes.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Lessons for healthcare leaders turn up in numerous unexpected corners and industries, and on the all-important issue of patient safety, they can add one more: the nuclear power sector, Leapfrog Group CEO Leah Binder\u00a0writes\u00a0in\u00a0Forbes.", "title": "3 healthcare safety lessons from the nuclear power industry", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-healthcare-safety-lessons-nuclear-power-industry/2016-02-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "accountability,alarm fatigue,Care Delivery,Frontline Workers,Leah Binder,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,nuclear power,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The nuclear power industry, meanwhile, is far safer, because it can't afford not to be given the catastrophic consequences of negligence, she says.\nHealthcare settings are, statistically, extremely unsafe for both patients and healthcare workers, writes Binder.\nIndustry leaders listen to frontline workers: The nuclear industry creates an environment where individual workers don't fear the consequences of speaking up about problems.\nWhile the two industries operate in different ways, she says there are five reasons why healthcare can easily apply protocols from the nuclear power industry.\nAfter 1986's Chernobyl disaster, nuclear reactor leaders formed the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) to standardize industry-wide safety protocols."}
