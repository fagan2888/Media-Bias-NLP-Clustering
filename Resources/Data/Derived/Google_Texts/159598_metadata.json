Too often they \u2014 and their clinicians \u2014 must make choices about preventing, diagnosing and treating diseases and health conditions without adequate information. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was created to help solve this problem \u2014 to help patients and those who care for them make better-informed health decisions.\n\nEstablished by Congress through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as an independent research institute, PCORI is designed to answer real-world questions about what works best for patients based on their particular circumstances and concerns. We do this primarily by funding comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER), studies that compare multiple care options. But more research by itself won\u2019t improve clinical decision-making. Patients and those who care for them must be able to easily find relevant evidence they can trust. That\u2019s why our mandate is not just to fund high-quality CER and evidence synthesis but to share the results in ways that are meaningful to patients, clinicians and others. We\u2019re also charged with improving the methods used in conducting those studies and enhancing our nation\u2019s capacity to do such research.\n\nWe will be evaluated ultimately on whether the research we fund can change clinical practice and help reduce the variations and disparities that stand between patients and better outcomes. We\u2019re confident that the work we\u2019re funding brings us and the audiences we serve closer to that goal.\n\nRecently, some questions have been raised in health policy circles about our holistic approach to PCORI\u2019s work. That view holds that direct comparisons of health care options \u2014 especially those involving high-priced interventions \u2014 should be the dominant if not sole focus of PCORI\u2019s research funding approach as a path to limiting the use of expensive, less-effective options.\n\nWe agree that discovering new knowledge on how therapies compare with one another is a critical mandate of PCORI and is essential to improving the quality and effectiveness of care. However, ensuring that patients and those who care for them have timely access to and can use this knowledge, so that they can effectively apply it to improve their decisions, is also very important. That is the reasoning behind our integrated approach path that addresses the gaps in available evidence, and also studies how best to make the evidence available and usable.\n\nMuch of our research portfolio is in fact dedicated to the research that our critics desire. We\u2019re funding studies to answer questions about common, serious conditions like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental illness, which affect millions of Americans. And the specific topics we\u2019re addressing are recommended and vetted by researchers and the patient and stakeholder communities to whom we\u2019re responsible.\n\nThis work will be bolstered by a new series of large pragmatic studies that will compare outcomes between two or more approaches to addressing high priority clinical issues in real-world settings. We also are establishing a national clinical research infrastructure to make it easier and less expensive to conduct these kinds of large studies in diverse patient populations.\n\nBy focusing on outcomes and data from real-world settings, we\u2019re more likely to obtain relevant answers to the many important questions patients have. Consider patients newly diagnosed with cancer. They want to know not just survival rates but the impact of different therapies on their quality of life or ability to work. Such outcomes matter to patients, but research often fails to address them.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made engagement a cornerstone of our research. Every research study we fund must include a plan to engage patients, their clinicians and others across the health care community to ensure the research focuses on practical questions.\n\nBecause engagement of this depth is new to many researchers and patients alike, we\u2019re developing methods to improve our ability to incorporate patients\u2019 perspectives in research. Patient-centered research methods that are transparent and scientifically sound will enhance the credibility and usefulness of the studies we fund.\n\nThis integrated approach will provide patients with the right information in the right place at the right time. It recognizes that engagement, methods, infrastructure, and effective dissemination make patient-centered research timely and useful.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested more than $464 million in such research to date. About 62 percent of this research funding has focused on CER, with the rest spread across infrastructure (18%), methods (11%), and communication and dissemination research (8%). We expect to commit $1 billion over the next two years to expand this work.\n\nWith a foundation for patient-centered research in place, we\u2019re confident our work will provide patients, caregivers, clinicians and others throughout the health care community with the information they need and help to improve health and well-being for all of us.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/03/25/pcoris-research-will-answer-patients-real-world-questions/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "PCORI\u2019s Research Will Answer Patients\u2019 Real-World Questions"}, "description": "PCORI\u2019s Research Will Answer Patients\u2019 Real-World Questions | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re funding studies to answer questions about common, serious conditions like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental illness, which affect millions of Americans.\nEvery research study we fund must include a plan to engage patients, their clinicians and others across the health care community to ensure the research focuses on practical questions.\nAbout 62 percent of this research funding has focused on CER, with the rest spread across infrastructure (18%), methods (11%), and communication and dissemination research (8%).\nPatient-centered research methods that are transparent and scientifically sound will enhance the credibility and usefulness of the studies we fund.\nThe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was created to help solve this problem \u2014 to help patients and those who care for them make better-informed health decisions."}
