"The Imitation Game" is the saddest story told at the box office all year.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the lead actor, playing the British mathematician Alan Turing, in a brilliant ensemble of dramatic talent, including Keira Knightley. This true story’s power comes from knowing it happened and changed the course of history. It is as improbable as life can be, with a tragic personal twist.

Turing leads a small team in a huge night-and-day effort, racing to break the German Enigma code. The time is World War Two. The place is Bletchley Park, a fine country house the British government has provided to spur the project along.

The stakes were as high as they can be. The Germans were winning the fight in the air and on the high seas. Perplexed and stumped for two years, Turing realizes they can’t break the complex code without some little slip or clue from the German military operators. The British government, all the way up to Winston Churchill, is pressing for answers. Much depends on breaking Enigma with their own invention, a machine called Christopher.

Just why Turing names the machine Christopher opens a story arc back to the eccentric genius’s past. Turing’s first love as a schoolboy was named Christopher, a kind, bright boy who loved him back. They were “inseparable,” as the headmaster said.

To be a homosexual in that era was, in a way, to be doomed in a glass prison. It was against the law, meaning that gay men like Turing relied on keeping secrets and breaking codes in their private lives.

Richard Chamberlain, the English actor, told the New York Times in a recent interview, “When you grow up in the ‘30s, ‘40s and ‘50s being gay, it not only ain’t easy, it’s just impossible ... I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me.”
