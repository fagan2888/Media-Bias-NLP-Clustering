Ah, the White House petition page, once a gesture of federal transparency, now a dumping ground for I Can Haz Wacky Political Hobgoblin.

To that point, a petition to have Alaska secede from the United States and join Russia has garnered 21,000 signatures in four days, rapidly outpacing every other petition on We The People’s landing page.

The petition, which may or may not be a joke, lists its millennia-old reasonings and demands in various sentence fragments:

The White House raised its petition response threshold from 25,000 signatures to 100,000, after the initial number was letting anybody and their brother in. The page remains a popular spot for secessionist movements.

In your daily dose of historical irony, Russia originally rented Alaska to the United States to help offload vulnerable territory and shore up its lagging economy after, wait for it, the original Crimean War.
