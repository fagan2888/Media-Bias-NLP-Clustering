Authorities have found a 14-year-old Thornton girl who was reported missing Sunday afternoon.

Hannah Pagan, who was last seen about 11 a.m. Sunday at the Thornton Recreation Center, called from a store in Brighton, according to Officer Matt Barnes.

Officers located the teen and are investigating her 10-hour disappearance.

Pagan’s parents called police about 3 p.m. to say their daughter had not come home. Authorities searching for the teen contacted area residents through a reverse 911.

“There is no indication of foul play at this time,” Barnes said.
