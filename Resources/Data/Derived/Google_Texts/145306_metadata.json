The plan, known as a Medicaid waiver, also would allow the state to continue improving the efficiency, safety and quality of its Medicaid program, called Medi-Cal.\n\nAbout a third of all Californians are enrolled in Medi-Cal \u2014 12.5 million people. The current waiver, which took effect in 2010, expires on Oct. 31, though the federal government can grant an extension while negotiations over the plan continue.\n\n\u201cIt is critically important to us,\u201d said Susan Ehrlich, CEO of San Mateo Medical Center, one of the state\u2019s public hospital and clinic systems. \u201cIt is a very large percentage of the overall revenue that we rely on, and we don\u2019t have other ways to make it up.\u201d\n\nEhrlich is one of about a dozen public and University of California hospital leaders who traveled to Washington this week to make their case for the waiver to members of Congress and administration officials.\n\nErica Murray, CEO of the California Association of Public Hospitals, said one of the sticking points is how long an important provision of the waiver would last, with the state proposing five years and the federal government offering only three. The provision would pay for changes in how public hospitals deliver care, she said.\n\n\u201cThree years is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need five years of support and incentive to achieve the goals of where the public systems need to be to stay competitive in their local marketplaces.\u201d\n\nDisagreements also exist over how hospitals should be paid to care for uninsured patients. The state wants to have the flexibility to use the money for more primary and preventive care rather than just to pay for emergency room visits and hospitalizations.\n\nThe state and the federal government have been negotiating since March, when California submitted a plan called \u201cMedi-Cal 2020.\u201d The plan also includes money to improve dental health programs, to expand the number of providers treating Medi-Cal patients and to start pilot projects addressing social problems of high-need patients.\n\nState Department of Health Care Services Director Jennifer Kent said this week that the state needs the waiver to keep public hospitals financially stable so they can continue implementing reforms enacted under the Affordable Care Act. State officials are working toward a resolution and are trying to meet the deadline, Kent said.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows this is important,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt just boils down to getting the details worked out. I think we will get there.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services declined to comment on the ongoing negotiations, but said extensions have been granted in other states.\n\nPublic hospitals have every right to be concerned about how the discussions are going, but there is always a lot of back and forth in Medicaid waiver negotiations, said Robin Rudowitz, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. \u201cGiven the amount of money, I can\u2019t imagine that anyone is going to walk away from the table,\u201d she said.\n\nWaivers allow states to make exceptions to the usual Medicaid rules. Under the expiring Medicaid waiver, known as the \u201cBridge to Reform,\u201d California enrolled about 650,000 uninsured residents in free county-based health coverage until they were able to enroll in Medi-Cal through the Affordable Care Act. The state also transitioned many of its Medi-Cal beneficiaries into managed care.\n\nIn addition, public hospitals revamped their programs \u2014 and created new ones \u2014 to improve the health and safety of their patients and to cut costs. For example, they began tracking patients with certain diseases, pairing patients with health coaches and making more weekend appointments for primary care.\n\nNow public hospitals say they need money to continue implementing the reforms. The new waiver also would increase the number of hospitals that can access funds.\n\nSan Mateo Medical Center used the money to cut wait time for primary care appointments, screen diabetic patients for depression and reduce deaths by sepsis. Kern Medical Center reduced pressure ulcers among hospitalized patients and helped obese children lose weight.\n\nUCLA Health System developed a program to help train physicians from Latin America so they could begin working in in high-need areas. The university\u2019s health system also improved diabetic patients\u2019 adherence to instructions on taking medication.\n\nSantiago Mu\u00f1oz, UCLA Health System\u2019s chief strategy officer, said that his institution relies on it to help pay for expensive care to children with complex illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re providing a lot of care to Medicaid kids,\u201d said Munoz, who was among those who traveled to Washington this week to push for the waiver. \u201cA lot of this highly specialized care is only available at academic or teaching hospitals.\u201d\n\nWithout the new waiver, public hospitals will be in a \u201cprecarious situation,\u201d said Christina Ghaly, deputy director for strategy and operations for the L.A. County Department of Health Services.\n\nThrough the waiver, the county\u2019s public hospitals and clinics received about $2 billion in federal funding over the past five years, were able to assign more than 400,000 patients to primary care teams and better integrate physical and mental health services.\n\nThe goal of the Medicaid waiver, she said, is to shift more care from inpatient to outpatient settings and to get to the bottom of why some patients continue to seek high-cost treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen a person ends up in the emergency department 50 times because they are homeless, you can continue seeing them in the emergency department \u2026 or you can address the root cause of their homelessness,\u201d she said.\n\nThe state\u2019s low Medi-Cal reimbursement rate doesn\u2019t fully cover care for the low-income population, providers said. And even though the Affordable Care Act expanded Medi-Cal, Ghaly said there are still millions of uninsured patients \u2014 and public hospitals are disproportionately responsible for their care.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a deal,\u201d Ghaly said. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t able to close that gap \u2026 there would be some very difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nAnna Gorman is a reporter with Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news organization covering health care policy and politics.
