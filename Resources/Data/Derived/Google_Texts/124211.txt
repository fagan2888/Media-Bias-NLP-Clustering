A writer for Rant recently compiled a list guaranteed to catch the eye and raise some blood pressures. The list, "Things people say that offend all Republicans" includes items that the writer says are guaranteed to make Republicans "even angrier than they normally are."

Since Alabama is pretty much the most Republican state in the country, I thought it would be interesting to see if any of these comments get your GOP blood boiling.

The list includes things such as: "Bush lied to us in Iraq;" "Reagan was imperfect;" We need more regulations;" "CNN isn't liberal;" and "Obamacare is not socialism." You can read the complete list here.

Oh, and there's one more I thought you all might want to share your thoughts about: "Racist Dixiecrats are now called Republicans."

Here's what the writer said about that one: "Yes, Southern Democrats used to be the racist ones. Totally. That's on us. We're very sorry and embarrassed. But that powerful voting bloc didn't just disappear. They are now called Southern Republicans."

Feel free to chime in below.
