The Iroquois, Delaware, Carrier, Inuit, Haida, Salish, Paiute, Wiyot, Shasta, Luise\u00f1o, Chumash, Zuni, Cheyenne and Blackfoot have all labeled the shining collection, according to Western Washington University\u2019s American Indian Starlore page.\n\nOn Saturday September 13, late at night\u2014or just before bedtime, as Earthsky.org points out\u2014those without cloud cover will be able to see the waning moon drift near the ethereal star group (it is not a constellation) that has inspired so many varied stories across the millennia.\n\nPerhaps their allure lies in their very elusivity: To see them properly, one has to look away. This is because, as Earthsky.org explains, the light-sensitive rods in the retina are located at its outer edge, while those that register color are in the center.\n\n\u201cSo when we look directly at something (as we do most of the time), we\u2019re using the part of our eye that is most sensitive to color,\u201d Earthsky.org says. \u201cBut when we look at something indirectly, looking to one side of it rather than directly at it, we\u2019re using the part of our eye that\u2019s most sensitive to faint light.\u201d\n\nThe Pleiades are actually comprised of several hundred stars, according to Earthsky.org, and are literal siblings seeing as they all emerged from the same cloud of dust and gas about 100 million years ago.\n\n\u201cThis gravitationally bound cluster of several hundred stars looms some 430 light-years distant, and these stars drift through space together at about 25 miles per second,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cMany of these Pleiades stars shine hundreds of times more brightly than our sun.\u201d\n\nThe Pleiades have nuzzled favorite sky sights before. A couple of years ago they visited with Venus.\n\nRELATED: Venus Gets With the Seven Sisters\n\nThere are almost as many stories about the cluster as stars contained therein. The sister theme comes into play among the Sierra and Paiute tribes of California, according to American Indian Starlore. The Aries Grizzly Sisters, so that legend goes, used to play with Deer Sisters, the Pleiades, in a cave.\n\n\u201cOne day Grizzly mother ate Deer mother,\u201d Starlore says. \u201cDeer sisters retaliated by trapping Grizzly sisters in the cave.\u201d\n\nMost of the stories are sad, involving lost and/or crying children, abandoned wives or the fallen.\n\nThe Inuit tell of Nanuk the Bear, attacked by a pack of dogs. His bid to escape took him and his pursuers to the edge of the world, but so busy were they in the chase that they did not notice.\n\n\u201cSuddenly they all fell off the edge into the sky, where they all turned into stars (Pleiades),\u201d Starlore recounts.\n\nThe Onondaga legend is one of several involving children\u2014children who danced their way up into the sky, lightheaded from hunger. The adults who had told them they had enough to eat ran out as they were dancing and rising little by little skyward, but it was too little, too late, according to the website Firstpeople.us.\n\n\u201cOne looked back and became a falling star,\u201d Firstpeople.us says. \"The others reached the sky and are now what we call the Pleiades, and the Onondagas Oot-kwa-tah. Every falling or shooting star recalls the story, but the seven stars shine on continuously, a pretty band of dancing children.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tonight\u2019s the night for the Seven Sisters to gather around the moon.The Pleiades will shine with the moon on Saturday September 13 from late night till dawn on Sunday, an ethereal sight.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/13/pleiades-seven-sisters-surround-moon-156881", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/pleiades-wwu_planetarium.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Surround the Moon"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-13T17:10-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Surround the Moon"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/13/pleiades-seven-sisters-surround-moon-156881", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Pleiades, stars, star cluster, astronomy, space, moon", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Surround the Moon"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2e4\"", "article_summary": "Tonight\u2019s the night for the Seven Sisters to gather around the moon.\n\u201cMany of these Pleiades stars shine hundreds of times more brightly than our sun.\u201dThe Pleiades have nuzzled favorite sky sights before.\nThe Aries Grizzly Sisters, so that legend goes, used to play with Deer Sisters, the Pleiades, in a cave.\n\u201cSuddenly they all fell off the edge into the sky, where they all turned into stars (Pleiades),\u201d Starlore recounts.\nThough many cultures brand them as sisters, the seven stars that stand out in the cluster known today by its ancient Greek name the Pleiades have long been noticed, categorized, named and gossiped about."}
