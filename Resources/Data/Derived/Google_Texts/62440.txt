Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Amsterdam next week includes a nuclear-security summit, a Group of Seven meeting on the Ukrainian crisis and a possible summit with South Korea’s president. But his first order of business will be to visit the Anne Frank House.

Mr. Abe’s visit to the hideout where the teenage Holocaust victim wrote her diary comes after a disturbing string of vandalism incidents in the Tokyo area involving Holocaust-related books. Earlier this year, more than 300 Japanese copies of Anne Frank’s diary and related books were found to have their pages ripped out in at least 38 libraries and one bookstore in Tokyo and Yokohama.

Last week, Tokyo police arrested an unemployed Tokyo man, charging him with ripping the pages out of 25 books. The man has not been identified by the police. Police haven’t said whether he is a suspect in the other cases.

The diary is read widely by Japanese children and young adults, and the vandalism received international attention.

A foreign ministry official said Mr. Abe wanted to convey the message that many Japanese were hurt by the vandalism. Mr. Abe will be the first Japanese leader to visit the Anne Frank site, the official said, adding that the visit was not directly prompted by the vandalism.

“Humbly accepting historical facts and passing them on to future generations is one step towards realizing peace,” the foreign ministry said of the visit.

Mr. Abe has come under fire in South Korea, China and elsewhere over his view of history and comments by allies that questioned the basis for two-decade-old apologies by Japan over its actions in World War II. Last week, the prime minister said he would uphold those apologies, signaling he wanted to repair relations with South Korea ahead of a visit to East Asia next month by President Barack Obama.
