A beloved female Asian elephant was euthanized Friday night after it had stopped eating and drinking for two days, Denver Zoo officials say.

“Denver Zoo is deeply saddened to announce the death of “Kimbo…Blood tests indicate renal failure,” a Saturday news release says. “Having lost her quality of life, Kimbo was humanely euthanized…”

The news release said that Kimbo had a sweet disposition.

“She brought a great amount of joy to all who had the fortune of visiting her. She will be greatly missed,” Denver Zoo President/CEO Shannon Block said in a statement on Saturday.

Kimbo was believed to have been born in Thailand in March 1970. She was sent to the Caldwell Zoo in Tyler, Texas, before coming to the Denver Zoo in December 2012, the news release says. She was “a shy girl” and was recognized by the freckles on her trunk.

Kimbo was the first new female elephant to move from another zoo into Toyota Elephant Passage.

Kimbo had a difficult spell in late September, often displaying abdominal discomfort, a news release says.

Then within the last week, Kimbo’s appetite began to diminish, and over the past two days she has refused both food and water.

“Decisions like these are always very difficult and they are not ones we take lightly. Unfortunately, additional diagnostic tests and treatment would require more invasive measures and would not likely resolve her advanced issues,” said Brian Aucone, senior vice president for animal care and conservation.

The average life expectancy for female Asian elephants in zoos is 46.9 years old. Denver Zoo still has four other Asian elephants, female Dolly and males Groucho, Bodhi and Billy.
