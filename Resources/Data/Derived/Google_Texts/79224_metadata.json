The Swift software consistently sends requests to a server, checking for updates. To someone with the right knowhow, though, it\u2019s possible to impersonate Swift\u2019s server and send through software that can be used to gain control of the device.\n\nThe main problem with this vulnerability is that there\u2019s no real solution. The Swift keyboard is so integrated into Samsung\u2019s software that it cannot be removed or disabled \u2014 even if it is switched out with a different keyboard app. Steering clear of unsecured Wi-Fi networks will make you less likely to be targeted, but it won\u2019t render you invulnerable.\n\nRelated: 10 Biggest Tech Flops of the Century\u200b\u200b\n\nSwift runs with elevated permissions, giving it pretty much free rein around the phone. This means that a hacker that worms his way into it can also access the Galaxy\u2019s microphone and camera, track the user\u2019s location or listen to their calls. They can even install apps.\n\nNowSecure claims to have made Samsung and Google\u2019s Android team aware of this vulnerability in late 2014, and Samsung reportedly has made a patch available to network providers. It\u2019s not clear, though, whether providers have pushed out the patch to users yet. Many networks have a record of being notoriously slow to push through updates and security patches, and NowSecure\u2019s tests found a number of Galaxy phones on different carriers were still vulnerable as of Tuesday.\n\nIf you\u2019re of a more technical bent, you may be interested in seeing the details of NowSecure\u2019s report on their blog. If you\u2019re of a less technical bent, you might want to check with your carrier and try to avoid insecure Wi-Fi networks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re one of the millions of users of a Samsung Galaxy phone, you might be a potential target for a malicious hacker.
