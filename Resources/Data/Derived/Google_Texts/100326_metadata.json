Yes, forced. First, ObamaCare canceled a policy she was happy with, and then the ObamaCare exchange tricked her into signing up for Medicaid by making that her only option.\n\nFor years Hopkins was content to pay $276 a month for a catastrophic plan that she was happy with and felt fit her budget and healthcare needs. All of that changed, though, when, like millions of Americans, she received a cancellation notice from her insurance company. Because the president, Democrats, and media had to lie about this reality in order to pass ObamaCare, Hopkins was shocked to learn that she would no longer be allowed to keep the plan she liked.\n\nHopkins\u2019 insurance provider did offer an alternative plan that satisfied the federal government\u2019s requirements of what was best for her \u2014 but not Hopkins\u2019 requirements. The alternative would cost $415 a month, hit her with a $1500 deductible, and ensure she paid for maternity coverage she would never need.\n\nBecause there was no way she could afford that, Hopkins sought out other alternatives on the Washington state ObamaCare exchange (one of the very few that is working). And this is when her government suckered Hopkins into becoming a welfare recipient:\n\nI logged onto the site under [my mother\u2019s] name and entered the information my mother provided over the phone. I fully expected her to realize that she had forgotten some crucial piece of information, like a decimal point in her annual income. We checked and double-checked the information, but the only option still appeared to be Medicaid. She suggested clicking on \u201cApply for Coverage,\u201d thinking that other options might appear.\n\nInstead, almost mockingly, her \u201cEligibility Results\u201d came back: \u201cCongratulations, we received and reviewed your application and determined [you] will receive the health care coverage listed below: Washington Apple Health. You will receive a letter telling you which managed care plan you are enrolled with.\u201d Washington Apple Health is the mawkish rebranding of Medicaid in Washington state.\n\nThe page lacked a cancel button or any way to opt out of Medicaid. It was done; she was enrolled, and there was nothing to do but click \u201cNext\u201d and then to sign out.\n\nSo not only was this poor woman conned into signing up for welfare, apparently she can\u2019t opt out \u2014 which makes sense. Whether it is against their will or not, the more people Obama can herd onto his scorecard, the better.\n\nThe thing is, Hopkins has always been eligible for Medicaid. But she is a dying breed of American \u2014 one with too much self-respect to accept a government handout when she can find a way to make it on her own.\n\nSomething cold-hearted leftist technocrats like Barack Obama, Ezra Klein, Josh Barro, and much of the mainstream media will never understand is a woman like Charlene Hopkins: Someone who took great pride in making it on her own but is now despairing and demoralized (her daughter\u2019s words) to find herself forced into welfare.\n\nBefore ObamaCare, Medicaid was one option. Not the option. Before this, she had never been, in effect, ordered to take a handout. Now she has been forced to join the government-reliant poor, though she would prefer to contribute her two mites. The authorities behind \u201caffordable care\u201d had erased her right to calculate what she was willing to spend to preserve her dignity\u2013to determine what she thinks is affordable.\n\nThat little contribution can mean the difference between dignity and despair.\n\nThe wake of human destruction behind ObamaCare\u2019s rollout is just beginning to be tolled \u2014 millions of cancellations and tens of millions more likely coming, premium and deductible increases on middle class families who can\u2019t afford them, the loss of doctors\u2026.\n\nBut how many Charlene Hopkins are out there? How many thousands, tens of thousands, or millions have or will be forced by ObamaCare into a choice that was unthinkable just the day before: Go without health insurance or give up a piece of your dignity by accepting a government handout?\n\nIn the case of Charlene Hopkins, she wasn\u2019t even given that choice. After her government lied to her about being able to keep her insurance, and hustled her into becoming a welfare queen, they won\u2019t let her remove herself from their \u201cObamaCare Is Working!\u201d scorecard.\n\nI\u2019m proud to see the spiritedness and resolve that bears my mother up even now. Such character does not draw attention to itself: Its spark only catches the eye when oppression seeks to snuff it out.\n\nRight now, in the United States of America, this is happening to everyday working and middle class Americans whose only sin was following the rules and believing what their president and media told them.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaCare Forces Woman Into Welfare Program", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "ObamaCare Forces Woman Into Welfare Program", "title": "ObamaCare Forces Woman Into Welfare Program - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2013/11/21/barack-obama-re-elected-as-us-president-pg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/11/21/obamacare-forces-woman-into-welfare-program/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare Forces Woman Into Welfare Program", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2013/11/21/barack-obama-re-elected-as-us-president-pg.jpg", "title": "ObamaCare Forces Woman Into Welfare Program - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Apple, Twitter, WSJ,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "WSJ", "published_time": "2013-11-21T07:22:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1754\"", "article_summary": "Before ObamaCare, Medicaid was one option.\nHopkins\u2019 insurance provider did offer an alternative plan that satisfied the federal government\u2019s requirements of what was best for her \u2014 but not Hopkins\u2019 requirements.\nSo not only was this poor woman conned into signing up for welfare, apparently she can\u2019t opt out \u2014 which makes sense.\nFirst, ObamaCare canceled a policy she was happy with, and then the ObamaCare exchange tricked her into signing up for Medicaid by making that her only option.\nBecause the president, Democrats, and media had to lie about this reality in order to pass ObamaCare, Hopkins was shocked to learn that she would no longer be allowed to keep the plan she liked."}
