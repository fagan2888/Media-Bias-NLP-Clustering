Planned Parenthood can come in and dissect some of the baby\u2019s parts and sell them for research.\n\nEven prisoners on death row have constitutional rights and you could not, if you executed them, sell their parts without their consent. If you see a pregnant woman walking a dog, the unborn baby has no constitutional rights, but if you abuse that dog you can be arrested for cruelty to an animal.\n\nAdvocates for abortion call it \u201cpro-choice.\u201d It is an elective procedure not an emergency procedure to save a life. Nevertheless, the Obama administration through the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, will pay the abortionist, primarily through Planned Parenthood, to kill the unborn baby.\n\nThe Supreme Court no longer interprets the Constitution. It is a super legislature.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States, she will probably appoint Barack Obama to the Supreme Court and believe me, the last chance to reverse Roe v. Wade and save babies will be gone.\n\nJack Wright Jr.\n\nMonroe\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/26XBGBt", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "If Clinton elected president and appoints Obama to Supreme Court, chance to reverse Roe v.
