A Kansas State University professor has been nominated for two Grammy awards for his solo performance on an album with the Kansas City Chorale.

Bryan Pinkall, assistant professor of music, and the Kansas City Chorale were nominated in the categories of Best Choral Performance and Best Engineered Album for their album "Rachmaninoff: All-Night Vigil."

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the album was released last March and debuted at No. 1 on the Classical and Traditional Classical Billboard charts.

Pinkall previously served as manager of performance operations and direction for the Emmy-winning 2014 Sochi Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony. He also managed the production of Pope Francis' Mass in Philadelphia in 2015.
