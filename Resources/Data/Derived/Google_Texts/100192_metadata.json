A broken sternum, a busted knee, a pierced kidney: each a piece of evidence proving tenacity on the field.\n\nThe play delves into a cultural conversation of what it means to be a football fan.\n\nIn a scene in X\u2019s and O\u2019s (A Football Love Story), a play having its world premiere at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre this month, a trio of retired players crosses the stage in a round-robin, bragging about the quantity and severity of their injuries.\n\n\u201cI had 22 surgeries,\u201d says one man.\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re counting? I had 37 surgeries,\u201d counters another, only to have a third trump them both: \u201cSixty-four surgeries,\u201d he says definitively.\n\nThen the trio repeats: \u201cBlew out both Achilles.\u201d \u201cSeparated shoulder.\u201d \u201cBroken collarbone: Tape it up and back in the game.\u201d\n\nPlaywrights KJ Sanchez and Jenny Mercein based the play on interviews with former professional football players, their families and their fans. They took on the brutal culture of football and the growing controversy surrounding concussions \u2013- and tried to square that with their own fandom.\n\n\u201cWe started to talk about how many conflicted feelings we had about loving the game, now understanding the significance of the damage that the game does,\u201d Sanchez says.\n\nIn the early 2000s, more and more retired football players began reporting symptoms of early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Others were showing personality changes, rage and depression: signs of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. A diagnosis can be confirmed only post-mortem, by examining the dissected brain.\n\n\u201cWhen this information started coming out, I was like, \u2018Wow. This is something I might have to deal with later on,\u2019 \u201d says Dwight Hicks, who spent six years playing defense for the San Francisco 49ers in the early \u201980s, and now portrays a retired football pro in the play. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t scary. Until some of the prominent players, guys that I knew, some of the guys that I played against, started to have this problem.\u201d\n\nThe play picks up where investigative journalism and research journals leave off, delving into a cultural conversation of what it means to be a football fan, and what the game says about America, in light of emerging science that reveals lasting brain damage from repeated hits to the head.\n\nIntense Conversations About Violence of the Game\n\nSanchez says this is not the first time football has confronted this identity crisis.\n\n\u201cThere have been intense conversations about the violence of the game, the brutality of the game, and the safety of the players,\u201d she says. \u201cThrough every generation, we knew what the risks were.\u201d\n\nThroughout the play, there are breaks in the narrative where the cast recites historic milestones and debates. Sanchez based these on archival documents and news articles.\n\n\u201c1869! Rutgers and Princeton play the first college football game!\u201d one actor says, while the chorus marches to John Philip Sousa. \u201c1892! William \u2018Pudge\u2019 Heffelfinger gets paid $500 to play and professional football is born!\u201d\n\nIn 1905, 19 players died playing football. The president of Harvard at the time, Charles Eliot, wanted to banish the game.\n\nThe Eliot character declares, \u201cToday\u2019s football is a boy-killing, education-prostituting, gladiatorial sport!\u201d\n\nThen, Teddy Roosevelt, president of the United States, steps into the debate.\n\n\u201cThe bruising nature of football instills manly virtues and builds strong bodies, when with each passing day America risks becoming less rugged and virile,\u201d says the actor playing Roosevelt. \u201cSurely we can minimize the danger without having to play the game on too ladylike a basis.\u201d\n\nOne American response to saving the game was to improve the protective gear players wore. But Sanchez says making better helmets is part of what led to more serious injuries.\n\n\u201cBecause the better the helmet, the more invincible the player,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are more likely to turn yourself into a human javelin.\u201d\n\nShe wrote a team physician into the play to explain how these head injuries happen. CAT scans of brains flash on a video screen behind her.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is, the brain, it\u2019s almost like a yolk inside of an eggshell,\u201d she says. Even with the protection of a helmet, \u201cthe yolk is still going to hit on one side of the shell and then the opposite side of the shell.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the buildup of those smaller subconcussive hits that leads to lasting injuries.\n\n\u201cSo a better helmet does not keep your brain from sloshing around inside of its skull,\u201d Sanchez says.\n\nEvery holiday, Sanchez and her husband watch highlight reels of the best football plays. At various times in her life, she has rooted for the Green Bay Packers, the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\u201cOne of my first girlhood crushes was on Tom Landry,\u201d she admits, laughing, \u201cwhich says way too much about me.\u201d\n\nQuestioning Fans\u2019 Responsibility for Players\n\nAfter Junior Seau, a beloved San Diego Charger, committed suicide in 2012, Sanchez\u2019s reckoning with the game began in earnest. While writing X\u2019s and O\u2019s, she and collaborator Mercein began to ask themselves whether they, as fans, had some responsibility for the players, and for the fate of football.\n\nThey created a table of fans at a bar who appear in scenes interspersed throughout the play, asking each other what will happen to football.\n\n\u201cIf football goes away,\u201d ponders one fan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to go away,\u201d her friend interrupts.\n\n\u201cMy family, we don\u2019t go to church \u2026 football is our way of being part of something bigger,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to admit I\u2019d be lonely.\u201d\n\nThey question the violence of the game. How violent it needs to be in order to be entertaining. And what they really get out of the violence.\n\n\u201cI think I watch it for the moment not when the guy gets knocked down. But rather the moment he gets back up,\u201d the fan says. \u201cI think I need to remember we can get back up.\u201d\n\nAfter the play runs in theaters, Sanchez plans to take it to colleges and high schools. She wants to start conversations like these in the community, especially among young people who will decide whether to play or not, and how much of their future they want to bet on football.\n\nPreviews for \u201cX\u2019s and O\u2019s (A Football Love Story)\u201d begin Jan. 16 at the Berkeley Repertory Theater.
