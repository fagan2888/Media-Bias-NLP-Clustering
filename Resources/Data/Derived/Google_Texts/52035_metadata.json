Bush on how to use information technology to bring down the cost of health care. Tippett said that at that time, health care IT was 10-15 years behind banking technology.\n\n\u201cIf information technology was applied to health care at the rate that it was applied to banking,\u201d Tippett said, \u201ceverybody would be healthier, and costs would go down.\u201d\n\nTippett believes that by the time Obamacare showed up in 2009, the government had indeed switched its focus from the pharmaceutical and insurance companies to information technology as the source of cost savings in health care.\n\nBut even then, Tippett says, most of the IT was focused on back-office systems like billing \u2014 not on making the health care experience easier for patients and doctors.\n\nHe said it is up to tech entrepreneurs and investors to move the focus of the technology to the needs of the patient.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on the long term, rather than on the back office,\u201d Tippett said. \u201cWe need to get people to talk to each other using technology.\u201d\n\nAs an example of the current system\u2019s inefficiency, Tippett points to tests ordered by doctors to treat a single patient. Much of the waste in the system, he said, comes from doctors and other caregivers not communicating with each other. \u201cThirty percent of all tests are done again, because the first guy couldn\u2019t get [the results] to the second one,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors might be able to communicate better with an electronic health record that is controlled by the patient and lives in the cloud.\n\n\u201cI do think the patient-centered record will eventually win,\u201d Tippett said.\n\nVerizon Healthcare is currently working on a \u201cuniversal identity\u201d system that would reliably associate a patient with her clinical record and allow her to share the data with her doctor and others, Tippett said.\n\nHealthBeat is a two-day conference covering how new ways of tracking our personal data can improve our health and health care system.\n\nFacebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-10-27T10:26:36+00:00", "author": "mark-sullivan", "modDate": "2014-10-27T10:26:36+00:00", "keywords": "healthbeat-2014,top-stories,verizon", "type": "news", "id": 1588885}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Doctors might be able to communicate better with an electronic health record that is controlled by the patient and lives in the cloud.", "title": "Verizon's CMO says patients, not doctors, should own their digital health\u00a0record", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/27/verizon-cmo-tippett-patient-centered-record-will-eventually-win/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/beat6568-780x520.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Doctors might be able to communicate better with an electronic health record that is controlled by the patient and lives in the\u00a0cloud.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1ec\"", "article_summary": "HealthBeat is a two-day conference covering how new ways of tracking our personal data can improve our health and health care system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the doctors or the insurance companies.\u201dTippett\u2019s experience in bringing information technology to health care goes way back.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dr. Peter Tippett, who leads Verizon Healthcare and its digital health accelerator, believes that a patient-centered, patient-controlled electronic health record is coming in the future.\nDoctors might be able to communicate better with an electronic health record that is controlled by the patient and lives in the cloud.\nBut even then, Tippett says, most of the IT was focused on back-office systems like billing \u2014 not on making the health care experience easier for patients and doctors."}
