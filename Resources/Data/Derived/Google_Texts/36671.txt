Wichita police have arrested two men in connection to a double homicide earlier this week.

Sgt. Kevin Kochenderfer confirmed during Saturday afternoon's media briefing that the two suspects were arrested in connection to Tueday's double homicide in the 2500 block of East Mossman.

Booking records identified the suspects as 24-year-old Brent Carter and 19-year-old Jamion Wimbley. Both were booked into the Sedgwick County Jail Friday evening.

Carter faces two counts of first-degree murder and criminal discharge of a firearm. Wimbley was arrested for two counts of first-degree murder, criminal discharge of a firearm and criminal possession of a firearm.

Police are still searching for a third suspect.

Betty "Ann" Holloman lived at the home on Mossman where the shooting happened. She, along with a 24-year-old man, was killed.

Holloman leaves behind seven children, three grandchildren, and dozens of other family members and friends. Many of them showed up outside her home for a vigil on Thursday.
