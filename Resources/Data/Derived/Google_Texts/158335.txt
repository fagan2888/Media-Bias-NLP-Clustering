Learning how the city works at a young age. That was the goal for the city of meridian's touch a truck event Saturday.

Power trucks, backhoes, dump trucks, garbage trucks, police, work trucks and even Aircare were all at the old Sears building on 22nd Ave. Many kids got a hands on look at different trucks and equipment that makes a city work. Many of them were able to operate some of the levers and push some of the buttons and of course a lot of horn honking. Organizers say they plan to continue this event every year.

"It's really nice. My little brother got to get on the tractor. We went in the fire truck. We got our faces painted," Zykia Berry says.

"It's a day for the families to come out and enjoy. It lets the kids have a chance to touch and see things they never get to see and understand what we do everyday in the city of Meridian," Parks and Recs Supervisor Aleasha Jordan says.
