And in a big bin at the front of the store were hundreds of figures, including Batman and Polly Pockets, as well as Star Wars characters. The price: four for $1. Perfect for stocking stuffers.\n\nThomas the Train toys were bagged in bulk, with eight trains selling for $14.99, instead of what they\u2019d go for in a retail store \u2014 between $8 and $17 each, according to Alpart.\n\nThe owners of the store at 1515 W. Street Road also go out of their way to package some of the items in plastic boxes or containers so they look new.\n\nIt\u2019s an added touch that makes a difference \u2014 especially when you\u2019re thinking of putting something that might have been played with before under your Christmas tree.\n\nAnother perk is you may find extra discounts once you get to the store.\n\nIf you\u2019re a grandparent, you\u2019ll get 10 percent off your purchase every Wednesday. If you\u2019re an educator, you\u2019ll get up to 30 percent off your purchase the first Thursday of each month. And every week, the store features a \u201csurprise\u201d sale on a certain type of product. The sale may include crafts, Barbie dolls or board games.\n\nAs you know, I\u2019m all about getting the most from my money.\n\nAnd nothing puts me in the holiday shopping mood more than a \u201cspecial\u201d on an already-good deal.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Bucks County Courier Times", "description": "Shopping at places like Warminster's RePlay Toys sheds some of the stress associated with so much spending this time of year.", "title": "$aving Bucks: All on board for RePlay Toys", "url": "http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/blogs/saving-bucks/aving-bucks-all-on-board-for-replay-toys/article_08545a18-8914-5c67-8dd0-087240dc1df6.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/buckscountycouriertimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/13/b131d7cd-a054-5c3d-b4f7-2abc50aa43e7/52ab6d984fae7.image.jpg?resize=760%2C565", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@couriertimes", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Shopping at places like Warminster's RePlay Toys sheds some of the stress associated with so much spending this time of year.", "msvalidate.01": "787153C38497467EA4140F3BE4C2455F", "fb": {"app_id": 1568122253505949}, "keywords": "#intell", "google-site-verification": "L_z65KReEHmr7-_OLfAoLAkaTHNcjGC1u25SVmBzl9M", "news_keywords": "#intell"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c44\"", "article_summary": "Last week, I was handed a coupon to a Warminster store that sells gently used toys and some new toys, too.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a lower price for toys that are just about new,\u201d said Kube, eyeing up a plastic kitchen set.\nShopping at places like RePlay Toys sheds some of the stress associated with so much spending this time of year.\nRachel Kube of Warrington has three boys and visits the store regularly to shop for sports equipment and toys.\n\u201cShe\u2019s getting two swings for less than what she would pay for one,\u201d said Antoinette Alpart, co-owner of the store."}
