And now being part of the Hall of Fame, it speaks volumes to how they feel I played the game.\u201d\n\nAdded Van Pelt: \u201cI really appreciate what Jim McElwain is doing with the program. I think he\u2019s on to something. He\u2019s regaining the excellence.\u201d\n\nOthers inducted as CSU\u2019s newest Hall of Famers were Marne Richardson (track, 1994-99), Willis Holland (wrestling, 1953-56), Ralph Hutton (swimming, 1968-71) and Allison Peckham (volleyball, 1998-2001).\n\nOops. Boise State coach Chris Petersen couldn\u2019t have been pleased with his standout running back, Jay Ajayi, in the first quarter.\n\nAjayi, a sophomore, broke into the clear on a sweep around right end and appeared to have scored untouched on an 18-yard run \u2014 except that Ajayi inexplicably stepped out of bounds on the 2-yard line.\n\nFortunately for Boise State, and especially Ajayi, the Broncos scored a play later on a keeper by quarterback Grant Hedrick.\n\nBroncos set the standard. Although Boise State entered Saturday night\u2019s game with as many as three losses in a season for the first time since the 2007 team finished 10-3, the Broncos remain the nation\u2019s winningest major-college football team since 2000.\n\nThrough Friday, Boise State had a winning percentage of .864 since 2000, topping nearest challengers Oklahoma (.819), Ohio State (.809), Texas (.787) and LSU (.782).\n\nRemaining home games. Colorado State has two more games at Hughes Stadium: Saturday vs. Nevada and Nov. 30 against Air Force.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams introduce new Hall of Fame class, including BVP and Porter", "title": "CSU Rams introduce new Hall of Fame class, including BVP and Porter", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/02/csu-rams-introduce-new-hall-of-fame-class-including-bvp-and-porter/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131103_015843_joey-porter-csu.jpg", "height": 558}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131103_015843_joey-porter-csu.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-03T01:59:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:42:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb18c\"", "article_summary": "Porter, who became an NFL all-pro with the Pittsburgh Steelers, has returned to campus to complete his degree requirements and serve as an undergraduate student assistant for the Rams football team.\nThrough Friday, Boise State had a winning percentage of .864 since 2000, topping nearest challengers Oklahoma (.819), Ohio State (.809), Texas (.787) and LSU (.782).\nBoise State coach Chris Petersen couldn\u2019t have been pleased with his standout running back, Jay Ajayi, in the first quarter.\nFortunately for Boise State, and especially Ajayi, the Broncos scored a play later on a keeper by quarterback Grant Hedrick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another one of those big honors that you\u2019re so happy that the school recognizes your talents and being one of those guys to make it to the Hall of Fame,\u201d Porter said."}
