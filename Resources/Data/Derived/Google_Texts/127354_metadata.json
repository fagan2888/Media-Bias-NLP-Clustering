At least it was the first time someone said something newsworthy from the perspective of a certain MedCity News health IT reporter.\n\nWednesday in Iowa, Hillary Clinton came out in favor of widening Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine and for solving the interstate licensure issue that has held back telemedicine. That\u2019s a huge issue to people in Iowa and other, apparently lesser, rural states that don\u2019t have early, influential presidential caucuses.\n\nAs Politico reported, Clinton said:\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s still too difficult for families in rural America to find quality, affordable healthcare. And I know many families here in Iowa are worried about even more rural hospitals closing. Telemedicine can help \u2014 and we should streamline licensing and explore how to make that reimbursable under Medicare. Here in Iowa, you just won an important victory, stopping efforts to prevent Planned Parenthood from providing telemedicine services to women who might not be able to make it to a larger city. Thousands of women in Iowa have used these services in recent years. This shouldn\u2019t have to be said, but how can anyone be advocating for denying women access to healthcare?\n\nWithout delving into the morality debate on abortion, Clinton was referring to a unanimous June decision by the Iowa Supreme Court to block a state regulation that would have banned the dispensing of abortion-inducing pills by telemedicine.\n\nClick here for a full transcript of Clinton\u2019s remarks, delivered at Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny, Iowa. If you prefer, here\u2019s a video of her complete talk. The part about healthcare starts at 30:56.\n\nPhoto: Scott Olson/Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "Finally, a 2016 presidential candidate has said something about healthcare other than repealing Obamacare (pretty much every Republican) or single-payer \"Medicare for all\" (Bernie Sanders).", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Finally, a 2016 presidential candidate has said something about healthcare other than repealing Obamacare (pretty much every Republican) or single-payer \"Medicare for all\" (Bernie Sanders).", "title": "Clinton: Expand Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-485283114.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T15:41:10-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/08/clinton-expand-medicare-reimbursement-for-telemedicine/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-485283114.jpg", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "Finally, a 2016 presidential candidate has said something about healthcare other than repealing Obamacare (pretty much every Republican) or single-payer \"Medicare for all\" (Bernie Sanders).", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinton: Expand Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,2016 presidential campaign, access to care, health politics, Hillary Clinton, Iowa, rural health, telehealth, Telemedicine, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Telemedicine", "published_time": "2015-08-27T11:29:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T15:41:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Wednesday in Iowa, Hillary Clinton came out in favor of widening Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine and for solving the interstate licensure issue that has held back telemedicine.\nFinally, a 2016 presidential candidate has said something about healthcare other than repealing Obamacare (pretty much every Republican) or single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d (Bernie Sanders).\nTelemedicine can help \u2014 and we should streamline licensing and explore how to make that reimbursable under Medicare.\nThat\u2019s a huge issue to people in Iowa and other, apparently lesser, rural states that don\u2019t have early, influential presidential caucuses.\nAs Politico reported, Clinton said:\u201c[I]t\u2019s still too difficult for families in rural America to find quality, affordable healthcare."}
