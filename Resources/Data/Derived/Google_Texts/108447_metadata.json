Tuesday's primary election might go a long way toward answering that question.\n\nNo fewer than three of the candidates near the top of the ballot have either aligned themselves with the tea party or professed agreement with such tea party principles as limited government and fiscal responsibility. Specifically, the latter tenet, says the Berrien County TEA Party Patriots, calls for spending less revenue than the amount generated by a low flat-tax rate.\n\nGOP candidates in accordance with those ideas include Jim Bussler, a Dowagiac nurse who has challenged U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph; Jim Walker, a Baroda truck driver opposing 78th District state Rep. Dave Pagel, R-Berrien Springs; and Cindy Duran, a retired nurse from St. Joseph who's going up against 79th District two-term state Rep. Al Pscholka, R-Stevensville. Although the incumbents are favored, surprises are possible, particularly if few voters turn out, as is often the case with primary elections.\n\nPagel, 59, the son-in-law of the late Lad Stacey who once held the 78th District seat, is hoping his background with the Berrien Springs school board and Berrien County Commission coupled with the experience picked up in his first two years in Lansing will work in his favor. He has experience as a business owner as well, having owned Pagel Produce for years.\n\nHe and Walker, 51, have disagreed on Common Core educational standards adopted in Michigan, with Pagel arguing all they do is set expectations for what students should learn by specific grade levels. The federal government has no role in them, he has said, a stance Walker disputed at a recent tea party meeting when he ripped Common Core for its \"liberal ideas'' and referred to it as \"communism.'' Walker, too, said, he opposes Medicaid expansion, which Pagel supported in Lansing.\n\nLike Walker, Duran, a 61-year-old grandmother, is making her first run for public office. She has been unrelenting in her criticism of Pscholka, accusing him of skirting the truth by stating he didn't vote for Common Core and flip-flopping on his position on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nPscholka, 53, the chairman of the Republican caucus, has stood his ground, arguing the Legislature had no choice on Common Core in the wake of the Democrat-controlled state Board of Education's decision four years ago to enact it. Denying its implementation would have violated the Constitution, he said, arguing there's a difference between his vote to spend money to implement the standards and a decision on the standards themselves.\n\n\"That's the actual battle, what the assessment is going to look like,'' he said.\n\nAs for the ACA, Pscholka said he \"hates'' it but voted to expand Medicaid eligibility because inaction would have been a worse option. Had the Legislature failed to act, $2 billion in taxes would have been lost to Washington, he said, adding the reforms included in the legislation have made it a model eyed by Indiana.\n\nPscholka has touted Michigan's financial gains since he was elected four years ago, pointing to a 30 percent reduction in welfare rolls, while Duran has hammered away on tax and road issues. An advocate of a part-time Legislature, she said eliminating subsidies such as the $45 million for the movie industry would free up money for roads. She also has called for gradually phasing out the state income tax.\n\n\"I'm not naive enough to believe it can be done overnight, but what a way to attract residents,'' she said. \"People are changing residences (moving out of state) because of the tax on pensions and (high) car insurance.''\n\nIn the 59th District, Matt Lori, R-Constantine, is leaving because of term limits. Looking for the GOP nod to go up against Dowagiac Democrat Mike Moroz in the fall are John Bippus, 55, an auctioneer and former three-term Three Rivers city commissioner; Roger Rathburn, 51, the recently retired superintendent of Three Rivers public schools; Aaron Miller, 27, a Sturgis resident and school teacher in the Middlebury Community Schools; and Bob Sills, 67, an Army veteran and the owner of a business solution provider.\n\nAlthough Bippus has the most government experience, Rathburn has argued his 13 years as a school superintendent would help him be a leader in Lansing. Miller has called for an end to the funds lent to bankrupt Detroit and abolishment of the state's no-fault auto insurance program while Sills has pointed to his work in Lansing with state Sen. Bruce Caswell, arguing he learned what it takes to be an effective representative.\n\nThe Pagel-Walker winner will meet Niles Democrat Cartier Shields in the fall. Shields has no primary opposition nor does Eric Lester, a retired oncologist and a resident of St. Joseph who will go up against the Pscholka-Duran winner in November.\n\nLMumford@SBTinfo.com\n\n574-876-2752", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "How strong is the tea party movement in southwest Michigan?
