When the alarmed father rushed to the baby\u2019s room, the hacker turned the camera toward the dad while still screaming \u2013 at which point the father disabled the wireless device. But the family felt completely violated by the invasion.\n\n\u201cMany available systems provide little to no security,\u201d wrote researchers at Saardland University in Germany in a new paper on how home automation systems can pose a security risk by allowing hackers to invade someone\u2019s private life. \u201c[The systems] leak information about the users\u2019 habits as well as their presence.\u201d Such information \u201ccan be abused to plan burglaries.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers, led by Christoph Sorge, conducted two real-world installations of off-the-shelf home automations systems to see how much information could be obtained by a passive malicious attacker who would attach a chip to a wireless network to monitor a home. Among the revelations: Messages from the door lock system can indicate exactly when people leave the house for work and when they return home later.\n\nRelated: Apple Plans to Turn Your House into an iHome\n\nThe researchers found that there are other implications beside the possibility of being burglarized. Insurance companies might refuse to pay damages if certain information normally thought to be secure and private was now readily available.\n\nEven encrypted communication doesn\u2019t fully protect against such attack. It is still possible, for example, to predict user presence and absence even if individual actions cannot be identified.\n\n\"As far as I know, there are currently no protective measures,\" Sorge told The Fiscal Times. \"I would advise sending additional messages during the day so it looks like there's always someone at home.\"\n\nThis article was updated on July 29.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Whether you\u2019re use home automation technology to remotely regulate the heat in your ho", "title": "The Hidden Threats from Your \u2018Smart\u2019 Home", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/28/Hidden-Threats-Your-Smart-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01132012_Smart_House_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/28/Hidden-Threats-Your-Smart-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01132012_Smart_House_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Whether you\u2019re use home automation technology to remotely regulate the heat in your ho", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf07f\"", "article_summary": "New research is increasingly finding that the smart home is actually much easier to hack into than first thought.\nInsurance companies might refuse to pay damages if certain information normally thought to be secure and private was now readily available.\nRelated: Apple Plans to Turn Your House into an iHomeThe researchers found that there are other implications beside the possibility of being burglarized.\n\"As far as I know, there are currently no protective measures,\" Sorge told The Fiscal Times.\nIt is still possible, for example, to predict user presence and absence even if individual actions cannot be identified."}
