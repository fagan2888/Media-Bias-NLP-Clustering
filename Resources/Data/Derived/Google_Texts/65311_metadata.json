The Obama administration said it made the change to reflect a 2009 court ruling that held the office is not subject to FOIA.\n\nThe ruling came from a case brought by the liberal-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) against the Bush administration for allegedly deleting more than 22 million emails the group had wanted to obtain.\n\nThe court said the office was exempt from the transparency law because it performed only operational and administrative support functions and lacked any independent authority.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, why the administration waited until Tuesday \u2013 four years after the court decision \u2013 to make the change to officially exclude the office from FOIA.\n\nRelated: Freedom of Information Act Bill Flounders\n\nA handful of other executive offices are also exempt from the law, including: the Office of the Vice President, the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Security Council, the Office of Policy Development, the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of National AIDS Policy, the National Economic Council and the President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory.\n\nThe timing of the policy revision came in the middle of Sunshine Week \u2013 a fact that unsurprisingly set off a firestorm among transparency advocates already enraged at the Obama administration for its lax of FOIA compliance.\n\n\u201cThis step makes mockery of the administration\u2019s commitment to transparency, especially given that it\u2019s Sunshine Week,\u201d Anne Weisman, executive director of CREW \u2013 the same group that brought the suit against the Bush administration \u2013 said in a statement. \u201cApparently they have abandoned even the appearance of transparency.\u201d\n\nThis year the White House set a record for censoring government files and denying access to requested information, according to an analysis by the Associated Press published Wednesday. The backlog of unanswered FOIA requests grew to more than 200,000 last year \u2013 an increase of 55 percent from the previous year. The administration reduced the number of employees tasked with responding to information requests by about 9 percent this year, the AP also noted.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest brushed off concerns about the FOIA exemption. But it comes at a time when the president\u2019s promise of greater transparency is under real scrutiny, especially given the revelations about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email account while she was Secretary of State.\n\nTwo news outlets, the Associated Press and Gawker, have filed lawsuits against the State Dept. for failing to comply with FOIA \u2013 and journalists, reformists and lawmakers are hitting the administration hard over its efforts to suppress secrets.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The administration that boldly called itself the \u201cmost transparent in history\u201d has jus", "title": "Obama\u2019s Transparency Promise Became a Big Fat Lie", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Obama-s-Transparency-Promise-Became-Big-Fat-Lie", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11062014_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Obama-s-Transparency-Promise-Became-Big-Fat-Lie", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11062014_Obama.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The administration that boldly called itself the \u201cmost transparent in history\u201d has jus", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The backlog of unanswered FOIA requests grew to more than 200,000 last year \u2013 an increase of 55 percent from the previous year.\nThe administration reduced the number of employees tasked with responding to information requests by about 9 percent this year, the AP also noted.\nOn Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest brushed off concerns about the FOIA exemption.\nThe court said the office was exempt from the transparency law because it performed only operational and administrative support functions and lacked any independent authority.\nfor failing to comply with FOIA \u2013 and journalists, reformists and lawmakers are hitting the administration hard over its efforts to suppress secrets."}
