I was forced to take money out of my 401(k) to make ends meet during the year and that raised my income level. Now I face having to pay back $1,500 for premium tax credits I received to subsidize my marketplace plan\u2019s premiums. What am I supposed to do?\n\nA: It\u2019s not uncommon for people to fail to count one-time income bumps from retirement savings or other sources when they\u2019re estimating their annual income to qualify for advance premium tax credits for marketplace coverage, said Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\n\nIn the case of retirement savings, \u201cthey\u2019re not thinking of it as income because it\u2019s their own money,\u201d she said. But since retirement money is generally deposited on a pretax basis, it counts as income when it\u2019s withdrawn and can affect how much people qualify for in premium tax credits.\n\nIt\u2019s important to go back to the marketplace and report any income changes, including one-time changes, as soon as they occur to minimize repayment problems down the road, Straw said.\n\nAbout half of people who received advance premium tax credits in 2014 got too much, the Internal Revenue Service reported, based on the tax forms people filed to reconcile how much they received against how much they should have gotten.\n\nThe amount that people have to repay is capped for those whose income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000 for one person).\n\n\u201cThe repayment caps are really helpful in cases like this when something unexpected occurs or where an error was made,\u201d Straw said. However, taxpayers can still be on the hook for significant amounts, up to $1,250 for single taxpayers and $2,500 for couples and families, she said.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay what you owe right away, the IRS will allow you to pay in installments, but there may be additional fees and interest charges.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.
