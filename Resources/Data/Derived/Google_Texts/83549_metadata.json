But the heavily polished and unquestionably sharp candidate has already refined an ability to sprinkle his answers to just about any question with a healthy dose of focus-group-tested phrases.\n\nPromising to deliver \u201ccommon-sense solutions that will help middle-class families\u201d was one favored refrain that he dropped on multiple occasions during the 25-minute interview.\n\nCanada-born and Ohio-raised, Eldridge\u2019s nascent campaign in upstate New York got off to an inauspicious start when the New York Times published an unfavorable story in July about his recent home-buying habits.\n\nThat piece brought to light Eldridge and Hughes\u2019 house-hunting exploits in the Hudson Valley: The young couple purchased a $5 million estate in the town of Garrison in 2011, but then settled earlier this year on a $2 million home in a neighboring district -- that just so happened to offer a more attainable House seat.\n\nIn the interview with RCP, Eldridge (pictured above, at right, with Hughes) said the district-shopping charge is \u201cuntrue,\u201d pointing to his work with Hudson River Ventures -- the investment fund that he started in 2011, which has since helped grow 15 small businesses in the area.\n\n\u201cI was investing in this region long before I became a candidate, and I chose to live here and start my company here because I think it\u2019s an incredible place to live,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the moment he emerged on their radar screen, national Republicans have been licking their chops at the prospect of taking on Eldridge, \u201ca carpet-bagging multimillionaire who\u2019s a good friend of Nancy Pelosi and wants to hang out with her at swank D.C. cocktail parties with a little pin that says \u2018Member of Congress,\u2019\u201d as New York Republican Party communications director David Laska put it recently.\n\nEarlier this month, the National Republican Congressional Committee engaged in a bit of mischief-making by submitting an anti-Eldridge advertisement to The New Republic -- the magazine owned by Hughes.\n\nPredictably, the publication declined to run the ad, and Eldridge suggested that the stunt was emblematic of the glib manner in which his opponents have chosen to target him.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I\u2019ve gotten into this race, they\u2019ve been focused on distractions exactly like that, rather than on the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to focus on those personal attacks because they don\u2019t want to talk about how Congressman Gibson has voted to end Medicare as we know it, defund Planned Parenthood, or to shut down the government, or to cut critical environmental protections which are very important to our region.\u201d\n\nTo counter the elitist, jet-setting image of him that Republicans have been eager to perpetuate, Eldridge takes pains to emphasize that he attended public schools in a small town outside of Toledo.\n\nRather than mention that his parents are physicians, a fact that was noted in his splashy 2012 wedding announcement in The New York Times, he prefers to talk about how his father was the first in his family to attend high school.\n\n\u201cI come from a modest background, and that has certainly shaped my perspective on how important it is to fight for middle-class families,\u201d he said.\n\nEldridge has honed an anti-Washington message, which is being echoed by congressional challengers from coast to coast with heightened emphasis in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown.\n\nRunning in a swing district that will be among the nation\u2019s most closely watched in next year\u2019s midterms, Eldridge has vowed to be an independent voice on Capitol Hill. In the interview, he declined to say whether he would support Nancy Pelosi for speaker if Democrats retake control of the House.\n\nRepublicans protest that this claim of political independence reeks of insincerity, given that Eldridge is a partially self-funded candidate whose campaign coffers have also been filled by some of the most prominent members of the Hollywood-New York-Washington axis of progressive elites, with whom he and his husband frequently rub shoulders.\n\nBut there is at least one area in which Eldridge is particularly eager to break from the party line.\n\nAsked to name a policy position that runs counter to that of the Democratic leadership, he delivered a stern rebuke to the Obama administration for its bungled rollout of the national health care reform law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very frustrated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are a lot of important elements of the Affordable Care Act, and I think it\u2019s critical that every single American has access to quality, affordable health care. But I\u2019m very frustrated that the Obama administration has not been able to roll out the Affordable Care Act smoothly, and obviously these problems with the website and enrollment are serious challenges.\u201d\n\nTrue to his otherwise circumspect approach, however, Eldridge declined to say whether he would have voted for the bill, knowing what he does now about its implementation, had he been a member of Congress in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to speculate on something when I wasn\u2019t there and wasn\u2019t in the room and didn\u2019t have an opportunity to vote on it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what I would say now moving forward is that I would not vote more than 40 times, as my opponent has, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats in the 19th District have begun to pick up the distinct whiff of a perilously flawed candidate in Eldridge, and The Daily Star, an upstate newspaper, reported that local Democratic attorney Frank Steinherr is eyeing a potential primary challenge to him.\n\nBut Eldridge\u2019s formidable strengths as a well-financed, eloquent messenger with powerful friends in the Democratic Party remain obvious.\n\nThough he has already contributed nearly $500,000 to his House bid, Eldridge has made campaign finance reform a key part of his platform, advocating for more transparency in the system, greater enforcement of the existing rules, and a small-dollar matching-funds system for congressional races.\n\nAnd having served as a senior adviser for Freedom to Marry -- a group that helped lead the successful 2011 charge for legalized same-sex marriage in New York -- his credibility among progressives on this key issue is ironclad.\n\nEldridge touts his leadership on same-sex marriage on his campaign website but made no mention in his announcement video of his marriage to Hughes -- an unusual omission for any candidate introducing himself to would-be constituents.\n\nInstead, he referred to the Hudson Valley as the place where he is building \u201cmy family, my home, and my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that my marriage to Chris is a pretty well-known fact about me,\u201d Eldridge explained. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly in the vast majority of articles that are written. In the announcement video, we were really focused on telling my story and talking about some of the elements of my background that aren\u2019t as well known.\u201d\n\nEldridge said that he felt \u201cpersonally indebted to the countless activists\u201d who have moved the country forward on LGBT issues and other matters of equality in recent years and added his view that Hillary Clinton would be \u201ca great president.\u201d\n\nHe declined to offer a timeline when asked when the country might be ready to elect its first openly gay president, but did not hesitate in saying why that person would not be him:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you an important fact on that front, which is I was born in Montreal, Canada, so it\u2019s not something you ever have to worry about. We\u2019re very much focused on this race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He may be a 27-year-old, first-time political candidate, but Sean Eldridge doesn't come across like one.\nIn an interview with RealClearPolitics this week, Eldridge -- the husband of Facebook...", "title": "Ambitious Sean Eldridge Polishes His Message | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/11/14/ambitious_sean_eldridge_polishes_his_message.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/216295_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "He may be a 27-year-old, first-time political candidate, but Sean Eldridge doesn't come across like one.\nIn an interview with RealClearPolitics this week, Eldridge -- the husband of Facebook...", "title": "Ambitious Sean Eldridge Polishes His Message | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TomBevanRCP", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Ambitious Sean Eldridge Polishes His Message | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Sean Eldridge,Election 2014,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea13\"", "article_summary": "By Scott Conroy - November 14, 2013He may be a 27-year-old, first-time political candidate, but Sean Eldridge doesn't come across like one.\n\u201cI\u2019m very frustrated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\nBut there is at least one area in which Eldridge is particularly eager to break from the party line.\nEldridge has honed an anti-Washington message, which is being echoed by congressional challengers from coast to coast with heightened emphasis in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown.\n\u201cI think there are a lot of important elements of the Affordable Care Act, and I think it\u2019s critical that every single American has access to quality, affordable health care."}
