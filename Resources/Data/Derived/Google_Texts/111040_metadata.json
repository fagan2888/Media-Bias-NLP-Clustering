Doing this can save you substantial recruiting time and legwork, and can also benefit all other members of the organization.\n\nPlan for the future\n\nCreate an organization chart that identifies employee duties. This is a key element to sustainable long-term planning. Being able to access this structure at a glance, and adding benchmarks to help you recognize the need for modifications to this structure, enables you to analyze whether your practice is poised to handle its current and projected workload. It also allows you to proactively shift employees and duties to meet your future needs now rather than correcting problems later.\n\nThink outside the benefits box\n\nWith the advent of the Affordable Care Act, thinking outside the benefits box has become an even more vital skill for successful health care HR managers. Identifying superior alternatives to many of the traditional employer insurance plans, as well as implementing new technology to help manage and oversee these alternatives, are two ways you can vastly improve the financial stability of your dental practice and the overall happiness of your employees.\n\nAbout DentistryIQ\n\nDentistryIQ provides dental professionals worldwide with a comprehensive collection of information on what is happening in the dental industry.
