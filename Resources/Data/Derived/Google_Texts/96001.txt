The Philadelphia Police Department says it has charged a man for stabbing another man to death and also injuring a woman.

Philadelphia Police Chief Grant Myers tells Newscenter 11 it happened around 11:00 Saturday night at a home on Hopson Avenue. Myers says it appears a domestic dispute led 33-year old Demetric Gray to stab 40-year old Zuave Trice of Georgia multiple times. Trice died at the scene.

Myers says Gray also stabbed a woman in the arm. She was taken to UMC in Jackson for treatment. Her condition is unknown at this time.

Investigators have now charged Gray with murder, as well as domestic violence and aggravated assault. Myers says Gray was found a short time after the incident in a ditch near the home.
