CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) - Clemson defensive back Adrian Baker is out for rest of spring after tearing an ACL during practice last week.

Tigers coach Dabo Swinney said Baker injured the ligament last Saturday. Baker was expected to provide critical depth in the secondary after three of Clemsonâ€™s starters there last year - cornerback Mackensie Alexander and safeties Jayron Kearse and T.J. Green - gave up the rest of their college eligibility for the NFL draft.

Swinney said he expected Baker to attack the rehab and perhaps be in the mix for the Tigers by September.

Baker is a junior who played in 12 games last season, making 13 tackles and two interceptions.
