The Demonstration is testing whether home-based care can reduce the need for hospitalization, improve patient and caregiver satisfaction, and lead to better health and lower costs to Medicare. The Demonstration is part of the new framework established by the Affordable Care Act, which moves away from a fee-for-service payment model towards one that rewards doctors based on the quality, not the quantity, of care they give patients. CMS aims to use alternative payment models to tie 30 percent of Medicare payments to quality and value by 2016, and to so tie 50 percent of payments by 2018.\n\nAccordingly, the Demonstration focuses on one of the costliest areas of Medicare spending: the chronically ill. According to Bruce Kinosian, an associate professor of geriatric medicine at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, chronically ill patients represent only \u201c5 percent of [all] Medicare beneficiaries\u201d but \u201cdrive nearly 50 percent of Medicare spending.\u201d The Demonstration hopes to build on the benefits that home-based primary health care already provides for Medicare beneficiaries. Participating providers conduct in-home visits that allows them to assess the needs of, and tailor care for, chronically ill patients \u2013 a task that often cannot be completed in a traditional \u201c15 minute\u201d office check-up.

For example, health care providers can conduct spot checks for tripping hazards, ensure that the patient\u2019s refrigerator is stocked with healthy food, or check the patient\u2019s medicine bottles to make sure that the pills are being taken correctly. House visits can also include high-tech equipment so that practitioners can check for on-the-spot health problems.

CMS also sets other quality measures to monitor the planning, implementation and performance of the Demonstration activities. Those quality measures are not tied to the incentive payments. Further details about the program can be found on CMS\u2019s website or in the Independence at Home Demonstration solicitation.\n\nLast month, CMS announced the results from the first performance year of the Demonstration. CMS found that the project saved over $25 million in the first Demonstration year, and that $11.7 million in incentive payments would be paid to nine participating practices. This translates to an average of $3,070 per beneficiary. All 17 participating practices improved quality in at least three of the six quality measures, and four practices met all six quality measures.\n\nThe Senate has passed a two-year extension of this Demonstration, and the House of Representatives is currently considering a similar bill.\n\nThis post was written by Shruti Barker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CMS implemented the Independence at Home Demonstration program testing whether home based care can reduce the need for hospitalization, improve patient and caregiver satisfaction,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) implemented the Independence at Home Demonstration program in January 2012.&amp;nbsp; The Demonstration is testing whether home-based care can reduce t", "title": "The Independence at Home Demonstration Project Completes its First Year and Saves over $25 Million", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/independence-home-demonstration-project-completes-its-first-year-and-saves-over-25-m", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/health%20care%20money_0.jpg?itok=-JUyn4Gd", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "CMS, Medicare, Medicaid, independence at Home Demonstration Program, reduce, hospitalization, patient, caregiver, satisfaction, reduce costs", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Health, government, CMS, Medicare, Medicaid, independence at Home Demonstration Program, reduce, hospitalization, patient, caregiver,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03b0\"", "article_summary": "All 17 participating practices improved quality in at least three of the six quality measures, and four practices met all six quality measures.\nWednesday, July 1, 2015The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) implemented the Independence at Home Demonstration program in January 2012.\nCMS found that the project saved over $25 million in the first Demonstration year, and that $11.7 million in incentive payments would be paid to nine participating practices.\nCMS also sets other quality measures to monitor the planning, implementation and performance of the Demonstration activities.\nThe Demonstration provides incentive payments to practices that meet these six quality measures while still generating a minimum amount of Medicare savings."}
