The restaurant is one of the few establishments taking part in the Charleston\u2019s soft-closings program.\n\nMichael Feldman, owner of Smoke BBQ, jumped at the chance to keep his business open until 3 a.m., even though he still has to stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many late-night places to eat in the city\u2019s entertainment district, he said. And he\u2019s going to be one of the few to feed the late night revelers before they jump into their cars and head home, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, the city of Charleston moved ahead with a 90-day pilot project to allow bars in the peninsula\u2019s entertainment district \u2014 which includes portions of Meeting, King and East Bay streets and the Market area \u2014 to stay open an extra hour, without serving alcohol. The effort, called \u201csoft closings,\u201d is aimed at increasing public safety by ensuring that not all bargoers pour out into the street at the same time. It\u2019s part of a larger plan to better manage late night activity in the city.\n\nLt. Heath King, with the Charleston Police Department, said only five businesses so far have asked to be part of the pilot, which runs through Dec. 8. And only three of them have actually selected dates to begin doing it, he said. That list includes Smoke, Boone\u2019s Bar and the Upper Deck Tavern. All of those businesses are on King Street.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a full menu,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep going until 2:45 a.m., then get everyone out by 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nBut the pilot plan has a few issues, he said. It requires bar owners to not only remove all the alcohol before 2 a.m., but they also must turn on the lights to their brightest level and turn off the music. And they can\u2019t allow in any patrons who weren\u2019t already inside before 2 a.m.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what most bar owners complain about,\u201d Feldman said of the restrictions. \u201cI\u2019m not fond of them either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people still will be eating food.\u201d\n\nHe hopes that the city will consider amending the rules after the 90-day pilot is complete. And he\u2019s pleased the city is trying something new. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to be the guinea pigs,\u201d he said.\n\nCity Councilman Dean Riegel, who was a strong opponent of an earlier plan to rein in rowdy late night bar patrons by placing a moratorium on new establishments that serve alcohol after midnight, said he\u2019s disappointed with the low rate of participation in the pilot program. \u201cI thought soft closings would be very welcome, very well received.\u201d\n\nThe city will revisit the issue after the 90-day pilot is over, he said, and decide if it should continue the plan as it is, modify it, or drop the idea entirely.\n\nHe thinks the restrictions might be getting in the way of the program being successful, especially requiring businesses to turn on bright lights and turn off the music. \u201cThat takes away all the ambiance,\u201d he said, \u201cthe reason for hanging around.\u201d\n\nReach Diane Knich at 937-5491 or on Twitter @dianeknich.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bars show little enthusiasm for Charleston soft closings, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston Police Department,Entertainment District,King Street,Meeting Street,Smoke BBQ,soft closing", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Michael Feldman, owner of Smoke BBQ, jumped at the chance to keep his business open until 3 a.m., even though he still has to stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m.", "title": "Bars show little enthusiasm for Charleston soft closings", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151003/151009810/bars-show-little-enthusiasm-for-charleston-soft-closings", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151003/pc16/151009810/AR/0/AR-151009810.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151003/pc16/151009810/AR/0/AR-151009810.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Feldman, owner of Smoke BBQ, jumped at the chance to keep his business open until 3 a.m., even though he still has to stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m.", "title": "Bars show little enthusiasm for Charleston soft closings", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151003/pc16/151009810/AR/0/AR-151009810.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151009810}}, "keywords": "Bars show little enthusiasm for Charleston soft closings , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston Police Department,Entertainment District,King Street,Meeting Street,Smoke BBQ,soft closing", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T13:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T20:23:00Z", "author": "Diane Knich"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Michael Feldman, owner of Smoke BBQ, jumped at the chance to keep his business open until 3 a.m., even though he still has to stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1229\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ll just keep going until 2:45 a.m., then get everyone out by 3 a.m.\u201dBut the pilot plan has a few issues, he said.\nAnd he\u2019s going to be one of the few to feed the late night revelers before they jump into their cars and head home, he said.\nIt\u2019s part of a larger plan to better manage late night activity in the city.\nThe effort, called \u201csoft closings,\u201d is aimed at increasing public safety by ensuring that not all bargoers pour out into the street at the same time.\nAlicia Modoor tends bar at Smoke BBQ this summer at 487 King Street."}
