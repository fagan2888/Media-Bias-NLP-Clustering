Dr. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in Massachusetts and the American Affordable Care Act. REUTERS/Dominick Reuter (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS BUSINESS) - RTR3GTMP\n\n4403507\n\nInfamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber told people not to read Obamacare, admitted he never knew how to control costs in the law and said he designed it by \u201cthrowing stuff at the wall\u201d in one of his most characteristic public speeches. In between taking personal shots at conservatives, he actually thanked congressional Democrats for voting against their constituents.\n\nAs Gruber faces the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Tuesday morning, here are some classic Gruber-ish quotes from a San Francisco podcast appearance in January 2012:\n\nObama lied about the law and told congressmen to vote against their constituents\u2019 wishes:\n\n\u201cI wish that President Obama could have stood up and said, \u2018You know, I don\u2019t know if this bill is going to control costs. It might, it might not. We\u2019re doing our best. But let me tell you what it\u2019s going to do\u2026\u201d (goes on to explain that some people would die without insurance) (49:55)\n\n\u201cIf he could make that speech? Instead, he says \u2018I\u2019m going to pass a bill that will lower your health care costs.\u2019 That sells. Now, I wish the world was different. I wish people cared about the 50 million uninsured in America\u2026But, you know, they don\u2019t. And I think, once again, I\u2019m amazed politically that we got this bill through.\n\nI mean, we actually asked many politicians to vote against their self-interest. Against what their constituents were telling them, to really do the right thing. And I think they deserve our support and applause for doing that.\u201d (51:04)\n\nSuper-Genius Jonathan Gruber Doesn\u2019t Know That Much About Sports\n\n\u201cAnd to deny this bill because it doesn\u2019t do enough to control health care costs is like criticizing the Giants, the San Francisco Giants, because they didn\u2019t win the Super Bowl.\u201d (29:00)\n\nSeconds later, he calls conservatives stupid\n\nPeople don\u2019t understand this bill\u2026I don\u2019t expect to convince people who think that President Obama was born in Kenya. I\u2019m not going to convince those people.\u201d (29:30)\n\nHe tells people not to read the law (this might be a good one to bring up at the Oversight \u201ctransparency\u201d hearing):\n\n\u201cNonetheless, if you read the Affordable Care Act, which I recommend you do not\u2026\u201d (21:40)\n\nHe didn\u2019t know how to keep costs down so he just came up with a bunch of random stuff:\n\n\u201cYou get demagogued. You get shouted down by people making stuff up. Even if we KNEW how to control health care costs, we couldn\u2019t do it politically. So what do you do? You\u2019re President Obama and the Congress. You promised you\u2019re going to control health care costs\u2026Your pollsters have told you that the American public doesn\u2019t actually care about insurance coverage, all they care about is health care cost\u2026What do you do? Well, you do what I like to think of as sort of a \u201cspaghetti approach.\u201d Throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and see what sticks.\u201d (22:30)\n\nTakes a personal shot at Newt Gingrich\n\n\u201cThe Newt Gingrich approach, which is repudiate everything. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean it.\u2019 Whatever. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to be married to her.\u2019 Whatever\u2026\u201d(54:50)\n\nNo shortage of self-esteem\n\n\u201cIn terms of opinions, they\u2019re opinions. And, um, I like to think I have an informed opinion. I like my opinion. But, they\u2019re opinions. I don\u2019t really know if I can point you to places that I like a whole lot better.\u201d (54:10)\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "'That sells'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Infamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber told people not to read Obamacare, admitted he never knew how to control costs in the law and said he designed it by \"throwing stuff at the wall\" in one of", "title": "Jonathan Gruber ADMITTED That Obama Lied\u2026They Knew It Would Not Control Costs!", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/08/jonathan-gruber-admitted-that-obama-lied-they-knew-it-would-not-control-costs/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/J-Grubs.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'That sells'", "title": "Jonathan Gruber ADMITTED That Obama Lied\u2026They Knew It Would Not Control Costs!
