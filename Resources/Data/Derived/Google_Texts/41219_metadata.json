(AP) \u2014 The departure of one New Jersey resident to Florida has gotten so much attention that lawmakers are calling for changing the state\u2019s tax structure, and a key legislative forecaster is raising concerns over revenue uncertainty.\n\nThe spotlight turned to hedge fund manager David Tepper this week when legislative budget forecaster Frank Haines cited the billionaire\u2019s move to Florida as a potential factor in how much income tax revenue the state brings in. Income tax revenues make up the biggest share of cash in state coffers, and a shift in projections of as little as 1 percent amounts to about $100 million, forecasters say.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much effect Tepper\u2019s departure could have, because his tax returns haven\u2019t been made public and it\u2019s unknown how much taxes affected his move. Tepper didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment.\n\nBut his move has caught the attention of the usually headline-shy legislative budget office.\n\n\u201cIf a very wealthy individual \u2014 potentially a significant taxpayer to the state \u2014 relocates and relocates not only as we\u2019ve been reading about it but really relocates for tax purposes \u2026 beyond our reach, then that\u2019s something to be aware of,\u201d said Haines, the legislative and budget finance officer.\n\nTepper\u2019s move spurred Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick to call for an overhaul of the state\u2019s tax system.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey can\u2019t afford to keep losing taxpayers and businesses,\u201d Bramnick said.\n\nNew Jersey has the lowest estate exemption level in the country at $675,000, affecting about 3,500 residents in 2014. New Jersey is one of only two states to levy both an estate and inheritance tax, and has a top income tax rate of 8.97 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Billionaire\u2019s move puts New Jersey tax rates in spotlight", "title": "Billionaire\u2019s move puts New Jersey tax rates in spotlight", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/10/billionaires_move_puts_new_jersey_tax_rates_in_spotlight/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Billionaire\u2019s move puts New Jersey tax rates in spotlight", "title": "Billionaire\u2019s move puts New Jersey tax rates in spotlight"}, "twitter": {"description": "Billionaire\u2019s move puts New Jersey tax rates in spotlight", "title": "Billionaire\u2019s move puts New Jersey tax rates in spotlight", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Michael Catalini", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Tepper\u2019s move spurred Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick to call for an overhaul of the state\u2019s tax system.\nNew Jersey is one of only two states to levy both an estate and inheritance tax, and has a top income tax rate of 8.97 percent.\nThe spotlight turned to hedge fund manager David Tepper this week when legislative budget forecaster Frank Haines cited the billionaire\u2019s move to Florida as a potential factor in how much income tax revenue the state brings in.\nBut his move has caught the attention of the usually headline-shy legislative budget office.\nIncome tax revenues make up the biggest share of cash in state coffers, and a shift in projections of as little as 1 percent amounts to about $100 million, forecasters say."}
