If you\u2019re like me, that will pop to mind about April 1. And then maybe you\u2019ll actually get around to doing them with a few days to spare until the April 15 deadline.\n\nSo why do we procrastinate? Lots of reasons come to mind for me, one of which is the fact that by April, I have no idea where many of my tax documents are. That means contacting financial institutions and dredging up W-2s at the office. Yuck.\n\nBut if you act soon, this year\u2019s endeavour could be somewhat simpler.\n\nFiling before you file\n\nThe first step is figuring out a filing system \u2014 filing in the organizational sense.\n\n\u201cIf they have everything together in one central location as they go through the year, it\u2019s a lot easier at the end of the year,\u201d said Jimmy Pendergrass, partner at Pratas Smith & Moore LLC. \u201cPut that in a file or central location as soon as they see it, so they\u2019re not having to touch it several times. If they put it in that one place, it\u2019ll be there when they\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nSome people use expanding files, he said, but he\u2019s seen everything from shoe boxes to paper sacks. The important thing, he said, is just keeping it together:\n\n\u201cThe better organized they are, the better it is for them and the less time is it for us.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a question about whether a document is needed, Pendergrass said, keep it and let your tax adviser make that determination.\n\nSeparate into categories\n\nIf you plan to itemize your deductions, you\u2019ll need a way to separate all of your receipts by category. And depending on your circumstance, there could be hundreds of receipts to work with.\n\nThat\u2019s why, from a tax preparer\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s easier if a client comes in with receipts and forms separated, said Les McGrew, district manager for H&R Block.\n\n\u201cDifferent people have different ways of doing it,\u201d McGrew said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people bring all their receipts in in big paper bags. If they\u2019re itemizing deductions, total it up by category. If they\u2019re filing on their own, a lot of people have their own ways of filing. If they\u2019re itemizing, it\u2019s nice if they have it all separated.\u201d\n\nAnd how many forms should there be?\n\n\u201cIt depends on the situation,\u201d McGrew said. \u201cIf they have a lot of medical expenses, that could require a whole lot of different forms and receipts. With mortgage expenses, it\u2019s usually just a few.\u201d\n\nThe good news is most people nowadays don\u2019t itemize their deductions, so the odds are good you won\u2019t have to keep a year\u2019s worth of receipts organized in order to do your taxes.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people can itemize anymore,\u201d McGrew said, \u201cIt\u2019s happening less and less because of the standard deduction. That\u2019s been going up every year for the last 30 years. You just take the bigger deduction of the two.\u201d\n\nDo you have everything?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have your tax documents already, you should receive them soon.\n\n\u201cProbably mid-January, some will start coming in,\u201d Pendergrass said, \u201cbut they may be coming in as late as late February, early March.\u201d\n\nMcGrew said employers are required to issue W-2s no later than Jan. 31, but many do so earlier.\n\nThe IRS starts accepting tax returns on Jan. 20.\n\nPendergrass said there\u2019s no way of knowing if you have received every document you need, but offered a clue:\n\n\u201cThey should know the majority of what they should expect to receive by what they\u2019re invested in,\u201d he said.\n\nHow do you tell whether that letter from your bank is a normal account statement or something you need to keep for your taxes?\n\n\u201cMost of the time, employers or anyone else that sends out documents will put on there \u2018For tax return purposes,\u2019 \u201d McGrew said.\n\nBut if you\u2019re concerned or simply unsure that you have all the documents you need, you may benefit from some help.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how complicated their return is,\u201d McGrew said. \u201cSometimes they need to get with a tax professional and figure out.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind\n\nOne thing that will be new in preparing this year\u2019s taxes is the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cA very big factor will be the Affordable Care Act, and a lot of people are not aware of that,\u201d McGrew said. \u201cSo-called \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 although we\u2019re not supposed to call it that anymore, basically is reconciled on our tax returns.\u201d\n\nIf a person or family purchased marketplace insurance and their actual income was different than they estimated, that\u2019s reconciled by the government, McGrew explained. That means you could either owe a penalty or you could have an additional refund.\n\nWhen asked for tips for people who want to file their own tax returns, McGrew\u2019s response was simple: \u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, I\u2019d advise them not to.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who\u2019ve been doing it by themselves will be going to a tax service this year,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they are going to do it themselves, they need to make sure they read very carefully what they\u2019re putting in there. If they\u2019re not sure (what a tax program is asking for), do a little research for what that actually means. I\u2019ve seen a lot come in that we\u2019ve had to amend.\u201d\n\nglenys.young@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8747\n\nFollow Glenys on Twitter @GlenysYoung", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Life, GLENYS YOUNG", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "In the first week of January, most people reading this probably aren't thinking about doing their taxes.
