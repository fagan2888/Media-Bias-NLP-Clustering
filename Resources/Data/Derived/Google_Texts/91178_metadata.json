They\u2019re hands free and consist of two 1-inch long ear buds that aren\u2019t connected by a cable or wire, and are easy to pop into your ears.\n\nSplit was developed by a company named Greenwing Audio, founded by a physicist, a biologist, and a mechanical engineer who hope to \u201cenlighten the portable audio market with safer and better performing wireless products,\u201d according to their website.\n\nOn its Kickstarter page, which hopes to gather $435,000 by Oct. 31, the company describes how the device works: when music plays, the earphones act like two individual players that are synched. Short radio signals keep the earphones synchronized when the track or volume is changed.\n\nWhile one bite skips tracks, two bites adjusts the volume. In order to avoid accidentally changing the track or volume when chewing or eating, users can \u201clock\u201d the earphones by tapping them with your finger.\n\nThe company claims that the amount of radiation exposed to your head will be 1,000 times lower when using Split as compared to a Bluetooth streaming headset.\n\n\u201cWe designed Split with one goal: To make it a non invasive presence in your life, so that you can carry music with you as you would carry two coins in your pocket,\u201d the company explains.\n\nThe storage space on Split would be quite small \u2014 it would only able to hold about 24 songs at once, with a 4 hour battery life \u2014 but the device could be ideal for workouts or bike rides, when shuffling through your iPod while exercising could break your focus.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to completely reinvent the design and usability of the portable music player,\u201d the company writes on its website.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "split, earphones, music player, greenwing audio", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A tech company has developed a handless listening device that changes tracks at the click of your teeth.", "title": "Tiny MP3 Player, \u2018Split,\u2019 Controlled By Clicking Your Teeth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tiny-mp3-player-split-controlled-clicking-your-teeth-seeks-funding-kickstarter-259074", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/05/ear.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A tech company has developed a handless listening device that changes tracks at the click of your teeth.", "title": "Tiny MP3 Player, \u2018Split,\u2019 Controlled By Clicking Your Teeth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tiny-mp3-player-split-controlled-clicking-your-teeth-seeks-funding-kickstarter-259074", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/05/ear.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/05/ear.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-10-05T14:03:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-05T14:03:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A tech company has developed a handless listening device that changes tracks at the click of your teeth."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2900\"", "article_summary": "\u2026stephanie\u2026, Creative CommonsA new listening device developed by a tech company will allow a person to listen to music simply by clicking their teeth to change tracks.\nSplit earbuds are developed to fit snugly in your ears without being connected to a cable.\n\u201cOur goal is to completely reinvent the design and usability of the portable music player,\u201d the company writes on its website.\nThe earphones, known as \u201cSplit,\u201d are individual buds and are not connected by any cable and wire, but are synchronized to play in unison through high precision crystal clocks.\nThey\u2019re hands free and consist of two 1-inch long ear buds that aren\u2019t connected by a cable or wire, and are easy to pop into your ears."}
