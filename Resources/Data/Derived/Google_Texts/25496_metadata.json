The war in Iraq destabilized the Middle East and the outcome in Afghanistan is not certain.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis triggered massive government intervention, damaged the middle class and exacerbated an income gap that\u2019s been growing since the 1970s.\n\nThe rapid rise of China, a military rival with the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a seemingly insatiable appetite for energy and industrial materials, has put America\u2019s No. 1 ranking at risk.\n\nA less resilient economy might have permanently been knocked off its pedestal, but America is not that easy to count out.\n\nLately, things have turned around a bit for the U.S. on several fronts:\n\n\u2022 We are leading the industrialized world with solid, if unspectacular, GDP growth. Our federal deficit seems under control and our economy, at least by some measures, is again closing in on full employment.\n\n\u2022 The Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy moves are creating opportunities for global companies. Movements toward more normal relations with Iran and Cuba, which are gaining momentum, could shift the balance of economic power in the Middle East and Latin America.\n\n\u2022 The president\u2019s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, though recently stymied by disagreements over agriculture subsidies and other details, has the potential to do the same for his \u201cpivot to Asia.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At home, our entrepreneurial culture is alive and well. Innovations in tech-autonomous vehicles, the sharing economy (Uber, Airbnb, etc.) and the Internet of things still come largely from the U.S. The talk is of a new \u201cfab five\u201d \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix \u2014 companies capable of massive disruption with powerful global brands.\n\n\u2022 Energy choices abound, especially for North America. And the U.S. has reasserted itself in the climate change debate with President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, one that will abandon dirty coal in favor of natural gas as a bridge fuel to renewables.\n\nA closer look at the potential effects of the Cuban and Iran initiatives is particularly revealing. Both countries have highly educated populations with much economic potential.\n\nCuba is a tiny economy with a GDP of $70 billion but the potential to be three or four times larger. On a GDP per capita basis, the U.S. is at about $54,600, while Cuba is around $10,200, based on 2010 data adjusted for currency fluctuations. Moreover, realignment with Cuba could open the door to struggling but much larger Venezuela and blunt the Chinese overtures to Ecuador.\n\nIran is more of a regional heavyweight. It is the second-largest economy in the Middle East behind Saudi Arabia and second in population after Egypt. Years of sanctions mean it too has a very small GDP per capita, around $14,600 (2014 estimate) and is badly in need of technology and upgrades.\n\nWe will leave the foreign policy issues of engagement vs. continued sanctions to others. From an economic perspective, engagement with Iran has the potential to dramatically shift economic power in the region.\n\nLocally, technology centers like Colorado\u2019s Front Range are proving that innovation is still America\u2019s fort\u00e9. An energy resurgence \u2014 led by Colorado\u2019s unique blend of cleaner fossil fuels and renewables \u2014 has given the U.S. a powerful new card to play on the world stage. Moving toward a global consensus on climate change and trade could do much for our state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe bottom line is that global leadership is not America\u2019s birthright. Rather, it is a big responsibility that must be earned and re-earned each generation.\n\nIn a chat with Charlie Rose, New York Times columnist Tom Friedman talked about Obama as a risk-taker who is not afraid to look for game-changing solutions. The U.S. might be on the cusp of changing the game.\n\nAn America that has successfully managed two large threats \u2014 Cuba and Iran \u2014 and restored a modicum of balance to its Middle East policy would be a powerful nation, one that is better equipped to exert its economic heft in a multipolar world.\n\nLloyd Blankfein, CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs, recently talked to business magnate Michael Bloomberg about China\u2019s \u201chuge execution problem\u201d and the inefficiencies inherent when central planning and not markets allocate capital.\n\nOur emerging entrepreneurial economy may fuel a resurgence that keeps our GDP per capita far ahead of China\u2019s $12,900 (2014 estimate) for many decades. Let\u2019s not forget that China has just experienced a stock market meltdown that\u2019s been compared to Wall Street\u2019s 1929 crash.\n\nEras do not fall neatly into century demarcations. But if the 20th century belonged to America \u2014 and there were bad decades in that century for America, like the 1930s \u2014 then the 21st century belongs to the global economy. With foresight, prudence and pluck, and a determination to not just accept the future, but to also shape it, this century could provide plenty of good decades for the United States.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A glass-half-full look at America\u2019s position in the world", "title": "A glass-half-full look at America\u2019s position in the world", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/07/a-glass-half-full-look-at-americas-position-in-the-world/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150807__20150809_Z00_OP09P_DUBROFFp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150807__20150809_Z00_OP09P_DUBROFFp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-07T14:48:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:51:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a37\"", "article_summary": "The war in Iraq destabilized the Middle East and the outcome in Afghanistan is not certain.\nIt is the second-largest economy in the Middle East behind Saudi Arabia and second in population after Egypt.\nBoth countries have highly educated populations with much economic potential.\nFifteen years into the 21st century, there are huge questions about America\u2019s role in the world.\nBut if the 20th century belonged to America \u2014 and there were bad decades in that century for America, like the 1930s \u2014 then the 21st century belongs to the global economy."}
