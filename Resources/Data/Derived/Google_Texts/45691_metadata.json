Don\u2019t take me to the hospital!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all Joel Urzua could think about when the police officer asked if he needed medical assistance. Uruza had just been rear-ended hard by a drunk driver on a Los Angeles freeway.\n\nUruza was so disoriented he couldn\u2019t remember his last name, but he could remember one thing\u2026 he didn\u2019t have health insurance, and costly hospital bills could ruin him.\n\n\u201cI lied and told them I was fine,\u201d Uruza said. Uruza is a former foster youth who emancipated from the foster care system and lost his medical coverage.\n\nWhat Uruza didn\u2019t know was that the Affordable Care Act, which went into effect January 1, 2014, included a provision that requires states to provide medical coverage to former foster youth who exited foster care at age 18 or older but are still under the age of 26. This special provision grants foster youth the same coverage allowance as other young adults who stay on a parent\u2019s insurance plan until the same age.\n\nYouth emancipating from foster care must be automatically enrolled in Medicaid coverage. Uruza falls into a unique \u201cgap\u201d group of foster youth who left foster care prior to the new law, lost coverage and is now eligible to re-enroll because he is under 26.\n\nThrough an astonishing stroke of luck, a few weeks later Uruza received an email about his medical coverage eligibility, registered and was able to take care of his injuries. Absent that, he might still be suffering in silence.\n\nTracking former foster youth can be a challenge, and many still do not realize they are eligible for coverage. Every year it is estimated that 20,000 annually \u201cage out\u201d of foster care across the United States.\n\nUruza\u2019s home state of California is one of a few states that extend coverage to any state resident who exited foster care at age 18 or older, regardless of the state the youth was in foster care. At the moment, the federal Department of Health and Human Services does not require states to enroll youths who were in a different state\u2019s foster care system.\n\nTo reach this special \u201cgap\u201d group, California child policy, research and advocacy organization Children Now launched the \u201cCovered \u2018Til 26\u201d campaign\u2014an aggressive outreach program dedicated to educating young adults, organizations and county agencies about former foster youths\u2019 coverage eligibility.\n\nFunded by The California Wellness Foundation through year-end 2016, Children Now runs a youth-friendly website (Coveredtil26.org) on how former foster youth can retain or enroll in Medi-Cal. The group even provides individual guidance for those struggling with the process.\n\n\u201cFormer foster youth are a vulnerable group that too often lacks adequate support to navigate the transition to adulthood successfully,\u201d said Fatima Morales, Policy and Outreach Associate at Children Now. \u201cThey are much less likely than their peers to have health insurance but they tend to have more health care needs due to abuse, neglect or trauma experienced during childhood.\u201d\n\nLike the Affordable Care Act, the Medi-Cal extension to age 26 for former foster youth has had its kinks.\n\n\u201cThe health care registration systems weren\u2019t programmed to appropriately enroll former foster youth in the Medi-Cal program,\u201d Morales said. \u201cSo some former foster youth who are eligible have received incorrect eligibility determinations. Children Now has worked aggressively with advocates to raise awareness of these technical issues with state and county agencies, stakeholders and even the media to ensure these fixes are a priority.\u201d\n\nOscar Sanchez falls into the \u201cgap\u201d group. He and his three siblings entered foster care after their single mother left home to run an errand and never returned. Sanchez, who now works and attends college in San Diego, struggled with the Medi-Cal registration process.\n\nAn avid cyclist, he broke his clavicle and several ribs after hitting a pothole while training for a bike race. In the emergency room he learned that he had registered incorrectly, so all he could get was a sling and some pain killers to avoid paying out of pocket.\n\n\u201cI contacted Covered \u2018Til 26 and Fatima helped me fix my health care coverage,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cIt was pretty hectic at first, but after completing a one-page document I\u2019m covered, have gotten better care and I see an Orthopedist for my injuries.\u201d\n\nErica Ontiveros of Orange County wasn\u2019t taught proper dental hygiene as a child in foster care; as a result she had a mouth full of painful cavities. Medi-Cal coverage allowed Ontiveros to visit a dentist for treatment. Had she waited much longer to treat the cavities, Ontiveros would have required much more invasive root canal procedures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for Medi-Cal. It has been a turning point for my health,\u201d acknowledged Ontiveros.\n\nTo date, the Covered \u2018Til 26 campaign has connected approximately 6,500 former foster youth to information and resources about extended Medi-Cal coverage and how to enroll in or retain coverage. Children Now has partnered with foster care alumni groups, community groups, direct service providers, news organizations and California legislators to help spread the word to current and former foster youth.\n\nFormer foster youth living in California who have questions or wish to sign up for Medi-Cal should visit Coveredtil26.org.
