Kearney's Good Samaritan Hospital in Nebraska is operational after a wave of flash flood waters burst through windows of the cafeteria. The kitchen area is damaged and not in use.The incident caused quite a scare for the staff and patients.

Hospital staff looked on in disbelief as flash flood waters ripped through the cafeteria at the hospital Friday night. Now surveillance video shows just how close the wave of water came to one staff member.

Moments before midnight, nine feet of standing water outside the hospital came bursting through the large glass windows.

Marsha Wilkerson, Director of Marketing and Communication at Good Samaritan says the devastation is heartbreaking.

"To see this really beautiful space destroyed by mother nature is actually very emotional and really hard for a lot of our staff," said Wilkerson.

What was a state of the art dining facility built just a few years ago is now a sea of debris. The kitchen sustained extensive damage and is currently not in use. Patients are receiving meals from a temporary kitchen but have limited menu options.

Thankfully no one was injured in the incident. As a precautionary measure, two patients were transported Saturday to different hospitals to undergo surgery.

They aren't sure when the kitchen will reopen. The cost of the damage is not yet known.

Wilkerson says the Hospital is working with their insurance company and the natural disaster relief agency on repairing the damage.
