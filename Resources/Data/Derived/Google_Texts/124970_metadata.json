Equally important is the reaction of Democrats to his success, and what it tells us about the potential for a new broad coalition (like the New Deal) that can defeat the 1%.\n\nThe New Deal is as dead as FDR. But a new coalition can be built for the 21st C.\n\nOn January 7 I listed four keys to a possible Trump victory.\n\nBuild political organization that gets votes \u2014 Done. Craft a message that appeals to majority of Americans. Strike a deal with America\u2019s ruling elites. Now they see Trump as a disruptor of a political game that they own. But Trump is both one of them (2nd generation) and a consummate deal-maker (his big book is The Art of the Deal ). The necessary alliances will come easily if he wins the nomination. Luck, such as a recession in mid-year, which could easily happen.\n\nTrump has completed the first task (as I expected). Now he\u2019s working on the second, to more effectively tap the resurgent populism that catapulted him to the top of the GOP.\n\nCNN says that \u201cTrump has hammered Wall Street in recent speeches, wants to raise taxes on the rich and has embraced policies that will hurt many multinational companies.\u201d Michael Tesler (Asst professor of political science, UC Irvine) describes the results as showing \u201ceconomically progressive positions, combined with Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric about minority groups, seem to have created a powerful populist coalition that has made Trump the front-runner\u2026\u201d\n\nPolls show the result: broad appeal among Republicans and independents. Even the good liberals at Slate have noticed (\u201cThink Hillary Clinton Will Crush Donald Trump in the General Election? Don\u2019t Be So Sure\u201c). RAND\u2019s Presidential Election Panel Survey (PEPS) shows his success. Slowly our political gurus see this. Bernie Becker in Politico writes about \u201cTrump\u2019s 6 populist positions\u201c. Even more insightful is Jonathon Chait in NY Magazine\u2026\n\nDonald Trump has undergone an important metastasis. His populist rhetoric has firmed up and identified a different and somewhat more specific band of enemies, including (but not limited to) oil companies, insurance companies, defense contractors, and wealthy \u201cbloodsuckers\u201d in general. \u2026 Trump\u2019s campaign initially emphasized his nativist position on immigration, which caused him to be identified with the Republican right. But Trump has repositioned himself increasingly as the candidate of the populist, disaffected center. \u2026 Trump\u2019s populism has slowly intensified. \u2026 He has proposed to let the federal government negotiate lower prices for Medicare prescription drugs, a plan horrifying to conservatives (and drug companies). Like other Republicans, he proposes to eliminate Obamacare and replace it with something undefined but wonderful. The reason Trump\u2019s vague repeal-and-replace stance makes them so nervous is that he once advocated single-payer insurance, and he has emphasized, in a way other Republicans have not, the horrors of leaving people who are too poor or sick to afford insurance on their own. Trump\u2019s shorthand description of the travails of the uninsured before Obamacare \u2014 people \u201cdying on the street\u201d \u2014 alarms conventional conservatives precisely because it captures the broad reality of the suffering that justified Obamacare in the first place, and which would intensify if the law is repealed. The Republican fear is that Trump\u2019s vague promise to replace Obamacare with something terrific is not just a hand-waving tactic to justify repealing Obamacare. Their fear is that he actually means it. Trump\u2019s populist positions may place him farther away from the Republican Party\u2019s intellectual and financial vanguard, but they draw him closer to its voters. The clearest sign of Trump\u2019s intentions is the conscious fashion in which he has tried to co-opt the appeal of Bernie Sanders (who, like Trump, has opened up a populist attack on his party\u2019s consensus). Trump\u2019s argument is that he agrees with Sanders on trade, but only Trump can put his critique into practice\u2026\n\nOthers prefer not to see the outlines of a resurgent populism. The Economist is tone-deaf as usual: \u201cThe populists are on top\u201c. Their only mention of Trump\u2019s populism: \u201cFor the Republican leaders who recoil in horror at Mr Trump\u2019s careless populism, his offensiveness and his frequent trampling over conservative causes such as free trade\u2026\u201d\n\nOthers see but fear Trump\u2019s populism as a threat to the Democratic Party, remaining blind to a possible alliance to further their common policy goals, as is John Nichols in The Nation: \u201cBut what if one party changes \u2014 however cynically or crudely \u2014 to address the fears of the moment, while the other does not? What if Trump turns up the volume on a populist message while the Democrats run a more cautious campaign?\u201d\n\nThis is clearest on the Left, as seen in \u201cThe scariest thing about Trump\u2019s primary dominance: The GOP still doesn\u2019t understand the monster it created\u201d by Heather Digby Parton in Salon. Glenn Greenwald called her one of the \u201cleading and most admired commentators\u201d of the \u201cProgressive blogosphere\u201d. She\u2019s the articulate intelligent voice of a leader to a dying political movement.\n\n{Pundits} seem to think this might signal that the GOP is becoming a mainstream populist party. I would argue the opposite is true. They voted for him in spite of his apostasy on all those issues. Indeed, it\u2019s pretty obvious they were willing to rationalize all of it because they believe so strenuously in all the other issues on which he running. They are ecstatic over his anti-\u201cpolitical correctness\u201d campaign to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and their American children and ban 1.6 billion Muslims from entering the country, while putting the ones who are already here under surveillance. These voters cheer wildly for his enthusiastic endorsement of torture, his promise to kill the families of terrorist suspects and his pantomimes of summary executions of soldiers accused of desertion. His puerile insults and schoolyard bullying are seen as signs of strength. His profane language is appreciated for its gritty machismo. He treats the press with total contempt, and the voters love it. Over and over again, when asked to explain what they like about him, Trump supporters exclaim, \u201cHe knows what I\u2019m thinking!\u201d And what these people are thinking is that he\u2019s making it safe for them to be \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d again, giving sanction to publicly express their resentment toward people who don\u2019t look and act like them.\n\nSixteen hundred words, but not one about Trump\u2019s economic populism \u2014 or the popularity of his policy proposals. She did mention \u201cHe also vowed to stay neutral in disputes between Israel and Palestine, which is the equivalent of carpet bombing and entire herd of sacred cows.\u201d \u2014 but didn\u2019t connect it to his opposition to foreign wars. Keep those eyes closed, Heather!\n\nThe future\n\nPopulism and progressivism are cousins and so natural foes. At odds both will lose to the 1%. Both have internal weaknesses: populism\u2019s nativism and racism, and the progressive\u2019s fascination with far-Left obsessions about gender and race (e.g., the transgendered, the campus rape epidemic, reparations for slavery). The style and cultural differences are as great. Yet they can become unstoppable if sufficient numbers on both sides seek common cause \u2014 recreating a 21st century version of the New Deal.\n\nThe rise of Trump, and to a lesser extent Sanders progressive insurgency, show the potential for structural change in US politics: a realignment election in which the political coalitions and policies debated change. I believe it is our only hope. Let\u2019s not blow it.\n\nThe fascists corrupted the fasces as a symbol, but the Roman people\u2019s original meaning remains vital to know: separately we are powerless; we are strong only when bound together with a common purpose.\n\nOther posts about Trump & the new populism\n\nSee all posts about Trump and the New Populism, especially these\u2026\n\nFor More Information\n\nIf you liked this post, like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
