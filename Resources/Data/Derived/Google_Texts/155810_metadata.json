When used to restore blood flow in heart attack patients, the procedure proves beneficial. These acute cases account for half of the 700,000 stent procedures in the United States each year, according to the article.\n\nBut after combing through thousands of pages of court documents and regulatory filings, reviewing more than a dozen medical studies, and conducting interviews with 37 cardiologists and 33 heart patients or their survivors, Bloomberg concludes this go-to treatment is often overused, resulting in death, injury and fraud.\n\nThe problem stems in the country's payment system that rewards doctors based on volume of procedures rather than quality of care, according to the article. Cardiologists get paid less to talk about the risk of the procedure and alternative treatments than they do for implanting the device.\n\n\"Stenting belongs to one of the bleakest chapters in the history of Western medicine,\" Nortin Hadler, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Bloomberg. Cardiologists he said, continue to conduct these procedures because the \"interventional cardiology industry has a cash flow comparable to the GDP [gross domestic product] of many countries\" and doesn't want to lose it.\n\nOne of the more famous cases of stent overuse occurred at one of Maryland's top cardiac-care hospitals after an internal review prompted by a federal investigation in 2009 determined hundreds of patients had unnecessary coronary stents implanted in their arteries, possibly as part of an insurance fraud scheme. Mark Midei, the former cardiologist at the center of the case, filed a defamation suit against Maryland's St. Joseph Medical Center, but a Baltimore County Circuit Court judge dismissed the case in April.\n\nDespite these cases, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates implanting multiple, preventive stents when a patient succumbs to heart attack produces a better outcome than only one stent. Researchers recruited 465 patients between 2008 and 2013 and found that patients who had preventive stents had a reduced chance of death by 64 percent over the next two years, versus patients who only received a stent in the offending artery. Those same patients also reduced their chance of having a second major heart attack or severe angina episodes over the same period, FierceMedicalDevices previously reported.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the Bloomberg article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy: Multiple cardiac stents could prevent future heart attacks\n\nHospital's star doctor accused of implanting stents unnecessarily\n\nNotorious cardiologist wants hospital to go to trial for defamation\n\nMost heart patients confused about stent benefits", "article_metadata": {"description": "Half of\u00a0elective surgeries to implant cardiac stents\u00a0may be unnecessary and inadvertently causing patient deaths,\u00a0according to\u00a0an in-depth investigative report by Bloomberg.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Half of\u00a0elective surgeries to implant cardiac stents\u00a0may be unnecessary and inadvertently causing patient deaths,\u00a0according to\u00a0an in-depth investigative report by Bloomberg.", "title": "Half of cardiac stent procedures overused, unnecessary", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/half-cardiac-stent-procedures-overused-unnecessary/2013-09-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Bloomberg,Cardiac Stents,elective procedures,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient death", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "These acute cases account for half of the 700,000 stent procedures in the United States each year, according to the article.\nHalf of elective surgeries to implant cardiac stents may be unnecessary and inadvertently causing patient deaths, according to an in-depth investigative report by Bloomberg.\nFor more:- read the Bloomberg articleRelated Articles:Study: Multiple cardiac stents could prevent future heart attacksHospital's star doctor accused of implanting stents unnecessarilyNotorious cardiologist wants hospital to go to trial for defamationMost heart patients confused about stent benefits\nWhen used to restore blood flow in heart attack patients, the procedure proves beneficial.\nThe problem stems in the country's payment system that rewards doctors based on volume of procedures rather than quality of care, according to the article."}
