It is intended to ex-tend prenatal care beyond the four walls of the clinic by delivering evidence-based, OB-approved guidelines in the form of daily nutritional, medical and lifestyle action items.\n\nWith Babyscripts, patients receive the additional benefit of increased quality of care using connected health devices. A wireless weight scale and blood pressure cuff are packaged as part of Babyscripts \u201cmommy kit\u201d and are delivered to each patient following her confirmation of her pregnancy visit. Regular home use of these devices can help identify a patient\u2019s trend lines for weight gain and blood pressure as compared to evidence-based normal healthy ranges.\n\nFor physicians, Babyscripts helps to better educate their patients on pregnancy guidelines. And by identifying patient trends, it offers providers the ability to give quick feedback, potentially optimizing a patient\u2019s visit schedule. These benefits reduce costs and help physicians comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWith our agreement with RHJN, Babyscripts is one step closer to proving that the Internet of Things and connective technology can revolutionize healthcare,\u201d said Juan Pablo Segura, Babyscripts co-founder and president. \u201cTo gain the interest of such a leading-edge organization has great implications for the future of Babyscripts as the go-to solution for doctors and patients to achieve better pregnancies.\u201d\n\nWhere too many healthcare solutions focus on either just the patient or the provider, Babyscripts is notable for its inclusion of both, in the greater healthcare equation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge movement in healthcare to use wearable technology and apps to improve health and fitness, with Fitbit\u00ae and other devices,\u201d Segura said. \u201cBut there are very few technologies that engage the doctor and patient directly. We\u2019re creating new approaches to pro-mote wellness and manage patient care beyond the traditional clinical setting.\u201d\n\nDr. Matthew King, a practicing OBGYN at RHJN, is focused on the future of medicine and how Babyscripts can help his practice better deliver OB care.\n\n\u201cWe never stop investing in innovation at RHJN,\u201d Dr. King said. \u201cAnd Babyscripts is the first of many innovative experiences that we want to give to patients to empower them during their pregnancy.\u201d\n\nSince its founding last year, Babyscripts has received increasing recognition. Recently, Babyscripts won the 1776 regional Challenge Cup competition, a global startup competition that took place in 16 cities across 11 countries to identify the most promising startups solving the biggest challenges in education, energy, health and cities. This victory puts Babyscripts in the Global Finals.\n\nBabyscripts is also a member of the Startup Health Academy and partner of GE\u2019s Healthymagination Fund. In addition to on-boarding RHJN, it is involved in an ongoing pilot with George Washington University Hospital, which includes over 100 patients, and continues its expansion with additional academic medical centers, like Medstar Health and Duke Medicine.\n\nAbout BabyScripts\n\nBabyscripts delivers patients and providers the only clinical mobile solution for a better pregnancy. Connected devices delivered to a patient\u2019s home watch patient weight and blood pressure trends, while a user-friendly mobile application helps providers administer medical, nutritional and lifestyle guidelines to their patients. The intelligent connectivity between the wireless devices and mobile app improves the quality of care and increases administrative efficiency.
