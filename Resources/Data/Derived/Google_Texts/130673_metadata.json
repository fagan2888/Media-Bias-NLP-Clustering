I\u2019m Steve Russell, a new member of the House of Representatives from Oklahoma\u2019s Fifth District.\n\nOur new Congress has a great opportunity: to restore Constitutional government and place the American people and their priorities first.\n\nAs lawmakers, we must never forget that our government was designed to derive its power from the consent of the people.\n\nSadly, we\u2019ve seen Washington ignore your concerns about the economy, spending, jobs and making our nation secure.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats both care, but we hold different views about the ability of the people to make a bright future or whether the government should stand in your way and define that future for you.\n\nAs Americans, we have not lost our capacity for greatness. We can still overcome the odds.\n\nTake the President\u2019s regulations and obstruction of our energy sector: we have seen hard-working Americans innovate and transform our economy only to have the president try and take credit for it.\n\nWe have seen Americans families work together in their communities to make ends meet paycheck to paycheck even while our volunteer armed forces sacrifice to keep us safe in a dangerous and shifting world.\n\nDespite it all, deep in our hearts, Americans still want America to be great. We still are.\n\nI, like you, refuse to give up on this great country. I\u2019m joined by a wave of colleagues that you sent to Congress who believe the same thing.\n\nWe have the resources to transform our economy, the talents to work together to solve our problems, and the grit to lead in a dangerous world that looks to us for hope and stability\u2014an American beacon that still shines when others only provide a dim view of the future.\n\nWith your inspiration, this new Congress is hard at work. Here are four things the House has already voted to do:\n\nLift the burden on small businesses so they can hire more of our veterans without penalties;\n\nRepeal ObamaCare\u2019s absurd 30-hour work-week definition so we can get people working again full-time;\n\nBuild the Keystone XL pipeline, with its more than 42,000 American jobs and safe energy for our children\u2019s future, friends and allies;\n\nForce bureaucratic agencies to regulate with more honesty, thrift and transparency.\n\nThese measures are only the beginning.\n\nNow President Obama doesn\u2019t agree with our direction, the one that you, the voters, asked us to take, and he has threatened to block your progress. But we challenge him to listen to the people instead of standing in the way of your future.\n\nAs we take these steps, we must do it with the guidance and principles that founded our nation. You don\u2019t build a building without a blueprint. You don\u2019t chart your future by taking shortcuts but rather do it with fairness and unity.\n\nThat\u2019s why the House voted to stop the president\u2019s unilateral action on immigration. It\u2019s not about opportunity, it is about the Constitution and being fair to those legal immigrants who follow the law.\n\nOn at least 22 separate occasions, the president said he did not have the authority to do what he did, and we are holding him to his word.\n\nEvery time the president makes the playing field uneven and unfair, he tramples on the opportunity for all Americans.\n\nWe can and will find solutions to immigration and will be happy to do it, but they will be your solutions through the Congress, not unfair executive actions.\n\nAs we look to the future, let us do it together. We have heard your voice, and now we need your support. Together, we can get it done.\n\nThanks for listening. Say a prayer for those protecting us and may God bless this great Republic.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Steve Russell touted votes that the GOP Congress had already taken on Obamacare, Keystone XL, and executive amnesty", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Steve Russell touted votes that the GOP Congress had already taken on Obamacare, Keystone XL, and executive amnesty", "title": "GOP Rep Russell Touts GOP Congress' Accomplishments - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/GOP-117-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/01/17/gop-rep-russell-touts-gop-congress-accomplishments/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Steve Russell touted votes that the GOP Congress had already taken on Obamacare, Keystone XL, and executive amnesty", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/GOP-117-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "GOP Rep Russell Touts GOP Congress' Accomplishments - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "executive amnesty, Keystone XL, obamacare, Steve Russell,Breitbart TV,Russell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Steve Russell", "published_time": "2015-01-17T08:48:48-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Our new Congress has a great opportunity: to restore Constitutional government and place the American people and their priorities first.\nEvery time the president makes the playing field uneven and unfair, he tramples on the opportunity for all Americans.\nAs lawmakers, we must never forget that our government was designed to derive its power from the consent of the people.\nI\u2019m joined by a wave of colleagues that you sent to Congress who believe the same thing.\nSay a prayer for those protecting us and may God bless this great Republic.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
