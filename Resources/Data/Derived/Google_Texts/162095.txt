Pierre, SD

The South Dakota State Historical Society is accepting applications for grants to fund large-scale restoration or rehabilitation projects of historic properties.



The Deadwood Fund grant program will award amounts ranging from $1,000 to $25,000 for projects scheduled to begin Jan. 1. Funding for the program comes from Deadwood's gaming revenue.



Individuals, organizations and public agencies are eligible to apply.



The grants must be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis from nonfederal and nonstate sources.



Nearly $122,000 was distributed among 11 projects in 2014, which resulted in a total public-private investment of about $448,000.



Applications are due Oct. 1.
