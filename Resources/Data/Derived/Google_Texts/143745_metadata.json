Overall, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, New Jersey's basic plans are among the most comprehensive in the U.S.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires health plans to include a package of 10 \"essential health benefits.\" But the federal law, which took effect this year, doesn't get into specifics. Until 2016, those decisions are left to the states. As a result, the researchers found, coverage for certain services varies widely from state to state.\n\nWhat's covered\n\nOf the 11 specific services there researchers looked at, New Jersey requires coverage for seven. Only three states require more: Illinois, New Mexico and Nevada, all of which mandate eight of the 11. A few states require only one or two.\n\nThe seven services that New Jersey requires, and the total number of states that mandate them, are: chiropractic care (45); treatment for TMJ disorders (31); hearing aids (26); autism spectrum disorder services, including Applied Behavioral Analysis (26); nutrition counseling (25); bariatric surgery (23) and infertility treatments (19.)\n\nFind out if you're ready for weight-loss surgery\n\nWhat's optional\n\nThe four services that New Jersey doesn't require, and the total number of states that do, are: routine foot care (20); private-duty nursing (19); acupuncture (5) and weight-loss programs (5.)\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDepending on your plan, you might have coverage for more or all of these services. The state requirements simply set a minimum of what plans have to include.\n\nShannon Mullen: 732-643-4278; smullen@njpressmedia.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1wphqFS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Jersey requires that health insurance plans include coverage for services that other states mandate, including autism therapy, infertility treatments, and bariatric surgery, a new study says", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "New Jersey requires that health insurance plans include coverage for services that other states mandate, including autism therapy, infertility treatments, and bariatric surgery, a new study says", "title": "Do NJ health plans cover autism, infertility treatments?", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/health/2014/10/24/new-jersey-autism-insurance/17840375/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey requires that health insurance plans include coverage for services that other states mandate, including autism therapy, infertility treatments, and bariatric surgery, a new study says", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54ed5573263abfec95506e0f8d68c1a4cc86a184/c=0-4-240-244&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/10/24/-health1.jpg20081216.jpg", "title": "Do NJ health plans cover autism, infertility treatments?", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "autism insurance, New Jersey autism, ACA benefits by state"}, "article_summary": "The state requires health insurance plans to cover all of those services, unlike many other states.\nOnly three states require more: Illinois, New Mexico and Nevada, all of which mandate eight of the 11.\nOverall, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, New Jersey's basic plans are among the most comprehensive in the U.S.Why it mattersThe Affordable Care Act requires health plans to include a package of 10 \"essential health benefits.\"\nWhat's coveredOf the 11 specific services there researchers looked at, New Jersey requires coverage for seven.\nA few states require only one or two."}
