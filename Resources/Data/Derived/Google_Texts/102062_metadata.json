It was a race she should have won.\n\nBidding to become the first American woman to win a World Cup race on Aspen Mountain since Tamara McKinney in 1981, the EagleVail resident was in the lead two gates from the finish Friday when she suffered an uncharacteristic lapse of concentration and fell in a giant slalom she seemed sure to win.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of heartbreaking, but I was attacking, I was really fighting,\u201d said Shiffrin, 20. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at the video, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see a bunch of things I should have done better like, second to the last gate, staying on your outside ski. Some of the basics.\u201d\n\nShiffrin had the fastest first run, and all of the other racers were finished when she entered the starting gate for the second one. Skiing through a heavy snowfall, she had a lead of 0.68 seconds at the final intermediate timing. Victory seemed certain \u2014 and then it was gone in a sliding fall and a puff of snow. Lara Gut of Switzerland was the beneficiary, winning by 0.1 of a second over Eva-Maria Brem of Austria.\n\nWatching Shiffrin approach the finish, Gut was sure Shiffrin would win.\n\n\u201cShe was skiing awesome,\u201d Gut said. \u201cWe are in the States, so I felt like, \u2018OK, it\u2019s all right if she wins,\u2019 and then, \u2018She crashed, she can also make mistakes, so I win.\u2019 It\u2019s unusual that Mikaela does mistakes like that.\u201d\n\nShiffrin\u2019s mistake was getting her weight on her inside ski in a turn, which she called an \u201cinexcusable mistake for somebody who\u2019s able to win.\u201d Her outside ski lost grip and slipped from underneath her.\n\n\u201cIt (the course) kept turning towards the finish and I knew that it did,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI got past the bigger turns and I was like, \u2018That felt quite good.\u2019 But I was also thinking in my mind, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe I made it this far, it was kind of rough.\u2019 No sooner did I think that \u2026\u201d\n\nShiffrin has dominated slalom the past three seasons, winning gold medals at two world championships and the Sochi Olympics. Her GS has improved to the point where she expects to contend in every race. She was second in the season\u2019s first GS race last month in Soelden, Austria.\n\nShe can gain some consolation here with slaloms Saturday and Sunday.\n\nVail\u2019s Lindsey Vonn crashed on the first run after her left ski popped off when she pressured it to make a hard right turn.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even really bumpy, so I\u2019m kind of perplexed as to how that happened,\u201d said Vonn, 31. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened to me in a race before. To have it happen in Aspen is definitely disappointing, but (stuff) happens. Next week is Lake Louise, so I\u2019m just going to move on and focus on that. I\u2019m fine (physically). Just super annoying.\u201d\n\nVonn has owned the World Cup races at Lake Louise, Alberta, claiming 15 of her women\u2019s record 67 victories there. She will race two downhills and a super-G there next week.\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What seemed near-certain victory for Shiffrin vanishes two gates from the finish in Aspen GS", "title": "What seemed near-certain victory for Shiffrin vanishes two gates from the finish in Aspen GS", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/what-seemed-near-certain-victory-for-shiffrin-vanishes-two-gates-from-the-finish-in-aspen-gs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__Mikaela-Shiffrinp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__Mikaela-Shiffrinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T11:58:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:21:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0413\"", "article_summary": "Watching Shiffrin approach the finish, Gut was sure Shiffrin would win.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even really bumpy, so I\u2019m kind of perplexed as to how that happened,\u201d said Vonn, 31.\n\u201cThat was kind of heartbreaking, but I was attacking, I was really fighting,\u201d said Shiffrin, 20.\nASPEN \u2014 It would have been hard enough to take if she\u2019d merely lost a race she could have won, but this was harder for Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\u201cIt (the course) kept turning towards the finish and I knew that it did,\u201d Shiffrin said."}
