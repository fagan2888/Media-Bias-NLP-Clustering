In the course of asking one of my favorite college basketball game analysts, Dan Dakich, about Buzz Williams leaving Marquette for Virginia Tech, I asked him about Wisconsin taking on Oregon, a team that likes to play at warp speed.

Dakich said Saturday in a telephone interview that the Badgers can reach a high score without upping the pace.

“The way for Wisconsin, in my opinion, to get it in the 80s isn’t necessarily to speed up, it’s just to make shots,” said Dakich, who called a number of Big Ten telecasts this season for ESPN. “I don’t necessarily dislike the matchup (for Wisconsin) because Bo’s teams can handle teams that want to score with them because they inherently can lock people up. There are some places where, hey look, they never locked anybody up. They never are going to lock anybody up. I thought against Michigan at Michigan they just locked everybody up.

“People say it’s a bad matchup,” Dakich said. “People are talking about a high-scoring team against Bo Ryan. Promise you, if Wisconsin wins there’s going to be about a five- to seven-minute time frame in the second half where Oregon doesn’t score. Because that’s what Bo’s teams can do, regardless of what their defensive numbers are or aren’t.”

Dakich is among those who think the Badgers will advance to the Final Four.
