The less well-known of the two, Deanna McMillan, the first in her family to attend college, earned a doctorate in engineering.\n\nHaving served as adjunct faculty at Purdue and Ivy Tech, Deanna is deeply concerned about public education. She laments that the general public is not aware of recent higher education opportunities in Indiana and the vital role that STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) coursework will play in the future. She wants to provide the information and guidance to enable young Hoosiers to acquire an education fit for the 21st century.\n\nAs an academic engineer with years of experience working in the field, she is eminently qualified and eager to tackle the restoration of our crumbling infrastructure. Her deep concern for the welfare of others is manifested in her volunteer work at the Crisis Center, especially with victims of rape, and her role as Affordable Care Act navigator.\n\nPossessed with exceptional technical, academic and personal skills, Deanna McMillan is an excellent choice to serve at representative of House District 26.\n\nSheli Lucas\n\nLafayette\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.jconline.com/26B4XBv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letter: McMillan qualified for Dist. 26", "og": {"site_name": "Journal and Courier", "description": "Letter: McMillan qualified for Dist. 26", "title": "Letter: McMillan qualified for Dist. 26", "url": "http://www.jconline.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/29/letter-mcmillan-qualified-dist/83702508/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/jconline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letter: McMillan qualified for Dist. 26", "title": "Letter: McMillan qualified for Dist. 26", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e8c26da9ef6263c92fa64f81ddab53767b675bcc/c=0-0-2040-2040&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/29/LafayetteIN/B9321964630Z.1_20160429121201_000_GFGE7I30D.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@JCOnline", "site": "@JCOnline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815251197", "fb": {"app_id": 150121088373528}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The less well-known of the two, Deanna McMillan, the first in her family to attend college, earned a doctorate in engineering.\nPossessed with exceptional technical, academic and personal skills, Deanna McMillan is an excellent choice to serve at representative of House District 26.\nFile photo (Photo: Journal & Courier)Indiana House District 26 Democratic voters have the difficult but enviable choice between two very capable, well-educated, professional women.\nHaving served as adjunct faculty at Purdue and Ivy Tech, Deanna is deeply concerned about public education.\nAs an academic engineer with years of experience working in the field, she is eminently qualified and eager to tackle the restoration of our crumbling infrastructure."}
