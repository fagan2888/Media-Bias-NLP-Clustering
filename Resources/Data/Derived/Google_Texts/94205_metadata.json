By Tuesday, Bush was backpedaling, claiming he \u201cmisheard\u201d the question. And by Wednesday he was punting, arguing against answering \u201chypothetical\u201d questions about a war that claimed 4,491 U.S. lives.\n\nNo candidate this year is haunted by that conflict like Bush, who must weigh political and familial considerations. But he\u2019s not alone in his struggles. In a campaign dominated so far by foreign policy themes, GOP presidential hopefuls are increasingly torn between the need to project toughness and the need to acknowledge what many voters see as the defining error of the last Republican commander-in-chief.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act driven by the demands of the electorate. Years of surveys show the American public\u2019s rejection of a war launched on faulty intelligence: a 2014 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for example, found 71% of voters thought the war \u201cwasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d compared to just 22% who thought it was. At the same time, the tumult rippling across the Middle East\u2014from the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) to the unrest in war-torn nations like Libya, Syria and Yemen\u2014has rejuvenated the nation\u2019s hawkish impulses. A succession of polls this year suggest most Americans support sending ground troops to fight ISIS.\n\nAs a result, GOP candidates have embraced anew a muscular foreign policy that had atrophied for much of the Obama presidency. Promises to calm the chaos of the Middle East have dominated early candidate cattle calls, while tough talk on Iran has taken the place of Obamacare as a stump speech fixture. Even Sen. Rand Paul, who advocates a restrained foreign policy as part of the party\u2019s more isolationist wing, introduced an amendment to significantly boost the defense budget. After announcing his presidential bid in April, the Kentuckian posed in front of a retired aircraft carrier in the port of Charleston to repeat his call. On a recent trip to South Carolina, Sen. Marco Rubio invoked Liam Neeson\u2019s avenging promise from the movie Taken: \u201cWe will look for you, we will find you, and we will kill you.\u201d\n\nThe bellicosity is one element of a broader strategy that includes also blaming President Obama for the mess in the Middle East and tethering Bush to his older brother. \u201cIf we knew then what we know now and I were the president of the United States, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to war,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told CNN. Paul told the Associated Press that Bush\u2019s comments represent \u201ca real problem if he can\u2019t articulate what he would have done differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing what we know now, of course we wouldn\u2019t go into Iraq,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz told The Hill.\n\nRubio went even further in an interview Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cNot only would I have not been in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in favor of it. He said so,\u201d he said.\n\nTurning Iraq into a centerpiece of the campaign is fraught with risk for Republicans, who have wrestled with the demons of a misbegotten war for a decade now. In 2004, the GOP made support for the conflict into a proxy for patriotism and rode the decision to victory in the presidential election. But by 2006, Democrats regained control of Congress amid the persistent casualties and growing sectarian violence sweeping Iraq.\n\nTwo years later, Obama\u2019s early opposition to the war helped vault him past Hillary Clinton in their epic primary contest. He then used Sen. John McCain\u2019s outspokenness for the war against him, mocking McCain\u2019s suggestion that there might be an American presence in Iraq for 100 years. In 2012 Obama won re-election while highlighting his commitment to end the war.\n\nBut as the stability of Iraq crumbled in the wake of Obama\u2019s troop withdrawal, Republicans sensed they could regain the upper hand. GOP candidates have criticized Obama for not leaving a larger security force in place to support the Iraqi government. Party strategists believe the path to the presidency hinges in part on an ability to disavow George W. Bush\u2019s mistakes while blaming Obama for making the mess much worse.\n\nRecognizing it won\u2019t be easy, some of the party\u2019s presidential contenders are treading lightly. In a speech laying out his foreign policy vision Wednesday, Rubio only briefly alluded to Iraq, implying that Obama\u2019s troop drawdown was too swift and invoking \u201cAfghans worried that America will leave them like we left Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe delicate balancing act is sharply different from the strategy employed by the likely Democratic nominee. After years of standing by her vote to authorize the war, Clinton wrote in her 2014 memoir that she \u201cgot it wrong. Plain and simple.\u201d\n\nIt was a reflection of how the politics of the issue had shifted\u2014and may be shifting still.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidates, especially Jeb Bush, are struggling with the question of the Iraq war.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "They want to be hawkish without supporting an unpopular war.", "title": "The Iraq Question That Trips Up GOP Candidates", "url": "http://time.com/3857568/republicans-iraq/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/jeb-bush.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/jeb-bush.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "They want to be hawkish without supporting an unpopular war.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Iraq Question That Trips Up GOP Candidates"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "iraq, 2016 election, jeb bush, ted cruz, chris christie, marco rubio, barack obama, hillary clinton, republican presidential candidates on iraq", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iraq, 2016 election, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Republican presidential candidates on Iraq"}, "article_summary": "As a result, GOP candidates have embraced anew a muscular foreign policy that had atrophied for much of the Obama presidency.\nThe all-but-certain Republican presidential candidate\u2019s strategy for handling his trickiest political inheritance has swung wildly in recent days, earning criticism from both sides of the aisle.\nIn a campaign dominated so far by foreign policy themes, GOP presidential hopefuls are increasingly torn between the need to project toughness and the need to acknowledge what many voters see as the defining error of the last Republican commander-in-chief.\nAnd by Wednesday he was punting, arguing against answering \u201chypothetical\u201d questions about a war that claimed 4,491 U.S. lives.\nGOP candidates have criticized Obama for not leaving a larger security force in place to support the Iraqi government."}
