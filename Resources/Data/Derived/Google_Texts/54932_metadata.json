It is people who are trying to divide us up who are the real enemies.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s confident America will return to its strength.\n\n\u201cThere are enough God-fearing people who are praying diligently on a daily basis. He\u2019s (God\u2019s) not going to turn His back on us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said when the nation\u2019s leadership is put back in the hands of those with \u201cintegrity and honesty,\u201d those attributes need to be used to govern.\n\n\u201cThat is what we need to strength the fabric of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201d\n\nSee Part 1 of his comments:\n\nHe also warned the nation about Obamacare, saying the \u201cgigantic government program\u201d has had the people turn over a huge chunk of power to Washington.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even understand that,\u201d he said. His plan would be for a repeal, and then a creation of health savings accounts that could be shared and inherited.\n\nBut there is a good result from Obamacare, he said, and Americans should tell its authors, \u201cYou made us start thinking.\u201d\n\nSee Part 2:\n\nOn immigration, he said, \u201cWe have to be logical. I like the fact that Canada has a program, immigrants can come there and work legally, be registered and come and go as they please, they pay taxes. They\u2019re not Canadian citizens.\u201d\n\nOn the Second Amendment: \u201cThere is no way that we should ever get rid of it. \u2026 There was always the threat of foreign enemies coming in, and the people couldn\u2019t simply depend on the military to protect them. Also, there was always the change of your own government becoming the enemy.\u201d\n\nOn abortion: \u201cA majority do not believe in abortion on demand. How we got into this situation is pretty hard to understand. There was an agenda being pushed, it was pushed effectively.\u201d\n\nOn racism: \u201cI will say if a person is looking for racism, they will see it. \u2026 We need to continue to make progress in that area.\u201d\n\nSee Part 3:\n\nRead what Dr. Carson has written, in \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d and \u201cTake the Risk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "You broke it, you fix it, is the message from famed neurosurgeon and outspoken conservative leader Dr. Ben Carson to Americans who don\u2019t like the way their country is moving.
