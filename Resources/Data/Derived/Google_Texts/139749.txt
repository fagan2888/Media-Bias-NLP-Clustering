If your last film was the second-highest-grossing political documentary of all time, you need to think big with your follow-up. Dinesh D’Souza and his America co-director John Sullivan have certainly tried to do that. The team behind 2012’s 2016: Obama’s America asked Hillary Clinton to appear in their just released docu but she turned them down. They did get Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul and, as this clip we’ve got shows, they have an appearance from Abraham Lincoln – well, reenactments of the 16th President’s career and the terrible Civil War that defined his term and so much of America’s history since. “For me Lincoln embodies that philosophical statesmanship and practical wisdom that represents the highest achievement of a leader,” D’Souza told me today about why he wanted Honest Able depicted in the pic.

Since its initial release in Atlanta and Houston on June 28, America went wide on July 2 and jumped to 1105 screens. Sources tell me the Lionsgate distributed docu, which got an impressive A+ CinemaScore result, is doing brisk business in Southern California, the Inland Empire, Florida, Arizona and Texas. Check out the Lincoln clip, portions of which were first unveiled tonight on Fox News Channel’s The Kelly File, here:
