Increasing health score availability raises privacy issues for the authors.\u201cConsumer scoring has substantial potential to become a major policy issue as scores with unknown factors and unknown uses and unknown validity and unknown legal constraints move into broader use,\u201d the authors said. \u201cThe protections consumers receive with respect to credit scores need to be expanded to all consumer scoring, and the rules for credit scores may warrant some re-examination as well.\u201d\n\nWhile it might be assumed that HIPAA, the main federal privacy law for healthcare information, ensures the privacy of individual health records, it does not cover \u201chealth information held by gyms, websites, banks, credit care companies, many health researchers, cosmetic medicine services, transit companies, fitness clubs, home testing laboratories, massage therapists, nutritional counselors, alterative medicine practitioners, disease advocacy groups or marketers of non-prescription health products and foods,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\n\nAnd some personal health records systems maintained by organizations that are not HIPAA-covered entities \u201cmay also become a source of unregulated health information for scoring,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nOne of the newer health scores, the Individual Health Risk Score, was developed pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u201cto create a relative measure of predicted healthcare costs\u201d for ACA enrollees to mitigate the effects of adverse selection and stabilize payments for plans insuring individuals and small groups.\n\n\n\nSo far, the 2012 federal rule creating the score limited its life to four years but \u201cis silent about individuals seeing their health risk score,\u201d the report said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe HHS rule took some care to protect the privacy and security of an individual's risk score,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cNevertheless, each individual in plans subject to risk adjustment will have his or her own health risk score. It is possible to foresee that an employer or lender or someone else with power over an individual might coerce the individual into obtaining his or her score and disclosing it.\u201d\n\n\n\nFair Isaac Corp., developer of the FICO score for credit reporting, launched in June 2011 a medication adherence score, which aims to enable a health plan or pharmacy to predict \u201ca patient's propensity to adhere to a medication prescription plan\u201d in the coming 12 months.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the end of 2011, FICO scored 2 (million) to 3 million patients\u201d using factors that include employment, home ownership, living situations, age, gender, family size and asset information, such as auto ownership, the authors said. The report quotes a FICO statement that the score \u201cwill use a patient's prescription claims history when available and pull on other publicly available third-part data sources when no other information is present.\u201d\n\n\n\nLikely customers of these reports are drugmakers, who pay covered entities to send prescription refill reminders for drugs it sells. \u201cIf the manufacturer can identify those patients who are likely to refill prescriptions anyway, it can tell the intermediaries to send reminders only to those who have a low adherence score,\u201d they said.\n\n\n\nSeveral \u201cfrailty scores\u201d are also in common use, including ones developed by the CMS and Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThe concern with any predictive score, particularly a frailty score, is that it can escape into the hands of third parties where it can be used outside of the original intent,\u201d they said.\n\nFrailty scores a factor in Accretive Health case", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The use of healthcare-specific consumer scores detailing people's health have proliferated in the past seven years and more are on the way, according to a report by the World Privacy Forum, a San Diego-based not-for-profit.", "title": "Privacy threat seen in growing number of healthcare scores", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The use of healthcare-specific consumer scores detailing people's health have proliferated in the past seven years and more are on the way, according to a report by the World Privacy Forum, a San Diego-based not-for-profit.", "title": "Privacy threat seen in growing number of healthcare scores", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140407/NEWS/304079959", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140407/NEWS/304079959/AR/0/World-Privacy-Forum.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The use of healthcare-specific consumer scores detailing people's health have proliferated in the past seven years and more are on the way, according to a report by the World Privacy Forum, a San Diego-based not-for-profit.", "title": "Privacy threat seen in growing number of healthcare scores", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140407/NEWS/304079959/AR/0/World-Privacy-Forum.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140407/NEWS/304079959", "published_at": "2014-04-07", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140407/NEWS/304079959/AR/0/World-Privacy-Forum.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1153\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNevertheless, each individual in plans subject to risk adjustment will have his or her own health risk score.\n\u201cThe HHS rule took some care to protect the privacy and security of an individual's risk score,\u201d the authors wrote.\nSo far, the 2012 federal rule creating the score limited its life to four years but \u201cis silent about individuals seeing their health risk score,\u201d the report said.\nSeveral \u201cfrailty scores\u201d are also in common use, including ones developed by the CMS and Johns Hopkins University.\nAnd some personal health records systems maintained by organizations that are not HIPAA-covered entities \u201cmay also become a source of unregulated health information for scoring,\u201d it said."}
