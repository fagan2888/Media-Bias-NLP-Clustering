What\u2019s more, it posts its prices online \u2013 something that is not the norm for most labs \u2013 and claims it will never charge more than half of the traditional Medicare rates for tests. Theranos\u2019 approach to pricing may give people who are uninsured or have high deductibles the ability to pay for otherwise cost-prohibitive testing and it could save costs for Medicare and Medicaid, which pay approximately $10 billion a year in lab testing. Its equipment \u2013 which is said to be the size of a large desktop computer tower \u2013 is being piloted by Walgreens, who may roll it out nationwide if the company is pleased with the results.\n\nThe threat to legacy providers from companies like Theranos is that it is addressing a larger issue in healthcare \u2013 the desire for no more borders, said Ken Kaufman, chair of management consulting firm Kaufman Hall.\n\n\u201cIt is what we\u2019ve had since Amazon was created,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have moved away from facility-based real estate stores to ways of consuming goods over the Internet.\u201d\n\nThe change in an industry from an outside source is what Kaufman calls \u201cdisruptive economics.\u201d Be it in healthcare or other industries, it often takes an outsider to come in and make changes to reduce costs or improve quality. This is usually because legacy providers are too entrenched in the structure and revenue to create new models.\n\nTheranos could be a big disruption in the healthcare industry because it has no walls; its equipment would fit anywhere, noted Kaufman, so it shouldn\u2019t have the same fixed costs as legacy companies.\n\n\u201cI think if Theranos is the real thing, it\u2019s a remarkable disruption because the fixed costs are so much lower,\u201d he said. \u201cTheranos is not the be-all and end-all of this. It is just an example \u2026 and if you have the fixed costs of a real estate operation, it may not be a good place to be in healthcare over the next 15 years.\u201d\n\nBut Theranos\u2019 disruption is not a slam dunk, countered Elissa Passiment, executive vice president of the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science.\n\nTheranos may be less expensive than other laboratories, she said, but they will have to be a lot less expensive to be competitive because, for one thing, it is new to the field and still proving itself, and for another, private payers often negotiate rates drastically below Medicare rates with organizations like Quest Diagnostics.\n\nTheranos will also at some point have to face approval from the Food and Drug Administration, a laborious process. \u201cAt some point, the FDA is going to want to see something from them to know what they are doing meets the claims they are making,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/quiet-company-poised-shake-legacy-healthcare-companies", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "For those who haven't heard yet of Theranos, take note because it may be a business disrupter of huge proportions.", "title": "Quiet company poised to shake up legacy healthcare companies"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "For those who haven't heard yet of Theranos, take note because it may be a business disrupter of huge proportions.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Quiet company poised to shake up legacy healthcare companies"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "For those who haven\u2019t heard yet of Theranos, take note because it may be a business disrupter of huge proportions.&#13; Founded a decade ago by Elizabeth Holmes to address her fear of needles, Theranos says it has created equipment and processes that need only 1/1,000th the amount of blood that is normally needed for testing \u2013 something that none of the current legacy laboratories can do \u2013 and results are achieved typically within four hours instead of days.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think if Theranos is the real thing, it\u2019s a remarkable disruption because the fixed costs are so much lower,\u201d he said.\nTheranos could be a big disruption in the healthcare industry because it has no walls; its equipment would fit anywhere, noted Kaufman, so it shouldn\u2019t have the same fixed costs as legacy companies.\nWhat\u2019s more, it posts its prices online \u2013 something that is not the norm for most labs \u2013 and claims it will never charge more than half of the traditional Medicare rates for tests.\nFor those who haven\u2019t heard yet of Theranos, take note because it may be a business disrupter of huge proportions.\nThis is usually because legacy providers are too entrenched in the structure and revenue to create new models."}
