It's true! And if the aliens on Earth 2.0 are anything like us, they'll ignore the news completely\n\nWhy aren\u2019t we all talking about the \"Earth Twin\"? That\u2019s the only thing anybody should be talking about. That\u2019s all you\u2019re allowed to talk about at my house. If you come over and you have something nice to say about the Earth Twin, you can stay. But if you start going on about Obamacare enrollment numbers or \"Twitter stress\" or the weird way Oscar Pistorius cries, all high-pitched and sad like Claire Danes, you\u2019re out.\n\nBecause all those stories pale next to the discovery of Earth Twin. Never heard of her? She and the red-dwarf star around which she orbits are brand-spanking-new to our galactic understanding. Her tongue-tripping technical name, which we will not be using in this article, is Kepler-186f (zzzzz...), named for the NASA telescopic experiment that scooped her from cosmic obscurity. But science geeks are calling her Earth 2.0.\n\nHere\u2019s all that matters: She is the closest thing scientists have ever found to a planet that resembles Earth and our incredibly sexy living conditions. Or as one of the main researchers described her, in plain un-geek-like language, she\u2019s \"the first definitive Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone around another star.\" This is what\u2019s known as the Goldilocks zone. Not too hot, not too cold. Not too Venus, not too Mars. Important words here include definitive, Earth-sized, and yes, the holy-shit part: habitable!\n\nLet me explicate more about Earth Twin, as best one can from the picture emerging. She\u2019s beautiful and buttery, with a thick, insulating atmosphere. She likely has forests, lakes, mountains. Might she have photosynthesis? Hell yeah! Gravity conditions? Similar to the ones Sandra Bullock face-planted into at the end of Gravity. Which is to say, Earth-like. \"You could far more easily imagine someone being able to go there and walk around on the surface,\" said a dude on the research team I would like to have walk a little bit in front of me when we visit the planet.\n\nAt any other time of our existence, this would be huge, huge news, the sort you could call earthshaking and still feel like you\u2019re selling it short. And yet: It didn\u2019t even make the front page of the Times. It trended not. These days we\u2019re bored by outer space. We\u2019re interested in looking in, not out. Our minds and media have gone micro. We\u2019re too busy watching the Oscar Pistorius Trial channel (this actually exists!) or Instagramming the ramps and pea shoots of our diet.\n\n(Me, I\u2019m as lame as the next lamestreamer. I no longer eat solid food, not since I discovered Delectable, the magical app that allows you to upload photos of the wine you\u2019re drinking and humblebrag about it with other lushes. It is like Grindr for alcoholics. Last night I spent three hours on it. Who needs new planets when you can discover new apps?)\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy about all this is that we\u2019re living in, and largely ignoring, an epic age of space discovery. Maybe the reason this doesn\u2019t top Fox Friends every day or break through our daily consciousness is because the revelations truly stagger the mind, and the immediacy feels, well, light-years away. (Earth Twin: 500 light-years from Houston.) But think about how quickly the technology changes, how the language of possibility ticks ever upward. Let China and Japan fight over a few uninhabited islands. Do you know how many new planets Kepler has discovered in the last few years? Nine hundred and sixty-six, bitches! Thousands more are still being investigated for their planetary chops.\n\nHere\u2019s what I like. This is all breaking at a time when conservative mistrust of science and an exalted belief in creationism run higher than ever. To me, Kepler is a godsend. It points the way to a future where all our cultural battle lines begin to seem silly. Because you have to wonder: How will fundamentalists, who believe in one holy apostolic Earth, begin to change their Story when ever-more earthshaking discoveries complicate it?\n\nYou can see signs that it\u2019s beginning to happen\u2014evangelicals starting to talk about space, which is super-weird. Of course, so far they\u2019re doing it in bombastic, biblical ways. The other day ancient oracle and giant-forehead owner Pat Robertson spoke of the apocalypse in Avengers-like ways. \"I don\u2019t see anything else that fulfills the prophetic words of Jesus Christ other than an asteroid strike,\" he said. \"There isn\u2019t anything that will cause the seas to roil, that will cause the skies to darken, the moon and the sun not to give their light\" except \"a big ol\u2019 hunk of space rock.\" And then he started riffing on how Jupiter is our cosmic savior. It was a refreshing take on Revelations! Anyway, forgive him. He\u2019s working out a new cosmology. But it will definitely end violently.\n\nI\u2019m no Nostradamus, but I did go to Notre Dame, which is almost the same thing. And I can tell you, religiously and scientifically, that all of this will happen. Earths 3.0 and 4.0 will be discovered. We will visit Earth Twin. And evangelicals will one day repent for crushing science. But that is light-years away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did anyone notice that they just discovered a planet that resembles ours? It's true!
