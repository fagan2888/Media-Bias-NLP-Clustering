A suburban Kansas City nonprofit has sent an official team to Ecuador to determine what type of medical assistance the group can provide in the wake of the deadly earthquake.

Rescuers pulled survivors from rubble Sunday after the magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Ecuador, killing at least 238 people and injuring more than 1,500.

Jim Mitchum, CEO of Lenexa-based Heart to Heart International, said Sunday his organization has sent a three-member advance team to Quito, Ecuador.

He says the team, which includes Heart to Heart's chief medical officer, will work with local officials to determine how the group can assist.

Heart to Heart works with several area medical volunteers to provide aid during crises in developing countries. Mitchum says the group typically sends medical professionals as well as supplies and medicine.
