Anything we write is bound to rub somebody the wrong way\u2014just look at the comments below some of my posts.\n\nBut while the online wrath of anonymous strangers can be annoying, I\u2019m fortunate not to face imprisonment, fines, torture or death when reporting on sensitive or taboo topics related to religion\u2014at least when I\u2019m publishing from the U.S. and London. Many of our international colleagues who face such consequences self-censor for their own safety, and who can blame them?\n\nThe most obvious restrictions reporters face in some countries are legal ones. Constitutions and laws prohibiting apostasy, blasphemy and defamation of religion are often used to muzzle the press and free expression.\n\nSome journalists also fear social and political backlash when broaching religious topics. Pakistan hasn\u2019t executed anyone for blasphemy in recent decades, but people are still being killed by vigilantes accused of the crime. In Nigeria, Boko Haram has bombed media outlets and murdered journalists for \u201cdistorting\u201d portrayals of the radical terrorist group. And in the Netherlands, some media professionals are still afraid to cover religion after an Islamist murdered one of their colleagues in 2004.\n\nReporters also take their economic livelihoods into account. Websites that discuss religion in Brunei must register with the government or face up to $200,000 in fines. In Jordan, journos face fines of up to $40,000 for denigrating religion. And in Ireland, blasphemy fines top $30,000.\n\nFaced with these legal, social, political and economic constraints, how can journalists and bloggers responsibly cover sensitive religious issues in their countries and abroad while staying out of trouble?\n\n1) Know the local red lines\n\nIn order to push the limits, you first need to understand them. Freedom of expression is egregiously undervalued in many countries. Brush up on local laws and cultural sensitivities before traveling so you know what\u2019s taboo before getting yourself in a bind.\n\n2) Let sources say what you can\u2019t\n\nInclude alternative voices in your reporting\u2014people who can express ideas and opinions you can\u2019t or who represent identities that are often absent or distorted in the press. This might sound like a basic principle of good reporting\u2014it is\u2014but it\u2019s also a powerful way to air dissent and to highlight local controversies and debates. Just be sure that including such quotes isn\u2019t likely to endanger you or your sources.\n\n3) Write anonymously\n\nIf you care more about reporting the facts or stating your opinions than you do about seeing your byline, consider writing anonymously or pseudonymously. Don\u2019t think for a second that doing so will make you totally untouchable. If you\u2019re reporting on sensitive issues you should take every precaution to avoid being traced, tracked or identified. If you fail to do so, you\u2019re not only compromising your own safety but also that of your sources. Start with some basic online privacy tips from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Tor, Privacy International and Access Now.\n\n4) Report from exile\n\nHardly ideal, but reporting from exile is often a necessary option. If journalists and citizens are unable to cover sensitive religious topics from within their countries, they might choose to safely, securely and anonymously feed information to outsiders who have large international followings. Diaspora journalists living and working abroad still need to consider the safety of family, friends, colleagues and sources back home. IranWire is a great example of this kind of reporting.\n\n5) Write between the lines\n\nIf you\u2019re mainly worried about automatic keyword censorship online, get creative. Netizens in China have long referred to the Tiananmen Square incident of June 4, 1989, as \u201cthe thirty-fifth of May.\u201d Such obfuscation is usually just a stopgap until the censors catch on, but if your readers know what you mean, go ahead and give it a shot.\n\n\u20266) See tip 1.\n\nI can\u2019t emphasize this point enough, so I\u2019m including it again. Before you can dance around the red lines, you need to know where they lie. Know before you go, and use common sense.\n\nThis is a rough-and-ready guide drawn from a talk I gave in March at the International Media Conference in Burma. For more perspectives from China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Denmark and further afield, watch the Newseum event we hosted in April.\n\nRemember that these are tips, not rules. Don\u2019t come Tweeting at me if you end up in jail.
