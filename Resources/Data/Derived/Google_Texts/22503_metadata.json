So after signing a four-year, $27.5 million contract with the Redskins in March, he worried about what it would mean for the first move with his new team to be getting arthroscopic surgery on his nagging left knee. What would his teammates think? The coaching staff?\n\nSEE ALSO: Griffin was glad to get going during preseason game, if only for a bit\n\n\u201cYou know, just a new guy, just getting signed,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cIt was a big deal.\u201d\n\nUltimately the positives of surgery outweighed the negatives, and Hatcher underwent the procedure on June 19. On Saturday, his teammates welcomed him back to practice after he was taken off the physically unable to perform list. The defensive end made his training camp debut, participating in individual drills with the other defensive linemen and even staying after practice to spend more time with the sled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve been on the field.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Redskins-Patriots preseason opener\n\nThe 32-year-old had been working exclusively on a side field for the beginning of training camp while recovering from the surgery, which he said wasn\u2019t the result of one specific injury but an accumulation of maladies over the years.\n\nHatcher, who spent his first eight seasons in Dallas, will work his way back slowly. He will only participate in individual drills for a week, then get some live repetitions and move up to full-contact drills next week. New coach Jay Gruden has said he is hopeful Hatcher will return in time for the third preseason game against Baltimore.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dominant player,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe had 13 or so sacks last year, and he\u2019s going to be an added impact to our team once he gets healthy.\u201d\n\nThe explosiveness and strength in Hatcher\u2019s knee has returned, but he said he won\u2019t truly know if the knee is 100 percent until playing on it full-speed. That mental hurdle has been one of the most difficult aspects of his rehabilitation so far.\n\n\u201cJust to say, you know, \u2018My knee is good\u2019 and go out there and just playing on it as hard as I can,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cOnce I did that, I was able to get over it mentally.\u201d\n\nTwo days after winning their preseason opener against New England, 23-6, the Redskins returned to training camp, welcomed back Hatcher and made two additional roster moves just before the beginning of practice.\n\nThe team released cornerback Peyton Thompson and signed free agent safety Da\u2019Mon Cromartie-Smith, a cousin of Cardinals cornerback Antonio Cromartie and Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.\n\nThompson struggled in one-on-one coverage Thursday night against the Patriots, getting beat twice on fly routes for big gains in the fourth quarter. He was fighting for one of the final available cornerback spots on the roster.\n\nGruden said the addition of Cromartie-Smith provides extra depth at safety in the absence of Ryan Clark, who sat out practice again on Saturday as he continues to work his way back from a strained hamstring. Gruden does not think Clark\u2019s injury is serious, but \u201cit\u2019s a hamstring \u2026 you just never know with those things.\u201d\n\nCromartie-Smith split time between the Steelers\u2019 active roster and practice squad during the past four seasons, playing alongside and learning from his new teammate, Clark. The Redskins and Steelers run similar defensive schemes, Cromartie-Smith said, which eased the transition. He played mostly with the second team during Saturday\u2019s drills.\n\n\u201cEverything was pretty much going fast forward today,\u201d Cromartie-Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of use to the scheme here. It\u2019s just about getting the terminology down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hatcher joins the Redskins after missing the previous month following knee surgery, while the team also cuts Thompson and signs free agent safety Da'Mon Cromartie-Smith.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hatcher joins the Redskins after missing the previous month following knee surgery, while the team also cuts Thompson and signs free agent safety Da\u2019Mon Cromartie-Smith.", "title": "Redskins welcome Jason Hatcher to practice, cut CB Peyton Thompson", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/9/redskins-welcome-jason-hatcher-practice-cut-cb-pey/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/24/redskins_20140724_057.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/24/redskins_20140724_057.jpg", "description": "Hatcher joins the Redskins after missing the previous month following knee surgery, while the team also cuts Thompson and signs free agent safety Da'Mon Cromartie-Smith.", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins welcome Jason Hatcher to practice, cut CB Peyton Thompson"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The team released cornerback Peyton Thompson and signed free agent safety Da\u2019Mon Cromartie-Smith, a cousin of Cardinals cornerback Antonio Cromartie and Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.\n\u201cIt was a big deal.\u201dUltimately the positives of surgery outweighed the negatives, and Hatcher underwent the procedure on June 19.\nOn Saturday, his teammates welcomed him back to practice after he was taken off the physically unable to perform list.\nRICHMOND \u2014 Jason Hatcher towers above the podium at Washington\u2019s training camp facility, a menacing figure with a mountain man\u2019s beard and 299 pounds of grit.\nNew coach Jay Gruden has said he is hopeful Hatcher will return in time for the third preseason game against Baltimore."}
