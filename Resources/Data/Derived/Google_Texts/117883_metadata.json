Ratings are based on federal government records previously not available to the public, the organization announced.\n\n\"This is the first time we're doing this and it's going to catch people by surprise,\" said Robert Krughoff, Checkbook's president, in the announcement. \"So we chose this time to focus on the good ones and to tell people who they are.\"\n\nBut the second website, Surgeon Scorecard by ProPublica, does include surgeons that have higher-than-average complications based on infections, clots or infections that call for post-operative care.\n\nThe non-profit news outlet calculated death and complication rates for surgeons who perform one of eight elective procedures in Medicare, including gall bladder removal and hip replacements, adjusting for differences in patient health, age and hospital quality.\n\nIn an editor's note, Stephen Engelberg said that the publication decided a year ago to publicly compare the performance of surgeons because consumers didn't have access to the information.\n\n\"These days, consumers can review ratings on everything from plumbers to hair salons to the latest digital cameras,\" he said. \"The process of undergoing surgery includes some of the most consequential decisions any of us ever make. So we began with the view that the taxpayers who pay the costs of Medicare should be able to use its data to make the best possible decisions about their healthcare.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two new sites will allow consumers to evaluate and compare surgeons based on never-before-available information on complications rates and patient outcomes", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Two new sites will allow consumers to evaluate and compare surgeons based on never-before-available information on complications rates and patient outcomes", "title": "New sites allow patients to compare surgeons based on outcomes, complication rates", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/new-sites-allow-patients-compare-surgeons-based-outcomes-complication-rates/2015-07-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital readmissions,medical errors,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient death,ProPublica,Surgeonratings,surgical complications", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35e8\"", "article_summary": "Two new sites launched today will allow consumers to evaluate and compare surgeons based on never-before-available information on complications rates and patient outcomes.\n\"These days, consumers can review ratings on everything from plumbers to hair salons to the latest digital cameras,\" he said.\nBut the second website, Surgeon Scorecard by ProPublica, does include surgeons that have higher-than-average complications based on infections, clots or infections that call for post-operative care.\nRatings are based on federal government records previously not available to the public, the organization announced.\nIn an editor's note, Stephen Engelberg said that the publication decided a year ago to publicly compare the performance of surgeons because consumers didn't have access to the information."}
