The $1.1 trillion spending bill Congress passed last week restores full pay for disabled veterans, but leaves most veterans without relief from the benefits reduction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly happy they have started to fix the problem, but it still does not change the fact that that promise that was made to career service members and veteran retirees has still been broken,\u201d said Alex Nicholson, legislative director for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).\n\nSEE ALSO: Disabled veterans to be exempted from pension cuts\n\nHe said as long as the cuts exist, veterans will suffer anxiety over their finances.\n\n\u201cWhen someone says we can fix this later, they\u2019re clearly not in tune with or aware of the impact this is having on veterans who have to worry about whether or not this is actually going to go through, and the stress and anxiety it\u2019s causing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bipartisan budget agreement included a one percentage point cut in annual cost-of-living increases over military members and is projected to save $6 billion over the next decade. The cuts will take start to take effect in January 2015 and reach the full 1 percent by 2017, leading some lawmakers to believe it can be dealt with later.\n\n\u201cThe 1 percent doesn\u2019t start for two years. We\u2019re going to take care of that,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said Thursday. \u201cThat is not an issue.\u201d\n\nBut veterans groups express a greater sense of urgency.\n\nJoe Davis, public affairs director for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said members of Congress could become distracted later this year, so a fix should come as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cIt is an urgent issue. This is an election year, so you have the entire House and a third of the Senate, their focus is elsewhere now. It has to get passed while this Congress is still this Congress because we know that Congress\u2018 focus is going to go elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nA number of lawmakers objected to the cuts at the time, and since the budget passed they have introduced a flurry of bills to erase them.\n\nThere have now been more than 20 standalone bills or amendments introduced on the subject, Mr. Nicholson said.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Republican senators introduced a plan to undo the cuts and extend long-term unemployment benefits by imposing across-the-board cuts. The American Legion endorsed that approach on Friday.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent, also introduced a bill on Thursday to address the cost-of-living cuts as well as several other issues that are important to veterans, such as offering alternative medicine options through the Veterans Affairs Department or offering in-state tuition for new veterans.\n\nThe fight over the cost of military pensions, which have soared with the costs of benefits for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, may not be over. The Pentagon\u2019s Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission is due to issue a report early in 2014, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress last month that the status quo on military benefits is \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s no lack of plans floating around to repeal the cuts, many of the suggested ways to pay for them involve partisan issues, which could slow down the process, Mr. Nicholson said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a will within the leadership to get this done. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right vehicle and stripping out the partisanship,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said IAVA is not supporting a particular offset or bill, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t care how they pay for it, we just want to see it undone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers say they have plenty of time to repeal a cut to military retiree pay that takes effect in 2015, but veterans' groups are warning Congress it must get it done soon before members get distracted by their own re-election campaigns later this year.", "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lawmakers say they have plenty of time to repeal a cut to military retiree pay that takes effect in 2015, but veterans\u2019 groups are warning Congress it must get it done soon before members get distracted by their own re-election campaigns later this year.", "title": "Veterans\u2019 groups press Congress to undo cuts to benefits", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/19/veterans-groups-press-congress-to-undo-cuts-to-ben/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/19/1_192014_congress-unemployment-ben-58201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/19/1_192014_congress-unemployment-ben-58201.jpg", "title": "Veterans\u2019 groups press Congress to undo cuts to benefits", "description": "Lawmakers say they have plenty of time to repeal a cut to military retiree pay that takes effect in 2015, but veterans' groups are warning Congress it must get it done soon before members get distract", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, Congress, Alex Nicholson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde417\"", "article_summary": "The $1.1 trillion spending bill Congress passed last week restores full pay for disabled veterans, but leaves most veterans without relief from the benefits reduction.\nSEE ALSO: Disabled veterans to be exempted from pension cutsHe said as long as the cuts exist, veterans will suffer anxiety over their finances.\nOn Thursday, a group of Republican senators introduced a plan to undo the cuts and extend long-term unemployment benefits by imposing across-the-board cuts.\nIt has to get passed while this Congress is still this Congress because we know that Congress\u2018 focus is going to go elsewhere,\u201d he said.\nThe bipartisan budget agreement included a one percentage point cut in annual cost-of-living increases over military members and is projected to save $6 billion over the next decade."}
