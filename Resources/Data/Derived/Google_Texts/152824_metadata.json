I hate political correctness,\u201d he said to the cheers of an audience at Spring Arbor College. \u201cPolitical correctness is imposed by secular progressives and those who want to fundamentally change our society, and they don\u2019t want any discussion about it, therefore, they make things off limits to talk about. But you know what? I\u2019m going to talk about it. I don\u2019t care what they say.\u201d\n\n\n\nCarson also took aim at what he says is profligate government spending, and regulations that are holding back economic progress.\n\n\n\nHe told an audience at the Christian college the US is a \u201cJudeo-Christian nation,\u201d and immigrants should not be allowed to change the character of the country.\n\n\n\nMonika Wynne is a Spring Arbor student from Holland. Wynne says she skipped class to hear Carson.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read about his views on abortion. I\u2019m also against that. I\u2019ve read about what he thinks about Obamacare, and I also like what his views are on that. As of right now, I just like a lot of his viewpoints.\n\n\n\nCarson is in the top tier of many national polls at the moment.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Doctor Ben Carson took his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination to Michigan, with stops in Jackson yesterday and Spring Arbor University.\nCarson, who\u2019s faced criticism for saying he would not support putting a devout Muslim in the White House, blamed \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d for the blowback.\nI hate political correctness,\u201d he said to the cheers of an audience at Spring Arbor College.\nMonika Wynne is a Spring Arbor student from Holland.\nCarson is in the top tier of many national polls at the moment."}
