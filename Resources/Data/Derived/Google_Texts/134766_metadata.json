Analysts say a prolonged strike would affect the flow of oil, lumber, auto parts and other products into the United States.\n\nAnother labor dispute between ship owners and longshoremen has been going on for months now on the West Coast of this country. And, this weekend, the president dispatched Labor Secretary Thomas Perez to California to try to resolve it.\n\nFor more about this, we are joined now from Los Angeles by Christopher Thornberg. He is an economist and a founding partner of Beacon Economics.\n\nSo, Christopher, tell me, what is at the center of this dispute, and why has it gone on for something like nine months?\n\nCHRISTOPHER THORNBERG, Founding Partner, Beacon Economics, LLC: Well, we have to remember that, you know, there is a long history of tension between the longshoremen and the various owners of the shipping companies that move products in and out of those ports.\n\nThis time around, the contract was up for renewal. Those negotiations had been carrying on.\n\nI know the workers at the port have been working under the old expired contract for a number of months.\n\nContract negotiations haven\u2019t been going very fast.\n\nAnd, as a result of that, there\u2019s been kind of this, if you will, guerrilla action going on between both parties.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat of a work slowdown by one side of the equation, and, of course, these kind of weekend-long lockouts on the other side of it. And, overall, the tensions are just getting hotter and hotter.\n\nALISON STEWART: What is the fight about?\n\nCHRISTOPHER THORNBERG: Just the same old, right, wages and benefits.\n\nThe port workers are looking to really increase some of the benefits they\u2019re getting right now.\n\nAnd, at the same time, we know that technological change continues to alter operations at the port. And they\u2019re fighting very hard to try and maintain the overall level of employment at those ports.\n\nALISON STEWART: Thus far, who has been most affected by this slowdown dispute? And, if it goes on much longer, who will be most affected?\n\nCHRISTOPHER THORNBERG: When you sit down and really look at what has been happening at the ports, say, in terms of containers moving in and out, while there are these sort of delays, the overall volume hasn\u2019t dropped by very much at all, to be perfectly honest, by the numbers we have been seeing.\n\nALISON STEWART: What about farmers in the Midwest or truckers? I mean, wouldn\u2019t this affect their livelihood?\n\nCHRISTOPHER THORNBERG: At some level. But remember that a lot of farmers have alternative ways of getting their crops, shall we say, out and about.\n\nALISON STEWART: Right now, there are 29 ports affected from Southern California up to Washington State. And the backlog has been its worst in the past week, since this whole thing started.\n\nSo, what does that mean for an average consumer?\n\nCHRISTOPHER THORNBERG: Not much at this particular point in time.\n\nYou know, I realize that it\u2019s easy to make big news about these ports. You hear all the rhetoric about these being an important, almost, if you will, an artery of the U.S. economy, and if it gets cut off, we almost think about the body economy bleeding out, as the case may be.\n\nBut those kind of views are highly overstated. Go to your local supermarket, go to your local department store, the shelves are stuffed with products and goods.\n\nNobody in the United States is being denied any kind of consumption choice as a result of these disruptions. And, candidly, it would take a very long time for that to happen.\n\nThe ports are a cheap and convenient way of moving product in and out of the United States, but they are not the only way.\n\nYou can wheel stuff through Canada or Mexico. You could ship it through the East Coast. You can put it on planes. There are plenty of ways of moving product in and out.\n\nThis may be a hassle and indeed even a financial hit for some companies, but on the macro sort of level, where we look at the winners and the losers, overall, it doesn\u2019t really mean all that much for the U.S. economy, or even here in Southern California, as it may be.\n\nALISON STEWART: Christopher Thornberg, thank you so much for sharing your analysis.\n\nCHRISTOPHER THORNBERG: My pleasure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A labor dispute between shipowners and longshoreman on the West Coast has been going on for months now.
