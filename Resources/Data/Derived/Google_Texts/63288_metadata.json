But even the law\u2019s most ardent supporters \u2014 or, perhaps, especially those people \u2014 should be worried about the numbers.\n\nThe president is sure to laud ObamaCare at his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday. And no doubt he\u2019ll boast about the 11.3 million people enrolled in an ObamaCare exchange by the end of the year.\n\nThat may look like \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d to Obama administration officials. But in fact, it\u2019s an ominous sign that ObamaCare is losing what little luster it had in the marketplace.\n\nFirst off, 11.3 million is nothing to celebrate when you consider that at the end of open enrollment last year, the administration claimed that 11.7 million had signed up. By the end of the entire year, that number had been whittled down to about 9 million, of which 8.2 million re-enrolled.\n\nMore will no doubt sign up before open enrollment ends on Jan. 31. Even so, the numbers are likely be only marginally improved from last year\u2019s.\n\nAnd they will be a far cry from the 20 million that the Congressional Budget Office had been expecting, and far fewer than insurance industry experts say are needed to keep the ObamaCare insurance pools stable.\n\nThe administration also brags that ObamaCare exchanges attracted 2.5 million new customers to its Healthcare.gov site. But that\u2019s significantly fewer than the 4.7 million new customers it got last year. Most businesses would look at that trend with concern, not pride.\n\nMeanwhile, the young and healthy continue to avoid ObamaCare. The administration says 26% of enrollees are 18 to 34 years old. That\u2019s the same share as last year at this time and lower than the 28% in ObamaCare\u2019s first year. And it\u2019s well below the 40% that the administration had said was needed to keep the ObamaCare insurance markets stable.\n\nAnd by the way, Gallup\u2019s report on the uninsured \u2014 which the administration happily paraded about when it showed the number going down \u2014 finds that it climbed to 11.9% at the end of last year, the second quarterly increase.\n\nAs IBD\u2019s Jed Graham aptly put it: \u201cThe Obama administration has shifted expectations about ObamaCare to such an extent that the latest enrollment data were, quite remarkably, reported as good news.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for the White House to put a high gloss on these unhappy numbers, but it\u2019s an indictment of the mainstream press that it\u2019s willing to swallow it whole.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: The White House sees this year's ObamaCare enrollment as another big win.
