That decision, issued last month and scheduled to take effect on March 20, struck down part of the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban, which voters overwhelmingly approved in 2004. Though gay couples still cannot obtain marriage licenses from Kentucky clerks (that\u2019s the subject of a different lawsuit,) U.S. District Judge John Heyburn\u2019s ruling entitles those legally married elsewhere to the same spousal rights and benefits given to every married heterosexual couple in the state.\n\nConway is the eighth attorney general in the country to abandon such laws in the face of mounting legal victories for marriage equality.\n\nClose video Defending gay marriage ban would 'be defending discrimination\u2019 Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway (D) talks to Kristen Welker about his decision to go against Gov. Steve Beshear (D-Ky.) and support same-sex marriage. embed like save share group\n\n\u201cThere are those who believe it\u2019s my mandatory duty, regardless of my personal opinion, to continue to defend this case through the appellate process, and I have heard from many of them,\u201d said Conway in a press conference Tuesday. \u201cHowever, I came to the inescapable conclusion that, if I did so, I would be defending discrimination. That I will not do.\u201d\n\nShortly after Conway\u2019s announcement, Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear \u2013 also a Democrat \u2013 went against his state\u2019s attorney general and said he would hire outside attorneys to appeal Heyburn\u2019s Feb. 12 ruling. In a written statement, Beshear warned that there could be \u201clegal chaos\u201d if Heyburn chose not to stay his decision while the appeals process played out. As of Tuesday, no such stay had been granted beyond March 20.\n\n\u201cOther Kentucky courts may reach different and conflicting decisions,\u201d said the governor. \u201cEmployers, health care providers, governmental agencies and others faced with changing rules need a clear and certain roadmap. Also, people may take action based on this decision only to be placed at a disadvantage should a higher court reverse the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand and respect the deep and strong emotions and sincere beliefs of Kentuckians on both sides of this issue,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut all Kentuckians deserve an orderly process that will bring certainty and finality to this important matter.\u201d\n\nWhile Beshear\u2019s move makes clear the fight for marriage equality in Kentucky is far from over, gay rights advocates still applauded Tuesday\u2019s development. Marc Solomon, national campaign director at Freedom to Marry, said in a statement that the attorney general\u2019s decision was \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d and that it furthered \u201cthe case across the country that Kentucky, the South, and all of America is ready for the freedom to marry.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just same-sex marriage that Kentucky may be ready for. Despite having voted Republican in every presidential election since 1996, and its fiercely conservative representation in Congress, Kentucky now looks to be yielding some ground to the progressive agenda.\n\nClose video Kentucky Atty.

Beshear announced 265,000 Kentuckians had enrolled for Obamacare, and that over 200,000 of them did so through qualifying for Medicaid \u2013 the opposition to which has been something of a test among Republicans to measure conservative mettle. Additionally, a series of polls have shown Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in grave danger of losing his long-held Republican seat. A Rasmussen poll released last month marked the tenth to show McConnell either tied with or trailing his likely opponent, Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nTaken together, progressives are confident these signs point to a potential political shift on the horizon.\n\n\u201cFrom social issues like marriage equality to economic populism issues like increasing Social Security benefits, a populist agenda is popular even in a perceived red state like Kentucky,\u201d said Laura Friedenbach, spokesperson for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in an email to msnbc. \u201cThat\u2019s great news for Democrats, and means we should stay on offense instead of worrying about defense.\u201d\n\nConservatives see it differently, and not without good reason. Later in the week, Paducah, Ky., will host members of the Lone Oak Baptist Church as they raffle guns to families attending their \u201cSecond Amendment Celebration\u201d \u2013 hardly the picture of reigning progressivism. It also wasn\u2019t that long ago that Kentucky\u2019s junior Republican senator, Rand Paul, made the link between same-sex marriage and marriage between a human and non-human, before squashing the suggestion as a joke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a seismic shift within the state,\u201d said Scott Lasley, Chairman of the Warren County GOP and a political science professor at Western Kentucky University, to msnbc. \u201cMy general sense is that all these things people are looking for, it\u2019s something that\u2019s not quite there. This is still going to be one of the most conservative states out there.\u201d\n\nMaybe so. But if Kentucky isn\u2019t taking home the \u201cprogressive state of the year\u201d award anytime soon, it may at least be in the running for the \u201cbluest red state\u201d title.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "On Tuesday, Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway announced he would not be appealing a federal order striking down part of Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-bluest-red-state", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "On Tuesday, Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway announced he would not be appealing a federal order striking down part of Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban.", "title": "Kentucky attorney general won't appeal gay marriage ruling", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-bluest-red-state", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/ap360829666560.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-bluest-red-state", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap360829666560.jpg?itok=9Y7dKZ9m", "title": "Kentucky attorney general won't appeal gay marriage ruling", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "On Tuesday, Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway announced he would not be appealing a federal order striking down part of Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-04T19:43:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "emma-margolin", "tags": "democrats,election-2014,elections,equality,health,health-care-reform,lgbt,marriage-equality,mitch-mcconnell,obamacare,rand-paul,republicans", "title": "Kentucky attorney general won't appeal gay marriage ruling", "published": 1, "date": "03/04/2014 19:43:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-bluest-red-state"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "On Tuesday, Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway announced he would not be appealing a federal order striking down part of Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Elections, Election 2014, Equality, LGBT, Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Marriage Equality, Mitch McConnell, Obamacare, Rand Paul"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a56\"", "article_summary": "Steve Beshear \u2013 also a Democrat \u2013 went against his state\u2019s attorney general and said he would hire outside attorneys to appeal Heyburn\u2019s Feb. 12 ruling.\nClose video Defending gay marriage ban would 'be defending discrimination\u2019 Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway (D) talks to Kristen Welker about his decision to go against Gov.\nGeneral won't defend gay marriage ban As new poll numbers show rising support for same-sex marriage, NBC\u2019s Pete Williams reports on the latest legal wrangling and the Kentucky Atty.\nConway is the eighth attorney general in the country to abandon such laws in the face of mounting legal victories for marriage equality.\nGeneral\u2019s decision not to defend the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban."}
