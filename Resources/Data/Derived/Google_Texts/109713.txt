Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) offered rival and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) a rhetorical "juice box" after a few rounds of sparring about their respective records during Tuesday night's undercard Republican presidential debate.

In response to a question on Obamacare, Jindal cast himself as the only person in the Republican presidential race other than former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) who has a concrete plan to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He also stressed that he was the only candidate to reject Medicaid expansion in his state.

Jindal then threw Christie a compliment: he said Christie "married well," adding "I love Mary Pat." The Louisiana governor had criticized the state of New Jersey's finances minutes earlier.

But the nice-guy act quickly fell away.

"Chris, look, I'll give you a ribbon for participation. And a juice box," Jindal said to a low cries of "oooh" from the audience. "But in the real world it's about results. It's about actually cutting government spending, not talking about cutting government spending."
