They assert that \u201cchanges in U.S. policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the U.S. for undocumented youth\u201d have accounted, in part, for the surge of illegal immigrant children pouring into the country.\n\nThe Obama administration enacted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, and some illegal immigrant children have reportedly been told that they will be given amnesty if they successfully cross America\u2019s southern border. Obama has also been pushing for amnesty for all the country\u2019s illegal immigrants and has suggested that he would unilaterally act to ease deportations if Congress does not pass amnesty. This may give illegal immigrants more incentive to attempt to enter the country illegally.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Administration Providing Illegal Immigrants Taxpayer-Funded Lawyers", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Administration Providing Illegal Immigrants Taxpayer-Funded Lawyers", "title": "Obama Administration Providing Illegal Immigrants Taxpayer-Funded Lawyers - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/07/Houston-Stash-House-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/07/obama-admin-providing-illegal-immigrants-with-taxpayer-funded-lawyers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Administration Providing Illegal Immigrants Taxpayer-Funded Lawyers", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/07/Houston-Stash-House-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Providing Illegal Immigrants Taxpayer-Funded Lawyers - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Eric Holder, Illegal Immigrants, New York Times,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "New York Times", "published_time": "2014-06-07T12:53:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration will spend $2 million dollars of taxpayer funds to provide illegal immigrant children with legal representation.\nThis may give illegal immigrants more incentive to attempt to enter the country illegally.\nObama has also been pushing for amnesty for all the country\u2019s illegal immigrants and has suggested that he would unilaterally act to ease deportations if Congress does not pass amnesty.\nThe Obama administration enacted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, and some illegal immigrant children have reportedly been told that they will be given amnesty if they successfully cross America\u2019s southern border.\nThey assert that \u201cchanges in U.S. policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the U.S. for undocumented youth\u201d have accounted, in part, for the surge of illegal immigrant children pouring into the country."}
