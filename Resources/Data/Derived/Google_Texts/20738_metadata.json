The company is seeking to raise \u00a3250,000 to begin its expansion less than a year after its establishment.\n\nWhile sharing details about Love Thy Mutt\u2019s products and services, founder David Davidian shared:\n\n\u201cLove thy Mutt has a broad and growing range of products that cater for the needs of dogs and owners. This includes perishables such as shampoos, perfumes and treats, through to fun toys, bowls, cushions and the most stylish collars and leads. \u201cOur devotion to our furry friends is lovingly expressed in every single one of our products. And \u2018Love Thy Mutt\u2019 is only the beginning for us with \u2018Love Thy Moggy\u2019 and \u2018Love Thy Small Pet\u2019 coming down the track. Some people have even told us that \u2018Love Thy Pet\u2019 should be the Eleventh Commandment! With dogs being the most popular UK household pet (of an estimated 46 percent of UK households owning pets, almost a quarter of this is dogs making it the most popular pet animal in the UK) we have focussed our product base here in the UK. \u201cAll of our gorgeous smelling shampoos and perfumes are made in the UK and come in a large variety of scents to reflect personal tastes and a dogs personality, further enhancing the bond between dog and owner whilst keeping clean and fresh. With dog grooming and pet spas being an increasingly popular trend, those who can\u2019t afford such services or wish to keep thier dog in top shape in between visits, can buy into our affordable products with beautifully, designed, premium packaging and a strong British-herritage feel. \u201cOur range of Collars, leads and add on charms enable the customer to mix and match in order to express the individual personality of their dog. \u2018Many owners increasingly think of their pets as an extension of themselves and want to dress them to reflect this. \u2018 Paula Flores, head of pet care research at Eurpomonitor. Each of our dog ranges reflects the different sides of Paul O\u2019Gradys personaity and draws on the high steet retail method of having varying styles to suit a broad range of customers within one brand. We always put a signature Love Thy Mutt twist on any trend, British herritage-style being close to our heart.\u201d\n\nDavidian also revealed what makes it stand out from other pet accessory brands:\n\nNational treasures: \u201cPaul O\u2019 \u2018Grady\u2019s returning ITV dogs series reaches into 5 million animal loving households when it is on TV. Paul is our first ambassador and we feel no other celebrity has a stronger association with dogs so our business model cannot be copied or rivalled. The co-founders include the original Chairman of ASOS and co-founders of Love Thy Mutt include the owner of The Outdoor Shop and former Head of Arts and Popular Culture at ITV, who between them have a broad access to other National Treasures who we will use as our brand grows.\u201d\n\nDesign ability: \u201cOur ranges are designed by our in-house design team who have years of experience designing. With worldwide giants such as H&M now having pet collar and lead ranges front of till, and referring back to earlier point that many consumers see pets as an extension of themselves, the need to be relevant and current in terms of fashion and style is ever growing. The trend for dog products is expanding well beyond specialist pet stores and supermarkets and Love Thy Mutt aims to be at the forefront of the growing trends with a strong design team behind them.\u201d\n\nBranding, Packaging and Identity: \u201cAs well as our USP of Paul O\u2019Gradys endorsement, branding and packaging is hugely important to the image of Love Thy Mutt so that it stands out from the crowd in a competitive market. We believe that our brand name is strong, memorable and has mass-appeal. Our brand logo has a distinctive British heritage-vibe and on our current range of dog products, the drawing on the packaging represents Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s favorite famous dog Olga, adding character and love to our brand.\u201d\n\nWhat it has achieved to date: \u201cLove Thy Mutt\u2019s first range is currently being sold in Pets at Home. We have a five year deal with Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s management company to use his name across our range of dog products.\u201d\n\nFunds from Crowdcube will be used for Love Thy Mutt\u2019s website along with investment in stock, web and digital marketing and our brand Ambassador program.\n\nSince its launch, the campaign has successfully raised nearly \u00a380,000 from 13 investors. It is set to close mid-October.\n\n____________________________________________", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "accessories, animals, crowdcube, david davidian, dogs, love thy mutt, pets, finance, fintech, crowdfunding, marketplace lending, peer to peer lending", "ca_image": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Love-Thy-Mutt-2-150x150.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Crowdfund Insider", "description": "Love Thy Mutt, a\u00a0Barnet-based pet accessory startup, has launched an equity crowdfunding campaign on Crowdcube.
