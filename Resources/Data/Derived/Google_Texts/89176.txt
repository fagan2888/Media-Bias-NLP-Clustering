In a new article at AlterNet, Noam Chomsky describes the United States as a “rogue state” operating under the leadership of a “one-party” system. He recommends that the global community “de-Americanize” itself by separating from a “reigning military power [that] is losing credibility in other domains.”

Chomsky describes the U.S. as an ill-functioning and unruly hegemonic power, stewarded in large part by a coalition of business interests that can no longer control the populist forces they’ve unleashed as a “battering ram in the neoliberal assault against the population.” The GOP establishment has had some success, Chomsky grants, “but now finds that it can no longer control its base, much to its dismay.” He cites the virulent response to Obamacare, and the recent government shutdown, as cases-in-point.

Chomsky saves his greatest indignation, however, for the U.S.’s recent capture and interrogation of the terrorist suspect Abu Anas al-Libi, seized by U.S. forces in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. “U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry informed the press that the actions are legal because they comply with American law, eliciting no particular comment,” Chomsky writes. “Principles are valid only if they are universal,” he continues. “Reactions would be a bit different, needless to say, if Cuban special forces kidnapped the prominent terrorist Luis Posada Carriles in Miami, bringing him to Cuba for interrogation and trial in accordance with Cuban law.
