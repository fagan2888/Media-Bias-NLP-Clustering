DALLAS — There’s a first time for everything, but Nuggets guard Gary Harris wishes there wasn’t a first time for this — a concussion, which kept him out of Saturday night’s game at Dallas.

“I’ve never had anything like this ever before,” Harris said.

He’s officially day to day, but he must pass tests and be cleared by a doctor before he can return to the court, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. The Nuggets’ starting shooting guard was injured taking a hit to the head/jaw area as he tried to get through a screen during the game against San Antonio on Friday night.

“He got the hit, we took him out, put him back in the game,” Malone said. “He attempted a shot, and Gary’s one of our best shooters, and the shot was way off. But then, when he was on defense and he was facing me, he just didn’t look right. (Nuggets head trainer) Dan Shimensky saw it as well, so we got him out, did the testing. … We’ll see when we can get him back.”

Said Harris: “Yeah, it’s just taking it day by day. It’s making sure my mind’s right and feeling better. … It’s really just making sure everything is good.”

Keeping Wilson close. Now that Wilson Chandler has already had surgery and begun the rehab process, Malone is insistent about keeping him around and active with the team as much as possible.

“That was one thing that I felt very strongly about,” Malone said. “Even though the season has been taken from him, it’s important that we have Wilson around … just for his own sanity, if you will. Make sure he feels a part of it, still. So once he starts traveling, we’ll have him travel with us the whole time. I might even give him a clipboard so he can be one of our coaches.” Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post
