No other national poll taken over the last month has O\u2019Malley higher than seven percent or Hillary\u2019s lead over Sanders lower than 15 points.\n\nBut since it\u2019s Thanksgiving eve and most of us are already drinking, let\u2019s not strain too hard pondering plausibility. Let\u2019s just think about President Trump.\n\nRubio and Cruz both believe that if they can somehow end up as the last man standing against Trump, it\u2019s a cinch they\u2019ll be the nominee. If you believe these numbers, they\u2019re kidding themselves. As for what happens if Trump falters and we end up with a Rubio/Cruz finale, Cruz wins that one-on-one 55/45 according to YouGov. That also strikes me as implausible \u2014 the margin, not the baseline result \u2014 but it\u2019s more plausible than the idea that Trump\u2019s going to crush Ted Cruz by 14 points once Cruz has united social conservatives, most tea partiers, and most of the \u201cAnyone But Trump!\u201d vote among the wider party behind him. Then again, the idea of the race settling into a two-man battle for the nomination may itself be implausible. If you subscribe to the \u201clanes\u201d theory of the primary, with Rubio in the \u201cestablishment\u201d lane, Cruz in the \u201cconservative\u201d lane, and Trump in the \u201cpopulist outsider\u201d lane, we may be destined for a bunch of primary results in which each of them effectively has a floor of 25 percent or so and a ceiling of 40 percent. That means delegates will be fairly evenly split during the first six weeks of the race, before the winner-take-all states start voting, which in turn means we may end up with none of the three able to clinch a majority before the convention. How does a brokered convention between Rubio and Cruz with Trump as a wild card sound next year? Free advice: Save some of your holiday liquor for next summer.\n\nHere\u2019s Rubio at his most Rubio-esque, insisting that the U.S. must defend Turkey against any Russian escalation after yesterday\u2019s jet shootdown. On the one hand, that\u2019s basic hawkish common sense: If your big problem with Obama is that he\u2019s easily pushed around by adversaries like Putin and unreliable when U.S. allies need American help, then obviously some muscle-flexing is in order when NATO\u2019s credibility is on the line. The alternative, abandoning Turkey and effectively collapsing NATO, would be the final proof that the United States is a fair-weather friend, even when there\u2019s a binding treaty obligation at stake. On the other hand, if you think Americans are wary of major foreign interventions now, good luck explaining to them that we need to risk World War III with a nuclear superpower in order to defend a Muslim country that\u2019s been trending for years towards Islamist dictatorship. And not just any nuclear superpower but one that\u2019s currently bombing ISIS positions in Syria (along with some U.S.-allied rebels too, mind you). The worst possible domestic pitch for maintaining NATO, even in an era of Russian revanchism, is letting it be used as a lever for defending Islamists. Maybe Rubio\u2019s right that Putin would glean from U.S. inaction that he can mess with any NATO country going forward \u2014 or maybe he would realize that the urgency of defending Turkey from Russia and the urgency of defending, say, Poland from Russia are different in western eyes. It\u2019s the end of NATO either way, but whether Rubio\u2019s right that weakness in this particular case would invite much more Russian aggression is an open question.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oh my.", "title": "YouGov poll: Trump leads Rubio and Cruz head to head \u2014 by double digits", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/25/yougov-poll-trump-leads-rubio-and-cruz-head-to-head-by-double-digits/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/h2h.jpg", "height": 219}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-25T22:01:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T21:58:33+00:00"}, "keywords": "cruz, GOP, head to head, poll, republican, rubio, trump, yougov,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "YouGov poll: Trump leads Rubio and Cruz head to head \u2014 by double digitsposted at 5:01 pm on November 25, 2015 by AllahpunditThis same poll has Hillary up by five points over Bernie Sanders, with Martin O\u2019Malley in double digits at 10 percent.\nHow does a brokered convention between Rubio and Cruz with Trump as a wild card sound next year?\nRubio and Cruz both believe that if they can somehow end up as the last man standing against Trump, it\u2019s a cinch they\u2019ll be the nominee.\nAs for what happens if Trump falters and we end up with a Rubio/Cruz finale, Cruz wins that one-on-one 55/45 according to YouGov.\nHere\u2019s Rubio at his most Rubio-esque, insisting that the U.S. must defend Turkey against any Russian escalation after yesterday\u2019s jet shootdown."}
