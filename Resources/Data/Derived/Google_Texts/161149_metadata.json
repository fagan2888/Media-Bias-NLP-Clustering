Brian Cousineau, spokesman for the Englewood Police Department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a suspicious death,\u201d Cousineau said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the DA\u2019s office and the coroner involved.\u201d\n\nA person was walking through the park early Saturday when he saw a person who appeared to be in trouble, he said. When police arrived they determined that the person was actually dead, he said.\n\nCousineau said he could not release details about the victim including the identity, gender or age of the person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a very preliminary stage of the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice cordoned off the area and rerouted a portion of the 5K and 10K Jeremy Bitner Fallen Officer Run, which began and ends at Cornerstone Park.\n\n\u201cThe race was altered so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with the crime scene investigation,\u201d Cousineau said.\n\nOfficer Bitner was killed May 28, 2012, when he was struck by a vehicle during a traffic stop.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Englewood police investigating a possible homicide after body found in park", "title": "Englewood police investigating a possible homicide after body found in park", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/14/englewood-police-investigating-a-possible-homicide-after-body-found-in-park/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T11:36:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T11:36:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Officer Bitner was killed May 28, 2012, when he was struck by a vehicle during a traffic stop.\n\u201cThe race was altered so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with the crime scene investigation,\u201d Cousineau said.\nEnglewood police diverted a race in honor of a police officer killed in the line of duty after a body was discovered Saturday morning along the race course at Belleview Park, authorities say.\nThe police department was called about the body found near South Lipan Street and West Chenango Avenue at 6:30 a.m., said Sgt.\nPolice cordoned off the area and rerouted a portion of the 5K and 10K Jeremy Bitner Fallen Officer Run, which began and ends at Cornerstone Park."}
