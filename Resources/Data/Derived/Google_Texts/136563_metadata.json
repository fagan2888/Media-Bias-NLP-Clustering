Attorney Claude Montgomery of the Denton Law Firm presented a very vague presentation (2-3 pages) of a Volunteer Employee Benefits Agreement (VEBA) to the Board and requested 5.5 million dollars for the VEBA.\n\nThis request was made last week also, without the professionalism or respect of any written materials. However, the board did not vote or endorse last week.\n\nTom Sheehan, DGRS chair\n\nThe board voted 3-2 to give the US Bankruptcy Court-appointed board (see attached order and membership below) $5.5 million (yeas Thomas Sheehan, Lou Hatty, Lori Cetlinskii-nays June Nickelberry and Tasha Cowan). The board benefits committee approved a motion requesting membership on the VEBA board, which was not tie barred to the $5.5 million. During the discussion trustee Hatty was concerned whether 5.5 million dollars was sufficient, particularly as it relates to prescription costs.\n\n(VOD note: The 4th Plan of Adjustment specifies clearly that only the Official Committee of Retirees (OCR), which Denton represents, and the Detroit Retired City Employees Association\u2013DRCEA, led by Shirley Lightsey, will sit on the DGRS VEBA board.\n\nLou Hatty\n\nFor the Police and Fire Retirement System, only the Official Committee of Retirees and the Detroit Police and Firefighters Association, led by Don Taylor, will sit on that board. This opportunity to make money off the VEBA\u2019s, which are nothing but bank trusts which DO NOT GUARANTEE payment of ANY health benefits (as specified in the 4th Plan of Adjustment,) is clearly behind the DRCEA and DPFFA endorsements of the 4th Plan of Adjustment.\n\nThese associations DO NOT represent the majority of city retirees, despite their lies to the contrary. Their leadership is NOT ELECTED by city workers and retirees. There will BE NO MEMBERSHIP FOR DGRS on the VEBA board. If the 4th Plan of Adjustment goes through, the retirement systems, the unions and all parties who have lawsuits pending in the Sixth Circuit Court, the U.S. District Court, and the state courts, will have to WITHDRAW city retirees\u2019 last hope of legal appeal.)\n\nPension board trustees need to be knowledgeable of the 4th Plan of Adjustment specifically related to \u201cother post employment benefits\u201d OPEB and VEBA. It appears that they are endorsing privatization of our health care benefits and relinquishing oversight to an unknown and unproven authority. VEBA\u2019s have only been used in the private sector and generally have expensive administration costs. This creates a new entity at our expense.\n\nThe GRS and PFRS already have a historical knowledge base or access to expertise in providing benefits and could purchase a group health care plan via request for proposal. This court appointed retirees committee board has already endorsed the 4th Amendment to the Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment and are used as an authority replacing our elected Pension Board.\n\nRemember, this is the bankruptcy court-appointed retiree board (click on Court Appointed Retiree Committee letter) that voted (3 to 5-one member abstained) to eliminate health care benefits for retirees under 65 years of age and allocated a measly $125 dollars stipend for health care. Retirees by design were forced to apply for the President\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act plan, which is affordable up to about 130% of the Federal Poverty Level (see attachment) or $1245 monthly for an individual. Most retirees pensions are about $1583 monthly and now are paying between $300-600 monthly for health care benefits, not including prescriptions.\n\nNOTE: THE DETROIT BANKUPTCY PLAN USES 105% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID FOR RETIREES. EVEN CHURCHES GIVING OUT FREE FOOD USE 200% OF THE GUIDELINE!\n\n(Click on 2014 Federal Poverty Levels to view chart above in larger PDF file.)\n\nRemember, litigation is still pending and objections have been filed against the legality of dumping a health care benefit contractually promised. (VOD\u2013Chapter 9, while not protecting public pensions except against an unfair and unequitable plan, DOES protect retiree health care benefits.)\n\nPlease note that the Denton Law Firm represents the court appointed retiree committee, sounds like the fox may be in the hen house. The Denton Law firm is being paid for by the city via Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes and the U.S. Trustee\u2019s approval. The US court appointed committee has also been indemnified (held Harmless) against law suits for the decision they make and the members they represent. Pension Board Trustees must be held accountable for the decision that they make with our money. CALL THE TRUSTEES!\n\nVOD has located likely home phone numbers on People Smart for Trustees who voted for the $5.5 million, since the DGRS general number at 224-3362 has been swamped, and those answering it cannot respond to questions about the board members\u2019 votes.\n\nThomas R. Sheehan, DGRS Chair 248-677-3320 (Royal Oak) 313-822-5783\n\nLou Hatty 313-882-6017\n\nLori Cetlinski 313-642-0124 734-301-3053, 734-642-0124, 313-521-3703 (who according to People Smart lives in Grosse Ile)\n\nSTATEMENT ON THE GRAND BARGAIN\u2013VOTE NO!\n\nBy Mayoral Candidate Tom Barrow\n\nJune 4, 2014\u2013Facebook\n\nA number of Detroit pensioners have asked me whether they should vote \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d on the so-called \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d. While I explained that I am not a city retiree, I also explained that my mother was and therefore I agreed to say what I believe would have been in my mom\u2019s best interest.\n\nMattie Barrow\n\nI begin by stating that I have read the voluminous 3\u2033 thick document (no average senior citizen will likely ever read nor understand its complex legalese). I have also read the proposed ballot received to cast a vote. Having said that, I am convinced the \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d is not a bargain for retirees. It is a proposal which shifts the focus to the most vulnerable as if somehow they are responsible for the city\u2019s phony malaise.\n\nThe first glaring abnormality of the \u201cBargain\u201d is that it requires retirees to waive essential constitutional rights to sue the State or City. This means that if current pending lawsuits surrounding the EM law are struck down, retirees will have consented to cut their own income and all of their generationally promised benefits. Why, because the pension is a state constitutional obligation. This alone should cause any retiree to question how grand the \u201cBargain\u201d truly is.\n\nSenior city retirees protest bankruptcy plan at court April 1, 2014.\n\nIn my view, the truth is the \u201cbargain\u201d is a subliminal deal to get state funding necessary to transfer the DIA and its art assets into others hands allowing it to spin off from the control of the City of Detroit and thus its people. The \u201cbargain\u201d also provides for a extreme reductions in benefits to those barely living and already sacrificing food for medicine. In short, it is a license to imprison and impoverish yourself.\n\nIt is no secret that I have long stated that this entire bankruptcy was phony, contrived and intended to transfer wealth and a nearly last piece which involves pensioners who have relied on the promise. It wants seniors to consent to cut their own throat and is, in my view, absurd. For these and a bevy of other unspoken reasons, I would have urged my own mother to vote \u201cNO\u201d as the \u201cBargain\u201d is no bargain for you as the City of Detroit\u2019s consent to transfer its own wealth should not be on your back. In my view, Conservatives are going to do what ever they want to do\u2026he just would like to have your consent to point to it later! \u2013 \u2013 PLEASE SHARE \u2013\n\nRelated article:\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/05/20/racist-detroit-bankruptcy-plan-11-5-billion-for-banks-0-for-retirees-vote-no-or-lose-appeal-rights/\n\nVOD related article also available in PDF at RACIST DETROIT BANKRUPTCY PLAN VOD,\n\nTo read the entire POA4 and its Disclosure Statement, click on\n\n4th amended Plan of Adjustment http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket4392.pdf\n\n4th amended Disclosure Statement http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket4391.pdf.\n\n(P.S. thanks to Jamon Jordan for asking what the heck DGRS is.
