Tim Middagh/Daily Globe\n\nWORTHINGTON \u2014 Hundreds of southern Minnesota residents gathered in Worthington Saturday afternoon to officially endorse Rep. Tim Walz as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate in the state\u2019s First Congressional District.\n\nWalz, a veteran, teacher and five-term Congressman, accepted the nomination during the DFL First Congressional District Convention with his wife, Gwen, daughter Hope and son Gus by his side.\n\nIt was 10 years ago that Walz and his wife, both teachers in the Mankato school district, sought the support of voters in a campaign for the First Congressional seat. He said Saturday he went to the convention \u201cwith the unshakeable belief that it was our generation\u2019s responsibility to make a difference in this country.\u201d\n\nA decade later, Walz said he has less hair, bigger kids and more friends, but he has brought \u201ca lot of positive change,\u201d noting his support for the Affordable Care, DREAM and Stock acts, his support for veterans, increasing the minimum wage and affordable college tuition.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act wasn\u2019t about insurance, it was about health care,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd. \u201cTwenty million of our fellow citizens can now go see someone when they need to and get the health care they deserve.\u201d\n\nAs for his support of funding for college education, Walz said, \u201cIf this nation wants to continue to innovate, continue to move forward, continue to prosper \u2026 we have to have the healthiest and best educated population there is. That\u2019s not government giving things away, that\u2019s smart investment.\u201d\n\nHe told the gathering that while much has been done thus far to move the country forward, it\u2019s only a start. Noting the Republican First Congressional District Convention hosted a week prior, Walz said contrary to what they might believe, \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here today to beat Republicans. We came here today to make a better country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a game and it\u2019s not about my team winning. It\u2019s about policies that actually work,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make the choices that improve people\u2019s lives, that are based on science, based on the things we know work, an economy that does work. You didn\u2019t come just to make sure Democrats win, but there is a correlation. If we don\u2019t win, those things don\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Walz said the country needs people who believe in the political system and, as such, Citizens United needs to be overturned. He also said it is time to address climate change for a more stable, sustainable future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s with great humbleness, it\u2019s with great appreciation, that we accept this nomination. I am honored every single day \u2026 to represent the people of southern Minnesota.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in support of Walz and the DFL party supporters via video were U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken.\n\n\u201cFrom supporting farmers in rural communities to investing in transportation, investing in good jobs, Tim understands what is needed in southern Minnesota,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cMinnesota\u2019s families and America\u2019s families are counting on us once again. It\u2019s time to give the American people their country back. We\u2019re fighting to take back the U.S. Senate and take back the White House.\u201d\n\nFranken echoed Klobuchar\u2019s comments, saying \u201c2016 is a crucially important year\u201d for the democratic party.\n\nPrior to Walz\u2019s acceptance of the endorsement, Nobles County DFL Chairwoman Deb Hogenson and Rock County DFL Chairman Dale Moerke were among a trio of individuals to speak in support of Walz\u2019s reelection.\n\nHogenson praised Walz for his work on the Affordable Care Act, saying that if it hadn\u2019t been for the health care reform, she and her husband \u2014 both facing health issues in the past six months \u2014 would have faced devastating financial consequences.\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s courageous vote for health care reform literally saved us from financial disaster,\u201d Hogenson said. \u201cDoug and I will always be grateful for the security that comes from health care coverage that can not be taken away.\u201d\n\nMoerke, a 31-year member of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, said Walz has been supportive of organized labor and is quick to respond to any issues in the far southwest corner of his district.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of issues and Tim Walz has been able to support us, whether it\u2019s affordable housing, paycheck fairness and even infrastructure,\u201d Moerke said. \u201cWalz was here to make sure we had the disaster assistance we needed (after the ice storm and spring flooding). Tim has always been here when we\u2019ve needed him and he will continue to be there. I\u2019m proud to support him again as our congressman.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson addressed the gathering briefly, reiterating the hard work ahead for the DFL party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got real issues, folks,\u201d she said, outlining the state\u2019s drop in average wages, Minnesota\u2019s ranking as the 12th highest in the nation for out-of-pocket costs for health care and fifth highest ranking in student loan debt. Parents are dipping into their own retirement savings to help their children with the high costs of college, she said.\n\nState DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin spoke of the importance of putting a democrat back in the White House, saying the next president will appoint up to four Supreme Court justices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people who believe it\u2019s going to be easy to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Martin said. \u201cRemember 1998? We said the same thing about someone running for governor and we woke up the next day and we had Gov. Ventura.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a tough election. We need to do what Paul Wellstone always did \u2014 run like we\u2019re 20 points behind, go door to door, neighbor to neighbor, person to person, talking about our values.\u201d\n\nAs part of the convention, several DFL-endorsed candidates spoke briefly about their 2016 campaign. Among them was Kirby Kruse, who is seeking the Minnesota House seat in Dist. 22B currently occupied by Rep. Rod Hamilton.\n\n\u201cWe need to get back control of the House,\u201d Kruse told his fellow Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re just a week out of the end of the session and we still have no bonding bill by the people holding the majority.\u201d\n\nTo wrap up Saturday\u2019s convention, attendees were tasked with electing delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. As determined by the outcome of the precinct caucuses earlier this year, the First Congressional District will send three delegates in support of candidate Bernie Sanders and two delegates in support of Hillary Clinton. Hogenson, who was elected chairperson of the First Congressional District earlier in the afternoon, was elected a delegate in support of Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,worthington,dfl,District,walz,Caucus,endorse,Candidate,liberal", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julie Buntjer", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Globe", "description": "WORTHINGTON \u2014 Hundreds of southern Minnesota residents gathered in Worthington Saturday afternoon to officially endorse Rep.
