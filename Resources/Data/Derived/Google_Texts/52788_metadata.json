Beneficial rain will be the main feature with the activity this morning.\n\nThe chance for strong and severe storms increases this afternoon across a large part of KAKEland. Hail, high wind and very isolated tornadoes are possible.\n\nThe best chance for storms comes through tonight and overnight. Central and south central Kansas, including Wichita, could get some locally heavy rain and isolated severe storms.
