The Lucky Puppy Rescue held it's annual "Spay-Ghetti" luncheon Saturday at Pineapple Willy's.

Adoptable dogs joined the party and guests were encouraged to help save a life.

A $10 donation was accepted, which provided entry to the event, where guests sampled different types of spaghetti and voted on their favorite.

Money raised goes back to the rescue for all their services, including spaying and neutering.

Employees said on average it costs about $100 to spay and neuter each dog.

Teri Mattson, the Director of The Lucky Puppy Rescue said,

"We came up with this several years ago 'Spay-Ghetti' because it goes along with raising money for the spays and that's our main goal, to prevent more puppies that don't have homes."

Mattson said last year 202 dogs were spayed and neutered at the Lucky Puppy rescue.

Their goal this year is 365.
