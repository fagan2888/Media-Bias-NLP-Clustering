Schiliro's Obamacare lessons\n\nFor the whole month of January, Phil Schiliro and the rest of the administration\u2019s Obamacare team had one goal: Treat every day like a potential Y2K.\n\nThat was the crisis that never actually happened, of course \u2014 the massive computer meltdown that was supposed to happen on New Year\u2019s Day 2000. But by January 2014, the Affordable Care Act rollout had already had its equivalent of an actual Y2K: the federal website disaster that started the enrollment season on such an embarrassing note.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo when Schiliro returned to the White House in December to help put implementation back on track, he and the rest of the team wanted to become more active in foreseeing other disasters. And one of the most widely predicted ones \u2014 which had actually happened to seniors during the Medicare Part D launch in 2006 \u2014 was that hordes of Obamacare customers would think they were covered and then find out that they weren\u2019t.\n\nSchiliro is back in Santa Fe now, his temporary stint at the White House finally over after being extended a few times. In a wide-ranging phone interview about the law and the rescue effort, Schiliro said the all-out effort to prevent even worse disasters from happening \u2014 and for the administration to be better prepared than it was at the initial launch \u2014 was a prime example of the lessons the Obama administration learned from the early rollout stumbles.\n\n( Schiliro Opinion: The Affordable Care Act Is Working)\n\n\u201cWe had to approach every day as if it was Y2K,\u201d Schiliro said. The be-prepared-for-anything approach worked, he said \u2014 because the feared wave of stories of angry, uninsured Obamacare customers never happened.\n\nThe administration reached out to insurers, hospitals, providers and pharmacies to get their ideas on how to head off troubles, Schiliro said. Pharmacies helped by volunteering to provide prescription medications for a month if customers said they were having coverage disputes.\n\nAnd the administration put together a team of specialists, based at the Department of Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to handle any difficult coverage disputes that did come up, with the ability to help solve them in real time.\n\n\u201cWe had a team \u2026 that was ready to respond to anything on Jan. 1,\u201d Schiliro said. \u201cAnd then, when we got through Jan. 1, we had to prepare as if Jan. 2 was Y2K. And then we had to stay on alert for the whole month of January.\u201d\n\nThey also staffed up the call center at HealthCare.gov, the federal enrollment website, to handle questions from customers, hospitals and pharmacies \u2014 with the most complicated cases being given to the special response team.\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\nThe disaster-prevention strategy was just one of the lessons the administration learned from the rollout, Schiliro said. The government also needs to change its procurement practices, he said, as President Barack Obama has talked about. But another key, he said, is to eliminate uncertainty among the health care industry groups that are affected by the law.\n\nThat\u2019s why he said the administration made a point of releasing the rules for the next enrollment season early. The 400-page rule on health exchange and insurance standards for 2015 came out last week, and he said the goal was to give insurers plenty of time to prepare and avoid a repeat of what happened last year, \u201cwhen the rules were still being changed very late.\u201d\n\nAnother lesson, he said, was that the White House needs a senior-level permanent staffer \u2014 rather than a temporary one like he was \u2014 who can focus on the law\u2019s implementation and have easy access to Obama and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough when disputes arise between agencies and departments.\n\nThat\u2019s the role he says will now be filled by Kristie Canegallo, the new White House deputy chief of staff who will replace him overseeing the ACA but also has a broader portfolio of other policy implementation issues.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: NRA stalls surgeon general pick)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just an extraordinarily impressive person,\u201d Schiliro said of Canegallo, who worked closely with him on the rescue effort. He said her multi-issue assignment shouldn\u2019t be a problem: \u201cShe can handle a lot of issues at once, but she\u2019s also able to drill down on any one of them in a great amount of detail.\u201d\n\nSchiliro said the administration also learned an obvious-sounding but important lesson: Just listen to people.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cWe had to approach every day as if it was Y2K,\u201d he says of rescuing HealthCare.gov.", "title": "Schiliro's Obamacare lessons", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/phil-schiliro-obamacare-health-care-white-house-exit-interview-obama-107038.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/06/131206_phil_schiliro_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Phil Schiliro,Health Care,Technology,Insurance,HealthCare.Gov,White House", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u201cWe had to approach every day as if it was Y2K,\u201d he says of rescuing HealthCare.gov.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe040c\"", "article_summary": "Schiliro's Obamacare lessonsFor the whole month of January, Phil Schiliro and the rest of the administration\u2019s Obamacare team had one goal: Treat every day like a potential Y2K.\nThe be-prepared-for-anything approach worked, he said \u2014 because the feared wave of stories of angry, uninsured Obamacare customers never happened.\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)The disaster-prevention strategy was just one of the lessons the administration learned from the rollout, Schiliro said.\n( Schiliro Opinion: The Affordable Care Act Is Working)\u201cWe had to approach every day as if it was Y2K,\u201d Schiliro said.\nSchiliro is back in Santa Fe now, his temporary stint at the White House finally over after being extended a few times."}
