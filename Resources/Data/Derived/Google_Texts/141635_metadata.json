Frank Wolf, R-Va., rode into office with the troops of the Reagan Revolution in 1980, quickly earning his stripes as a fierce cold warrior and staunch defender of human rights, and has represented his district in Northern Virginia in Congress ever since.\n\nWolf persuaded President Ronald Reagan to switch to a hardline policy toward the brutal regime of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who President Jimmy Carter had considered a reformer, as recounted in the WND Books bestseller \u201cDisinformation\u201d by Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa.\n\nWolf even lived to tell the tale of his own cloak-and-dagger escapade behind the Iron Curtain, chased by secret police while helping smuggle Pacepa\u2019s daughter, Dana, from Romania.\n\nDuring his three decades in Washington, Wolf has earned a well-deserved reputation among many as the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d for his tireless defense of human rights around the world. The Washington Post called the 74-year-old \u201ca vocal and sometimes lonely advocate for oppressed religious minorities, particularly Christians in Egypt, Syria and Pakistan.\u201d\n\nTo the astonishment of nearly everyone in Washington, even his staff, Wolf announced Tuesday that he will not seek an 18th term in 2014. Instead, he will pursue his humanitarian work full time.\n\nAnd, just as suddenly, a \u201csafe\u201d GOP seat in Congress was up for grabs.\n\nMicrocosm of the nation\n\nBut it is also a seat that may represent a microcosm of a nation in transition.\n\nWolf\u2019s career has straddled two distinctly opposite eras, entering office as Reagan began dismantling big government and departing as President Obama has been rebuilding it.\n\nA key question now is, which direction will the Virginian\u2019s successor go?\n\nThat could provide a major clue as to which way the country will go, in the congressional elections of 2014 and the presidential election of 2016.\n\nWolf\u2019s 10th district in Virginia has similarities to the nation at large. Traditionally center-right, a significant part of it has moved leftward in recent years.\n\nWhile Mitt Romney did best Obama by 1 percent in Wolf\u2019s 10th district in 2012, the demographics have been steadily moving in the Democrats\u2019 favor as young and affluent newcomers have migrated into the Northern Virginia suburbs across the Potomac from the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAnother bellwether race?\n\nActually, the region just had what political observers considered a bellwether election during the gubernatorial race, but the results turned out to be a snapshot of a moving picture that is still changing rapidly.\n\nThe Northern Virginia suburbs had become so left-leaning, even scandal-plagued Democrat Terry McAuliffe was able to use his overwhelming strength in the area to overcome a huge late surge by his opponent, Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, and eke out a victory in the gubernatorial race by two percentage points.\n\nBut the reason Cuccinelli was able to quickly close the gap in late October may be a game-changer for years to come: The Obamacare disaster.\n\nThe election was held on Nov. 4, and during the final weeks of the race it suddenly became apparent to Virginia and the nation that Obamacare was becoming so unpopular it could be a huge political liability for Democrats.\n\nThe Democrat who runs to replace Wolf will have a considerable, built-in base of support in Northern Virginia. But, the question now in the state\u2019s 10th district, as in the rest of the nation, is whether any Democrat, even with the party in power, can overcome the political damage done by Obamacare, damage that only seems to worsen over time.\n\nThe Democrats\n\nThe contender favored by Democratic Party leaders appears to be Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member John W. Foust, who announced his candidacy just last week, before the Wolf announcement.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Foust was expected to give Wolf his toughest challenge in years. But now that the congressman is retiring, more well-known Democrats may join the race.\n\nBefore Wolf\u2019s announcement, Foust had been hoping to use voter disenchantment with the 16-day government shutdown as a bludgeon against the incumbent. He was also hoping to tout his credentials as a bipartisan deal-maker, although Wolf also has that reputation.\n\nFoust\u2019s Democratic challengers, so far, are Fairfax lawyer Richard Bolger and Leesburg architect Sam Kubba.\n\nBolger called Wolf\u2019s announcement that he will retire \u201cgreat news for the 10th District,\u201d adding, \u201cIt is time for a real leader and problem-solver in Congress.\u201d\n\nKubba is running on what conservatives might consider a standard-issue Democratic platform of \u201cwell-paying jobs, with quality health care and good schools for all.\u201d\n\nThe prospective Republican field features more-experienced politicians, including one previously endorsed by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.\n\nDirty tricks already?\n\nOne potential candidate is already getting bad press and, strangely, it\u2019s coming from fellow Republicans.\n\nState Sen. Richard Black has announced he is forming an exploratory committee to determine whether he should run for the 10th district seat vacated by Wolf.\n\nThe Weekly Standard has posted a story calling Black a defender of spousal rape.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the website felt compelled to run an attack ad against the Virginia Republican, distributed by his opponent before November\u2019s election.\n\nDefenders point out that Black was not taking a position for or against marital rape, but as a former JAG officer and prosecutor, he was noting the proposed law was unworkable as a means of gaining convictions.\n\nChristopher Lore, a legislative assistant to the senator, said, \u201cI\u2019d also like to point out that he\u2019s the only person in the General Assembly who\u2019s successfully prosecuted a case of spousal rape during his career as JAG attorney.\u201d\n\nLore said the bill made it easier to prosecute these cases, and Black was worried about the weakening of the burden of proof and had fears about innocent people being prosecuted. When those fears were assuaged, he then voted for the bill.\n\n\u201cAttacks against him on this issue are purposeful twists of the truth,\u201d added Lore.\n\nThe aide told WND that Black\u2019s positions are solidly conservative and that he:\n\nOpposes amnesty for illegal immigrants\n\nFavors the rights of the unborn\n\nIs anti-Obamacare\n\nSupports Second Amendment rights\n\nLore also noted that Black has a strong interest in foreign affairs, opposes the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and has been in contact with the country\u2019s current ruler, Minister of Defense Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, whom he supports.\n\nOn thing that might distinguish the senator from other conservatives, Lore said, was that as a Vietnam veteran, he is staunchly opposed to U.S. military intervention and did not support the wars in either Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nAnother GOP conservative\n\nDel. Timothy D. Hugo, R-Fairfax, has served in the Virginia House of Delegates since 2003 and has been mentioned often as a likely candidate, should Wolf retire.\n\nHe was chief of staff to Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., and legislative director to Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wa.\n\nDuring the administration of President George H. W. Bush, Hugo was the special assistant to the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs.\n\nHe received a Kodak fellowship for the Senior Managers in Government Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nHugo favors low taxes, limited regulation and litigation, and says he has worked to eliminate wasteful spending and to hold state government departments accountable for their budgets.\n\nHe is pro-gun rights and pro-life.\n\nUpon learning of Wolf\u2019s intention to retire, Hugo released the following statement, \u201cTo me, Congressman Wolf has been that \u2018shining city on the hill\u2019 for all those seeking freedom from religious persecution and human bondage. When he leaves office, Congress, Virginia, and the nation will miss a giant of a man who sought and will continue to seek to make a difference.\u201d\n\nThe GOP moderate\n\nWhile Hugo and Black appear to be unabashedly conservative, the GOP establishment may favor the better-known and more middle-of-the-road option, Artur Davis.\n\nIn fact, Davis is so \u201cmiddle of the road,\u201d he used to be on the other side of the road.\n\nHe was a Democrat when he served in Congress and represented the Seventh District of Alabama from 2003 to 2010.\n\nDavis even served as co-chairman on Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008.\n\nHe became a Republican in February and after losing in the Democratic primary in the Georgia gubernatorial race in 2010. According to his own website, it was a \u201cshocking upset.\u201d\n\nThe former four-term congressman, former federal prosecutor and Harvard Law School alumnus is currently a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics and writes occasionally for National Review Online and Politico.\n\nDavis told the Washington Post in February that he would be interested in running should Wolf retire. On Tuesday, he told the paper that he will \u201cmonitor the field that develops in the next several weeks in the hope that a responsible center-right candidate will emerge.\u201d\n\nAs a Democrat, Davis voted against Obamacare. He attributed his switch to the GOP to what he called Obama\u2019s transition to the far left, while becoming what CNN called a top surrogate for the Romney campaign.\n\nFour years after seconding Obama\u2019s nomination at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, he delivered a primetime speech supporting Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention in 2012.\n\nHis speech attacked Obamacare, the lack of an economic recovery, high unemployment and the president\u2019s negative politics.\n\nWhile he says he practices the \u201ccenter-right brand that has more creativity to offer our politics than does the left,\u201d it proved difficult to discover where Davis stands on such important issues as amnesty for illegal aliens, abortion, gun rights and taxes.\n\nAnd, what moderates might consider nuanced and balanced positions, conservatives might see as inconsistent.\n\nRemarks Davis made in 2012 appeared to support amnesty, saying the GOP stance against it was hurting the party with Latinos, Asians and young people.\n\nHe voted to build a fence along the Mexican border in 2006, but voted for so-called \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d or amnesty, in 2005.\n\nHe voted against reporting illegal aliens who receive hospital treatment.\n\nIt is also difficult to pin down Davis\u2019 position on abortion, where his record is mixed.\n\nDavis appeared to be pro-life, based on an essay he wrote in 2012 referring to the \u201cviolence\u201d of abortion.\n\nBut, in 2007, Davis voted in favor of expanding research to more embryonic stem cell lines. In 2005, he voted in favor of allowing human embryonic stem cell research.\n\nHowever, he voted to restrict the interstate transport of minors to get abortions in 2005 and voted to ban partial-birth abortions in 2003.\n\nIn 2003, he received a 30 percent rating from the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, or NARAL, indicating a pro-life voting record.\n\nHowever, in 2006, he was given a 20 percent by the National Right to Life Committee, or NRLC, indicating a pro-abortion record.\n\nContinuing a theme, Davis also has a mixed record on gun rights.\n\nIn a December 2012 essay, he called himself \u201ca defender of the Second Amendment who thinks that the right to own guns is privileged by some of the most explicit words contained in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nBut, he also argued, following a spate of mass shootings over two years, the gun debate had \u201cturned a corner.\u201d He called for more regulations and said \u201cconservatives ought to be reassessing a hard-line defense of Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, he was given only a 34 percent rating by the National Taxpayers Union, indicating a less-than-vigilant stance against tax increases.\n\nDavis opposes same-sex marriage and rejects the civil rights comparison.\n\nHe wanted former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., to run for president in 2012 and opposed the effort of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to defund Obamacare earlier this year.\n\nAnd perhaps most tellingly of all, he is an admirer of both presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnother conservative option?\n\nConservatives also may be tempted to consider a woman who entered politics in 1990 by serving as a senior aide to Rep. Wolf, should she choose to run.\n\nState delegate Barbara Comstock, R-McLean, will begin her third term in January and represents a significant portion of Washington commuters living in Northern Virginia.\n\nComstock said that while working for Wolf she focused on health care, telework and business issues, appropriations for the district and tax relief for Virginia families.\n\nThe Virginian said she was then was recruited to serve on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, where she became chief counsel on hearings and oversight of investigations into waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nComstock also served as director of the Office of Public Affairs for the U.S. Department of Justice from 2002 through 2003.\n\nJudging by her voting record, she appears to be pro-life and pro-gun rights.\n\nComstock voted for:\n\nDefining life as beginning at conception\n\nRequiring an ultrasound prior to an abortion\n\nRepealing a purchase limit for handguns\n\nAuthorizing physical force against intruders\n\nRequiring voter identification for voting\n\nRepealing the HPV vaccine reqirement\n\nPalin\u2019s pick?\n\nA website that calls businessman Keith Fimian a stalwart conservative claims he has already decided to run for the seat in the 10th district.\n\nFimian unsuccessfully ran for Virginia\u2019s 11th district seat in 2008 and 2010.\n\nNot much in the way of public records could be found about about his positions on the issues, but Fimian must be rather conservative, given that he was endorsed in 2010 by Sarah Palin.\n\nShe wrote:\n\n\u201cKeith Fimian will be an important check on Congress for residents of the Commonwealth. The differences in this campaign are clear: His opponent supports job-killing cap-and-tax, wasteful stimulus spending, and the massive federal overreach on our health care system. Keith Fimian is not a career politician and has actually created private-sector jobs.\u201d\n\nAlso rans?\n\nState Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel had also been widely mentioned as a possible candidate should Wolf step aside, but she told the Washington Post Tuesday, \u201cI am absolutely not running for Congress.\u201d\n\nAlso according to the paper, Tareq Salahi, who ran for Virginia governor as a write-in candidate this year but is best known as the \u201cWhite House gate-crasher,\u201d is running for the seat.\n\nFollow Garth Kant on Twitter @DCgarth", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0A congressional race in Northern Virginia suddenly may have become a bellwether for the entire country, after a surprise announcement.
