â€” Rocky Mount police are searching for a 25-year-old man who is accused of shooting and killing a 24-year-old man Friday over a fight about a woman.

Police say Jeffrey Bullock shot Anthony Walker at Martin Luther King Jr. Park, at 800 E. Virginia St., around 11 a.m. Friday.

Walker was taken to Nash General Hospital, where he died.

Police have issued a warrant for Bullock's arrest for first-degree murder. He was last seen in a gold, four-door Nissan Maxima.

State records show Bullock was previously convicted of conspiracy to shoot into an occupied property, second-degree kidnapping and possession of a firearm by a felon.

No other information was released.
