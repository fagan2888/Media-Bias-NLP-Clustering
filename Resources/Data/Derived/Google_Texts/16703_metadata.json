It\u2019s the first time since the health care law was enacted that individuals must pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have health insurance. The penalty is 1 percent of income, or $95, whichever is greater.\n\nBut, in some cases where people received subsidies, in the form of tax credits, the calculation is tougher. Moreover, surveys showed more than half of those who could be affected didn\u2019t know much about the penalty.\n\nWell, let\u2019s help clarify the picture with Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News and accountant Poonam Bansal. She\u2019s owner of the firm Accounting Solutions in Virginia.\n\nAnd welcome you both.\n\nSo, Julie Rovner, to you first.\n\nWe said millions of Americans. How many people are really affected by this new health care law in terms of their taxes?\n\nJULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health News: Well, we don\u2019t know how many people are going to be paying the penalty because they didn\u2019t have insurance in 2014. That\u2019s partly because we don\u2019t know precisely how many people remained uncovered, and also, mostly, we don\u2019t know how many of those people who remained uncovered will qualify for one of the myriad exemptions from having to pay the penalty.\n\nWe have a better idea of who is impacted in terms of the subsidies. There are just under seven million people who were signed up for insurance on the marketplaces. Those are the people who are being theoretically affected. About 80 percent of people who got insurance coverage through the exchanges got subsidies. Those are the ones who are having to do a very complicated calculation about whether they have to get money \u2014 some of them are getting money back, and some of them will owe more money.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that\u2019s whether it\u2019s a state exchange or the federal exchange; is that correct?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: In both cases, yes. That money was federal tax money.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: OK.\n\nSo, Poonam Bansal, you\u2019re the one who is dealing with these taxpayers. What are you seeing first in terms of the penalty that people are expected to pay? How much of an issue is that turning out to be?\n\nPOONAM BANSAL, Accounting Solutions: There are a lot of taxpayers who filed their \u2014 who filed for the exchange programs, got subsidies when they filled out those forms.\n\nAnd let\u2019s say somebody didn\u2019t have a job. Then he got insurance through the marketplace, got a certain premium, got a certain credit, and then they got a job. They never thought they were supposed to change anything, and then they come and do their taxes and now they made way lot more money than getting the credit, and now they owe it all back.\n\nThose are the kinds of shockers people are getting. There are a lot of people out there who we did taxes for ended up paying back. And they were shocked.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: It sounds like there are more people affected who bought insurance in one form or another and didn\u2019t realize that this benefit they were getting was going to add to the total income.\n\nPOONAM BANSAL: Exactly.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Then there are people who didn\u2019t \u2014 who didn\u2019t buy health insurance at all, don\u2019t have health insurance, and are having to pay a penalty?\n\nPOONAM BANSAL: Yes.\n\nThere are people who didn\u2019t have health insurance at all. But those are not such a very high percentage, because a lot of them are really very low-income people who couldn\u2019t afford it. And that\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t have it. And they were \u2014 or they were not very smart or educated to go to the marketplace and shop around.\n\nAnd in those cases, we are seeing they don\u2019t really owe that much because they fall in the category that they\u2019re exempt.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, Julie Rovner, how good a job did the government do of educating people about this? Because we\u2019re hearing \u2014 now we\u2019re hearing that some people didn\u2019t really understand \u2014 and we just heard Poonam say, they didn\u2019t understand what they were going to owe.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Yes. Well, there are still some number of people who think that the law has been repealed or that the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, neither of which has happened, just both of which have been debated.\n\nIt\u2019s not that surprising that there were some number of people who still didn\u2019t realize they were supposed to have insurance. Now, one of the things that the federal government has done, they say this year only, if that you\u2019re doing your taxes \u2014 remember, what\u2019s due today are your taxes for last year, for 2014.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: If you still don\u2019t have insurance, well the sign-up period closed in February. But there is a special enrollment period this year for people who are doing their 2014 taxes, finding out they have to pay a penalty, and thinking, oh, my goodness, I will have to pay another penalty for 2015, which is, by the way, larger.\n\nSo those people are at least getting a chance to sign up, so they won\u2019t have to pay a penalty next year for this year.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But \u2014 so they\u2019re being given a little more time to sign up. They still have to pay their taxes.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Yes. They still have \u2014 they still owe whatever they owe for 2014.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: This is a chance for them to not owe for 2015 also.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Poonam Bansal, what are some examples of the kinds of issues you have described what some people are bringing to you? Are these difficult things to resolve? Are they relatively easy once people recognize what the issue is? How is it working?\n\nPOONAM BANSAL: Well, tax time, as I always say, involves a lot of emotions, because it involves money. Any clients, we say you have a refund, they start hugging us. And anybody we say, you owe, feels like I\u2019m the devil.\n\nAnd on top of it, we have the Affordable Care Act, which some people owe and some people don\u2019t, and they just can\u2019t understand it. They just feel like, I\u2019m doing something wrong. It\u2019s not that hard to resolve in terms of technicalities. I think it\u2019s people\u2019s mind-set and for them to accept it.\n\nNow, just say, for example, a father is claiming his daughter dependent on his return. She\u2019s earning $10,000 a year. So, she\u2019s still young. That income is counted towards the gross family income\u2026\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nPOONAM BANSAL: \u2026 to get the exchange. But he didn\u2019t know that. And he didn\u2019t include that. And now he owes a penalty. So those kind of things, they just can\u2019t understand it.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So people are getting educated.\n\nJulie, is the government thinking \u2014 I know you\u2019re not talking to everybody in the government. But is the sense that people will be better informed by next year, that this is just a rocky start for this whole thing?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that this year has gone more smoothly than many expected. There was expected, particularly people who have been watching this thought there would be all kinds of backlash from people suddenly going to do their taxes and realizing they are going to have to pay, when they thought they were getting a refund, or they\u2019re losing half their refund, or the penalty for not having insurance is for most people more than $95.\n\nAnd, by and large, we haven\u2019t heard a huge outcry about this. Obviously, there are situations where people are getting rude surprises, but there are also situations where people are getting bigger refunds than they thought because they didn\u2019t sign up for enough of a subsidy.\n\nSo, there\u2019s people who a happy. But there\u2019s nothing to quite educate people than going and doing your taxes and seeing this. I think a lot more people are going to know about this now than knew about it three months ago.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as we sit here right now in Washington, there are about six more hours to go. They have got that much time to figure it out.\n\nPoonam Bansal, Julie Rovner, we thank you both.\n\nPOONAM BANSAL: Thank you, Judy.
