Ken Buck is now the latest conservative member to face retribution from House Republican leadership, as his fellow freshman lawmakers will gather tomorrow to decide if he will remain freshman class president.\n\nBuck, of Colorado, joins a growing number of conservatives who have been punished by the party\u2019s top leaders for bucking the party line and voting against a routine procedural rule on Trade Promotion Authority last week.\n\nThe Colorado conservative was elected by the freshman class unanimously last year, though he didn\u2019t have a challenger.\n\nLate Tuesday night, chiefs of staff\u2014including Buck\u2019s\u2014received an email from Reps. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Mimi Walters, R-Calif., calling a meeting of freshman lawmakers. The topic of the meeting was not disclosed. However, Walters told The Hill it concerned the leadership of the freshman class.\n\n\u201cA majority of the freshman class has expressed concerns I share regarding the leadership of our class president,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to regular business, tomorrow we will also be discussing the direction of future leadership.\u201d\n\nKatherine Rosario, Buck\u2019s spokeswoman, told The Daily Signal the gathering could result in the Colorado Republican\u2019s removal from his post as freshman class president.\n\nLeadership cannot explicitly remove Buck from the role, as freshman members instead would have to vote for a successor. However, Rosario said it appears the effort is organized by Walters, a liaison to House Speaker John Boehner and one of his allies.\n\nBuck was asked to resign, but declined.\n\nSeveral conservatives have been approached by House leadership after failing to toe the party line on last week\u2019s procedural vote.\n\n>>> GOP Leadership Threatens Other Conservative Chairman as Punishment for Trade Vote\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., lost his chairmanship of the Government Operations subcommittee, and a number of other subcommittee chairmen have also been approached by their full committee leaders, where the subject of their votes came up.\n\nAdditionally, three Republicans\u2014Reps. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Trent Franks of Arizona and Steve Pearce of New Mexico\u2014were booted from the GOP whip team for their vote on the rule.\n\nHouse Republican leadership\u2019s actions, which Meadows said has created a \u201cculture of punishment,\u201d is angering conservatives. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of more than 30 conservative members, is working on a plan to respond.\n\nMany conservative members feel their party\u2019s leaders are asking them to vote against their principles and conscience, which they disagree with.\n\nConservatives\u2019 disapproval of leadership isn\u2019t confined to the House anymore. On Wednesday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke out against top Republicans\u2019 actions during a speech at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nCruz criticized Republican leadership for using conservatives across the country to get Republicans elected, but ignoring their wishes when it comes to passing legislation.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that Republican leadership always, always, always cuts deals with the Democrats and with Washington, and throws overboard the conservatives that come October to November in an election year they are desperately asking to turn out and elect them in power?\u201d the Republican senator asked. \u201cThe Washington cartel has amassed more and more power at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n\nDuring his speech, Cruz went on to call out lawmakers who open their \u201cears and wallets\u201d to the \u201chighest bidder\u201d when legislation is set to be introduced, and favor the interests of lobbyists over their constituents.\n\n\u201cCorrupt backroom deals result in one interest group getting preferences over the other, although you give the other a chance to outbid them, or even worse, a very, very small interest group getting special carve outs at the expense of taxpayers,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd those who don\u2019t oblige, well they are shunned by the cartel, effectively locked out.\u201d\n\n>>> Mark Meadows to Fight GOP House Leadership: \u2018Sometimes You Have to Make Changes to the Coach\u2019", "article_metadata": {"description": "Freshman Rep.
