The worst is yet to come.\n\nObamaCare Hits Small Business Hard in \u201915\n\nStarting Jan. 1, employers with 100 or more full-time workers face hefty increases in their health insurance costs as they comply for the first time with the mandate.\n\nThey must now offer the government\u2019s comprehensive coverage \u2014 including \u201cfree\u201d preventive care \u2014 for all employees working 30 or more hours a week, or risk being fined $2,000 per employee per year.\n\nBut many of these small businesses are retailers that don\u2019t have the kind of margins where they can cover workers and still stay in business.\n\nMany grocers and restaurants have opted to pay the fine rather than swallow the larger cost of buying coverage for all workers. Others are cutting back worker hours to duck the law altogether.\n\nUniversal health care is hardly \u201cfree,\u201d and its costs hit both employees and customers hard. Service companies \u2014 including even garbage collectors \u2014 are passing on the added cost to customers in the form of higher bills.\n\nTake God Bless the USA, a trash collection company outside Charlotte, N.C. It recently notified customers that it\u2019s raising prices 5% to help cover expenses.\n\n\u201cDue to the Affordable Care Act, effective Jan. 1, 2015, we are obligated to provide health care coverage to all of our employees,\u201d it explained in a Dec. 5 letter. \u201cUnfortunately, we are unable to internalize this cost and are sorry we have to pass this cost on to you.\u201d\n\nRequirements under ObamaCare tighten in 2016, when smaller firms employing 50 to 99 full-time workers also have to offer coverage or face fines.\n\nA few small businesses in Michigan that did offer employee-sponsored health coverage are now preparing to stop next year, says Michigan Group Benefits, an East Lansing-based insurance agency.\n\nWhy? Sticker shock from the pricier ACA-compliant policies, which provide everything from \u201cfree\u201d mammograms to colonoscopies.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield and other insurers have stopped allowing businesses to renew policies that aren\u2019t compliant with ObamaCare. In their place, they\u2019re offering plans with 14% to 45% rate increases, the National Association of Health Underwriters says.\n\nThough employers with fewer than 50 workers are exempt from mandates, they too are feeling ObamaCare\u2019s pain.\n\nKaiser Permanente already has sent cancellation letters to such employers, explaining that their existing plans don\u2019t offer ObamaCare\u2019s richer benefits and therefore are no longer available.\n\nSome two-thirds of the 31 million employees who work for such firms and get health insurance from them could receive similar cancellation notices over the next year.\n\nWhen the president signed ObamaCare in 2010, he promised it would \u201clower costs for families and for businesses.\u201d As it turns out, neither is true.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Red Tape: With businesses' one-year reprieve from financial penalties under ObamaCare ending, the horror stories of complying with the costly health care law", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Red Tape: With businesses\u2019 one-year reprieve from financial penalties under ObamaCare ending, the horror stories of complying with the costly health care law already are trickling in.
