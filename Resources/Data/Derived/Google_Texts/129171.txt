On Friday, Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America founder Shannon R Watts said the fact that the NRA had blocked her on Twitter is proof her anti-gun group was “winning.” If that’s true, then Breitbart News must be doing pretty good as well because @shannonrwatts began blocking this writer shortly after the mid-term elections.

Twitchy caught Watt’s tweet, which said: “You know you’re winning when you get blocked by @NRA.”

Twitchy then reported on Watt’s follow-up tweet: “Blocked by @NRA — one of the the country’s largest lobbying groups. Afraid of this midwestern mom?”

This writer’s attempts to follow her result in Twitter showing the following message: “You are blocked from following @shannonrwatts and viewing @shannonrwatts’s Tweets.” A subsequent message says the block comes “at the request of the user.”

On November 11, Breitbart News reported that Watts spun Moms Demand Action’s numerous midterm loses by saying her group emerged from the elections as a “political force.” On the other hand, the NRA emerged from the elections with wins in over 91 percent of the Congressional races in which they endorsed a candidate.
