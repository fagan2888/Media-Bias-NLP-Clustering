OK, that\u2019s an immense understatement.\n\nThe South Carolina man told me yesterday that he\u2019s reached out to FOX News, to ABC, to MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show. He\u2019s been calling the Democratic National Party. Could I help him get word to the media or DNC?\n\n\u201cTell them you have someone who wants to talk and wants to be the poster child,\u201d he told me.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Lang wants to be the \u201cposter child\u201d for a government safety net that he has recently called a \u201ccomplex and flawed bill.\u201d Since his GoFundMe campaign went viral on May 12, he\u2019s had conversations \u2013 most notably conversations with Harold Pollack \u2013 that have made him rethink not only his disdain for the law, but his entire political philosophy.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I sat down and were looking at our values and we said, \u2018We\u2019re not Republicans. We\u2019re Democrats!\u2019\n\nCapitalizing on his high profile\n\nLang says a lot has changed since his story started trending on May 12. For one thing, he feels that people who initially misunderstood him \u2013 and posted comments \u201cbashing the hell out of me\u201d have also had a change of heart. They\u2019ve \u201csent me private messages apologizing to me, saying they didn\u2019t know the whole story. It was a total turnaround.\u201d\n\nAnd while the public responses include some that have been painfully critical \u2013 one visitor advised, \u201cSell your house, you irresponsible moocher\u201d \u2013 he says now he\u2019s been encouraged to use his visibility for good. \u201cComments I\u2019ve been getting personally and on GoFundMe are telling me to take advantage of that publicity \u2013 that I should be the poster boy for the ACA.\u201d\n\nLang\u2019s taken that suggestion to heart and wants to reach out to others just like him who have misjudged the ACA. \u201cSo many people as far as Republicans are in the same position as me. They\u2019re not political. They didn\u2019t do any research [on the law] \u2026 and they listen to FOX News. They\u2019re getting misinformed.\u201d\n\nMostly, he says, people need to stop making decisions about the law based on politics. \u201cThey need to stop listening to politicians and do their own research,\u201d he says. \u201cI would tell people, \u2018you\u2019re talking to someone who was like you. I can see clearly now. The politics are gone.'\u201d\n\nIs FOX News blocking his calls?\n\nWhile the self-employed South Carolina man has been working the phones to secure a spot on national television, so far, he feels he\u2019s been ignored. FOX News (including The O\u2019Reilly Factor), in particular, has turned a deaf ear \u2013 and he says that\u2019s not surprising.\n\n\u201cFOX News doesn\u2019t have the guts to put me on because I\u2019m a hot potato for them to the point where they\u2019ve blocked my number,\u201d Lang says. \u201cThey won\u2019t touch me because they\u2019re so far to the right. If they aired me it\u2019s like admitting a problem that affects even their whole party \u2026 and they aren\u2019t willing to do anything about it.\u201d\n\nBut Lang says he\u2019s received enough encouragement to believe that his supporters could push him into the national television spotlight. \u201cTell [your readers], \u2018Call your local station and demand that they put me on. If enough people call, they will cave.\u201d\n\nWhy? \u201cI want to talk about the coverage gap I\u2019ve fallen into so that others will not fall into it.\u201d\n\nLang isn\u2019t done talking \u2013 or crowdfunding\n\nWhether Lang gets his 15 minutes on national television or not, he\u2019s not receding from public view soon \u2013 and his crowdfunding isn\u2019t over either.\n\nNow, less than $5,000 from his original $30,000 goal, he says he\u2019ll have to update his GoFundMe goal. The new total will reflect a more realistic bill he expects to face for more extensive treatment than he\u2019d anticipated. He also hinted that the total could go higher, depending on a doctor\u2019s assessment of new symptoms of what he suspects is kidney disease.\n\nWill his appeal for more donations \u2013 and his newfound appreciation for the ACA \u2013 draw emotional responses? Almost surely, some will continue to see him as an opportunist. (An extreme example: Local police had to get involved after his wife received a threatening phone call: \u201cThe guy said \u2018he needs to stop being a freeloader and a moocher. If he keeps complaining about his eyes, I\u2019m going to poke out his eyes.'\u201d)\n\nBut others will likely applaud Lang\u2019s apparent determination to help others who may be missing out on the ACA\u2019s benefits \u2013 \u201cif I can even help just one person not go through the hell I\u2019ve gone through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Luis Lang has been working the phones to secure a spot on national television so he can help others like him who may be missing out on Obamcare's benefits \u2013 \"if I can even help just one person not go through the hell I\u2019ve gone through.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Luis Lang has been working the phones to secure a spot on national television so he can help others like him who may be missing out on Obamcare's benefits \u2013 \"if I can even help just one person not go through the hell I\u2019ve gone through.\"", "title": "Luis Lang wants to be Obamacare\u2019s \u2018poster child\u2019", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2015/05/22/luis-lang-wants-to-be-obamacares-poster-child/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2015/05/luis-lang-obamacare-poster-child-780x408.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "crowdfunding, Fox News, MSNBC", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-22T14:19:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde31\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTell them you have someone who wants to talk and wants to be the poster child,\u201d he told me.\nWhile the self-employed South Carolina man has been working the phones to secure a spot on national television, so far, he feels he\u2019s been ignored.\nA week after Luis Lang\u2019s story went viral, he\u2019s had a change of heart about Obamacare.\nThe South Carolina man told me yesterday that he\u2019s reached out to FOX News, to ABC, to MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show.\nThe new total will reflect a more realistic bill he expects to face for more extensive treatment than he\u2019d anticipated."}
