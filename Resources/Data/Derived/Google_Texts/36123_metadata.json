Not yet 20, she aimed her weapon at a Nazi officer and shot him to death on a Paris bridge on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nThat deed on July 23, 1944, was Madeleine Riffaud\u2019s summons to Parisians to rise up.\n\n\u201cEveryone saw that a young girl on a bicycle can do this,\u201d she recalled in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nRiffaud\u2019s solitary act provided an opening salvo for a popular uprising in Paris, which was spurred by the Allied landings in Normandy following four years of Nazi occupation. When American and French troops liberated the City of Light on Aug. 25, 1944, it came against a backdrop of jubilation and chaos.\n\nOn Monday, Paris will mark the 70th anniversary of its freedom from Hitler\u2019s Third Reich with a day of tributes, including an outdoor ball, a speech at City Hall by President Francois Hollande, and a sound and light show re-enacting the day of liberation.\n\nThe commemoration underscores how much has changed in a Europe, and wider world, that is confronting new dangers with echoes of the past.\n\n\u201cI think there is a certain degree of forgetting precisely what the right wing across Europe in the 1930s actually meant,\u201d said University of Nottingham historian Karen Adler, who draws a parallel between that dark time and the rise of far-right parties across much of Europe today.\n\nSome Parisian elders who lived through the occupation now advocate unity and dialogue among Europeans to ensure that extremism can never take hold of the continent again.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was monstrous,\u201d said Jacqueline Courret, now 85 and living at the Liberty rest home in Paris.\n\nDuring the occupation, Courret lived in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood on the Rue de Rivoli. She recalled how the Nazis\u2019 regular roundups of Jews meant that her school eventually closed because so many pupils had disappeared, including a friend. Some 77,320 Jews were deported from France during the war.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1944, a European capital that had epitomized culture, bounty and the sweet life fell to its knees as humiliation, hunger, cold and distrust became the measures of daily life. Long food lines, black markets and coveted ration tickets marked the memories of those years.\n\nCourret and two other women at the Liberty care home described how age-based food tickets determined their daily rations. Potatoes, rutabagas, soup and milk for the children were standard fare. Meat was a delicacy. Sometimes, Courret said, her parents served up cat meat.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a cat left in Paris at the end of the war,\u201d she said, chuckling.\n\nUnderstanding how ordinary life goes on in an occupied country can be hard for outsiders to grasp.\n\n\u201cOrdinary things go on as well as the terrible things and the spectacular things,\u201d Adler said. \u201cPeople are still getting married. \u2026 They\u2019re still having arguments with their spouse.\u201d Life, she said, \u201cis not always being lived at an incredibly high pitch.\u201d\n\nWith fuel scarce, bicycles provided taxi services. The family of 83-year-old Michele Le Meleder tried warming up in winter around an electric toaster.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paris to celebrate end to Nazi rule 70 years later", "title": "Paris to celebrate end to Nazi rule 70 years later", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paris to celebrate end to Nazi rule 70 years later", "title": "Paris to celebrate end to Nazi rule 70 years later", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/paris_to_celebrate_end_to_nazi_rule_70_years_later/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/france-paris-liberation-remembered.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paris to celebrate end to Nazi rule 70 years later", "title": "Paris to celebrate end to Nazi rule 70 years later", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/france-paris-liberation-remembered.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elaine Ganley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0f5\"", "article_summary": "During the occupation, Courret lived in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood on the Rue de Rivoli.\nNot yet 20, she aimed her weapon at a Nazi officer and shot him to death on a Paris bridge on a Sunday afternoon.\nRiffaud\u2019s solitary act provided an opening salvo for a popular uprising in Paris, which was spurred by the Allied landings in Normandy following four years of Nazi occupation.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a cat left in Paris at the end of the war,\u201d she said, chuckling.\n\u201cWhat happened was monstrous,\u201d said Jacqueline Courret, now 85 and living at the Liberty rest home in Paris."}
