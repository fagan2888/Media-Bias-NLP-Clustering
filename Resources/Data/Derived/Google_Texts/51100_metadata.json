While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Obama, has increased access to mental health for millions of America, \u201cincidents of violence continue to highlight a crisis in America's mental health system,\u201d the White House said in a fact sheet.\n\nPart of that effort will include preventing people prohibited by law from having guns get access to them, the Administration added.\n\nHowever, in light of gain in access to mental health treatment, less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health issues get the treatment the mean. To improve this situation, Obama has proposed a $500 million investment to improve access to mental health care by increasing service capacity and the psychiatric health care workforce.\n\n\u201cThis effort would increase access to mental health services to protect the health of children and communities, prevent suicide, and promote mental health as a top priority.\u201d\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) heralded the move by Obama.\n\n\u201cWe support the president's efforts to expand background checks, propose policies that respect physician-patient confidentiality, and increase funding for mental health services by $500 million,\u201d APA President Renee Binder, MD, said in a statement. \u201cWe will work with Congress to make that funding proposal a reality, as we also work with allies in Congress who are championing comprehensive mental health reform.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,cancertherapyadvisor.com,chemotherapyadvisor.com,clinicaladvisor.com,clinicalpainadvisor.com,empr.com,endocrinologyadvisor.com,infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com,mycme.com,neurologyadvisor.com,oncologynurseadvisor.com,psychiatryadvisor.com,renalandurologynews.com", "news_keywords": "Practice Management", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "Psychiatry Advisor", "description": "Obama has proposed a $500 million investment to improve access to mental health care as part of gun control reform.", "title": "Mental Health Improvements Part of Obama's Gun Control Action", "url": "http://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/practice-management/mental-health-psychiatric-mental-illness-health-gun-control/article/463224/", "image": "http://media.clinicaladvisor.com/images/2014/12/05/obamapledges100millionaids_696109_696110.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PsychiatryAdv", "image": {"src": "http://media.clinicaladvisor.com/images/2014/12/05/obamapledges100millionaids_696109_696110.png"}, "description": "Obama has proposed a $500 million investment to improve access to mental health care as part of gun control reform.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mental Health Improvements Part of Obama's Gun Control Action"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=909713520", "fb": {"app_id": 236959933328663}, "google-site-verification": "dZgjJ9HRVwo_jdEmYHQ6bp5TORr7UErbyMrKG8JxzvM", "article": {"section": "Practice Management", "tag": "Practice Management", "published_time": "2016-01-05T15:26:29", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T16:48:47"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Obama has proposed a $500 million investment to improve access to mental health care as part of gun control reform."}, "article_summary": "Mental Health Improvements Part of Obama's Gun Control ActionShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintObama has proposed a $500 million investment to improve access to mental health care as part of gun control reform.\nPresident Obama's executive action to curb gun violence includes improvements to the nations' mental health system.\nHowever, in light of gain in access to mental health treatment, less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health issues get the treatment the mean.\n\u201cThis effort would increase access to mental health services to protect the health of children and communities, prevent suicide, and promote mental health as a top priority.\u201dThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) heralded the move by Obama.\nTo improve this situation, Obama has proposed a $500 million investment to improve access to mental health care by increasing service capacity and the psychiatric health care workforce."}
