So are those who were uninsured to begin with, which leaves a huge backlog.\n\n\u201cThe rollout has been very rocky and it's caused major, major disruptions,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cAnd at this point, I think the question is how do you operate a salvage operation that will get you back on track?\u201d\n\nMendelson says so far, the total enrollment is about 150,000 for both the state and federal exchanges, but more than half that -- 80,000 -- came from just California, meaning the federal marketplaces are way behind.\n\n\u201cTo get 5 million people -- who have received individual cancellations in the last couple months -- signed up by Dec. 23, you have to run through the system well over 200,000 people per day for those 23 days in December,\u201d said James Capretta, with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cSo is the website really capable of handling 200,000 sign ups just to handle the individual cancellations?\u201d\n\nBut the pre-Christmas crush isn't the only problem. The federal government hasn't built the software to accurately tell insurance companies who has actually enrolled. One report says up to one third of the enrollments since Oct. 1 have errors, so people may think they have coverage when they do not.\n\nIn fact, officials say the software to make that work correctly hasn't even been built yet.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
