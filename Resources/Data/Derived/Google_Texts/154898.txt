American institutions spent $3.21 billion on lobbying in 2014, down from a high of $3.55 billion in 2010, according to information from the Senate Office of Public Records published last week by Open Secrets. As usual, Big Pharma, the military-industrial complex, the NRA and pro-Israel groups were among the big spenders that peddled their influence via nearly 12,000 professional lobbyists. Analysts point to a variety of reasons why lobbying has declined slightly in recent years. The most common argument is that Congress is less productive, leading companies and organizations to spend fewer resources on trying to affect legislative outcomes. Another argument is that the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which tightened public disclosure requirements, has driven some lobbying activity into loopholes where they skirt the official tally. “There were some really momentous things going on [in 2009 and 2010], including the health care bill, the stimulus and Dodd-Frank,” said Russ Choma, an expert on political spending at the Center for Responsive Politics. “[Legislative activity] peaked then, and that’s the reason so many people were spending so much money. We’ve seen nothing of that size since.” He said a flurry of end-of-year legislative activity involving last-minute Wall Street–friendly add-ons to the CRomnibus spending bill didn't contribute significantly to the year’s totals. For the third year in a row, the single biggest spenders were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Retailers and Blue Cross/Blue Shield. As a result of intensive lobbying by business groups, Barack Obama’s administration postponed for a second time the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that medium-size employers pick up the tab for their workers’ coverage. The Chamber, along with Koch Industries, was also effective in blocking the SEC rule to require public companies to report political spending. “There’s definitely a very top echelon of groups that don’t ever really change, said Choma. “But that does tend to ebb and flow, depending what’s on Capitol Hill.”
