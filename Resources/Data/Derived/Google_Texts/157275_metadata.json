We\u2019re going to look at some fiscal data that must be very depressing for President Obama and other advocates of big government. But that means this information must be very good news for American taxpayers!\n\nHere\u2019s a chart looking at annual federal spending since 2000. You\u2019ll notice that spending skyrocketed from 2000-2009 (a time when libertarians were justifiably glum), but look at how the growth of government came to a screeching halt after 2009.\n\nHere are some specific numbers culled from the Office of Management and Budget data and Congressional Budget Office data. In fiscal year 2009, the federal government spent about $3.52 trillion. In fiscal year 2014 (which ended on September 30), the federal government spent about $3.50 trillion. In other words, there\u2019s been no growth in nominal government spending over the past five years. This hasn\u2019t received nearly as much attention as it deserves, but there\u2019s been a spending freeze in Washington.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve argued in favor of an overall cap on government outlays in the past, my leftist friends always said this would produce catastrophic consequences. They had lots of rhetoric about \u201cunmet needs\u201d and \u201chuman costs,\u201d so let\u2019s contemplate societal outcomes since 2009:\n\nDid children starve? Nope.\n\nDid widows die in the snow? Nope.\n\nDid planes fall from the sky? Nope.\n\nDid poisoned food plague the country? Nope.\n\nDid sick people get turned away from hospitals? Nope.\n\nDid the North Koreans take over the world? Nope.\n\nGee, it appears that spending restraint doesn\u2019t result in chaos. Not that we should be surprised, based on research on \u201cpublic sector efficiency\u201d from the European Central Bank. So we can logically conclude that spending restraint doesn\u2019t lead to societal disarray. Now let\u2019s look at what does happen when government is put on a diet.\n\nI\u2019ve periodically discussed my Golden Rule, which says that good fiscal policy takes place when government spending grows slower than the private sector. Even though we haven\u2019t had impressive growth during the Obama years, there have been modest increases in both nominal gross domestic product and inflation-adjusted (real) GDP. In other words, the Golden Rule has been in effect since 2009. As a result, the burden of government spending, relative to the economy\u2019s productive sector, has been declining.\n\nHere\u2019s another chart that will be very depressing for the president and other statists.\n\nWhat\u2019s really remarkable is that we\u2019ve seen the biggest drop in the burden of government spending since the end of World War II. Heck, the fiscal restraint over the past five years has resulted in a bigger drop in the relative size of government in America than what Switzerland achieved over the past ten years thanks to its \u201cdebt brake.\u201d\n\nAt this point, some readers may be wondering who or what deserves credit for this positive development. I\u2019ll offer a couple of explanations. The first two points are about why we shouldn\u2019t overstate what\u2019s actually happened.\n\nThe good news is somewhat exaggerated because we had a huge spike in federal spending in 2009. To use an analogy, it\u2019s easy to lose some weight if you first go on an eating binge for a couple of years. Some of the fiscal discipline is illusory because certain revenues that flow to the U.S. Treasury, such as Toxic Assets Relief Program repayments from banks, actually count as negative spending. I explained this phenomenon when measuring which presidents have been the biggest spenders. But there also are some real reasons why we\u2019ve seen genuine spending restraint.\n\nNow for the bad news. All this progress will be wiped out very quickly if there\u2019s not genuine entitlement reform. The long-run fiscal forecasts, whether from CBO or international bureaucracies such as the International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, show that America will become a European-style welfare state over the next couple of decades in the absence of reform.\n\nSo let\u2019s enjoy our temporary victory but work even harder to avert a future fiscal crisis.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 03 Dec 2014 06:53:16 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The burden of government spending, relative to the economy\u2019s productive sector, has been declining.", "title": "The Federal Government Has Quietly Frozen Spending Since 2009", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_864807.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-03T09:16:29+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/12/03/the-federal-government-has-quietly-frozen-spending-since-2009/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The burden of government spending, relative to the economy\u2019s productive sector, has been declining.", "title": "The Federal Government Has Quietly Frozen Spending Since 2009", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_864807.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Government", "tag": "Editors Picks,Entitlement Reform,Entitlements,government growth,Government Spending,President Obama,private sector,spending", "published_time": "2014-12-03T06:53:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T09:16:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The burden of government spending, relative to the economy\u2019s productive sector, has been declining."}, "article_summary": "The good news is somewhat exaggerated because we had a huge spike in federal spending in 2009.\nHere\u2019s a chart looking at annual federal spending since 2000.\nSo we can logically conclude that spending restraint doesn\u2019t lead to societal disarray.\nBut there also are some real reasons why we\u2019ve seen genuine spending restraint.\nAs a result, the burden of government spending, relative to the economy\u2019s productive sector, has been declining."}
