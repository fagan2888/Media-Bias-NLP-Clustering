This is similar to his job rating: 44 percent approval vs. 54 percent disapproval.\n\nNationally, a third of all voters said opposition to the president was a reason for their in vote in House races, while only 20 percent expressed support for Obama in their choice of candidate.\n\nReason for U.S. House Vote\n\nSupport Obama 19 percent\n\nOppose Obama 33 percent\n\nNot A Factor 45 percent\n\nMeanwhile, there is a sense among voters that the economy continues to struggle: 70 percent rate the country's current economic condition as not good or poor, while 28 percent say the economy is in good condition and only 1 percent calls it excellent.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nCondition of Nation\u2019s Economy\n\nExcellent 1 percent\n\nGood 28 percent\n\nNot good 48 percent\n\nPoor 22 percent\n\nJust over three-quarters of Americans -- 77 percent -- are at least somewhat worried about the direction of the nation\u2019s economy in the next year, while 22 percent said they were not too worried or not at all worried.\n\nWorried About Future of U.S. Economy?\n\nVery 37 percent\n\nSomewhat 40 percent\n\nNot too 18 percent\n\nNot at all 4 percent\n\nMore than a quarter say their family\u2019s financial situation has gotten better over the past two years, while a similar number say their situation has gotten worse. Those who say it has gotten better supported the Democratic candidate for Congress by a 60 percent to 38 percent margin. Those who say it has gotten worse went for the Republican candidate, 67 percent to 31 percent.\n\nFinancial Situation\n\nGotten better 29 percent\n\nGotten worse 25 percent\n\nSame 45 percent\n\nAll of that leads to a sense the country is on the wrong track. Only 31 percent say the economy is going in the right direction, down from 46 percent in 2012. Most voters -- 65 percent -- believe the country is on the wrong track. Voters who think things are on the wrong track backed the Republican candidate in their district by a 65 percent to 30 percent margin.\n\nDirection of the Country\n\nRight 31 percent\n\nWrong 65 percent\n\nThis pessimism extends to attitudes toward life for the next generation of Americans. Nearly half think life for their children will be worse than life today, while only 22 percent say it will be better.\n\nLife for Next Generation\n\nBetter than today 22 percent\n\nWorse than today 48 percent\n\nAbout the same 27 percent\n\nDespite the attention to issues such as Ebola and ISIS, the economy remains most prominently on the minds of voters. Nearly half -- 45 percent -- see the economy as the most important issue facing the country. Those economy voters split 49-49 in their House vote. Health care voters went for the Democrat by 60-38 percent, while immigration voters backed the Republican by 73-25 percent.\n\nMost Important Issue Facing Country\n\nEconomy 45 percent\n\nHealth care 25 percent\n\nIllegal immigration 14 percent\n\nForeign policy 13 percent\n\nNearly half of voters nationally feel ObamaCare went too far, nearly doubling the number who say it didn\u2019t go far enough. About one in five (21 percent) say the law is about right. Voters who think the law went too far went for the Republican candidate in their district by nearly 70 points.\n\nFeelings About ObamaCare\n\nWent too far 48 percent\n\nNot far enough 25 percent\n\nAbout right 21 percent\n\nOnly one voter in five says they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right just about always or most of the time. Most voters trust Uncle Sam only some of the time or never.\n\nTrust Government?\n\nAlmost always 3 percent\n\nMost of the time 17 percent\n\nOnly sometimes 60 percent\n\nNever 18 percent\n\nThe key voting group of independents made a big difference again Tuesday. While they made up the same amount of the electorate, they were more likely to back the Republican by 10 points. In 2010, independents went for the Republican in their district by 19 points.\n\nNational House Vote\n\nIndependents\n\nDemocrats 42 percent\n\nRepublicans 54 percent\n\nHere are the key findings in some of the most contested states.\n\nColorado\n\nIn a Senate election where women\u2019s issues were central to the campaign, Sen. Mark Udall emerged the leader among that group, but it was Rep. Cory Gardner, the Republican challenger, who won the day.\n\nWomen\n\nUdall 52 percent\n\nGardner 43 percent\n\nGardner\u2019s support came from many groups, including independents and male voters.\n\nIndependents\n\nUdall 43 percent\n\nGardner 50 percent\n\nMen\n\nUdall 40 percent\n\nGardner 56 percent\n\nOver half of Colorado voters disapproved of President Obama\u2019s job performance, mirroring results in many other states. Gardner won the support of these voters by an 82-13 percent margin.\n\nObama Job Performance\n\nApprove 43 percent\n\nDisapprove 55 percent\n\nFinally, almost two thirds of Colorado voters said most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.\n\nPolicy Toward Illegal Immigration\n\nLegal Status 65 percent\n\nDeport 28 percent\n\n\n\nGeorgia\n\nIn Georgia, Republican David Perdue held the open Senate seat for the Republicans, defeating Democrat Michelle Nunn and garnered enough of the vote to avoid a runoff election.\n\nA key to his victory was the independent vote. Independents broke strongly for Perdue. Perdue received 59 percent of the independent vote, compared with 36 percent going for Nunn.\n\nIndependents\n\nNunn 36percent\n\nPerdue 59percent\n\nSwafford 5percent\n\nGeorgia voters were sending a message -- 36 percent of voters said a reason for their vote was to show opposition to President Obama, while only 19 percent said a reason for their vote was to show support for the president. Other voters said the president was not a factor.\n\nReason For Senate Vote\n\nSupport Obama 19percent\n\nOppose Obama 36percent\n\nNot A Factor 43percent\n\nThree-quarters of Georgia voters said who controlled the Senate factored into their vote. These voters supported Perdue by a 53 percent to 46 percent margin.\n\nHow Important Is Party Control of Senate?\n\nVery important 76 percent\n\nSomewhat important 15 percent\n\nNot too important 5 percent\n\nNot at all important 4 percent\n\nIowa\n\nRepublican Joni Ernst took the open Senate seat in Iowa away from the Democrats, defeating Democrat Bruce Braley. Ernst played up her farming background, which resonated with Iowa voters. More than four-in-ten voters were from rural areas, and they strongly backed her.\n\nRural voters\n\nBraley 38 percent\n\nEnrst 58 percent\n\nMore voters agreed with Ernst on the issues, than Braley.\n\nErnst On The Issues\n\nToo Conservative 37 percent\n\nNot Enough 10 percent\n\nAbout Right 47 percent\n\nBraley On The Issues\n\nToo Liberal 44 percent\n\nNot Liberal Enough 10 percent\n\nAbout Right 37 percent\n\nPresident Obama is not popular in Iowa, with 60 percent of voters disapproving of the job he is doing, while 39 percent approve.\n\nObama Job Performance\n\nApprove 39 percent\n\nDisapprove 60 percent\n\nKansas\n\nRepublican incumbent Pat Roberts held onto to his seat in Kansas today as the party faithful put their support behind him.\n\nChallenger Greg Orman, won a majority of support among fellow independents.\n\nIndependents\n\nRoberts 37 percent\n\nOrman 54 percent\n\nBatson 9 percent\n\nHowever, Orman\u2019s advantage among independents and early deciders was outweighed by Roberts\u2019 advantage among Republicans, who make up 48 percent of Kansas voters. Roberts won Republicans by a 85-13 percent margin.\n\nParty Breakdown\n\nDemocrat 25 percent\n\nRepublican 48 percent\n\nIndependent 28 percent\n\nDespite his win, 62 percent of voters said Roberts has spent too much time away from Kansas to represent the state effectively. Those voters broke for Orman 55-38 percent.\n\nRoberts Away From\n\nKansas Too Much?\n\nYes 62 percent\n\nNo 33 percent\n\nBut the Republican leaning in Kansas remained constant among voters Tuesday. A majority of Kansas voters said they wanted the Republicans to win control of the Senate. Only 29 percent say they prefer the Democrats to win control.\n\nPrefer to Win Control of the Senate\n\nDemocrats 29 percent\n\nRepublicans 56 percent\n\nDoes not matter 12 percent\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana will host a runoff between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and her Republican challenger Bill Cassidy. Cassidy appears to have the advantage, with voters saying they would support Cassidy in a runoff by a 51 percent to 43 percent margin\n\nRunoff Election Vote\n\nLandrieu 43 percent\n\nCassidy 51 percent\n\nNo vote 4 percent\n\nOver half of voters -- 57 percent -- say that Landrieu agrees with the president too often, while only 34 percent say she agrees with the president about the right amount of the time.\n\nLandrieu Agrees With Obama On The Issues\n\nToo often 57 percent\n\nNot enough 6 percent\n\nAbout Right Amount 34 percent\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIncumbent Democratic Senator Kay Hagan was defeated by Republican Thom Tillis in the hotly contested race in North Carolina. One problem for Hagan was President Obama, with more Tar Heel State voters viewing the administration negatively than positively.\n\nFeelings About Obama Administration\n\nPositive 39 percent\n\nNegative 60 percent\n\nAdditionally, about half of North Carolina voters said Hagan agrees with Obama too often.\n\nHagan Agrees With Obama\n\nToo Often 52 percent\n\nNot Often Enough 6 percent\n\nAbout Right 37 percent\n\nNearly 40 percent of North Carolina voters were very worried about the direction of the nation\u2019s economy. These voters supported Tillis, 72 percent to 25 percent.\n\nWorried About Future of U.S. Economy?\n\nVery 39 percent\n\nSomewhat 36 percent\n\nNot too 19 percent\n\nNot at all 5 percent\n\nVirginia\n\nIn a race that is still too close to call Wednesday morning, Sen. Mark Warner received an unexpectedly strong challenge from Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie. The race was driven in part by dissatisfaction with President Obama\u2019s job performance.\n\nObama job performance\n\nApprove 40 percent\n\nDisapprove 58 percent\n\nSeniors, who strongly supported Warner in 2008, broke for Gillespie Tuesday, which contributed to the closeness of the race.\n\nSeniors\n\nWarner 46 percent\n\nGillespie 54 percent\n\nFour out of five Virginia voters are worried about the direction of the nation\u2019s economy next year. Only 40 percent of those voters went for Warner, while 58 percent went for Gillespie.\n\nWorried About Future\n\nOf US Economy?\n\nWorried 82 percent\n\nNot Worried 18 percent\n\nMethodology\n\nEdison
