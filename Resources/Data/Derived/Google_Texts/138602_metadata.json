More students are opting to customize their online MBAs to save money, time and accelerate their career path. Online students are adding additional areas of emphasis, fast-tracking their education with competency-based offerings that allow students to test out of certain classes based on workplace-gained knowledge and pursuing dual degrees.\n\nOne example of a customized MBA is the physician-based MBA, a popular choice among doctors looking to bolster their business knowledge.\n\nSusannah Gawor, the program director for the Indiana University Kelley School of Business physician-only MBA program, says many veteran physicians are turning to online or hybrid MBAs as they adjust to new, business leadership roles encouraged by portions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Physicians are trying to be in the patient advocate role, but they don\u2019t always have the vocabulary and the skills they need to lead the discussion and bridge the gap between administration and clinical practice,\" Gawor says. \"If you don\u2019t understand the business issues behind decisions in the industry, how can you properly advocate?\"\n\nIndiana University is one of at leas\u200b\u200bt \u200bthree universities in the country \u2013 the other two being University of Tennessee and Auburn University \u2013 to offer physician-based MBAs, Gawor says. Online students in Indiana\u2019s program take core MBA classes the first year and have the chance during their second year to select from \u200bdifferent specialties, including health care-related topics.\n\nIndiana\u2019s business school is also offering other customized programs tailored to specific student populations, including online-only classes for current and former NFL players, and a program for General Electric information technology employees who are working toward a certificate program that can be applied to an MBA or Master of Science degree.\n\n\"Customizing is a growing trend,\" Gawor says. \"We have to customize graduate education because many students have been out long enough that they know what they do know and what they do not know.\"\n\n[Discover why online MBA programs offer an easier admissions path.]\n\nAnother way for online students to customize an MBA is by shortening the experience, a move which can save students money as well as time.\n\nSchools such as the nonprofit\u200b Western Governors University, an online university, offer competency-based degrees where credit is given for knowledge gained in the workplace. WGU, the first university in the U.S. to offer competency-based degrees, charges a flat rate of $3,250 for a six-month term of MBA classes.\n\nStudents can take as many or as few credits as they want for the same price, says WGU President Bob Mendenhall. According to WGU, the average time to complete an MBA is 22 months, which costs approximately $13,000.\n\nThat\u2019s helped online students like Kristin Mote, \u200ba 40-year-old mother of three who works full time as a respiratory therapist in Willard, Utah. With 20 years of experience in the health care industry, Mote, who started her MBA in health care management in April 2014, was able to quickly test out of some of her course work and plans on earning her degree by March 2015.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160504_Chinese\",\"text\":\"Upward of 304,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. during the 2014-2015 academic year.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "More students are personalizing their online MBAs to save\r\nmoney, time and accelerate their career path.", "zone": "homepage", "author": "Dawn Reiss", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "More students are personalizing their online MBAs to save\r\nmoney, time and accelerate their career path.", "title": "Online MBAs Starting to Offer Customization Options", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2014/09/11/online-mbas-starting-to-offer-customization-options", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/60/81/adda1b6145009e7fd7c08708090a/140910-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "More students are personalizing their online MBAs to save\r\nmoney, time and accelerate their career path.", "card": "summary", "title": "Online MBAs Starting to Offer Customization Options - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "Online Education", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/01ca239/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F60%2F81%2Fadda1b6145009e7fd7c08708090a%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140910-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "online education,online MBA,students,education,graduate schools,business school,Dawn Reiss", "published_at": "2014-09-11", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-09-11"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z34e81", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Schools such as the nonprofit\u200b Western Governors University, an online university, offer competency-based degrees where credit is given for knowledge gained in the workplace.\nThat\u2019s helped online students like Kristin Mote, \u200ba 40-year-old mother of three who works full time as a respiratory therapist in Willard, Utah.\nOnline MBA students can personalize their program by adding additional areas of emphasis, pursuing competency-based offerings and enrolling in dual degrees.\n[Discover why online MBA programs offer an easier admissions path.]\nAnother way for online students to customize an MBA is by shortening the experience, a move which can save students money as well as time."}
