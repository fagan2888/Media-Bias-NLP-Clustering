With its endorsement, North Carolina Right to Life points to Rep. Tillis\u2019 outstanding pro-life leadership as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThom Tillis has demonstrated his effectiveness in the fight to protect innocent human life in North Carolina with his leadership in the North Carolina House. His excellent style and knowledge will serve him well in advocating for the unborn babies and their mothers in the U.S. Senate,\u201d said Barbara Holt, president of North Carolina Right to Life.\n\nHolt told LifeNews that, as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Thom Tillis led the effort with the other pro-life members of the legislature in passing a number of measures protecting unborn children and their mothers.\n\nHolt says Tillis\u2019 pro-life record and views are a stark contrast to pro-abortion Sen. Kay Hagan\u2019s record since being elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nHagan voted for the \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u201d \u2013 better known as Obamacare \u2013 which provides government funding for insurance plans that pay for abortion-on-demand, and will lead to the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments. Earlier in 2014, Kay Hagan voted against a measure that would have protected the religious liberties of employers by protecting them from being forced to purchase health plans that cover drugs and procedures to which they have religious or moral objections.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nHolt says Hagan was quoted in the News and Observer as opposing the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which protects pain capable unborn children 20 weeks and older from abortion. The pro-abortion senator also has the endorsement of Emily\u2019s List that supports women candidates who support abortion on demand.\n\n\u201cKay Hagan\u2019s pro-abortion positions do not reflect North Carolina values. She refuses to protect unborn children and their mothers by supporting commonsense legislation that protects pain capable unborn children,\u201d Said Barbara Holt.\n\nIn April, Tillis received the pro-life endorsement of the National Right to Life Committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina Pro-Life Group Backs Thom Tillis for U.S. Senate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Yesterday, North Carolina Right to Life, the state's oldest and largest pro-life organization, endorsed North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis for the U.S. Se", "title": "North Carolina Pro-Life Group Backs Thom Tillis for U.S. Senate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/08/26/north-carolina-pro-life-group-backs-thom-tillis-for-u-s-senate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/thomtillis2-190x126.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "north carolina pro-life group backs thom tillis for u.s. senate", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded7e\"", "article_summary": "Yesterday, North Carolina Right to Life, the state\u2019s oldest and largest pro-life organization, endorsed North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis for the U.S. Senate.\nWith its endorsement, North Carolina Right to Life points to Rep.
