EDITOR: I am appalled by the proposal to move the Charles M. White Public Library out of downtown. I lived in Stevens Point from the time I was four years old until I graduated from P.J. Jacobs in 1954. The library was the heart of the city. From the time I was in second grade, I could walk to the library. Even after I graduated from high school, when I was home on breaks from University of Wisconsin-Madison, I would go to the library to study.

The library has a long history and the current building has a special significance. Charlie White was a figure recognizable to many Pointers. He lived in a rundown hotel on the south side and every day he walked from the south side to downtown. Today he would probably be considered homeless, wearing an overcoat and looking disheveled. A lot of us thought he was going to the square to spend his day in the bars, but the librarians and regular library patrons knew better. He spent much of his day in the library. When he died he left $140,000 to the city for an unspecified “project or building that will be beneficial” to the people of the community. The city decided to use the money to fund a new library building.

Don’t move this library! Support it! It is part of the history of Stevens Point and a community resource.
