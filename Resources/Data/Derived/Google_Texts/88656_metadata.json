Due to the great variance in courses and race-day conditions, head-to-head comparisons between runners were generally given great consideration. The boys and girls cross country runners of the year and the boys and girls coaches of the year will be announced at the annual Parade of Athletes banquet May 19, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 15 Dec 2013 11:55:58 -0400", "Description": "First Team", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "First Team", "title": "All Hillsborough County girls cross country team", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/preps/all-hillsborough-county-girls-cross-country-team-20131215/", "image": {"width": 3738, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131215/ARTICLE/131219489/EP/1/3/EP-131219489.jpg", "height": 3270}, "updated_time": "2013-12-15T11:58:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "First Team", "title": "All Hillsborough County girls cross country team", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131215/ARTICLE/131219489/AR/0/AR-131219489.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-15T11:55:58Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T11:58:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0681\"", "article_summary": "Eliana Ochoa, Brandon, So., Second at county meet, placed 24th at 3A state meet in 19:22.09.\nAnna Montgomery, Plant, Sr., County meet champion, helped lead Panthers to sixth-place overall finish.\n; Julia DeYoung, Robinson, Sr.; Colleen Doherty, Academy of Holy Names, Jr.; Emily Schonder, Chamberlain, Sr.; Claire Snyder, Academy of Holy Names, Sr.; Emily Zwijacz, Newsome, Jr.\nMaggie Parrish, Chamberlain, So., Third at county meet, ran 19:21at flrunners.com Invite.\nMaddy Hull, Robinson, Sr., Placed fifth at county meet, ran 19:34.3 at flrunners.com invite."}
