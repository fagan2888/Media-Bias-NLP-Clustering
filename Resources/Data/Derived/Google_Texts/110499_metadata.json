Thad Cochran is closing out the final days of his primary campaign by promising voters that if he\u2019s re-elected he will keep doing what he has done for decades: fighting to make sure that Mississippi gets its \u201cfair share\u201d of the federal pie.\n\nThe promise of the Republican incumbent clashes with the limited government message that two-term state Sen. Chris McDaniel, his tea party-backed challenger, has espoused on the campaign trail, where he has called Mississippi a \u201cwelfare state,\u201d pledged to get government off people\u2019s backs, and blamed the likes of Mr. Cochran for the nation\u2019s $17 trillion national debt.\n\nThe irony, according to political observers and GOP insiders, is that the thing that could end Mr. Cochran\u2019s 36 years in the Senate \u2014 his proven ability to steer federal funding to Mississippi \u2014 is the same thing that also could save it.\n\nPHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals\n\n\u201cMississippi would dry up like a prune if we didn\u2019t have the federal government,\u201d said Joseph Parker, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\n\u201cObviously, cussing the federal government is like kicking the dog \u2014 everybody does it for one reason or another, but Mississippi is getting a fabulous return on its investment in Washington,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\nMississippi and New Mexico are ranked as the most dependent states on the federal government, according to a recent study from WalletHub, a personal finance social network.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tea party on life support after brutal primary beatdown\n\nThe study said that federal funding comprises nearly 46 percent of Mississippi\u2019s revenue and said the state received $3.07 back for ever dollar it sent to the federal government.\n\nA Tax Foundation study also found that Mississippi ranked first in the amount of federal aid as percentage of state revenue.\n\nMr. Cochran, 76, has been master at bringing home the bacon, and suggested during the campaign that he\u2019d like to see the return of earmarks, which lawmakers put on ice in 2010.\n\nIn the three years leading up to moratorium, Mr. Cochran steered more earmarks to his home state than any other member of Congress.\n\n\u201cSenator Cochran requested 709 earmarks, costing taxpayers $1.9 billion dollars,\u201d said Thomas A. Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste. \u201cEach year he had both the highest number and dollar amount in earmarks. It would be legitimate to say that Sen. Cochran was the No. 1 earmarked, or porker, however you want to describe it, for fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Mr. Cochran also helped secure disaster funding for the state, and is now in line to become chairman of the powerful appropriations committee if Republicans win control of the Senate.\n\nBut Mr. Cochran\u2019s genteel, old fashioned, approach has fallen out of favor with the conservative grass roots, which celebrate the likes of Sen. Ted Cruz, the fresh Texas Republican of Texas who has taken more of a no-holds-barred approach to governing.\n\nMr. McDaniel, 42, says that he is cut from the same cloth as Mr. Cruz, and caught flak earlier this year for saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis race is about Mississippi\u2019s future not its past,\u201d said Noel Fritsch, a spokesman for Mr. McDaniel\u2019s campaign. \u201cMississippi voters know we need a change in Washington. The status quo has left not just our country but in fact our state worse off.\u201d\n\nKevin Broughton, spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, which has spent nearly $630,000 on behalf of Mr. McDaniel, said that Mr. McDaniel is challenging conservatives to take a good look in the mirror.\n\n\u201cWe call ourselves conservatives, but here are the state party machine leaders saying we cannot afford to lose this spigot of money flowing our way,\u201d Mr. Broughton said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of criticism we level at Democrats and liberals all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we are going to be that way, if Republicans in Mississippi think that the most important thing is to keep our addiction to federal money sated, or satiated, that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s embrace it and be ideologically honest about it \u2014 but let\u2019s never call ourselves conservatives again,\u201d Mr. Broughton said.\n\nBut Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a top GOP fundraiser, has emphasized that Mississippi is the poorest state in the nation and said that Mr. Cochran\u2019s seniority is \u201cincredibly important\u201d for the state.\n\n\u201cYou have a whole lot of people whose jobs have resulted from things that Thad has done that are good for the country and good for the state,\u201d Mr. Barbour said. \u201cPeople are appreciative of it. Mississippi knows it, and they may have to be reminded of it sometimes, but they are appreciated of it.\u201d\n\nJoe Worrell, 51, of Magee, said he wants change, but he wants it done right, and will likely support Mr. Cochran.\n\n\u201cYou gotta do what you gotta do to get the money for your state,\u201d Mr. Worrell said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll scratch your back, you scratch mine. It has been that way forever.\u201d\n\nRalph Lauderdale, 64, of Booneville, also said he appreciates the success Mr. Cochran has had bringing money back to the state, as well as his response to Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\u201cHe is trying his best to bring financial betterment to Mississippi,\u201d Mr. Lauderdale said. \u201cHe is in a position that he can lean a lot of his influence toward Mississippi. Sometimes, in politics, it is better to have someone who has been there than someone who has to build up his reputation with other members.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
