The Colorado legislature this week appropriated nearly $2.07 million in compensation for five property owners and a utility company affected by the Lower North Fork fire.

This brings the total paid by the state to $4.9 million among 16 claimants.

The March 22, 2012, controlled burn that became the Lower North Fork fire, which killed three people, was set by the Colorado State Forest Service doing watershed-protection work on land owned by Denver Water in the Jefferson County foothills near Conifer. The blaze destroyed 24 buildings and burned 4,140 acres.

Twenty-nine other landowners are in the process of seeking compensation from the state for their losses in the wildfire.

Deputy Attorney General Vince Morscher said the State Claims Board, which hears claims and forwards payment recommendations to the legislature, is committed to considering settlements for claimants who wish to resolve claims expeditiously.

“We want persons with viable claims to be compensated for their losses and be able to move on with their lives,” Morscher said.

The six claimants who settled Thursday:

• William and Maureen Larson: $525,000

• E. Fontaine Larue and Carolyn M. Larue Trust: $255,000

• Jill and David Owens: $360,000

• Davie Cottrell and Kristen Moeller: $432,500

• Walter Harvey Eucker and Black Gold Construction Inc.: $282,000

• Intermountain Rural Electric Association: $212,000.

More claimant hearings are scheduled for Feb. 24 and March 10.
