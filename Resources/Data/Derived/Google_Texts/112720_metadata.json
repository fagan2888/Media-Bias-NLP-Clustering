RAD stands for \"referral aggregator database.\"\n\nPatients, particularly in times of medical stress, need to know that their providers \"at least know about trans lives,\" Johnson said, and to \"know that I'm not going to freak them out by showing up.\"\n\nA study published earlier this year in the American Journal of Public Health found that fewer than 10 percent of academic medical staffs in the country had procedures or policies in place to identify LGBT-competent physicians. While 16 percent of respondents reported having comprehensive LGBT-competency training, 52 percent said they had no such training processes in place.\n\nHowever, they said, there is a strong desire on the part of the medical community to engage with LGBT patients and learn better treatment strategies and regimens. Eighty percent of participants expressed interest in actively addressing these issues, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the blog post\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated articles\n\nLatest Aetna marketing campaign targets LGBT community\n\nLGBT-competent doctors few and far between\n\n4 ways to tackle healthcare disparaties\n\nACHE 2015: Healthcare must focus on vulnerable populations", "article_metadata": {"description": "A transgender advocacy group has created a directory of physicians and other caregivers that rates the providers on how knowledgeable and non-discriminatory they are regarding trans and genderfluid patients,\u00a0according to\u00a0Boston Public Radio's\u00a0Common Health\u00a0blog.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A transgender advocacy group has created a directory of physicians and other caregivers that rates the providers on how knowledgeable and non-discriminatory they are regarding trans and genderfluid patients,\u00a0according to\u00a0Boston Public Radio's\u00a0Common Health\u00a0blog.", "title": "Transgender patients form their own health referral networks", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/transgender-patients-form-their-own-health-referral-networks/2015-07-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,LGBT,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction,transgender,transgender patients", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "Horror stories abound of transgender patients who must undergo humiliating psychiatric and physical exams before they receive access to treatment for life-threatening conditions, according to the Huffington Post.\nMany doctors do not understand that trans men still need breast cancer exams and trans women still need to be checked for prostate cancer.\n\"The first thing [the doctor] said was, 'I have a real problem with your transgender status,'\" Kallio told the Huffington Post.\n\"So this is what a breast surgeon wanted to do with my breast cancer,\" said Kallio, \"is first send me to psychiatry.\"\nBy David FergusonA transgender advocacy group has created a directory of physicians and other caregivers that rates the providers on how knowledgeable and non-discriminatory they are regarding trans and genderfluid patients, according to Boston Public Radio's Common Health blog."}
