It's pretty gross and just weird. Why the hell would you go to the Grand Canyon if you hate wildlife? Spend another night in Scottsdale or something, clowns.\n\nFrom the Republic:\n\nGrand Canyon Chief Ranger Bill Wright said Monday that the case will remain open, but none of the tips provided by the public have led to the alleged squirrel-kicker. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) announced last week that it is adding a vacation to the Grand Canyon to the $15,000 reward it offered last month for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man. [...] PETA wants anyone with information to contact Wright at 928-638-7888.\n\nIn my head, I'm sort of hoping those guys ended up falling into a hole somewhere, blown off-balance by a seemingly-random gust of wind, but that's probably wishful thinking.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "The Range Blog Post", "description": "Bummer of the day: the park ranger heading up the investigation of that guy who (apparently) kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon says that...", "title": "Those French Guys Are Seemingly Going to Get Away With Their Squirrel-Kicking Crimes | The Range: The Tucson Weekly's Daily Dispatch | Tucson Weekly", "og": {"site_name": "Tucson Weekly", "description": "Bummer of the day: the park ranger heading up the investigation of that guy who (apparently) kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon says that...", "title": "Those French Guys Are Seemingly Going to Get Away With Their Squirrel-Kicking Crimes", "url": "http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2014/09/09/those-french-guys-are-seemingly-going-to-get-away-with-their-squirrel-kicking-crimes", "image": {"width": 591, "identifier": "http://media1.fdncms.com/tucsonweekly/imager/those-french-guys-are-seemingly-going-to-g/u/slideshow/4824695/1410303604-squirrel_kicker.jpg", "height": 375}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bummer of the day: the park ranger heading up the investigation of that guy who (apparently) kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon says that...", "title": "Those French Guys Are Seemingly Going to Get Away With Their Squirrel-Kicking Crimes", "image": {"src": "http://media1.fdncms.com/tucsonweekly/imager/those-french-guys-are-seemingly-going-to-g/u/slideshow/4824695/1410303604-squirrel_kicker.jpg"}, "creator": "@dangibson520", "site": "@tucsonweekly", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "oid": 4824694, "fb": {"app_id": 187122448009492}, "keywords": "grand canyon squirrel kickers, peta, grand canyon, people are terrible, squirrel kicker, news, politics, elections, tucson democrats, tucson republicans, arizona news, arizona legislature,, Tucson Weekly", "google-site-verification": "1shMVE6r6wpDwBgxHmNKSAVS9_A0RaoG53XlEOtHOJM", "thumbnail": "http://media1.fdncms.com/tucsonweekly/imager/those-french-guys-are-seemingly-going-to-g/u/slideshow/4824695/1410303604-squirrel_kicker.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "grand canyon squirrel kickers, peta, grand canyon, people are terrible, squirrel kicker, news, politics, elections, tucson democrats, tucson republicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb28\"", "article_summary": "Why the hell would you go to the Grand Canyon if you hate wildlife?\nBummer of the day: the park ranger heading up the investigation of that guy who (apparently) kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon says that the investigation has hit a dead end.\nIn my head, I'm sort of hoping those guys ended up falling into a hole somewhere, blown off-balance by a seemingly-random gust of wind, but that's probably wishful thinking.\n[...] PETA wants anyone with information to contact Wright at 928-638-7888.\nFrom the Republic:Grand Canyon Chief Ranger Bill Wright said Monday that the case will remain open, but none of the tips provided by the public have led to the alleged squirrel-kicker."}
