(HarperCollins via AP) The Associated Press\n\nBy MARK KENNEDY, AP Drama Writer\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A stage adaptation of one of the most popular self-help books in the world is coming to a Manhattan theater, starring a Martian.\n\nPerformer Peter Story will star in a one-man show adapted from John Gray's book \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\" at the off-Broadway complex New World Stages this fall.\n\nGray's mega-selling hit about how couples can bridge the interplanetary gulch between the sexes became one of the biggest best-sellers in the country. Playwright Eric Coble, who wrote the Broadway play \"The Velocity of Autumn,\" has adapted it for the stage. Story has added personal elements from his life to the show.\n\n\"This is not a seminar. This is not a conference. This is not a 'Dr. Phil' show where I'm up there to give advice. This is a comedy show. This is going to feel very much like a stand-up comedy show,\" Story said last week.\n\n\"It's a great date night show, whether you've just started dating or you've been in a relationship for a long time. Because even if you're doing it right, this is a great night to be reminded of the things that you're doing, keep it right and get those spices flowing.\"\n\nThe two-act, 2-hour-long comedy \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Live!\" has had over 200 performances in more than 80 cities in 38 states since 2013. It starts performances Oct. 22 and opens Nov. 7 at New World Stages. The creative team promises it will be PG-13.\n\n\"The show is at its prime, and the only thing to do at that point is to go to New York City,\" said Story, who has appeared on television shows such as \"CSI,\" ''Without a Trace\" and \"Ugly Betty.\" ''We couldn't be more excited.\"\n\nProducer Paul Emery discovered the play in a theater just outside Holland in Amsterdam, performed in Dutch. Emery needed an interpreter but \"it was still hysterical as hell,\" he said. He got the rights to bring it to the United States and added humorous video animation. Mindy Cooper directs.\n\nHas performing the show helped navigate his own life? Story, who is married to performer Megan O'Neil, says yes.\n\n\"If I'm not doing at home what I'm speaking out on the road, let me tell you,\" he said, laughing. \"My wife has no problems calling me on the mat for it. Sometime repeating my own material to me.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://www.marsvenuslive.com\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "article_metadata": {"zone": "entertainment/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "'Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus' books NYC stage", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A stage adaptation of one of the most popular self-help books in the world is coming to a Manhattan theater, starring a Martian.", "title": "1-man stage show adapted from 'Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus' coming off-Broadway", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2015/08/10/men-are-from-mars-women-are-from-venus-books-nyc-stage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/2f/c85babc2c1fc64d920f28112a85860/media:aa26695f361d430d8f92d682f9f7d854Theater-MenArefromMars.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A stage adaptation of one of the most popular self-help books in the world is coming to a Manhattan theater, starring a Martian.", "card": "summary", "title": "'Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus' books NYC stage"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 10, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Entertainment,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A stage adaptation of one of the most popular self-help books in the world is coming to a Manhattan theater, starring a Martian."}, "article_summary": "The two-act, 2-hour-long comedy \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Live!\"\nPerformer Peter Story will star in a one-man show adapted from John Gray's book \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\" at the off-Broadway complex New World Stages this fall.\nThe two-act, 2-hour-long comedy \u201cMen Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Live!\u201d has had over 200 performances in more than 80 cities in 38 states since 2013.\nIt starts performances Oct. 22 and opens Nov. 7 at New World Stages.\nPlaywright Eric Coble, who wrote the Broadway play \"The Velocity of Autumn,\" has adapted it for the stage."}
