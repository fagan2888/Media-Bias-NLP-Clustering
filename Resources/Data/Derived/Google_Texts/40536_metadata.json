This is thanks to the effects of \u201can increasingly digitalized lifestyle on the brain.\u201d\n\nAt least I think that is what the article said. I lost interest and never finished it.\n\nIn any event, the report finds that \u201cHeavy multi-screeners find it difficult to filter out irrelevant stimuli \u2014 they're more easily distracted by multiple streams of media.\u201d\n\nWhich explains a lot about the lack of critical thinking these days.\n\nRemember when President Obama successfully used several vague platitudes to win two elections? All he had to do was promise hope and change and people started fainting in the aisles.\n\nHe convinced many low-information voters that he would be their savior. He'd achieve peace with Iran through the force of his charming personality. He said he'd pull our troops out of Iraq and all would be grand. He'd provide health care for all and it would cost lots less than we had been paying!\n\nAnd the low-info, short-attention-span crowd bought his zeal hook, line and sinker.\n\nNow Iran is outsmarting him at every step and, no small number of experts fear, his efforts are expediting, rather than inhibiting, Iran's goal of getting a nuke.\n\nBy pretending the opposition elements in Iraq were of a junior-varsity makeup, he pulled out the troops and left a massive void \u2014 unleashing massive chaos that is spreading throughout the region.\n\nObamaCare was sold to the public along emotional lines \u2014 insurance for all \u2014 and lies \u2014 costs would go down. ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber explained on several occasions that it was designed to dupe stupid Americans. Now we know insurance costs have soared for the vast majority of those who were happy with their insurance.\n\nDuring Obama's presidential campaigns, it was pointless to get into discussions with the average short-attention-span/low-info voter.\n\nIf you argued that Obama's hope of negotiating a peaceful outcome with Iran might be a fool's errand \u2014 that Iran has a long history of flouting international agreements \u2014 you were called a close-minded neocon.\n\nIf you argued that it was premature to pull our troops out of Iraq \u2014 that we still have troops in South Korea, Germany and Japan \u2014 you were called an imperialist and a warmonger.\n\nIf you argued that the best way to extend health coverage to the poor and uninsured was to address the cost challenges of our incredibly complex system, you were told you hated the poor and the uninsured.\n\nLook, the more citizens we have who lack the desire or focus to think things through, the more ripe we are for silver-tongued politicians and clever advocates of the latest hot-button issue to make useful idiots out of us.\n\nOr we can follow Bill Gates' advice on how to use deep, critical thinking to resolve our problems and achieve dramatically improved outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe barrier to change is not too little caring,\u201d said Gates in his 2007 Harvard commencement speech, \u201cit is too much complexity. To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.\u201d\n\nSo how do we cut through complexity? Gates says there are four stages: \u201cdetermine a goal, find the highest-leverage approach, discover the ideal technology for that approach,\u201d then \u201cmeasure the impact of your work and share your successes and failures so that others learn from your efforts.\u201d\n\nWe can do better, people \u2014 but that will require that we have a much better attention span than a goldfish.\n\nTom Purcell, a freelance writer, lives in Library.
