(AP photo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) -- Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) says that Congress will be prepared to successfully repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, if a Republican president is elected in November.\n\n\u201cIf a Republican president is sworn into office in only 11 months, we are going to be ready,\u201d Upton said. \u201cThat is the challenge that Speaker [Paul] Ryan put before us.\u201d\n\nHe said the Republican alternative to Obamacare would:\n\nEliminate federal mandates and allow Americans to pick the health care plans they want;\n\nTurn control over the insurance markets back to consumers and states;\n\nReduce costs and increase choices;\n\nProtect Americans with pre-existing conditions;\n\nAdd more transparency and competition;\n\nTarget assistance to lower-income Americans;\n\nModernize Medicare by capping expenditures and giving states improved flexibility; and\n\nExpand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).\n\n\u201cIn the next couple of months, the American people will see a specific policy on paper of our vision for health care,\u201d Upton pledged, adding that there is a consensus among Republicans in Congress on replacing Obamacare after it is repealed in 2017.\n\nSpeaker Ryan is \u201ccommitted not only to getting the big idea right, but also getting the process right,\u201d he said.\n\nUpton reminded attendees at a discussion panel presented by the nonprofit Conservative Reform Network and hosted by the Hoover Institution at the think tank\u2019s Washington suite that Obamacare has not lived up to expectations.\n\n\u201cSadly, sadly many of the predictions and warnings that we made about the law have come to pass and still, there are tens of millions with no coverage,\u201d Upton remarked.\n\nIn laying out the main elements of the Republican replacement proposal, the 15-term congressman also noted that it will remove several key features of the ACA.\n\n\u201cUnder our proposal, Obamacare\u2019s labyrinth of federal benefit mandates, rating restrictions and complex tax subsidy structures are gone. Just erased like an Etch-a-Sketch. Individual mandate tax and individual mandates are gone also,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInstead of forcing Americans to buy Washington-approved coverage, we empower the American people to make the best health care choices for both themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nIn February 2015, Upton, who serves as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, introduced the Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (CARE) Act.\n\nThe bill seeks to eliminate the federal mandates in President Barack Obama\u2019s signature piece of domestic legislation. Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) are co-sponsors.\n\nThe ACA garnered zero Republican votes in Congress when it was passed and signed into law by Obama in 2010. Upton argued the law has federalized the health care industry to its detriment.\n\n\u201cWe know that Washington doesn\u2019t always know best. So, we are truly seeing the perils of a one- size-fits-all policy constructed on truly obsolete ideas,\u201d he asserted. \u201cObamacare\u2019s government-centered premise is not new. The outdated ideas in Obamacare have failed people time and time again.\u201d\n\nAfter diagnosing the repercussions of Obamacare and prescribing an alternative, Upton declared a call-to-action.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the sake of our freedom and our opportunity, for the sake of the economy and the federal budget \u2014 something we all care about \u2014 the public deserves a fresh-looking approach that embraces 21st century innovation. We are going to make it happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Rep.
