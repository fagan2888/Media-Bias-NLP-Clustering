On Friday’s “Real Time” Bill Maher said that everyone knows a guy just like former McKinney, Texas police Cpl. Eric Casebolt, “the high school loser” type.

Opening up his McKinney segment, Maher told panelists — among them, Ron Christie (Daily Beast), Alexis Goldstein (The Other 98) and Mike Pesca (Slate) — that Casebolt obviously just wanted to “re-litigate his sh*tty adolescence” by being a cop because “now he’s got some power.”

The “Real Time” host continued: “He can lord it over people. It’s not that hard to weed out that personality type, is it?”

Goldstein, spokesperson for the non-profit group The Other 98, explained that she thought the problem was a result of us operating in a system of white supremacy for so long.
