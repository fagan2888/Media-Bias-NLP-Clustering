Todd Rokita (R-IN) over his party\u2019s continued crusade against Obamacare Thursday morning, pushing him to admit that Republicans\u2019 \u201cdivisive approach\u201d is responsible for the prolonged government shutdown. Rokita dismissed Costello\u2019s dogged questions by focusing on how young and beautiful he found the CNN host.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have children yet, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have grandchildren yet, you look much too young, but we\u2019re fighting for them,\u201d Rokita said. \u201cCarol, do you have any idea how much this law is going to cost?\u201d\n\nCostello shot back, \u201cDo you know how much it costs every day the government is partially shut down? You\u2019re costing taxpayers millions and millions of dollars!\u201d\n\nRokita insisted that Obamacare is \u201cone of the most insidious laws ever developed by men\u201d and will hurt the country \u201cmuch more than any government shutdown.\u201d Costello then pressed him on the upcoming dept ceiling fight, asking, \u201cObamacare hurts the country worse than [not] raising the debt ceiling? Because that\u2019s not what a bunch of Wall Street bankers told the president yesterday.\u201d\n\nRokita even dismissed the idea that defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt would be more harmful than Obamacare. \u201cI had a lot of CEOs in my office yesterday, and they didn\u2019t share the same vision with me that some CEOs apparently shared with the president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think most Americans would say fight that fight separate from the federal budget. Don\u2019t partially shut down the federal government, don\u2019t make things worse by fighting the same fight over and over,\u201d Costello argued.\n\nRokita responded, \u201cNo, you\u2019re part of the problem,\u201d prompting Costello to roll her eyes and scoff, \u201cUgh, come on. That\u2019s so easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarol, you\u2019re beautiful but you need to be honest as well,\u201d Rokita finally said, eliciting an eyebrow raise from Costello.\n\nWatch it:\n\n\n\nCostello also attacked Republicans\u2019 current piecemeal strategy of crafting bills to re-open specific parts of the federal government that have attracted the most attention, such as the closing of the national parks and war memorials.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "CNN's Carol Costello grilled Rep.
