Note: All this week in the Daily Reckoning email edition, Managing Editor Peter Coyne has been reporting direct from the streets of Havana, Cuba. He\u2019s on a fact-finding tour of the country with his travel companion Paul Mampilly \u2014 editor of Agora Financial\u2019s FDA Trader. Below, Pete relays one harrowing tale of \u201cintestinal fortitude\u201d from someone else he\u2019s met on the trip \u2014 and an account of the kind of medical treatment he received. Read on\u2026]\n\nThe first thing you would\u2019ve noticed about Michael was his bloodshot eyeballs.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I had things coming out of both ends of me nonstop,\u201d he told me over breakfast. \u201cA lot of things.\u201d\n\nYummm\u2026\n\nThe longer I look around Havana, the more I realize it\u2019s a magnificent place to have a friendly conversation\u2026 sip a mojito\u2026 or catch Montezuma\u2019s revenge.\n\nIn fact, it may be the only place in the world you can do all three things simultaneously.\n\nMichael, a 40-something, clean-cut and preppy North Carolinian journeyed out to a private restaurant, or \u201cpaladar,\u201d the other night. Privately owned restaurants are known for better water and food standards than the government-run ones.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was dying. I couldn\u2019t stop throwing up or using the bathroom.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all relative, though, because within hours of eating, the poor chap spent the night and next two days sitting and kneeling over a 1960s toilet.\n\nOnly this morning did we see him again. He was in good physical health but still in mental recovery\u2026\n\n\u201cHow was everything?\u201d we asked, concerned for our fellow traveler.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear?\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe needle story\u2026\u201d\n\nI leaned in\u2026 \u201cUhh, no, what needle story?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Michael explained, \u201cAfter I told you I was sick on Monday, I went back to my room. I felt like I was dying. I couldn\u2019t stop throwing up or using the bathroom.\u201d\n\nFor background, after Michael had told us he was sick Monday, we let the hotel front desk know our new friend needed a nurse or doctor.\n\n\u201cWithin the hour,\u201d Michael continued, \u201ca nurse knocked at my hotel door with a silver tray.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn broken English, she said to me, \u2018Need to inject,\u2019 which I was OK with. It was some sort of anti-nausea medication to stop the vomiting. But then she clarified where she needed to stick me\u2026 pointing to my rear end.\u201d\n\n\u201cOooh\u2026\u201d we whispered, wincing.\n\n\u201cI felt like hell\u2026 I barely had the energy to shake my head back and forth to say no.\n\n\u201cShe made me lie down\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWere the syringe and needle separate, prepackaged and disposable, or exposed and made of glass?\u201d asked our colleague Paul Mampilly. Paul\u2019s our investment director and editor of FDA Trader. It\u2019s the world\u2019s premier independent biotech research service. Safe to say, Paul knows what he\u2019s talking about here\n\n\u201cGlass and exposed,\u201d replied Michael. \u201cShe said it was sterilized\u2026 she also brought an antibiotic with her to kill the bug I caught.\u201d\n\nPaul turned to me. \u201cSee how fast they responded? Imagine if this happened in the U.S. First, he probably would\u2019ve gone to the ER. He would\u2019ve been subject to a CAT scan and at least 10 other tests. Then two more nurses would\u2019ve checked on him\u2026 and then a doctor. He would\u2019ve racked up thousands of dollars in costs. Instead, Fidel picked up the tab.\u201d\n\nBut Michael came to us at 8:10 a.m. on Monday, and within an hour, the nurse was at his door, already had a diagnosis and treatment and treated him. It was efficient and low-cost.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because,\u201d Paul continued, \u201cbasic medicine is cheap and easy to do. It\u2019s about pattern recognition. Notice she was able to diagnose Michael\u2019s symptoms without performing any tests. Without even seeing him. How?\n\n\u201cShe took the information we gave the hotel \u2014 he was a tourist\u2026 he ate at a paladar\u2026 a few hours later, he began vomiting and using the bathroom\u2026 etc. Based on her experience, she was able to narrow down what it was. She had seen tourists before who had it. That\u2019s how she knew to bring something to stop the vomiting and an antibiotic to kill the bacteria.\u201d\n\nIn Cuba, they\u2019re able to keep costs low because they don\u2019t do testing \u2014 except for very sophisticated illnesses.\n\nWould Michael\u2019s diagnosis have been any better if he were subjected to dozens of tests?\n\nBy contrast, we have doubts that many American doctors could do their job without tests or advanced technology. They don\u2019t use their judgment or their heads \u2014 just their eyes, following whatever the computer tells them.\n\nMore technology quickly becomes a hindrance to providing good health care. Would Michael\u2019s diagnosis have been any better if he were subjected to dozens of tests?\n\nNo system is without its flaw, however. They reuse syringes and needles because they can\u2019t afford more hygienic disposable ones. They use half-century-old sterilization techniques. People get stabbed in the rump instead of swallowing a pill. They have no standards, so safety can vary from doctor to doctor. These are symptoms of a society with no money. The less money you have, the more shortcuts you\u2019re forced to make.\n\nIn the U.S., there is what Paul calls an \u201cexpense cascade\u201d \u2014 which is set up to generate more and more money for doctors, hospitals, insurers and medical device and drug manufacturers. That\u2019s a function of government.\n\nIn Cuba, the health care is relatively good and low-cost. Yet the (very few) resources the Cubans have are poured into their health care system. That and education. Every other aspect of life is sub-substandard. That\u2019s also a function of government.\n\nHasta luego,\n\nPeter Coyne\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nP.S. Pick your poison, I suppose. But if you pick the \u201cexpense cascade\u201d, I recommend you read this essay from our friend Jud Anglin. Jud runs a company called MedRetreat \u2014 which helps Americans find better and cheaper health care services abroad. He got started back when Hillary Clinton was pushing the health care initiative back in the \u201990s. He was already beset by Crohn\u2019s disease and trying to figure out a way to negotiate the insurance system on his own. Obamacare to him was a major set back. Luckily he\u2019s found a way to reduce your health care costs through a new \u201cexchange.\u201d\n\nP.P.S. \u201cPeter,\u201d writes one reader, \u201cI have the ultimate respect for you now. You are not some fake. Yes, I would love to visit Cuba. The young folks of Cuba, I believe, will welcome \u2018capitalism\u2019 to better their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had to go there to find all of this out?\u201d questions another. \u201cWhere ya been the last 30 years or so? This is what communism does.\u201d\n\nUhh\u2026 seeing is believing. Besides, not everything is how it seems here. More on that later. If you\u2019re interested, here are a few more photos.\n\nJavier, smoking a cigar in St. Francis Square.\n\nAn old Chevy \u2014 used as a taxi \u2014 just outside Ernest Hemingway\u2019s house. Been asking every Cuban if they\u2019ll let me get behind the wheel of one. So far, no luck.\n\nOne of many ruins in Old Havana. The buildings are stunning\u2026 but they need repair. There is a huge opportunity for foreign investors to come, restore the city and profit.\n\nCarmen, after receiving her bread rations. Cubans get one piece of bread per day per family member. She told me she\u2019s happy \u2014 I wonder, however, if she could be even happier.\n\nThe bread rations building \u2014 and Cubans lining up to redeem their government coupons.\n\nJamie and Juana, two owners of a homemade chocolate and nut cart in Old Havana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Peter Coyne takes a look at the Cuban health care system and how it compares to the U.S. health care system.
