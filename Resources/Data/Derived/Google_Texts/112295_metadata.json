Since the building is abandoned and access to it is locked, they believe the taggers had to break in.\n\nNear Pine and Sandusky, there's another Bowser and Swank tag.\n\nTPD Cpl. Tracy Clark says it may not be a violent crime, but it's a crime that leaves its mark.\n\n\"Their weapon is a paint can, and they're destroying property with paint cans, that's what they use,\" Clark said.\n\nOklahoma City and Tulsa police have been working together to track down Bowser, Swank and Repos.\n\nOfficers arrested three people. Court records say officers believe Chicagoan Victor Reyes, from Chicago is Repos.\n\nThey say Hillary Gaby, an OSU student, identified herself as Swank and Paul Yeakey, who lives in Tulsa, identified himself as Bowser.\n\nNews On 6 knocked on Yeakey's door, but he didn't want to talk.\n\nTulsa police recently did a search warrant on a house and say they found 36 pounds of marijuana, $16,000 dollars in cash and more than 300 cans of spray paint, along with dozens of drawings depicting tagging designs.\n\nYeakey and Gaby have been charged with the drugs, but not with vandalism at this time. Police believe selling pot is how they fund their tagging trips.\n\nAs for the crew's nickname CTD \u2013- what does it mean?\n\n\"It's come to light that it stands for \"Costing Tax Dollars.\" That's what they're doing, painting this stuff on walls, bridges and railroad cars,\" Clark said. \"They want to cost us money.\"\n\nThe City of Tulsa spends about $100,000 a year painting over graffiti.\n\nPolice said it's an organized crime, and there's a whole underground operation with newsletters, updates and a huge following.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Tulsa police are investigating a local connection to a crime that's hit San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Detroit.", "author": "Lori Fullbright", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24959917/nationwide-grafitti-ring", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24959917_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tulsa police are investigating a local connection to a crime that's hit San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Detroit.", "title": "Nationwide Graffiti Ring Leaves Its Mark On Tulsa"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24959917_SA.jpg", "description": "Tulsa police are investigating a local connection to a crime that's hit San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Detroit.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nationwide Graffiti Ring Leaves Its Mark On Tulsa"}, "wnreadableurl": "nationwide-grafitti-ring", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/03/12", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "owner": "KOTV", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcd7\"", "article_summary": "Graffiti \"taggers\" known as Bowser, Swank and Repos go by the name CTD and have left their mark all over public and private buildings.\nTulsa police are investigating a local connection to a crime that's hit San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Detroit.\nOklahoma City and Tulsa police have been working together to track down Bowser, Swank and Repos.\nTracy Clark says it may not be a violent crime, but it's a crime that leaves its mark.\n\"Their weapon is a paint can, and they're destroying property with paint cans, that's what they use,\" Clark said."}
