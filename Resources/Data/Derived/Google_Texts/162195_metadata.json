Bobby Jindal said Friday.\n\nJindal, a Republican presidential hopeful, elaborated on the theme during an extended segment of a question-and-answer session at the Ideas Summit hosted by the National Review Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe governor\u2019s riff began with a criticism of President Obama\u2019s leadership but morphed into something more as he warmed up in front of a receptive crowd.\n\n\u201cThe president has done a great job\u2014and I don\u2019t mean this as a compliment\u2014but I think he has done a great job of dividing the country,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cHe divides us by gender, by race, by geography, by age, by income.\u201d\n\nWhat got Jindal going was the subject of the Baltimore riots that followed the funeral of a young black man who suffered a fatal injury while in police custody. The governor was careful not to minimize the sadness of the case or the need for local law enforcement to gather the facts and act accordingly.\n\nThen he said:\n\nLet the Democrats divide us with special interest groups. We should be speaking of universal aspirations. I believe every mom or dad wants their child to have a better education, have a better-paying job and live the American dream like my parents wanted for me.\n\nJindal, 43, is the son of parents who came to America from India. He told a favorite story of a young mother who, like her mother before her, had a baby while still a teen. She thanked the governor for a state program that made it possible for her daughter to get a scholarship to a parochial school in New Orleans.\n\nThe second-term governor, still pondering a White House run, quipped that he didn\u2019t think she voted for him, except perhaps \u201cby mistake.\u201d\n\nWhile on the subject of children, he boasted that on his watch Louisiana concentrated on private-sector growth to reverse a population drain and add residents in each of seven years. His administration \u201cmade tough choices so our kids would come back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere I think voters are today is that after six and a half or seven years, they\u2019ve seen this president\u2019s policies don\u2019t work,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a bunch of numbers to tell them \u2026 Their kids are still living on their couch after [graduating] school. They can\u2019t pay back their student loans, health care premiums didn\u2019t get cut $2,500. All the things we were told were going to happen didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nJindal\u2019s conclusion:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama has demonstrated the failure of \"progressivism,\" the Louisiana governor and Republican presidential hopeful says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama has demonstrated the failure of \"progressivism,\" the Louisiana governor and Republican presidential hopeful says.", "title": "Jindal: Voters \u2018Open to Conservatives Making Their Case\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Unknown12.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1c48FMH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama has demonstrated the failure of \"progressivism,\" the Louisiana governor and Republican presidential hopeful says.", "title": "Jindal: Voters \u2018Open to Conservatives Making Their Case\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Unknown12.jpeg"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-05-01T19:35:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bobby Jindal president, Bobby Jindal Louisiana, Bobby Jindal Obama, National Review Institute, Ideas Summit, Bobby Jindal"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhere I think voters are today is that after six and a half or seven years, they\u2019ve seen this president\u2019s policies don\u2019t work,\u201d Jindal said.\nConservatives have an opportunity to present a clear alternative to the consequences of failed liberal policies that have become part of everyday life to Americans, Louisiana Gov.\nThe governor was careful not to minimize the sadness of the case or the need for local law enforcement to gather the facts and act accordingly.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a bunch of numbers to tell them \u2026 Their kids are still living on their couch after [graduating] school.\nHe told a favorite story of a young mother who, like her mother before her, had a baby while still a teen."}
