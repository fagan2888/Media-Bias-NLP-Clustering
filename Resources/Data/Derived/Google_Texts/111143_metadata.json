More surprising is her criticism of the way he speaks about his faith.\n\nJohn Kasich, she says, \u201crants about religion in a way that only he can understand.\u201d Her first example:\n\nKasich is constantly proclaiming that illegals are \u201cmade in the image of God,\u201d and denounces the idea of enforcing federal immigration laws, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s humane.\u201d\n\nFor someone who famously called for the United States to invade Muslim countries \u201ckill their leaders and convert them to Christianity\u201d in the days immediately following September 11 and has also written a book excoriating liberalism for being \u201cgodless,\u201d the above lines display an astonishing lack of knowledge of basic Christianity.\n\nThe idea that we are made in the image of God, of course, comes from the creation account in Genesis 1, verses 26 and 27. That we are made in the image of God is, to state the obvious, one of the fundamental tenets of the Christian faith. It is the basis for our belief in the dignity of the human person as someone bearing the very image of God. And this, being the creation account, this is a dignity that all members of the human race\u2014regardless of race, creed, or religion have.\n\nFor Catholics specifically, the truth that we are made in the image of God is the cornerstone of Church\u2019s entire pro-life message, social teaching, and much of its theology\u2014from its vision of the human person as a rational being endowed with freedom to its understanding of the Incarnation.\n\nKasich is Anglican, but the importance of this truth is hardly recognized by Catholics alone. It\u2019s cited in the Westminster Confession of Faith and appears to hold a place of centrality in the theology of contemporary Protestant Reformers (see for example this article).\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe Ann Coulter does not recognize the reference to the creation account Genesis, but her wording certainly indicates that possibility. That\u2019s actually the more charitable reading of her column. The alternative is that she cannot understand how illegal aliens could be possibility deserving of the respect for the dignity of the person that Genesis urges all of us to have for all people by virtue of their common humanity. In other words, Coulter seems to be saying that the suggestion that illegal aliens should be treated in ways that do not denigrate their human dignity is a confusing concept for GOP voters.\n\nOne certainly hopes not.\n\nFor Kasich, such recognition apparently leads to his support for full amnesty for illegal immigrants. (For the record, Kasich disputes such characterizations.)\n\nOf course, embracing the teaching of Genesis does not compel one to agree with him. But it does impose an obligation on Christian voters and policymakers to ensure that whatever particular solution they envision for the problem of illegal immigration is one that does not violate their basic human dignity. That leaves a lot of room for a range of humane solutions. But it probably does enjoin Christians to refrain from talking about illegal immigrants as if all are inveterate drug-smuggling rapists who live on welfare.\n\nBut there\u2019s more that Coulter says is confusing about Kasich\u2019s Christianity:\n\nWhen asked about his decision to expand Medicaid under Obamacare\u2014projected to cost federal taxpayers $50 billion in the first decade\u2014he said: \u201cNow, when you die and get to the, get to the, uh, to the meeting with St. Peter \u2026 he\u2019s going to ask you what you did for the poor. Better have a good answer.\u201d\n\nHe lectured a crowd of fiscal conservatives on his Obamacare expansion, saying, \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know whether you ever read Matthew 25, but I commend it to you, the end of it, about do you feed the homeless and do you clothe the poor.\u201d He also attributed the law to Chief Justice John Roberts and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my money, OK?\u201d\n\nCoulter\u2019s claim that this is overly religious \u201cranting\u201d that \u201cno one understands\u201d is itself puzzling. Who isn\u2019t familiar with the popular cultural of image of St. Peter being the greeter at the \u201cpearly gates\u201d of heaven? And who hasn\u2019t heard the gospel commands to feed the homeless and clothe the poor? Certainly Christians may disagree with how Kasich applies these gospel principles to public policy. But the fact that such a connection could be made should hardly be confusing.\n\nAgain the alternative interpretation of her words worse: that Coulter has become so accustomed to reading the Christian gospels in light of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek\u2014or whatever laissez faire libertarian author is her gospel when it comes to economic questions\u2014that the mere suggestion that the injunction to help the poor would be cited as a basis for government programs has become simply incomprehensible to her.\n\nAll of which leads one to wonder: when Coulter once advocated for forcible mass conversions to Christianity\u2014a position that she never retracted or backed down from as far as this author knows\u2014just what did she have in mind when she talks about \u2018Christianity\u2019?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent column, avowed pro-Trump supporter Ann Coulter takes John Kasich\u2014who dropped out of the\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "In a recent column, avowed pro-Trump supporter Ann Coulter takes John Kasich\u2014who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this ...", "title": "Ann Coulter\u2019s Embarrassing Failure to Grasp Basics of Christianity", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/blog/sbeale/ann-coulters-embarrassing-failure-to-grasp-basics-of-christianity/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/NCRegister_square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/blog/sbeale/ann-coulters-embarrassing-failure-to-grasp-basics-of-christianity/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/NCRegister_square.jpg", "description": "In a recent column, avowed pro-Trump supporter Ann Coulter takes John Kasich\u2014who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this ...", "card": "summary", "title": "Ann Coulter\u2019s Embarrassing Failure to Grasp Basics of Christianity"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register Blogs, Catholic News, Vatican News, Catholic Blogs, Catholic Information, Catholic Church, Pope, Pope Benedict, Catholic Bishops, Catholic Cardinals , Stephen Beale,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s hard to believe Ann Coulter does not recognize the reference to the creation account Genesis, but her wording certainly indicates that possibility.\nOf course, embracing the teaching of Genesis does not compel one to agree with him.\nThat we are made in the image of God is, to state the obvious, one of the fundamental tenets of the Christian faith.\nIt is the basis for our belief in the dignity of the human person as someone bearing the very image of God.\nThe idea that we are made in the image of God, of course, comes from the creation account in Genesis 1, verses 26 and 27."}
