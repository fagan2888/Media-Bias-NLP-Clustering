He also is starting his third season as special teams captain by vote of his teammates.\n\nBruton\u2019s assignment Sunday wasn\u2019t up for vote. When Pro Bowl safety T. J. Ward was suspended for one game for violating the NFL personal conduct policy, Bruton was summoned to make his sixth start dating back to 2009 when he joined the team as a fourth-round draft choice from Notre Dame.\n\nBroncos coach Gary Kubiak proclaimed a comfort level with Bruton ready to step in.\n\n\u201cDavid has worked as a starter a lot in camp. He was in the battle with \u201cStew\u201d (safety Darian Stewart) a lot. David is a talker. He\u2019s being put into an environment where he needs to lead and he\u2019s a leader. His teammates named him captain.\u201d\n\nBruton at 6-foot-2, 217 pounds, brings a little more size into the defensive backfield than Ward\u2019s 5-10, 200 pounds.\n\n\u201cAs a professional, I\u2019m always ready to go out and play when my number is called,\u201d Bruton said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m going to continue to try and make a name for myself in this league. It\u2019s very touching that the guys see me as a leader. I feel like they have confidence in me.\u201d\n\nBruton knows the Ravens pretty well, and understands he\u2019ll be facing a strong-armed passing team with quarterback Joe Flacco and a productive running game.\n\nBroncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips noted that the change of personnel will cause some adjustments, but he also is high on Bruton\u2019s qualities.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really a smart player, and he\u2019s not going to make any mistakes,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cHe makes a lot of plays and we\u2019re glad to have him.\u201d\n\nCornerback Aqib Talib looks forward to having Bruton in the defensive backfield.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a drop off at all,\u201d Talib said. \u201cBruton has a lot of experience. He\u2019s been in games before.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos safety David Bruton ready to step up in T.J.
