The family was suing because they were being forced on to the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, which only offers plans that require them to pay for other people\u2019s abortions.\n\nBarth and Abbie Bracy had insurance through a private insurer, but Obamacare forced the insurer to cancel the policy effective later this year. Forced on to the Obamacare exchange, the Bracys were left only with plans that include a mandatory surcharge used to fund the elective abortions of others. Ironically, Barth Bracy is executive director of The Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee and has warned people of exactly the problems his family is now facing.\n\nThe lawsuit also challenged secrecy clauses within Obamacare which forbid Americans from being told prior to enrollment whether the plans they would purchase on an exchange will include abortion coverage. The clauses also forbid Americans from being told how much of the premium is a federally mandated abortion surcharge that pays for other people\u2019s elective abortions.\n\nNow, their attorneys, Alliance Defending Freedom, have informed LifeNews that the Bracy family won\u2019t be forced to pay Obamacare\u2019s abortion surcharge.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorneys voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against federal and state officials Wednesday after the addition of Obamacare plan options that, for the first time in Connecticut, will not require participants to pay for others\u2019 elective abortions. Despite the Connecticut change, many American families are still being forced to pay hidden abortion surcharges.\n\n\u201cAmericans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Casey Mattox. \u201cThe Bracy family has experienced first-hand the kind of deception that was used to pass and that continues to pervade this law. While we are pleased that Connecticut families will now have a choice to avoid paying this abortion surcharge, it is a shame that other families won\u2019t have that choice, and that most Americans don\u2019t even know that they must pay this secret fee.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nFederal law forbids taxpayer subsidies for elective abortions; however, the Affordable Care Act requires every exchange plan that includes abortion to collect a separate fee that is used exclusively to pay for abortions. The ACA further forbids disclosure of the abortion surcharge to customers.\n\nThe Connecticut state health exchange only offered plans that include abortion coverage, and thus every plan on the exchange required the hidden abortion surcharge. While plans not requiring the abortion surcharge will now be available in Connecticut, many families in Connecticut and elsewhere are unaware that a portion of their premium is being used to pay solely for abortions.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office has confirmed that people seeking coverage on the exchanges in Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, and Rhode Island continue to have no choice but to enroll in a plan requiring an abortion surcharge. All plans nationwide that include abortion coverage require the surcharge, but the ACA requires that it not be separately disclosed in the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Life Family Forced Onto Obamacare Wins Battle to Avoid Paying for Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "A pro-life leader and his family who lost their health plan due to Obamacare filed suit in federal court this year.
