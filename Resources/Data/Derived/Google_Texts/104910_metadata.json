Tammy Duckworth focused on Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk while candidates Andrea Zopp and state Sen. Napoleon Harris traded criticisms on criminal justice reforms and closing Chicago Public Schools during the first major gathering of Democratic U.S. Senate hopefuls on Monday.\n\nThe exchange on criminal justice marked one of the few contentious moments during a largely sedate joint appearance before the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board. The lack of rancor was symbolized by the candidates declining an offer to ask their opponents a pointed question.\n\nInstead, the Democratic hopefuls used the 80 minutes or so to introduce themselves and their campaigns as well as to explain why each thought they were uniquely qualified to challenge Kirk, a first-term Republican who may be among the most vulnerable Senate incumbents up for election this year.\n\nZopp, a former state and federal prosecutor who once headed the Chicago Urban League, pointed to a lack of trust of police in impoverished neighborhoods highlighted by controversy over the November release of video of the 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teen, by Jason Van Dyke, a white Chicago officer.\n\nMurder charges were filed against Van Dyke shortly before the release of the video, which showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from officers. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the shooting and conducting a civil rights probe of the Police Department.\n\nHarris has \"been largely silent on the critical issue facing our community, as has been Congresswoman Duckworth. I've been outspoken on the issue, called early on for the Department of Justice to come in and investigate Chicago Police Department pattern and practice,\" Zopp said.\n\nCaption State Sen.

(WGN-TV / Chicago Tribune)\n\n\"This is not just a Chicago issue. There certainly is a crisis here, but it's an issue across our country that we have to address,\" she said, adding, \"It begins with the racial issues that we have in this country that we have to start working through.\"\n\nBut Harris, elected in 2012 to the Illinois Senate from Harvey, said, \"I've been in this issue my whole life. Because I've been in the community talking with people who are directly impacted.\n\n\"I didn't see Ms. Zopp out in the protests,\" Harris said. \"It's easy to go on Twitter and Facebook and write a quote. That's not real getting out in front of the issue.\"\n\nBut Zopp questioned what Harris had done about the issue, noting she has been involved with social programs, including a mentoring program for at-risk youth.\n\n\"Maybe you should run for state's attorney,\" Harris responded. \"You're running in the wrong race.\"\n\nThat prompted Zopp to go after the contention that Harris, a former NFL linebacker who now owns pizza restaurants, would bring \"leadership\" to the state and the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"Leadership is great, but if it's uninformed or inexperienced, it can't get things done,\" she said. \"The fact is you have limited experience, the leadership experience that is going to be addressed in Washington and that are going to make a difference for working families.\"\n\nDuckworth, of Hoffman Estates, who is giving up her suburban 8th Congressional District seat after two terms to seek the Senate, largely stayed out of the fight.\n\nInstead, Duckworth said she would work on prison sentencing reforms, including changes to reduce the use of mandatory-minimum sentencing, tougher gun laws, and target for-profit prisons that she said were not in the business to end recidivism.\n\n\"We can't throw away a huge percentage of our population and not give them an opportunity to succeed and to have an opportunity to move away from the conditions that led them to being in prison in the first place,\" Duckworth said.\n\nEarlier in the endorsement session, Harris took aim at Zopp's previous role as a member of the Chicago Board of Education when the panel voted to close nearly 50 public schools in 2013.\n\nHarris said as a state lawmaker, he had voted \"to make sure we had adequate funding of education, unlike my opponent who was a part of closing down schools in our communities that they need education.\"\n\nStill, the candidates mostly agreed on several issues, including making improvements to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, rather than embracing a single-payer health care system pushed by Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator.\n\nTo curb the nation's deficit, the three candidates said they would look for efficiencies in entitlement programs rather than curbing benefits. Duckworth said she would consider lifting the salary cap on Social Security taxes or imposing a graduated tax system to pay the benefits.\n\nThe three also agreed on the need to allow the immigration to the U.S. of refugees from battle-torn Syria. Kirk has called for a pause in immigration to assure no Islamic State insurgents are among those accepted in U.S. borders, and has criticized Duckworth for supporting even greater numbers that President Barack Obama has authorized.\n\n\"It matters who you send to Washington, it really matters and we've seen this in Mark Kirk, who's really pursued quite a few wrong policies that put our nation in danger \u2014 his opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement, his decision to demonize a whole group of refugees who are fleeing the very butchers who are trying to endanger Americans and who continues to side with large corporations at the expense of small and medium companies and with everyday working Americans,\" Duckworth said.\n\nAlso Monday, a recently filed federal campaign finance report showed that Harris collected only $100 in campaign contributions last year while lending his campaign slightly more than $1 million.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Duckworth focuses on Kirk as rivals trade barbs on CPS, criminal justice reforms", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "U.S. Rep.
