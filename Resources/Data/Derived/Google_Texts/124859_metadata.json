The arts range from painting, sculpting, and pottery, while social activities include trips to the theater, movies, or book clubs. Additionally, participants were asked to report their computer activities, such as conducting web searches and making online purchases.\n\nAfter four years, the results showed 121 people developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) \u2014 the stage between age-expected cognitive decline and the more serious decline of dementia, The Mayo Clinic reported. But of the middle and old age participants engaged in the arts, 73 percent were less likely to develop MCI. Participants engaging in social activities and computer use into old age also reduced their risk by 53 and 55 percent, respectively.\n\n\"As millions of older US adults are reaching the age where they may experience these memory and thinking problem[s] \u2026 it is important we look to find lifestyle changes that may stave off the condition,\" Rosebud Roberts, study author and member of the American Academy of Neurology, said in a press release. \"Our study supports the idea that engaging the mind may protect neurons, or the building blocks of the brain, from dying, stimulate growth of new neurons, or may help recruit new neurons to maintain cognitive activities in old age.\u201d\n\nDeveloping MCI doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a person will develop dementia, but they are at greater risk when compared to someone without MCI. Last month, a separate study published in Neurology developed risk scores for predicting incident of MCI that can be easily obtained in a clinical setting; the earlier it\u2019s caught, the better. Something like a risk scale is cost-effective and easy for doctors to use to keep their patient\u2019s memory and thinking processes sharp, too.\n\nThis is noteworthy because currently, there are no tests or procedures doctors can use to demonstrate conclusively a patient has MCI. These cognitive changes are obvious, but they\u2019re not so severe a person can\u2019t keep on with their daily life. Until there\u2019s a concrete method to diagnose MCI and really work to reduce any further cognitive change, be it dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, experts recommend older adults nourish their brain with exercise and a heart-smart lifestyle; high blood pressure is a risk factor for MCI.\n\nSeeing as The Alzheimer\u2019s Association has been recommending mentally stimulating and socially engaging activities as coping strategies for MCI, the present study emphasizes this type of engagement can be benefical.\n\nSource: Neurology, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "arts, and, crafts, may, stave, memory, problems, increase, risk, dementia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mental and socially engaging activities reduced participants' risk of developing mild cognitive impairment.", "title": "Arts And Crafts Might Improve Your Memory", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/arts-and-crafts-may-stave-memory-problems-increase-risk-dementia-328590", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/arts-and-crafts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mental and socially engaging activities reduced participants' risk of developing mild cognitive impairment.", "title": "Arts And Crafts Might Improve Your Memory", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/arts-and-crafts-may-stave-memory-problems-increase-risk-dementia-328590", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/arts-and-crafts.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/arts-and-crafts.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-08T17:38:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T17:38:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mental and socially engaging activities reduced participants' risk of developing mild cognitive impairment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11eb\"", "article_summary": "Arts and crafts may be a way to stave off memory problems that lead into dementia, according to a new study published in the journal Neurology.\nSomething like a risk scale is cost-effective and easy for doctors to use to keep their patient\u2019s memory and thinking processes sharp, too.\nThe arts range from painting, sculpting, and pottery, while social activities include trips to the theater, movies, or book clubs.\nBut of the middle and old age participants engaged in the arts, 73 percent were less likely to develop MCI.\nResearchers recruited 256 people an average age of 87, none of whom had memory or thinking problems at baseline, to report on the number of arts and social activities they participated in."}
