Typically a run to the finals doesn’t result in a coaching change, but the Denver Cutthroats will have a new face behind the bench next season. Well, sort of.

Cutthroats head coach Derek Armstrong is stepping aside to focus on his team president and general manager duties. Assistant coach Brad Smyth will take over as head coach, the team announced Thursday.

Smyth played for the Cutthroats in their inaugural 2012-13 season and joined Armstrong — his friend and former teammate — behind the bench last year when the team made a run to the CHL finals before losing to the Allen Americans in five games.

Armstrong assumed the role of team president in January when Ben Rifkin resigned. At that time, Smyth took the role of director of hockey operations and he will remain in that post.

“This is by no means my last time coaching, I just felt that it was important to continue to help with the growth of this great organization,” Armstrong said in a statement released by the team. “I have a great relationship with Brad and know that he will continue to move the team forward toward a championship. He has been a staple to the team and the organization as a whole.”

Smyth said in the same statement that he is excited to lead the team and continue the mission to bring a CHL championship to Denver.

Smyth, 41, scored 28 goals and added 53 assists for the Cutthroats in 2012-13 in his last professional season as a player. He played in 88 games in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, Los Angeles Kings, New York Rangers, Nashville Predators and Ottawa Senators, tallying 15 goals and 13 assists.

Armstrong and Smyth were teammates in the American Hockey League from 1997-2001.
