He proceeded to rant for several minutes about how Bill O\u2019Reilly is an Islamophobe.\n\nEventually a security guard took notice and interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, you can\u2019t film here. This is private property.\u201d\n\nBrand then ducked into the building, where he was informed again he needed to stop filming.\n\nNext, Brand told someone in the building that he wanted to go onto Hannity\u2019s set to \u201chave a look around\u201d and \u201ctouch some stuff.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the building staff rejected his request.\n\n\u201cWhether the subject is Islamophobia or it\u2019s just the freedom to be in a lobby,\u201d Brand declared, \u201cFox is a difficult organization to work with. Whether it\u2019s canceling booking for the Hannity show or kicking you out of their building, which they claim is owned by Beacon Management, it\u2019s very difficult to have true freedom.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News denied to Mediaite that they had ever booked Brand, and Sean Hannity fired off these tweets mocking him:\n\n@rustyrockets I heard you were lurking around Fox yesterday like a deranged creepy stalker and begging to be on the show \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 16, 2014\n\n@rustyrockets Thanks but no thanks Mr. Katy Perry.
