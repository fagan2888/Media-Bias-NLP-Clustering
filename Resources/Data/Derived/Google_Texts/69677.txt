To Grow in Sports Medicine, Bregal’s Shock Doctor Merges with McDavid

Bregal picked up Shock Doctor in March 2014 with plans to consolidate the sports medicine market

Bregal Partners athletic performance company Shock Doctor has merged with McDavid, a sports medicine company.

McDavid, headquartered in Chicago, manufactures, designs and markets sports medicine, sports protection and performance apparel for active people and athletes. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Shock Doctor makes athletic performance and protective equipment, including mouth guards. The company is backed by New York private equity firm Bregal Partners, which bought it in March 2014.

The deal aligns with Bregal's plan to consolidate businesses in the sports medicine market. "We think the double digit growth trends in the $7 billion + global market for sports medicine are only going to accelerate given the focus on safety in youth sports and the increasing physical activity of older adults driven by the desire to stay healthy, says Bregal managing partner Robert Bergmann.

William Blair & Co. and Dechert LLP advised Shock Doctor on the deal, and Imperial Capital LLC and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP advised McDavid.
