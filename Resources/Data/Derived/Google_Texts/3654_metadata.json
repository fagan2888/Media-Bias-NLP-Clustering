It also does not mean 'hats, but only those hats sold to people who already own shoes.'\"\n\nThe government tried to stave off an injunction in the name of the public interest, saying it would let the companies issue harmful insurance plans.\n\nLamberth meanwhile noted that it is unclear whether the policies are harmful, or that this harm is worth allowing a federal agency to break the law.\n\n\"Forcing federal agencies to comply with the law is undoubtedly in the public interest, and defendants have not show to the Court's satisfaction that this clear benefit would be outweighed by the harms putatively caused by plaintiffs' policies,\" Lamberth wrote. \"For these same reasons, plaintiffs have shown that the balance of equities favors them.\"", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Fixed-indemnity insurance plans pay a fixed rate for certain injuries and illnesses, rather than the varied rate more traditional plans pay depending on the severity of an injury.\n\"For example, imagine a statue which regulates clothing but not 'hats,'\" Lamberth wrote.\nAs of Jan. 1, the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that fixed-indemnity insurance plans alone do not meet the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for health insurance.\nThe government tried to stave off an injunction in the name of the public interest, saying it would let the companies issue harmful insurance plans.\nInsurers Defeat Obamacare ProvisionWASHINGTON (CN) - A federal judge on Friday threw out a provision of the U.S. health care reform law that blocks the sale of fixed-indemnity insurance plans."}
