Spoiler Alert: Frank Underwood spends time in the White House prank calling Hillary Clinton.

The Clinton Foundation shared a video of Kevin Spacey impersonating Frank Underwood impersonating Bill Clinton as a part of a spoof leading up to the 68th birthday of the former president.

“Washington, D.C. is so boring during summer that I like to entertain myself by having some, well, fun with my predecessors,” Spacey in character as Underwood from “House of Cards” tells the camera from the Oval Office before phoning Hillary Clinton at a rectangular office.

Doing his best Bill Clinton impersonation, Spacey tries to get Hillary to reveal the former president’s birthday gift. Unfortunately, has about as much luck as getting Clinton to reveal her presidential plans. The former Senator and Secretary of State refuses to divulge what she will be getting her husband for his birthday on Tuesday, August 19.

And, in the spoof, Spacey is unable to sell Clinton on convincing Chelsea to name the couple’s first grandchild Frank or Claire.
