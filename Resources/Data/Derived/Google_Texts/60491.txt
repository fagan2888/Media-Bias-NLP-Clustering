Officials have released the name of the dump truck driver who was killed when he crashed into an overpass on the New Jersey Turnpike last week.

Union County spokesman Sebastian Dâ€™Elia on Monday identified the driver as 62-year-old Allen Yuhasz, of Woodbridge Township.

The Aug. 4 crash sparked a fire and caused a miles-long traffic standstill that lasted for several hours.

The truck was southbound when it struck the Wood Avenue overpass in Linden near Exit 13A. State police said the truck hit a vehicle that was being towed, then careened left, overturned and hit a bridge abutment before bursting into flames.

The fire initially was feared to have compromised the overpass and gas and power lines that run under it.
