States would have more authority to specify the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that must be provided by insurance. As an example, the federal government would no longer require insurance policies to include coverage for maternity care.\n\nThe proposal was devised by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee; Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; and Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, a member of the Finance and Health committees.\n\nIn documents sketching their proposal, Republicans said their \u201cblueprint\u201d would lower costs and rebut criticism from Democrats who say the Republicans have no ideas on health care.\n\nRepublicans said the need for such an alternative had become more urgent because they now control both houses of Congress, and the Supreme Court could upend the president\u2019s health care law with a ruling later this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir plan includes a potentially explosive proposal: Workers would have to pay federal income tax on the value of employer-provided health benefits that exceed certain annual thresholds \u2014 $12,000 for individuals and $30,000 for families. Health benefits above those levels would be treated and taxed as regular income for the employee. The thresholds would increase over time.\n\nEmployers could still take tax deductions for the cost of employee health benefits as an incentive to continue providing coverage, Republicans said. Moreover, a summary of the proposal says that \u201ceconomists across the political spectrum largely agree\u201d that the current tax break for employer-provided insurance is fueling the growth of health costs.\n\nEmployees and employers have been vocal in their objections to proposals that would limit the tax break.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that almost 10 million people would have coverage this year through the public insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act. Nearly 7.5 million people have selected plans or were automatically re-enrolled through the federal exchange, she said, and 2.4 million people have been signed up through state-run exchanges.\n\nRepublicans said their plan did not include a federal exchange, but would allow states to run such marketplaces if they wanted to.\n\nThe Republicans did not provide a formal estimate of the cost of their proposal or the number of people who would be covered. Democrats have criticized such plans in the past, saying that they would not achieve the coverage gained under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Republican plan would repeal the individual and employer mandates under which most Americans must carry insurance and larger employers must offer it to employees or else pay penalties.\n\n\u201cIf consumers do not want to buy coverage, they don\u2019t have to,\u201d according to a document describing the Republican plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Republicans would also repeal more than a dozen new taxes and fees, including taxes on insurance companies and manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices.\n\nThe government would offer subsidies, in the form of tax credits, for the purchase of \u201chealth care coverage or services,\u201d according to the proposal. The subsidies would be available to people with incomes up to three times the poverty level (up to $35,300 for an individual), compared with four times the poverty level under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLower-income and older people would receive larger subsidies, but the average amount would be less than the current subsidies, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, are now expected to total $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nUnder the Republican proposal, the government would provide a \u201ccapped allotment\u201d to states to finance coverage for certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Money would be allocated according to the number of poor people in each state. The amount would increase at the rate of the Consumer Price Index plus one percentage point and would \u201creflect demographic and population changes.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said Medicaid expansion under the current law was financially unsustainable.\n\nThe Republican proposal says that \u201cno one can be denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition,\u201d but this guarantee would apply mainly to people who had been continuously covered by insurance. For people who are uninsured, the Republican plan envisions \u201ca one-time open enrollment period in which individuals would be able to purchase coverage regardless of their health status or pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nRepublicans would still allow young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 health care plan until age 26, but states could \u201cchoose to opt out of this provision.\u201d\n\nThe government would allow more variation in premiums based on the age of policyholders. Under current law, insurers generally cannot charge older Americans more than three times what they charge younger people, other factors being equal. Republicans would allow a ratio of five to one, with states permitted to set more or less restrictive rules.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150204215144, "twitter": {"description": "Under the plan, workers would have to pay federal income tax on the value of employer-provided health benefits that exceed certain thresholds.", "title": "G.O.P.
