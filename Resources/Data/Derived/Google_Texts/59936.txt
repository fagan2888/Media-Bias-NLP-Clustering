More Info: Congress 17th District Republican Matt Connolly - 64%

Glenn Geissinger - 36%

It appears that Bethlehem Township resident Matt Connolly easily snagged the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 17th Congressional District.

As of 11 p.m. Tuesday, Connolly had snapped up 64 percent of the vote compared to challenger Glenn Geisinger’s 36 percent, with 212 of 443 precincts reporting, according to the Associated Press.

Both 50-year-old residents of Northampton County, Connolly, of Bethlehem Township, and Geissinger, of Plainfield Township, were vying for the opportunity to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, of Moosic, who was running unopposed for the Democratic nomination on Tuesday.

Connolly ran in 2014 for the Republican nomination, losing the primary to Dr. David “Doc” Moylan, who lost to Cartwright in the general election.

Connolly has said he is running because he doesn’t like the changes he has seen in the country in recent years.

“Government is too intrusive,” Connolly told the Times Leader Opinion Board earlier this month. “There are too many regulations/taxes that are driving jobs overseas, while wages in the U.S. have not increased.”

He said President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act — also labeled “Obamacare” — has caused many people to work two jobs and does not give people a choice of health care.

“Someone’s got to change this,” he had said. “This can’t be allowed to stand.”

Connolly is anti-abortion and is running “100 percent pro-family, pro-traditional marriage, and pro-Second Amendment,” according to his website.

If elected, Connolly said, he would work to repeal Obamacare and decrease insurance premiums across the board. He also would work to reduce welfare benefits and to make working a requirement for receipt of those benefits. And, he said, he is pro-pipeline and would work to make the United States “energy independent.”

Cartwright likely will be standing on his record when he faces Connolly in November.

His website touts his introduction of a leading-number of pieces of legislation, the majority of which have been introduced with bipartisan support. He has introduced bills that have proposed expanded rights and benefits for veterans, seniors, consumers and college students, according to his official website.

Cartwright’s legislative portfolio has also focused heavily on protecting the environment from exemptions and loopholes in fundamental environmental protections statutes and promoting equity for wage-grade federal workers at federal installations like VA hospitals, federal prisons and military depots, according to his website.

The 17th district includes all of Schuylkill County and parts of Carbon, Luzerne, Lackawanna, Monroe and Northampton counties. Major locations in the district include Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Tobyhanna, Bangor, Easton and Pottsville.

The primary races in the 11th Congressional District on Tuesday were uncontested.

Former Hazleton Mayor Mike Marsicano was the sole Democrat on the ballot and will seek to unseat U.S. Rep Lou Barletta, also a former mayor of Hazleton, in November. Barletta was unopposed for the Republican nomination.

The 11th Congressional District is comprised of all of Columbia, Montour and Wyoming counties and parts of Carbon, Cumberland, Dauphin, Luzerne, Northumberland and Perry counties. Major locations in the district include Harrisburg, Sunbury, Carlisle, Tunkhannock, Hazleton, Bloomsburg and Danville.
