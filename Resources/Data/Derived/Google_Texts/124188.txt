Another year, the same positions.

Bucks County Commissioner Rob Loughery was re-elected chairman of the board for 2014 at Wednesday morning's meeting, the third year in a row he'll assume that role.

Commissioner Charles Martin was re-elected vice chairman, also the third consecutive year for him in that position.

Both are Republicans.

The board's lone Democrat, Diane Marseglia, voted Wednesday for Martin and Loughery to retain their spots.

While all of the commissioners are in the middle of four-year terms, each year they vote for a chair and vice chair. This year's vote came and passed with barely any discussion.

There was simiarly minimal chatter about most of the other agenda items at the meeting: All 16 items passed, although one part of the General Services section - relating to potential construction at the Women's Correctional Facility - was tabled.
