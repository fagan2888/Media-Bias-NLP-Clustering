So far, Japanese company Sagami Rubber Industries has been winning.\n\nOver the course of ten years, engineers at Sagami tested over 20,000 condoms and designed a condom that was only 0.01 mm thick \u2014 yet entirely durable. To put that into perspective, an average human hair is about 0.06 mm thick.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how we can make them thinner than this,\u201d a Sagami researcher told Tokyo Sports, \u201cbut as long as there is a need for thinner, we will continue researching 0.009 mm and 0.008 mm thinness.\u201d The condom is called \u201cSagami Original 0.01.\u201d It costs about $12.\n\nThe Sagami Original 0.01 isn\u2019t the first ultra-thin, specially designed condom out there. Plenty of other condoms \u2014 many designed in Japan \u2014 exist, though they are slightly more expensive than traditional condoms. Sagami, which has been around since 1935, had previously designed a 0.02 mm-thick condom before their Sagami Original 0.01. Sagami was the country\u2019s first condom manufacturer, and the first in the world to produce colored condoms.\n\n\u201cYou know that usual smell of a latex condom? Well this condom has no smell at all, and I think you\u2019ll agree that\u2019s a neat feature of a polyurethane condom,\u201d the blog CondomSizes.org writes about the Sagami Original 0.01. \u201cOn the other hand, the extreme thinness, and the fact it\u2019s less stretchable makes it a bit harder to unroll.\u201d\n\nHowever, scientists continue to find ways to experiment with a material called \"graphene,\" which in theory would create the thinnest condom ever \u2014 even thinner than Sagami\u2019s. Graphene is so thin, in fact, that it\u2019s only one atom thick, and sturdier than diamond. \u201cOf course, we know that atoms can be divided into elementary particles, but you can\u2019t get any material that is thinner than one atom, or it wouldn\u2019t count as a material anymore,\u201d Andre Geim, a Dutch-British physicist who discovered the substance in 2004, told CNN.\n\nResearchers and those funding them hope to develop safe, effective and more \"pleasurable\" condoms to help convince more people around the world to use them. Condoms help in the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, and can prevent early pregnancies.\n\nEven though the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has devoted some $100,000 to condom researchers at various institutions, the graphene condom may take a while to develop. \u201c[I]t is to be noted that there is no specific timeline for the condom to hit stores near you,\u201d CondomSizes.org writes. \u201cIn all likelihood, research in this regard will take a few years before the right graphene composite is synthesized for the perfect condom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thinnest condom, sagami rubber industries, human hair, condoms", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Japanese engineers have managed to create the thinnest condom thus far, and its width is less than a human hair.", "title": "World\u2019s Thinnest Condom Is Finer Than A Human Hair", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/worlds-thinnest-condom-designed-sagami-rubber-industries-finer-human-hair-264527", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/06/condoms.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Japanese engineers have managed to create the thinnest condom thus far, and its width is less than a human hair.", "title": "World\u2019s Thinnest Condom Is Finer Than A Human Hair", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/worlds-thinnest-condom-designed-sagami-rubber-industries-finer-human-hair-264527", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/06/condoms.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/06/condoms.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-12-06T17:39:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-06T17:56:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Japanese engineers have managed to create the thinnest condom thus far, and its width is less than a human hair."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c4b\"", "article_summary": "Sagami, which has been around since 1935, had previously designed a 0.02 mm-thick condom before their Sagami Original 0.01.\nThe Sagami Original 0.01 isn\u2019t the first ultra-thin, specially designed condom out there.\nEven though the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has devoted some $100,000 to condom researchers at various institutions, the graphene condom may take a while to develop.\nOver the course of ten years, engineers at Sagami tested over 20,000 condoms and designed a condom that was only 0.01 mm thick \u2014 yet entirely durable.\nWell this condom has no smell at all, and I think you\u2019ll agree that\u2019s a neat feature of a polyurethane condom,\u201d the blog CondomSizes.org writes about the Sagami Original 0.01."}
