Nathan Deal wants GRU to have a top-50 medical school and that it might need help to do that.\n\n\u201cTo do that, they really need a larger, deeper clinical platform to get there,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTo do that on their own is going to be very difficult. They\u2019re broaching ideas on how we might collaborate more deeply to provide that medical education experience here.\u201d\n\nUniversity Hospital already has six residency slots where residents from the Medical College of Georgia rotate through. Three are in OB/GYN, two are in general surgery and one is in internal medicine. Because multiple residents can rotate through those slots, last year 36 residents rotated through University-based residencies and saw more than 1,400 cases.\n\nUniversity Hospital has the ability to add 11 more residency slots and would like to get help from a state fund to expand residencies in the state, Davis said. The hospital is trying to create a family medicine program in conjunction with MCG, for instance, he said.\n\nBut there could be even larger collaborations, Davis said.\n\n\u201cThey are also, just like every other hospital, dealing with the effects of the Affordable Care Act and the reimbursement challenges that it brings to every hospital in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe talks are similar to those Uni\u00adversity has had with other health systems and providers \u201clooking for ways to collaborate, to reduce the impact of that by reducing our fixed costs and how we can work closer together to do that,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe regents said \u201can exploratory discussion is underway,\u201d and Davis said the parties have agreed to meet again soon.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "The two are already working together on some residencies and would like to expand more, but the two could also help each other respond to shrinking reimbursements now and in the future, University CEO Jim Davis said.", "title": "Georgia Regents Health System, University Hospital look at potential partnership", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2015-01-23/georgia-regents-health-system-university-hospital-look-potential-partnership", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "Neil Pruitt, the chairman of the university system\u2019s Board of Re\u00adgents, and past chairman Philip Wil\u00adheit had lunch at University Hos\u00adpital to begin those talks, he said.\nThe regents said \u201can exploratory discussion is underway,\u201d and Davis said the parties have agreed to meet again soon.\nUniversity Hospital has the ability to add 11 more residency slots and would like to get help from a state fund to expand residencies in the state, Davis said.\nIn a statement, the regents said they wanted to \u201cexplore strategic opportunities to potentially create a partnership to expand health services and better serve Georgians.\u201dDavis said that Gov.\nBecause multiple residents can rotate through those slots, last year 36 residents rotated through University-based residencies and saw more than 1,400 cases."}
