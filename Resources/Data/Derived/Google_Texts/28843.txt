Mississippi's corrections department says that, for the second time in a week, a guard at the state prison in Leakesville is accused of trying to smuggle forbidden items to inmates.

A news release Friday said Thursday's arrest of 23-year-old Zackery Brown is not related to that last Saturday of 36-year-old Sherrika Bennett. Each was arrested at the South Mississippi Correctional Institute.

No home phone listing could be found for either. It was not clear whether either has an attorney.

Officials say Brown faces two felony charges: bringing cellphones and bringing a controlled substance into a prison.

They say K-9 officers helped find three cellphones, two chargers and about 1.5 ounces of the drug called spice in his jacket during screening as he reported to work.
