The 47-year-old Renner woman didn't see a doctor because she wasn't covered under Medicaid and didn't feel like she could afford insurance.\n\n\"I knew something was wrong,\" Sievers said. \"I was dying, and that was that.\"\n\nAfter two years of not feeling well, Sievers finally went to the doctor. They diagnosed her with leukemia, which had spread to her stomach.\n\n\"I was two weeks out. Two weeks longer, and they wouldn't have been able to help me,\" Sievers said.\n\n\"We have talked to lots of patients over the years who had to make a choice between having food on the table and a place to live or cancer treatment,\" American Cancer Society Chief Cancer Control Officer Dr. Rich Wender said.\n\nWender is in the state talking about how expanding Medicaid would help South Dakotans battling cancer. South Dakota is one of the 19 states that have not expanded the program.\n\n\"We're now showing more and more data that the 31 states who have found a way to expand Medicaid through various models are starting to see better health outcomes,\" Wender said.\n\nWender says there are two reasons for this. Those who have coverage are more likely to get screenings to prevent or catch diseases early. They also have better access to quality care.\n\n\"Any efforts we can to help people get access to insurance either through exchanges or innovative models to get more people covered through Medicaid will be good for cancer patients,\" Wender said.\n\nGovernor Dennis Daugaard has appointed a special coalition to explore expanding Medicaid. A 2013 study says expansion would cost the state more than $100 million dollars through 2020.\n\nThankfully, Sievers is in remission after months of treatment. She's also happy to report that she has insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I almost lost my life over it. To have this insurance for me and my husband is a huge, huge relief,\" Sievers said.\n\nHealth Beat {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
