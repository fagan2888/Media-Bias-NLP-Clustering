Sarah Palin wants to "bomb Obamacare."

The former vice presidential candidate wants to steer the national conversation away from Syria, back onto the so-called death panels she says President Obama plans to establish.

"Enough of this foreign fiasco distraction. Get back to work. It is time to bomb Obamacare," she posted on her social media accounts, along with a 2-minute scare video from her official SarahPAC.

The emotionally charged video suggests that though Plain was ridiculed for saying that bureaucrats would determine whose lives are saved under Obamacare, she was proven right — and it is still a problem.

The video ends showing a simulated heart-rate monitor with the words "to be continued…" followed by "… sadly."

The last time Palin chimed in with a statement about Syria, she said that we should "let Allah sort it out," and asked, "So we're bombing Syria because Syria is bombing Syria? And I'm the idiot?"
