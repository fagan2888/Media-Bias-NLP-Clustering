Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, called the ban a \u201clegislative oversight\u201d and is championing a bill to refine the statute\u2019s language to legalize potlucks across the state.\n\nThe law initially was written to subject all served food to safety regulations and health department inspections. However, lawmakers explicitly exempted potlucks and other \u201cnoncommercial social events\u201d if they occur at a workplace.\n\nSince the exemption did not include potlucks held in homes or churches, the law effectively made them illegal in Arizona. Anyone caught hosting a potluck outside the workplace could be slapped with a fine or even arrested.\n\nPaul Avelar, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice\u2019s Arizona office, called the law \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Avelar said he stumbled upon Townsend\u2019s bill while sifting through bills introduced in the state this year. That\u2019s when he first learned that Arizona\u2014\u201cI guess accidentally\u201d\u2014had made potlucks illegal. He said:\n\nI think what happened is what happens very often with regulations. More frequently the government is demanding the seats at our dining room table by telling us what we can have on our plates, in our glasses, where it comes from, and how it would have to get there.\n\nThe issue made local headlines after authorities in Pinal County, Ariz., shut down a potluck party hosted in a mobile home park after a resident who knew about the law decided to complain.\n\nOne resident brought the law to Townsend\u2019s attention, moving her to introduce a bill last month to clarify the statute. She told a local paper she didn\u2019t believe the law was intended to shut down all potlucks.\n\n\u201cThese are the sorts of common, everyday things that Americans don\u2019t need to have regulated for them,\u201d Avelar said. \u201cWe are all more than smart enough to be able to figure out what we can eat and when we can eat it.\u201d\n\nJohn Seibler, a visiting legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal that regulations like this are \u201cnot at all unique.\u201d In fact, he said, they exist in every state and \u201cin masses\u201d at the federal level.\n\nIn Wisconsin, for example, it is illegal to sell home-baked goods. Residents who decide to sell homemade cookies or muffins could face a $1,000 fine or six months in jail.\n\nIn Florida, Avelar said, owners of a small creamery who pasteurize and separate raw milk to produce skim milk can sell it legally but must call it \u201cmilk product.\u201d\n\nThe laws governing what people may eat and drink, he said, often are motivated by the \u201ctwin evils of protectionism and paternalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning the government is acting to protect certain business interests from everyday competition or just because the government thinks it knows better than what people can and should eat,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Institute for Justice is pursuing lawsuits against Wisconsin and Florida laws, along with a range of others across the United States, as part of an effort called the National Food Freedom Initiative.\n\nIn the United States, Seibler noted, over 300,000 regulations carry criminal penalties on the federal level alone.\n\nSeibler said this creates a \u201cnotice problem\u201d because individuals usually aren\u2019t aware of every single law that applies to them:", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Rep.
