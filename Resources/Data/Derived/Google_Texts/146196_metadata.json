That\u2019s compared with about 55 percent of Republicans who believe their party will do better, the Pew/USA Today poll found.\n\nBut William Galston, who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution focusing on government, told Al Jazeera he was surprised that the difference in the parties\u2019 outlooks wasn\u2019t bigger.\n\n\u201cI was actually struck by the nearly even balance of the two political parties,\u201d Galston said.\n\nHe said he had expected that Democrats\u2019 woes over the Affordable Care Act would have bolstered Republican hopes more.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have noticed that the Republican Party is very unpopular, and Republicans have noticed that the Democratic Party is not much more popular than they are,\u201d Galston said.\n\nAlso, the latest Pew figures don\u2019t reflect nearly the stark contrast in confidence that existed before midterm elections in 2006 and 2010, when seismic shifts in congressional seats shook up the balance of power between parties.\n\nIn June 2010, Democrats polled by Pew expressed little confidence in their party\u2019s ability to best the GOP, with only 29 percent saying they thought their party would do better. By contrast, a full 72 percent of Republicans foresaw success.\n\nConservatives\u2019 confidence was well founded. In November 2010, Republicans took back the House of Representatives as high unemployment, a weak economy and the rise of firebrand tea party candidates bedeviled Democrats and President Barack Obama.\n\nIt wasn't the first time optimism turned out right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But parties' confidence gap not as wide as in other elections when big shifts happened on Capitol Hill", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/13/midtermsobamagoprepublicansdemocrats.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/12/13/midtermsobamagoprepublicansdemocrats/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.snow_dec10_hp.1386977537886.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "But parties' confidence gap not as wide as in other elections when big shifts happened on Capitol Hill", "title": "Republicans more optimistic than Democrats about 2014 elections"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/12/13/midtermsobamagoprepublicansdemocrats/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.snow_dec10_hp.1386977537886.jpg", "description": "But parties' confidence gap not as wide as in other elections when big shifts happened on Capitol Hill", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans more optimistic than Democrats about 2014 elections"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Finance, Shutdown, Politics, Democratic Party, Tea Party, Republican Party, Barack Obama, Congress, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Democratic voters are getting worried about their party\u2019s prospects against Republicans in the 2014 congressional elections, according to poll results released Friday.\nOnly 43 percent of likely Democratic voters think their party will trump the GOP in the midterm elections.\nIn November 2010, Republicans took back the House of Representatives as high unemployment, a weak economy and the rise of firebrand tea party candidates bedeviled Democrats and President Barack Obama.\n\u201cDemocrats have noticed that the Republican Party is very unpopular, and Republicans have noticed that the Democratic Party is not much more popular than they are,\u201d Galston said.\nThat\u2019s compared with about 55 percent of Republicans who believe their party will do better, the Pew/USA Today poll found."}
