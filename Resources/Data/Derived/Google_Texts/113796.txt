While investigators are still working to identify the specific food that led to the outbreak, Chipotle has changed the source of a suspect produce item in the meantime. The chain declined to share the name of the produce item.

"Investigators are confident that ongoing transmission at Chipotle as part of this outbreak has ended," the department wrote.

Separately, Minnesota is conducting an ongoing Salmonella outbreak investigation associated with cucumbers that officials say is not related to the Mexican chain.
