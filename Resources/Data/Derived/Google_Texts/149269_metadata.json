Finally, the end seems to be in sight for one of the worst global oil glut in history.\n\nPhil Flynn, senior energy analyst at PRICE Future Group, says a new bull market is emerging in the global economy after \u201cone of the ugliest bear markets we\u2019ve seen,\u201d and he anticipates prices to get close to $70 a barrel by the Fourth of July.\n\nOil prices have plunged almost 70 percent over the past 20 months, largely caused by oversupply. Major oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia have refused to cut production amid slowing demand from Europe and China, even as their own economies have taken massive hits.\n\nRelated: 5 Conspiracy Theories About the Oil Crash, from Ludicrous to Logical\n\nNow, most countries seem to be ready to play nice and work together to boost prices. Oil prices have soared almost 40 percent since prices hit 13-year lows less than two months ago to below $27 a barrel. Recent data shows that the U.S. rig count fell for the 11th straight week.\n\nHere are the four main reasons behind the recent rally that Flynn says are evidence that the bottom is finally here:\n\nU.S. oil companies are cutting production\n\nAfter months of job cuts and slashes in budgets, many U.S. oil companies are finally choosing to cut production. Most companies are planning to pump 10 to 30 percent less than expected. According to Flynn, the barrels of oil produced in the U.S. could fall from 9 million barrels a day to as little as eight million by this summer.\n\nFlynn adds that even if oil prices rise over the next few months, companies aren\u2019t going to be able to just head back into the oil fields and tap into new wells. They\u2019ve already cut the spending for these projects and are deeply in debt. Roughly one third of oil companies are expected to declare bankruptcy this year, according to a Deloitte report.\n\nOPEC and non-OPEN countries finally agree to freeze production\n\nCountries that produce 73 percent of the world\u2019s oil have agreed to a tentative deal to freeze production, according to Russia\u2019s Energy Minister Alexander Novak. Officials from OPEC and non-OPEC countries anticipate limiting their output to January levels and are currently in talks for how to monitor the freeze. An OPEC meeting with Russia is planned for later this month to solidify the agreement.\n\nRelated: Why Oil Prices Will Rebound in 2016\n\nEven though not all of the countries have good diplomatic relations, Flynn doesn\u2019t see that causing much of an impact because oil carries more weight at this point. \u201cEverybody is on their knees right now,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cNobody can afford to play this game anymore.\u201d Even Saudi Arabia, the country that is supposed to be able to best ride out an oil bust, just asked banks for an international loan, totaling around $10 billion. The rating agency Standard & Poor also downgraded the Middle Eastern country\u2019s credit rating last month to A- stable rom A+ negative. The agency cited pressures stemming from the oil price drop as the reason behind the move.\n\nIranian oil isn\u2019t that big a deal\n\nThe idea of Iranian oil entering the market once sanctions were lifted motivated many oil-producing countries to keep pumping oil at record paces to prevent losing market share. But now that Iranian oil is ready to enter the market, the \u201cproblem is that companies don\u2019t have the money to invest. Production increases in Iran will be slower than expected,\u201d Flynn says.\n\nEven if Iran is able to ramp up production, \u201cthere is going to be some wiggle room\u201d from other oil producers for Iran to produce more oil, Flynn says. Iran and Saudi Arabia have no diplomatic relations, but \u201cnobody is in good shape and nobody can keep playing this game.\u201d An Iranian official said that the country would consider production cuts once the country is producing at levels seen before the sanctions were imposed.\n\nRelated: Oil Ends Down on Profit-Taking but Still Up Strongly on Week\n\nChina isn\u2019t that much of a concern\n\nAn economic slowdown in the world\u2019s largest oil importer isn\u2019t actually hurting the oil economy as much as anticipated. There was the initial fear that \u201cChina\u2019s demand would fall off a map and that the country would be in a total meltdown, but we\u2019ve seen some stability in the Chinese market and even though demand is questionable, imports have stayed near record highs,\u201d says Flynn.\n\nAccording to a Platts China Oil Analytics report, oil demand in China grew by 5.8 percent in 2015, up from 4.7 percent the year prior. Demand is expected to slow this year to 2.7 percent, due to an anticipated decline in GDP growth.\n\nDownbeat manufacturing and service sector data released this week raised hopes of the Chinese government implementing additional stimulus measures. The country also just announced that it cut the amount of money that banks must hold as reserves for the fifth time this year. Even though these signs give investors hope that the Chinese economy is turning around, there\u2019s always the possibility that the economy will sink deeper into depression and demand for oil will plummet. \u201cIf the wheels come off the Chinese economy, all bets are off,\u201d Flynn says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Oil producers rejoice!", "title": "4 Reasons Oil Prices May Have Finally Hit Bottom", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/07/4-Reasons-Oil-Prices-May-Have-Finally-Hit-Bottom", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06062013_North_Dakota_Oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/07/4-Reasons-Oil-Prices-May-Have-Finally-Hit-Bottom", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06062013_North_Dakota_Oil_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Oil producers rejoice!", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Oil prices have soared almost 40 percent since prices hit 13-year lows less than two months ago to below $27 a barrel.\nOil prices have plunged almost 70 percent over the past 20 months, largely caused by oversupply.\nAccording to a Platts China Oil Analytics report, oil demand in China grew by 5.8 percent in 2015, up from 4.7 percent the year prior.\nHere are the four main reasons behind the recent rally that Flynn says are evidence that the bottom is finally here:U.S. oil companies are cutting productionAfter months of job cuts and slashes in budgets, many U.S. oil companies are finally choosing to cut production.\nRoughly one third of oil companies are expected to declare bankruptcy this year, according to a Deloitte report."}
