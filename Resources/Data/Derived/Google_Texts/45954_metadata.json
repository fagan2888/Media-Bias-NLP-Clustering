station in Steamboat Springs and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Grand Junction.\n\nIt\u2019s a 201-mile drive he and many other veterans in Routt County have to make to receive medical care.\n\nAnd with a recent uptick in the number of veterans who need help making the trip, Stanko said it may be time to take another look at the local veterans transportation system that largely has stayed static for the past 12 years.\n\n\u201cIf you get more people enrolled in the VA and there are more people who just can\u2019t go on their own, then I think we\u2019re going to have to look at some way of getting some coordination going,\u201d he said Thursday.\n\nWhile Stanko, a Vietnam-era veteran who is heavily involved in veterans\u2019 issues statewide, is able to use his own vehicle to make the occasional trip to the hospital, he said there are dozens of local veterans who rely on grant funding to get there.\n\n\u201cThese are veterans who don\u2019t have a vehicle that can get there or who can\u2019t drive themselves,\u201d Stanko said. \u201cMost of them are going to get treatment for a service-related condition.\u201d\n\nSince 2002, grant funding from the Colorado Veterans Trust Fund has helped local veterans either get reimbursed for gas or rent a vehicle and a driver to make the trip.\n\nMany of the trips are veteran-led.\n\nStanko said with an increase in the number of veterans who are enrolling in the VA health system locally, he expects this year that the local American Legion Post 44 will need more than $5,400 to help fund the trips.\n\nThe veteran speculated that a combination of more outreach from the VA and changes from the Affordable Care Act, which requires everyone to get health insurance, may be contributing to the increase in the number of veterans getting enrolled.\n\nHe added that in previous years, the demand for assistance to get to Grand Junction hasn\u2019t been high enough to necessitate spending the full grant.\n\nWith more demand possible, the veterans here have raised their grant request to $6,000 for the next fiscal year.\n\nIt may seem like a small dollar amount, but Routt County Veterans Affairs Officer Michael Condie said it can make a huge difference for local veterans.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t help them out, some of these guys would be in huge trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nTransportation remains an important topic for local veterans who use a VA hospital that is more than 200 miles away.\n\nWhen they get to Grand Junction, sometimes four hours after a van has made other stops in the region, they have access to a 53-bed facility that provides primary and secondary care, including acute medical, surgical and psychiatric inpatient services.\n\nWhen the transportation plan for local veterans was implemented in 2002, local veterans were lobbying to get some of this level of medical care closer to home.\n\nAfter the years of lobbying, local veterans were rewarded in 2007 with a Telehealth Clinic in Craig that has made it more convenient for some to receive care remotely from the VA.\n\nThe Telehealth Clinic is expanding its services, but Stanko said there still were about 66 veterans last year that needed help getting to the VA facilities, where far more types of services are available.\n\n\u201cI think that if we\u2019re going to continue this kind of transportation service, we\u2019re going to have to look at different kinds of funding,\u201d Stanko said.\n\nHe also thinks more collaboration between counties is needed.\n\nStanko said some efforts already are underway to help streamline veteran transportation in the region, including the upcoming launch of a new call center that will be based out of Summit County.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why instead of us piddling around with $6,000 trying to get 66 veterans to Grand Junction and Denver, we couldn\u2019t coordinate something better,\u201d Stanko said.\n\nTo reach Scott Franz, call 970-871-4210, email
