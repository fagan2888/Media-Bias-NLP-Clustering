When they actively engage and build strong relationships with the community, Asian Americans come out to vote,\u201d Ninio Fetalvo, press secretary for Asian American and Pacific Islander media for the RNC, told the outlet.\n\nIn recent months, Republican candidates have made headlines for controversial comments about the Asian American community, including Donald Trump poking fun at Chinese business partners for broken English and Mike Huckabee\u2019s North Korean joke directed at Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nHowever, the RNC is seeking to detach itself from the candidates\u2019 comments by grooming the party\u2019s next generation of leaders.\n\n\u201cThe RNC\u2019s focus is to engage the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in a real way, and it is up to the voters to pick the nominee out of our pool of candidates, who set their own agenda and messaging for their respective candidates,\u201d said Fetalvo, according to Fox Business.\n\nThe increase in outreach efforts comes after Asians leaned more to the right in the 2014 midterm elections, despite historically supporting Democrats. A 2014 survey from Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote shows that Asian Americans are less likely to formally align with a political party; nearly half identify as Independent, while 27 percent of millennials in the demographic marked \u2018undecided.\u2019\n\nA study earlier this year by the University of California, Los Angeles and the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies revealed that the Asian American electorate is expected to double by 2040, amounting to nearly 7 percent or 1 in 15 registered voters.\n\n\u201cNot only will Asian Americans be a politically influential voting bloc in select areas in the United States, they have the potential to be the margin of victory in critical swing votes during the next six presidential election cycles,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\n\nFurther, Asians are slated to become the largest ethnic group in the United States, surpassing Hispanics, by 2055. The group will comprise 38 percent of the foreign-born population by 2065.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "News", "description": "WITH the 2016 presidential election a year away, the Republican National Committee (RNC) is expanding outreach efforts to a key demographic: Asian American millennials.\r\n\r\nThrough a six-week program called the Republican Leadership Initiative (RLI),", "title": "RNC seeks Asian American millennial voters, leaders | News", "url": "http://asianjournal.com/news/rnc-seeks-asian-american-millennials-voters-leaders/", "image": "http://asianjournal.com/news/files/2015/11/web-rli_1433973763-300x195.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 255788754543881}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dc1\"", "article_summary": "WITH the 2016 presidential election a year away, the Republican National Committee (RNC) is expanding outreach efforts to a key demographic: Asian American millennials.\nWhen they actively engage and build strong relationships with the community, Asian Americans come out to vote,\u201d Ninio Fetalvo, press secretary for Asian American and Pacific Islander media for the RNC, told the outlet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our time to stand up for American freedom,\u201d the video says, featuring the bright faces of AAPI millennials.\nHowever, the RNC is seeking to detach itself from the candidates\u2019 comments by grooming the party\u2019s next generation of leaders.\nThe RNC is already making a big recruiting push for millennials within the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, through a new video advertisement on YouTube, entitled \u201cIt\u2019s Our Time.\u201dThe 42-second video includes members of the diverse AAPI demographic, including two Filipino-Americans."}
