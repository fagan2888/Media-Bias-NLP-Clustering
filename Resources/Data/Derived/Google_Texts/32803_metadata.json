Once again, politicians (this time led by New York\u2019s Gov. Andrew Cuomo) are opting for the politically expedient \u201cquick fix\u201d that will make everyone feel good for a few moments but do nothing to address the long-term scientific reality that confronts the American eastern and southern coasts.\n\nThis is from a \u201cmust read\u201d editorial in yesterday\u2019s New York Times by one of the nation\u2019s leading coastal geologists, North Carolina\u2019s own Prof. Rob Young of Western Carolina University:\n\nEarlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a $207 million plan to dredge millions of tons of sand off the south shore of Long Island and spread it along the beaches and dunes. The Army Corps of Engineers, which will direct the federally financed project, says it will stabilize Fire Island and reduce the storm surge hazard for the mainland. In fact, the project will do neither. It is a colossal waste of money and another consequence of the nation\u2019s failure to develop a coherent plan to address the risks from storms faced by states along the eastern seaboard and gulf coast.\n\nAs Young goes on to explain, not only is the project unnecessary in that the barrier island in question is already naturally rebuilding itself (and that the dredging about to take place will disrupts important endangered wildlife habitats), but it\u2019s also emblematic of a broader and even more serious problem: The U.S. literally has no comprehensive plan to deal with rising seas:\n\nThere is no national plan to manage the coast. No plan for storm-damage reduction. No plan for how best to allocate federal funds. And no plan for how to respond to coastal hazards and rising sea levels over the long run. This leaves governments reactive rather than proactive. Most money is provided only after a disaster occurs, and is to be used in the areas affected by that one storm.\n\nThe bottom line: North Carolina politicians are always loathe to follow in the footsteps of \u201cliberals\u201d from the northeast. Here\u2019s one instance when such an attitude would be appropriate. Let\u2019s hope state leaders begin to listen to their homegrown national expert and to chart a more responsible course for managing inevitable coastal changes that\u2019s guided by science rather than wishful thinking and powerful real estate interests.\n\nRead Young\u2019s entire editorial by clicking here.\n\nLearn more about his research on the future of our coastline by clicking here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4ef\"", "article_summary": "The bottom line: North Carolina politicians are always loathe to follow in the footsteps of \u201cliberals\u201d from the northeast.\nThe latest story comes from New York but it might has well be Florida or North Carolina.\nAnd no plan for how to respond to coastal hazards and rising sea levels over the long run.\nThis is from a \u201cmust read\u201d editorial in yesterday\u2019s New York Times by one of the nation\u2019s leading coastal geologists, North Carolina\u2019s own Prof.\nMost money is provided only after a disaster occurs, and is to be used in the areas affected by that one storm."}
