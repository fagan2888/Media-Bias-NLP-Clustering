We are not forever stuck with a Supreme Court that has ruled some of the worst decisions by 5-4 votes. One nomination, one vote, could make the dissent the majority. Here\u2019s the kicker: The change in the court may be in a direction few have predicted. It\u2019s not just the liberals who are old or potentially sick, but the conservatives. Illness and voluntary retirement happen unexpectedly. Who would have thought that moderate Sandra Day O\u2019Connor would retire in 2006?\n\nFew know that Bush-appointed conservative Chief Justice John Roberts has had two reported seizures since 1993, even though the health issue was in the New York Times and other media when he was first appointed. His second seizure was in 2007. Many doctors classify two or more unexplained seizures as epilepsy.\n\nThe Supreme Court Justices have more control than you think; they even play a hand in choosing their successor by deciding when to retire, and by doing so, selecting what President will choose their replacement.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 82 (confirmed under Bill Clinton, 1993), is the oldest, and liberals have been pressing her to make room for an Obama appointment but she continues onward, with spunk. However, most of the others, including conservatives, are not far behind:\n\nAntonin Scalia, 79 (Ronald Reagan, 1986)\n\nAnthony M. Kennedy, 78 (Ronald Reagan in 1988)\n\nStephen Breyer, 76 (Bill Clinton, 1994)\n\nClarence Thomas, 66 (George H. W. Bush, 1991)\n\nSamuel Alito, 65 (George W. Bush, 2006)\n\nJohn Roberts, 60 (George W. Bush, 2005)\n\nSonia Sotomayor, 60 (Barack Obama, 2009)\n\nElena Kagan, 55 (Barack Obama, 2010)\n\nJustices Kennedy, leaning right, and Breyer, leaning left, tend to be the two deciding swing votes in this Court. Both are in their late 70\u2019s. A strong liberal replacement for either would make the court more progressive.\n\nThe cases that could be changed by one vote are enormous. Former Senate Leader George Mitchell told the National Press Club last year, \u201cThe Citizens United Decision will go down as one of the worst ever by any Supreme Court.\u201d He said it helps foster a \u201cmaddening money chase\u201d in politics, makes it \u201cfar worse than before,\u201d and \u201cI hope the American people will rise up against it.\n\nHere is a list of the top six cases that could be reversed by a single vote, with a more progressive Court:\n\nCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 2010\u2014 The Court ruled that the First Amendment gives non and for profit corporations, associations and labor unions the power to donate to political campaigns with no funding caps or restrictions. The court went even further in its controversial and disputed \u201ccorporations are people\u201d philosophy. Shelby County v. Holder, 2013\u2014The Court struck down section 4b of the Voting Rights Act which gives the federal government power over states that have a history of voting discrimination. Despite near-unanimous congressional approval of prior voting rights amendments as specifically authorized in the Constitution for Congress, Justice Scalia voted for the court to override congress due to his belief Congress can\u2019t be trusted: \u201cThey\u2019re going to lose votes if they vote against the Voting Rights Act.\u201d To Scalia, democracy is unconstitutional. On the other hand, Justice Ginsberg, among the four minority votes, accurately stated that the Congressional power \u201cis in the constitution.\u201d Republican House and Senate Judiciary Chairs Goodlatte (R-VA) and Grassley (R-IA) have seized on the majority-five ruling as an opportunity to stop improvements in the law while permitting forms of voter suppression. Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 2011 \u2013 The Court ruled that a female Wal-Mart employee could not file a class action suit alleging gender discrimination on behalf of herself, and 1.5 million Wal-Mart employees. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 2014 \u2013 The Court blocked Department of Health and Human Services regulations requiring employers, in this case corporations, to provide no-cost birth control to female employees, saying it violates the Religious Freedom Act, again because of their 5-4 view that \u201ccorporations are people.\u201d Amnesty v. Clapper, 2013\u2014ACLU challenged President Bush\u2019s 2001 wiretapping program expanded by congress in 2008. The Court 5-4 ruled the legislation constitutional and upheld the NSA\u2019s power, without warrant, to collect lists of international phone calls and emails. The debate continues in Congress as we write. Bush v. Gore, 2000\u2014Just five Republican-appointed justices stopped the Florida re-count, making George W. Bush the next president. Because of his policies versus Al Gore\u2019s, critical issues that could have turned out very differently include entering the Iraq War, financial deregulation leading to the 2008 crash, and rich tax breaks expanding income inequality.\n\nThe Court will face many more high profile decisions affecting Michigan and the Nation in the near future, including the Affordable Care Act, civil rights and gay rights cases, fair housing, women\u2019s health choices, pay equity, and regulation of financial institutions and corporations. The Supreme Court consists of people with pre-existing political and ideological proclivities. Changing the Court could come from age, illness, or something all Americans have power over\u2014the person we elect as President.\n\nRobert Weiner is a former spokesman for the Clinton White House and senior staff for Reps.
