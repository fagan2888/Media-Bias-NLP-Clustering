Orlando Health CEO David Strong said the project will add a new cancer center, a new nursing home and a freestanding emergency room in Horizon West.\n\n\u201cIt will transform this property from really a single hospital into a destination medical campus, as well as bring necessary medical services to the Horizons West community,\u201d Strong said.\n\nHealth Central is already expanding its ER expansion and adding a new bed tower, a project that will open this summer. Now, they will also replace a 1960s-era nursing home and add a new cancer center to the Health Central campus in Ocoee.\n\nGreg Ohe, current president of Health Central, said there\u2019s an existing cancer center across from Health Central.\n\n\u201cBut that cancer center is starting to bump up into some capacity issues,\u201d Ohe said. \u201cSo the thinking with the new center is we\u2019ll double its capacity so we can accommodate the cancer needs of this community.\u201d\n\nBut the third project could have the most impact long-term: a freestanding emergency room in the growing Horizon West area.\n\nI asked Tracy Swanson, executive director of the West Orange Healthcare District, if the new ER is the precursor for a new hospital.\n\n\u201cYes, there is plenty of land out there, but at this point, we\u2019re thinking long-range in terms of as the community grows out there, the potential is there,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nCritics of the health district, which used to own Health Central before it was sold to Orlando Health in 2012 for $185 million, say the district spends too much money on Orlando Health projects. Swanson said there was a seven-year non-compete in the sale that prevents them from funding Florida Hospital projects.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to serving the under-served and the indigent, all hospitals can come and ask for support,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd as we launch Healthy West Orange, we look forward to having Florida Hospital be a key partner in improving the health and well being of the citizens of west Orange.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
