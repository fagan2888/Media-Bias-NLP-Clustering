Some employers use those \u201ctip credits\u201d to satisfy the minimum wage obligations; some do not. (And in some states, like California, they cannot do so without running afoul of state minimum wage laws.)\n\nMany hospitality employers use \u201ctip pools\u201d to divide customer tips among staff. Those \u201ctip pools\u201d normally provide for tips to be divided among \u201cfront of the house\u201d employees who are involved in serving customers \u2013 servers, bartenders, etc. Some employers have extended the \u201ctip pools\u201d to include \u201cback of the house\u201d employees \u2013 dishwashers, cooks, etc. \u2013 particularly where they are not using a \u201ctip credit.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) issued a rule prohibiting employers from including kitchen staff in \u201ctip pools\u201d \u2013 even where no \u201ctip credit\u201d was being taken. Two separate district courts held that the DOL did not have authority to issue such a rule where no \u201ctip credit\u201d was taken, relying on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling in Cumbie v. Woody Woo, Inc., 596 F.3d 577 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\nOn February 23, 2016, in Oregon Restaurant & Lodging Assoc. v. Perez, No. 13-25765 (9th Cir. Feb. 23, 2016), a divided Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those two district court decisions, holding that the DOL in fact has the authority to regulate the \u201ctip pooling\u201d practices of employers even when they do not take tip credits \u2014 including prohibiting employers from including kitchen employees in \u201ctip pools.\u201d While confirming that the FLSA permits the use of \u201ctip credits\u201d to fulfill minimum wage requirements, the Court concluded that the DOL was acting within its authority in concluding that employers that establish \u201ctip pools\u201d may only do so when the persons who are included are persons who normally receive tips \u2013 and that, as kitchen staff do not normally receive tips, they cannot be included in \u201ctip pools.\u201d\n\nThe decision not only appears to be inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s own Cumbie decision, but with other courts that have reviewed this same issue.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association, a co-plaintiff in the case, has already indicated that it may seek review of the decision by a full panel of the Ninth Circuit. And it is certainly possible that the decision will be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court. But unless and until the decision is reversed, restaurant employers in the Ninth Circuit \u2013 which encompasses Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington \u2013would be wise to review their \u201ctip pooling\u201d practices promptly with counsel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ninth Circuit held DOL has authority to regulate tip pooling practices of employers even when they do not take tip credits, including prohibiting employers from including kitchen employees in tip pools", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (&amp;ldquo;FLSA&amp;rdquo;) permits employers to use &amp;ldquo;tip credits&amp;rdquo; to satisfy minimum wage obligations to tipped employees.&amp;nbsp; Some employers use those &amp;ldquo;tip", "title": "Ninth Circuit Approves DOL Rule Prohibiting \u201cTip Pooling\u201d For Kitchen Employees Even Where No \u201cTip Credit\u201d Is Taken", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/ninth-circuit-approves-dol-rule-prohibiting-tip-pooling-kitchen-employees-even-where", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/Cappital%20Hill_11.jpg?itok=xeTs1hkp", "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "keywords": "Ninth Circuit, DOL, Fair Labor Standards Act, Tip Credits, Pool, regulation, Oregon Restaurant & Lodging v.
