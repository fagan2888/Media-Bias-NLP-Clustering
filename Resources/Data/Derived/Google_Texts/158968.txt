When we think of Wal-Mart, we tend to think of a superstore that has pretty much everything you need.

But here locally we have something other Wal-Marts around the world are lacking: Josephus Williams.

"He's got fans from all over," said Wal-Mart Store Manager, Tim Cobb. "They come here specifically to see him."

Eight years ago, Williams, a former police officer, Air Force veteran, and opera stand-out, was donating his services to the Salvation Army as a holiday bell ringer in Panama City.

"I made the huge mistake one day and I put him at the Wal-Mart on 23rd Street," said the Salvation Army Major. "It was a huge mistake."

It wasn't a mistake that Williams raised $25,000 for the charity. The mistake was what would happen when that Wal-Mart's manager approached him because of it.

"He asked me for my boss' phone number," said Josephus. "All I was doing was sitting there ringing a bell and I was wondering why he wanted my boss' phone number."

"He was drawing huge crowd on the sidewalk," said Cobb. "So we thought it would be great if we could have him year round, so we offered him a job as a people greeter."

"So I lost my best bell ringer," said the Major. "And Wal-Mart gained a wonderful guy."

When Josephus isn't taking care of his mother, or in church blessing his peers with his voice, he sings his way into the hearts of Wal-Mart customers.

In style of course.

"We get some raised eyebrows," said Cobb. "From people who don't know whats going on, but he quickly wins them over."

"When I get through they always clap and they say, 'Wow, wow, wow,'" said Williams. "And some of them come and hug me and everything. It just makes your day, that's why I love working at Wal-Mart."

Wal-Mart employees say Josephus has a way of making everyone feel like someone, whether he is remembering their name, or going the extra mile to help customers with their shopping experience.
