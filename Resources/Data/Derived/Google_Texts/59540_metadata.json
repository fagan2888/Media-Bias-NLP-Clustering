Go look it up. You can find it.'\" Wilson said he was told.\n\nExcept he can't look it up, because as Fox 4 Problem Solvers discovered, it doesn't exist. There is no \u201cObamacare surtax\u201d on renters.\n\nEven so, Mr. Wilson says he's paid $300 so far for a bogus tax and estimates the owners of the 84-unit complex have taken in about $40,000 overall. They first started collecting the tax in 2013.\n\nThey need to be held accountable. I just really want them to stop,\u201d he said.\n\nTo get answers, Problem Solvers paid a visit to one of the owners of Burr Woods, Marilyn Gaar, who insisted what she's doing is perfectly legal.\n\nHere's how she figures it. Because the Affordable Care Act included a 3.8 tax on people with investment income who earn more than $250,000 a year, she insists it increased her taxes, so she's just passing her tax increase onto her tenants.\n\n\u201cSo that people who live here who do not have great incomes understand that they are paying for this,\u201d Gaar said.\n\nReally? Gaar admitted to us she didn't earn a dime on the rental property last year, meaning she wouldn't owe the Obamacare investment tax.\n\nIf she had, it would have been perfectly legal for Gaar to have raised rents to cover any increase in costs she may be facing. But attorney Bernard Brown says you can't just make up a tax and stick it on a lease.\n\n\u201cThat's simply a deceptive statement. It would make an ordinary person signing a agreement like that think there is a tax, a government charge that they are required to pay,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown said she should return the money he said she deceptively collected from her renters. But when we asked Gaar about that, her answer wasn't encouraging\u2026\n\n\u201cNo. Look how it\u2019s set up. It's the total rent, total payment that they owe,\u201d she said.\n\nThe total payment, but one that includes a monthly Obamacare surtax, a tax which doesn't exist. After talking with the owner at length, she is now considering renaming the charge so that people won't be confused.\n\nMeanwhile, several of her renters are now talking to an attorney and considering suing the complex for violating Missouri's consumer protection law.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "39.016951;-94.281615", "description": "BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. -- A Blue Springs man's lease includes a monthly fee for something called an \u201cObamacare Surtax.\u201d But when he couldn't find any evidence that such a tax exists, he called Fox 4 Problem Solver Linda Wagar for help.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "aa180836cf51f68a968102c5da3acfdf"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox4kc.com", "description": "BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. \u2014 A Blue Springs man\u2019s lease includes a monthly fee for something called an \u201cObamacare Surtax.\u201d But when he couldn\u2019t find any evidence that such a tax exists, he\u2026", "title": "\u201cObamacare surtax\u201d documented in lease raises renter\u2019s suspicions", "url": "http://fox4kc.com/2015/03/09/obamacare-surtax-documented-in-lease-raises-renters-suspicions/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwdaf.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/promo250180437.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwdaf.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/promo250180437.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox4kc", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox4kc"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576455676", "fb": {"pages": 56053548644}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox4kc.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/51bbf50c17a18556766e65127d6c062a?s=16", "application-name": "fox4kc.com", "ICBM": "39.016951, -94.281615", "keywords": "problem solvers, missouri, obamacare, problem solvers, rent", "google-site-verification": "IMc9GO9sOWQapKRQ7YNBAOnWgF_eEqdSCGBFLVSmAIw", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/fox4kc/", "published_time": "2015-03-09T15:43:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T15:43:03+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fox4kc/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Problem Solvers, Obamacare, Burr Oak Woods"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb41d\"", "article_summary": "But it is in black and white on Mr. Wilson's rental lease: A $22 charge for a \"monthly Obamacare surtax.\"\nThe total payment, but one that includes a monthly Obamacare surtax, a tax which doesn't exist.\nRuss Wilson said he called 80 apartment complexes in the last month trying to find out whether they charge renters a monthly fee for Obamacare.\nGaar admitted to us she didn't earn a dime on the rental property last year, meaning she wouldn't owe the Obamacare investment tax.\nMeanwhile, several of her renters are now talking to an attorney and considering suing the complex for violating Missouri's consumer protection law."}
