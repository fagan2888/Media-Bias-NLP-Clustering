According to a new report from private student loan lender Sallie Mae\u2019s, parental income and savings covered 32 percent of college costs in the academic year 2014-15, while scholarships and grants covered 30 percent.\n\nFamilies spent an average of $24,164 on college this year, a 16 percent rise in spending from the previous year and the largest increase since 2009-10. The money spent covers costs of tuition, books, and living expenses.\n\nRelated: Average Family Has Saved Enough to Send One Kid to College for Half a Year\n\nThe report details how fewer parents fear the worst when it comes to the risks associated with college. Fewer parents are worried that their child won\u2019t find a job after graduation, that their income will decline because of layoffs, and that there will be an increase in student loan rates. As confidence has increased, fewer families are using cost-saving techniques, such as having students live at home.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the willingness of parents to spend on education is the improving stock market. The average size of a 529 account, the popular college savings investment plan, continues to grow after the recession caused a downturn, hitting a balance of $20,474 as of December 1, 2014. That figure tumbled to $10,690 at the end of 2008, according to data from the College Savings Plan Network.\n\nAlthough parents may be feeling better about paying for college, the basic trend of increasing prices continues, and loans are still a big part of the funding picture. Between 2001 and 2012, average undergraduate tuition almost doubled, causing an average real rate increase of 3.5 percent each year. Nearly 71 percent of college graduates left school with student loan debt this year, up from 54 percent 20 years prior. The average debt was $35,000 in 2015, an increase of 34 percent from 2010, student loan-tracker Edvisors has found.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As lingering financial fears from the recession fade, more parents are willing and able to open their wallets to pay for their children\u2019s educations.
