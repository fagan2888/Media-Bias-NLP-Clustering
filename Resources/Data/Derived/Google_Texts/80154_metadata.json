Daniels in a study by the Charlotte Lozier Institute. Under the ACA, enrollment in an HCSM exempts members from the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d the law\u2019s requirement that people who choose not to purchase health insurance be fined up to $695 per adult and $2,085 per family in 2016 for that decision, Daniels writes.\n\nAs medical needs arise, members typically pay a portion of their expenses\u2014similar to a deductible\u2014and forward their bills to their HCSM or directly to fellow HCSM members, who pay monthly \u201cshares\u201d of approximately $200 per individual or $500 dollars per family.\n\nVoluntarism and Efficiency\n\nDale Bellis, executive director of Liberty HealthShare, says reliance on the participation of willing members distinguishes the HCSM model from those of insurance companies.\n\n\u201cMedical insurance pools money and builds reserves from consumers and makes promised payments based on certain risks,\u201d Bellis said. \u201cMedical cost sharing relies on the participation and contributions of individual members to meet the medical costs submitted by members.\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, for-profit insurance companies must maintain a medical loss ratio of not more than 20 percent, meaning they must spend at least 80 percent of revenue collected through premiums on patients\u2019 medical bills. Bellis says Liberty HealthShare\u2019s nonprofit status ensures greater efficiency.\n\n\u201cBecause we are nonprofit, we avoid the profit-motivated bureaucratic middleman approach to healthcare cost management,\u201d Bellis said. \u201cWe put health care decisions in the hands of the individual member, restoring the patient-doctor relationship. Our administrative expense target is 12 percent, which means 88 percent of dollars contributed monthly are directed to sharing the medical expenses of our members.\u201d\n\nMembership Rising Rapidly\n\nBellis says Liberty HealthShare\u2019s membership more than doubled in 2015 and participation in HCSMs overall has ballooned since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010.\n\n\u201cAt passage of the ACA, nationwide healthcare ministries represented less than 100,000 families,\u201d Bellis said. \u201cToday, there are approximately 250,000 families nationwide, representing 600,000 individuals, cost sharing with a health care sharing ministry.\u201d\n\nMembership in Samaritan Ministries, an HCSM founded in 1991, surged from 15,000 households in 2010 to more than 56,000 households\u2014182,000 adults and children\u2014in January 2016, WORLD News Group reported.\n\nThe ACA has made traditional health insurance less affordable and less appealing to many Americans, while sharing services in general are growing more popular, says Anthony Hopp, Samaritan\u2019s director of membership development.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are beginning to share in a lot of creative ways by using services like Uber and Airbnb,\u201d Hopp said. \u201cSo the idea of sharing medical needs doesn\u2019t sound so fringe anymore, but instead it\u2019s becoming a preferred and logical choice.\u201d\n\nPrinciple Over Price\n\nAlthough monthly membership in HCSMs costs less than most insurance plans, Hopp says some members choose to share costs for reasons unrelated to price.\n\n\u201cSamaritan members are like-minded Christians who agree to and sign a basic statement of faith,\u201d Hopp said. \u201cOur approach of directly sharing medical needs is steeped in prayer, community, and trusting God. Members are joining primarily on principle, not price. It\u2019s a biblical health care option that is consistent with their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nBellis says some of Liberty HealthShare\u2019s members sought out the HCSM because they are \u201cmen and women of faith and values\u201d who wish \u201cto live out their individual faith beliefs exempt from the requirements and mandates within the ACA [regarding] abortion, abortifacients, contraceptives, [and] gender reassignment.\u201d\n\nVoluntary Contributions\n\nUnlike other HCSMs, Samaritan asks its members to send checks directly to fellow members who have applied for reimbursement for a medical bill.\n\n\u201cTo remain a member in good standing, a person is required to send his monthly share to the person to whom he is directed,\u201d Hopp said.\n\nSamaritan members\u2019 direct contact with one another helps the organization cover preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cWhen a medical need is preexisting,\u201d Hopp said, \u201cSamaritan members are asked to consider voluntarily sending a little extra beyond the assigned monthly share, such as $20 to $25, in order to help the person with the preexisting need. We call these Special Prayer Needs, and throughout our 22 years of sharing, we\u2019ve been so encouraged to see the Body of Christ come together to help with these preexisting burdens.\u201d\n\nJenni White (jenni@rope2.org) writes from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nScott E.
