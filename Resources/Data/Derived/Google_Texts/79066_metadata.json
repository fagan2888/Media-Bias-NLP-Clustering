Carson\n\nPiscataway\n\nChristie hasn't always advocated for poor\n\nAs Elizabeth Connolly states in her recent Star-Ledger op-ed about eradicating poverty in N.J., we need to stick to the facts. I wholeheartedly agree, and therefore need to comment on two issues she raises. First of all she cites the expansion of Medicaid as an example of one of the policies the Christie administration has put forth to broaden the safety net for the poor. While I applaud Gov. Chris Christie for expanding Medicaid in 2013, the expansion was a part of Obamacare, a policy that did not come from Christie's administration at all. Gov. Christie has called Obamacare \"a federally failed program.\" He has also said that he thinks Obamacare should be repealed.\n\nIn regards to the claim that because of improved revenue Gov. Christie has raised the Earned Income Tax Credit, a few comments are in order. Gov. Christie reduced the EITC for the working poor in N.J. in 2010. This reduction hurt the working poor in the state, effectively raising their taxes, as the country and the state were digging out of the recession. I believe Gov. Christie's decision to raise the EITC this summer is more about his presidential campaign then his concern for strengthening the safety net for the poor.\n\nMichael P.
