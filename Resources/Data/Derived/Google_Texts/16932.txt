Où est le cinema français? UWM, bien sûr

The 18th annual Festival of Films in French is a celebration of French history, culture and vitality.

It's also 10 days of 17 really interesting, compelling and fun movies — nearly all of them getting their Milwaukee theater premieres at UWM Union Theatre, 2200 E. Kenwood Blvd. And admission is free.

Founded by the UWM French fepartment, the fest starts Friday with "On My Way," a bittersweet 2013 road movie starring Catherine Deneuve, at 7 p.m.; and "Hold Back," a culture-clash romance set in Paris, at 9:15 p.m.

Other highlights of this year's festival, which runs through Feb. 15, include:

■A screening of Claude Lanzmann's ("Shoah") "The Last of the Unjust," a documentary drawn from Lanzmann's lengthy interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last surviving president of the Jewish Council in the Theresienstadt death camp, Sunday at 2 p.m.

■Showings of two documentaries on hip-hop and contemporary France, "Pleasure to the People" and "93 Beautiful Rebel," starting at 2 p.m. Feb. 9 Director Jean-Pierre Thorn will be in attendance at the screenings, which are part of a daylong event, including hip-hop performances by Milwaukee dance companies.

■A showing of "Mother," a 1925 classic by French film master Jacques Feyder, shown with musical accompaniment, 7 p.m. Feb. 10.
