He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Saturday and will meet with a hand specialist.\n\nStanton, who grimaced as he swung and missed for strike three Friday night in the ninth inning of the Marlins\u2019 7-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, said the injury became worse as the game progressed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that it will be the quickest course possible, but certainly not great news when you lose a guy that means what he\u2019s meant to this ballclub and to baseball,\u201d Marlins manager Dan Jennings said before Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nStanton led the majors with 27 homers and 67 RBIs when sidelined. Last year he was in the thick of the home run race when a beaning ended his season on Sept. 11, and he finished tied for second in the majors with 37 homers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see with the work he puts in,\u201d reliever A.J. Ramos said. \u201cYou see the year he\u2019s having so you\u2019re definitely disappointed and you feel bad for him.\u201d\n\nThe latest injury means Stanton will miss the All-Star Game, and it\u2019s a big blow to a team that lost its fifth game in a row Friday to fall a season-worst 15 games below .500.\n\nWhile Stanton took lusty cuts in the ninth, he said the injury occurred earlier in the game.\n\n\u201cOn a swing, my bat dug into my hand a little bit and didn\u2019t feel the greatest,\u201d he said Friday after the loss. \u201cIt got worse and worse.\u201d\n\nStanton\u2019s hand appeared swollen, and he said it hurt where he grips the bat. He went 0 for 4 on the night, which included a broken bat.\n\nHe ground out in the first inning and struck out in the fourth, sixth and ninth innings. Stanton said he didn\u2019t think the broken bat affected him.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it was that at-bat,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably the swings and misses.\u201d\n\nStanton has 12 homers in June, tying the franchise record for any month. Despite his power surge, the Marlins had been woeful lately, batting .201 and averaging two runs a game over the past nine games through Friday.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s upon us to pick it up and we can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cIt would be easy to toss in the towel right now or we\u2019re going to find out what kind of fighters we have and how we step up.\u201d\n\nHis injury comes as the team anticipates the return Thursday of ace Jose Fernandez, who has been sidelined more than a year recovering from Tommy John surgery.\n\nStanton signed a record $325 million, 13-year contract last November. At age 25 he has 181 career homers, but because of injuries has never played more than 150 games in a season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Giancarlo Stanton out 4-6 weeks for Marlins with broken hand", "title": "Giancarlo Stanton out 4-6 weeks for Marlins with broken hand", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/27/giancarlo-stanton-out-4-6-weeks-for-marlins-with-broken-hand/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150627_125659_giancarlo-stanton.jpg", "height": 430}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150627_125659_giancarlo-stanton.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-27T12:58:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:10:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42f3\"", "article_summary": "The Miami Marlins slugger has a broken left hand, which is expected to sideline him four to six weeks.\nWhile Stanton took lusty cuts in the ninth, he said the injury occurred earlier in the game.\nHe was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Saturday and will meet with a hand specialist.\n\u201cOn a swing, my bat dug into my hand a little bit and didn\u2019t feel the greatest,\u201d he said Friday after the loss.\n\u201cIt got worse and worse.\u201dStanton\u2019s hand appeared swollen, and he said it hurt where he grips the bat."}
