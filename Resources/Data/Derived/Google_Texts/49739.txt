OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Thunder guard Russell Westbrook had surgery to repair a fracture to his right cheek after getting hit by a teammate’s knee.

The Thunder announced Saturday that the surgery took place in Los Angeles.

Westbrook had a noticeable imprint on his right cheek after Andre Roberson hit him in the final seconds of a 115-112 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night.

Westbrook will be re-evaluated next week.

The MVP of the All-Star game, Westbrook has had triple-doubles in his past three games. For the month of February, he averaged 31.2 points, 10.2 assists and 9.1 rebounds and led the team to a 9-3 record.

The Thunder already were without reigning league MVP Kevin Durant, who had a screw replaced in his surgically repaired right foot last Sunday. Thunder center Steven Adams also has been out with a hand injury.
