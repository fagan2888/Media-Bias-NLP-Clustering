His baritone voice and infectious charisma made his pivotal role on David Simon\u2019s \u201cThe Wire\u201d one of the more cherished in small screen history. His turn as Antoine Batiste was the first cast for Simon\u2019s \u201cTreme,\u201d a show that this writer somewhat controversially thinks the best show in the history of American television, a poetic look at music, film and culture that surpassed even the unabashed magnificence of the much lauded, Baltimore-set drama \u201cThe Wire.\u201d\n\nAs part of a larger conversation that included talk of his latest film project, the remarkable \u201cSelma\u201d (which documents the events surrounding the March to Birmingham in 1965), we pivoted to talk about his two most prominent roles on the small screen. What began as a simple, general question resulted in an answer of rare depth and complexity, an intensely introspective and philosophical response about what these two projects mean to him both as an artist and as a man.\n\nWhat \u201cThe Wire\u201d means to Pierce\u2026\n\n\u201cThe Wire,\u201d to this point, defines me as an artist, defines my career. That speaks not just of occupation, but there\u2019s a vocation of why you become an actor, the thing that you\u2019re called to do. One day it might not be my occupation, I may not earn my living at it, but it will always be my vocation, the thing that I\u2019m called to do, to try to illuminate some aspect of this human journey and human existence.\n\nWhat he feels is the role of art\u2026\n\nWhat thoughts are to the individual when they lie awake at night and say \u201cWho am I? What are my values, what have I done, what do I hope to do, where have I failed, where have I succeeded?\u201d As you reflect on your own personal life, and those thoughts fill your head, that is the same role of art in society as a whole.\n\nEntertainment is just a residual of art, but the role of art is where we collectively think about who we are, what our values are, where we\u2019ve succeeded, where we\u2019ve failed, where we hope to go as a society as a people. It\u2019s a declaration of our value.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost that, assuming that the only role of culture and art is to entertain and it should have no other impact. And that\u2019s why people so readily say hey, you\u2019re just a Hollywood actor, shut up, don\u2019t have an opinion. But [with] \u201cThe Wire,\u201d you could not get a clearer demonstration of that role of art in action, where it is to declare to society in a forum, to discuss who we are, what our dysfunctions are and where our problems are and where we hope to succeed. More importantly, [it\u2019s] giving humanity to folks whom society has marginalized, said we\u2019re going to put on the side, we\u2019re not going to face our dysfunctions, we don\u2019t want to deal with that.\n\nWell, we\u2019re going to put it front and center on the table.\n\nOn Pierce\u2019s faith in David Simon, and watching \u201cThe Wire\u201d for the first time\u2026\n\n\n\nI can now look back and appreciate that impact that \u201cThe Wire\u201d had. Reading it, I saw the possibility there. Shooting it, I felt the possibility there. When I first saw it, I thought, \u201cOh my God, save your money, this is not going anywhere!\u201d\n\nI sat there with Andre Royo and Sonja Sohn. I\u2019ll never forget the day we screened the first two episodes, I thought oh my goodness, man, this is gonna be cancelled!\n\nDavid Simon has [taught] me to have a respect for the intelligence of the folks in the audience, to speak not to the least common denominator in the audience, but speak to a higher level. Folks will come up to you if you\u2019re authentic and truthful and honest.\n\n[Simon] said all the pieces matter, all the pieces fit. He had faith and he was able to change American storytelling on television. He had faith in the audience \u2014 that if you were authentic and truthful, and to the point, people would hang in there.\n\nOn \u201cThe Wire\u201d as a visual novel\u2026\n\n\n\nIf [an audience is] engaged with the characters, they are going to put in the time and see where the development of the characters takes them and the development of the stories. [Simon] said that happens all the time in novels and we give it short shrift when it comes to television, but I think it can happen in television. He proved that it can be done and that you will be rewarded handsomely by honoring your audience.\n\nIt was the first time that I ever heard someone say it, but they said to think of \u201cThe Wire\u201d as a novel. Some chapters you won\u2019t be in, and you\u2019re not going to be a part of other chapters, but creating an entire world will have an impact. That\u2019s why \u201cThe Wire\u201d lives on to this day [as a] multi-faceted, complex rich depiction of humanity, not only in the acting but in the written word. [There\u2019s] the meld between actors and folks who were coming from the world, bringing even more, a higher level of authenticity. Putting them in the piece just helped the actors become more authentic and do their research and allow themselves to create the world so strong that it induces behavior.\n\nI was able to trust that all of the pieces fit and mattered, [as] I knew it would be cumulative.\n\nOn the universality of this story from Baltimore, and the nature of culture\u2026\n\nDavid is successful in his storytelling because he taps into that humanity. The more specific you are, the more universal it becomes. We are all human, and our humanness is manifested in different ways because of our cultures and where we are, [with] a culture being that intersection between life and how people deal with it.\n\nPeople deal with life in different ways, but the common thread through us all is the humanity, the humanity that will inform our behavior and who we are and how we react to things. How we react finds our moral core.\n\nOn reaching different audiences\u2026\n\n\n\n[It\u2019s] humanity that connects \u201cThe Wire,\u201d from the kids slinging on the corner to that blue haired lady on Park Avenue. If you look in the hip hop culture world, \u201cThe Wire\u201d is revered, and then you can go online and see \u201cThe Wire\u201d high up on the list when it comes to a parody site like Stuff White People Like. It is the thing that pulls them all together.\n\nIt is that humanity that David tapped into and the fact that he didn\u2019t give it short shrift. He was very specific. I don\u2019t know anyone strung out as much as Bubbles, but I knew who Bubbles was, I empathized with him, I understood his struggle, I got angry with him, I loved him, I cried at his triumph when he overcame. That is the humanity that we all share.\n\nOn \u201cTreme\u201d and its connection with his life and birthplace\u2026\n\n\u201cTreme\u201d is not a television show at all to me. \u201cTreme\u201d is a defining era of my life.\n\n[\u201cTreme\u201d] was the last 4 years I got to spend with my mother before she passed. It was coming back to the city that I loved so much, but I didn\u2019t understand how much it was a part of who I was until we lost it all, and I knew that it could easily never come back.\n\n[That] fear of knowing that your entire city, your entire reference of childhood and present and future is gone in one week, in one day, with the possibility of it never coming back. [It] was a nuclear holocaust and a nuclear winter of spirit, of place, of memory, of future.\n\nBeing from a city is like being from a family, with all of the dysfunction. It is the closest connection you have to your past and the people who are most likely going to be there for you in the future.\n\nWhat New Orleans means to Pierce\u2026\n\nFamily. That\u2019s what New Orleans is. To lose New Orleans in one night with Katrina, goes far beyond Mr. Wolfe\u2019s declaration of you can\u2019t go home again. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t go home again because your home never existed.\n\nIt was an unacceptable fear to everybody in New Orleans and that was the thing that unified us to say we have got to bring New Orleans back. It wasn\u2019t just lip service, it wasn\u2019t a declared love, it was out of an absolutely acute necessity because if we didn\u2019t bring New Orleans back, didn\u2019t attempt to bring New Orleans back, didn\u2019t declare the importance of New Orleans, didn\u2019t declare the absolute American genius of our culture, it would be saying it never existed at all and you have no reason to have any importance of existence and no declaration that you were ever here as a person, as a family, as a neighborhood, as a city, as a culture.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The film and television star on working with David Simon, his love for New Orleans and his newest project, \"Selma\"", "author": "Jason Gorber", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The film and television star on working with David Simon, his love for New Orleans and his newest project, \"Selma\"", "title": "Wendell Pierce: \u201cThe Wire\u201d changed my life", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/10/wendell_pierce_the_wire_changed_my_life_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/shutterstock_147971219-667x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The film and television star on working with David Simon, his love for New Orleans and his newest project, \"Selma\"", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/shutterstock_147971219-667x960.jpg", "title": "Wendell Pierce: \u201cThe Wire\u201d changed my life", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Wendell Pierce: \u201cThe Wire\u201d changed my life", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Art, Indiewire, New Orleans, Selma, The Wire, Wendell Pierce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd86d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Art, Indiewire, New Orleans, Selma, The Wire, Wendell Pierce, Entertainment News, NewsThis article originally appeared on IndiewireWendell Pierce \u2014 Juilliard trained actor, business entrepreneur, film actor, television icon.\nWhat \u201cThe Wire\u201d means to Pierce\u2026\u201cThe Wire,\u201d to this point, defines me as an artist, defines my career.\nOn Pierce\u2019s faith in David Simon, and watching \u201cThe Wire\u201d for the first time\u2026I can now look back and appreciate that impact that \u201cThe Wire\u201d had.\nWe\u2019ve lost that, assuming that the only role of culture and art is to entertain and it should have no other impact.\nHis baritone voice and infectious charisma made his pivotal role on David Simon\u2019s \u201cThe Wire\u201d one of the more cherished in small screen history."}
