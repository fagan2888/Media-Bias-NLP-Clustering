Needless to say, teams from South Dakota, Minnesota, and Nebraska were impressed.\n\nThe inaugural Pentagon Classic went off without a hitch. Sixteen teams stepped on to Heritage Court including five not from South Dakota. There are basketball classics all over South Dakota each year, but this one has the potential to be a big deal.\n\n\"With out a question this is a big deal. For us to be able to play a quality team like Moorhead, in a facility like this, with more games to be played. It showcases girl\u2019s basketball in South Dakota and I think that is a great thing,\" O'Gorman Head Coach Kent Kolsrud said.\n\nSouth Dakota was represented well as they won four of their six games against neighboring states. Two of the games featured in state teams facing each other. These games are used as a measuring stick against the areas top teams that otherwise don't get a chance to square off.\n\n\"It is a great representation of the talent and hard work that we put together in the city. It's also a great opportunity to see some of the towns, the size, and athletism from Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota,\" Lincoln head Coach Matt Daly said.\n\nPaul Seville is the man that deserves the credit for putting together such a successful day of basketball that brought over 1,800 people through the doors. For the players and coaches they are excited to be a part of the first and hopefully many more to come.\n\n\"In the coming years this will be a tradition and a great regional event to showcase our talent,\" Daly said.\n\n\"It was a great experience for us; we hope this is something that they continue to do. We really enjoyed playing in this facility and we would love to play here again,\" Kolsrud said.\n\nThe boy's Pentagon Classic will take place December 4th and will feature nine games beginning at nine o'clock in the morning.\n\n2014 Boys\u2019 Pentagon Classic (all games on Heritage Court)\n\n9 a.m. \u2013 Avon vs. Irene-Wakonda\n\n10:30 a.m. \u2013 Remsen-Union (IA) vs. Tea\n\nNoon \u2013 Clark-Willow Lake vs. Madison\n\n1:30 p.m. \u2013 Henry Sibley (MN) vs. Sioux Falls Washington\n\n3 p.m. \u2013 St. Paul Highland Park (MN) vs. Harrisburg\n\n4:30 p.m. \u2013 St. Paul Central (MN) vs. Sioux Falls O\u2019Gorman\n\n6 p.m. \u2013 Tartan (MN) vs. Sioux Falls Lincoln\n\n7:30 p.m. \u2013 Moorhead (MN) vs. Sioux Falls Roosevelt\n\n9 p.m. \u2013 Blake (MN) vs. St. Thomas More\n\nFor more information visit The Sanford Pentagon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "On Saturday the Sanford Pentagon hosted the first girl&#39;s Pentagon Classic.
