But appearances can be deceiving.\n\nThe city\u2019s estimated per capita income in 2012 was $24,991, down from $26,515 in 2000, according to city-data.com.\n\nThat means many Temple Terrace residents struggle to make ends meet, especially when it comes to putting food on their tables.\n\nThe volunteers who operate the St. Vincent de Paul Food Pantry on the campus of Corpus Christi Catholic Church in Temple Terrace are well aware of the issue and are there to help those in need.\n\n\u201cOur number of clients has almost tripled in the last couple of years and Obamacare is the main reason,\u201d said pantry coordinator Cheryl Stine. \u201cCompanies have cut back employee hours and now those people have to buy their own insurance. Food stamp amounts also have been cut.\u201d\n\nOn average the food pantry \u2014 which serves people living in 33616 and 33637 ZIP code designations and is open Saturdays from 9 to 11 a.m. \u2014 sees 40 to 50 families per week. Each family is entitled to utilize the pantry once a month.\n\n\u201cWe also see a lot of seniors who come because they can\u2019t make it on Social Security, and some have custody of their grandchildren,\u201d Stine said.\n\nChurch parishioners donate food and funds to the nonprofit lay organization, named in honor of Saint Vincent de Paul of France, a 17th century priest who recognized and heeded the need to serve society\u2019s less fortunate.\n\nThe food pantry also greatly depends on contributions from the community.\n\nThe Temple Terrace Junior Woman\u2019s Club has been among its greatest supporters by sponsoring an annual food drive to benefit the food pantry, which last year distributed 54,412 pounds of food to the area\u2019s hungry.\n\nFor the club\u2019s third annual Food Drive members plans to distribute bags for donations to homes throughout Temple Terrace on April 25.\n\nThey will be back in the neighborhoods on May 2 to pick up the food-filled bags and ask that residents place them near their mailboxes by 10 a.m.\n\nItems such as canned fruits and vegetables, soup, tuna, beef stew, pasta, rice, cereals and peanut butter and jelly are welcomed, as are powdered milk, coffee, tea, baby diapers and toiletries. Food must be nonperishable and containers unbreakable.\n\nStine and St. Vincent de Paul Food Pantry President Joe Affronti and volunteer Norma Gonzalez were present at a recent Junior Woman\u2019s Club meeting and dinner to speak to and thank the members for their support of the organization.\n\n\u201cThis is really an honor for us and we feel like we need to honor you,\u201d Stine said. \u201cYou have been stalwarts, and we really appreciate that.\u201d\n\nLittle did she know the food pantry was about to receive another show of support by the Junior Woman\u2019s Club.\n\nClub member Karen Macaluso presented Affronti with a $500 check, the first installment of the organization\u2019s $2,000 donation to the food pantry.\n\n\u201cThe Food Drive for the food pantry is now one of our major projects,\u201d Macaluso said.\n\nAffronti and Stine were overjoyed by the club\u2019s generosity.\n\n\u201cIn the summer, when children are on vacation, is when our greatest need is,\u201d Stine said. \u201cSo this contribution will go a long way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 08 Apr 2015 09:06:03 -0400", "Description": "TEMPLE TERRACE \u2014 From the outside looking in, the small town that borders the Hillsborough River appears to be relatively affluent.
