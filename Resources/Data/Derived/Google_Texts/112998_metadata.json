A whole new cycle of games, thrills, laughs, debates, controversy and resonance. A new year arrives unblemished, and it urges us to look forward, past our cynicism, and get excited in the most genuine way possible. Here are our most anticipated indie games of 2014.\n\n\u201cTransistor\u201d\n\nDeveloper: Supergiant Games\n\nSupergiant Games\u2019 debut \u201cBastion\u201d was a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind action-RPG that blended a \u201cDiablo\u201d\u2013esque slaughter with combat mechanics so deep and twitchy they almost resembled a fighting game. Their second effort, \u201cTransistor,\u201d looks to build on all the things that made \u201cBastion\u201d so delectable. It has a dirty cyberpunk world, decked out in polluted lighting and glittery neon, but it also looks to further Supergiant\u2019s strong, sophisticated storytelling tradition. Like \u201cBastion,\u201d \u201cTransistor\u201d looks like a very stylish game \u2014 I\u2019m very excited to see what Supergiant has in store.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture\u201d\n\nDeveloper: The Chinese Room\n\nThe Chinese Room\u2019s breakout game, \u201cDear Esther,\u201d was a quiet, ruminative journey that told an abstract journey against the tapestry of an old Celtic island. \u201cEverybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture\u201d seems to be a successor to that tone, but with a little more game play injected. You\u2019ll be able to pick things up, examine them, manipulate them \u2013 perhaps allowing for more traditional puzzle mechanics. But what\u2019s most intriguing is the story. We follow six characters who\u2019ve been left behind after the rapture, an excellent premise for a developer with a narrative pedigree like the Chinese Room.\n\n\u201cThe Witness\u201d\n\nDeveloper: Johnathan Blow\n\n\u201cBraid\u201d was one of the games that really helped bring independent game development to the mainstream press. It had a gorgeous, impressionistic art style, a dreamy original soundtrack and a remarkably personal story. I think that\u2019s what made it such a success; a lot of people had never seen such a personal expression of emotion told through a commercially released video game before. Designer Johnathan Blow has stayed pretty quiet since \u201cBraid\u2019s\u201d release way back in 2008, but his next project, \u201cThe Witness,\u201d looks to be out sometime in the next few months. There\u2019s not much information available about the game yet, save that it\u2019s a first-person adventure where you arrive anonymously to a mysterious island and solve a series of puzzles \u2013 much like \u201cMyst,\u201d the granddaddy of modern PC gaming. What we know for sure, though, is that Johnathan Blow is a unique voices in games, and anything he\u2019s spent nearly six years making is bound to be worth your time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From stylish cyberpunk to moving family story, these games will break new ground in 2014", "title": "5 indie video games to get excited about this year", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From stylish cyberpunk to moving family story, these games will break new ground in 2014", "title": "5 indie video games to get excited about this year", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/16/5_indie_video_games_to_get_excited_about_this_year/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/everybody_rapture.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From stylish cyberpunk to moving family story, these games will break new ground in 2014", "title": "5 indie video games to get excited about this year", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/everybody_rapture.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Winkie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, everybody's gone to the rapture, Gaming, indie games, octodad, that dragon cancer, the witness, transistor, Video Games", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d88\"", "article_summary": "Topics: everybody's gone to the rapture, Gaming, indie games, octodad, that dragon cancer, the witness, transistor, Video Games, Entertainment NewsThe beginning of the year will always be one of the most exciting times in gaming.\nLike \u201cBastion,\u201d \u201cTransistor\u201d looks like a very stylish game \u2014 I\u2019m very excited to see what Supergiant has in store.\n\u201cThe Witness\u201dDeveloper: Johnathan Blow\u201cBraid\u201d was one of the games that really helped bring independent game development to the mainstream press.\nTheir second effort, \u201cTransistor,\u201d looks to build on all the things that made \u201cBastion\u201d so delectable.\nHere are our most anticipated indie games of 2014."}
