They are skipping health care in spite of federal and state efforts, particularly through the Affordable Care Act, that have lowered the numbers of the uninsured.\n\n\n\nIn a survey taken in the fall, The Commonwealth Fund, a private, independent health care research organization, found that about 40 percent of adults nationwide who had high-deductible private insurance plans reported delaying care because of the cost.\n\n\n\nIn another, the Gallup Poll, which annually asks about health care cost and use every November, reported that the percentage of Americans who had insurance and chose not to go to a health care professional for a routine visit or a need because of cost hit an all-time high of 34 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cLast year, many hoped that the opening of the government health care exchanges and the resulting increase in the number of Americans with health insurance would enable more people to seek medical treatment,\u201d Gallup said. \u201cBut, despite a drop in the uninsured rate, a slightly higher percentage of Americans than in previous years report having put off medical treatment, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act has not immediately affected this measure.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Gallup survey showed that Obamacare has begun to help its target group as a whole. The percentage of middle-to-lower income Americans who said they skipped getting health care because of cost dropped, it said. The federal health care law targeted this population because it was the largest group among the uninsured \u2013 too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid, too poor to afford coverage.\n\n\n\nHowever, among households making $30,000-$75,000 a year, 38 percent said cost forced them to forgo health care, Gallup said, up from 33 percent in 2013.\n\n\n\nIn even wealthier households, the least likely to have Obamacare coverage, the increase was more pronounced. In households making more than $75,000 a year, it said, 28 percent reported skipping professional health care services due to cost. That figure is up 65 percent over 2013, according to the survey.\n\n\n\nThe problem is easy to identify but difficult to solve. Health care is extremely expensive in the U.S., and to keep from busting their budgets, companies that provide coverage to their employees and families increasingly are turning to plans that keep monthly premiums lower by increasing deductibles and charging more for out-of-pocket costs, said Linda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute.\n\n\n\n\u201cMore and more of [the cost] is being put on the employee, and because of that, they\u2019re reluctant to get the care they need because they\u2019re concerned about the cost,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nRick Pula of Piscataway is another of the insured who said he considers cost before seeking professional help.\n\n\n\nPula, 61, early this year fell on ice, he said, injuring his back, which already was sore from disc problems. The pain re-emerged in recent weeks, but he is trying to wait it out as he has done in the past, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am procrastinating going to the doctor because of experience with back pain and that it will usually subside,\u201d Pula said.\n\n\n\nHe said his share of the doctor\u2019s bill, plus the cost of a scan such as an x-ray or MRI and rehabilitation therapy makes the pain something he\u2019ll have to accept.\n\n\n\nAfter paying $500 for a walking boot he had gotten for a recent foot fracture, Pula was reluctant to see how high health care bills would be for his back.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do they justify it?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s justifiable because health care is costly, but many factors go into the price of its goods and services, said Kerry McKean Kelly, vice president of communications and member services for the New Jersey Hospital Association. Advances in pharmaceuticals and technology are expensive, and high use of health care, especially in the Northeast, requires numerous facilities and staff, she said.\n\n\n\nHospitals are doing their part to rein in costs by giving up an estimated $4.5 billion in Medicare reimbursements over Obamacare\u2019s first 10 years, she added.\n\n\n\nMore sacrifices will be necessary, said Wardell Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere needs to be much greater focus on addressing the underlying health care cost drivers, such as the price of services, to ensure affordable health care for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially true in New Jersey, which has some of the highest health care costs in the nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne place to attack is what Schwimmer calls \u201cactionable transparency,\u201d or simply letting consumers see the actual cost of health care goods and services and giving them options.\n\n\n\nWhen insured patients go to physicians\u2019 offices, pharmacies and hospitals, they have no access to a menu of price information. Without knowing the full cost, consumers are \u201cparalyzed,\u201d she said, so they don\u2019t take care of their health needs. As time goes on, those needs become more critical, leading to higher costs and worse outcomes, Schwimmer said.\n\n\n\nAssemblyman Craig J. Coughlin in October chaired a hearing over health care costs. The legislature is looking into a number of bills that could address the issue, he said, including measures that would give more price information to consumers or create an arbitration system to resolve billing disputes between insurance companies and health care providers.\n\n\n\nEfforts to get costs under control have bipartisan support, he said, noting that publicity over astronomical bills for seemingly routine procedures provoke outrage.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose things shock the conscience,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe national pediatrics organization this year issued a policy statement suggesting that the federal government may want to limit high-deductible health plans to adults because its members see families withholding important primary care for their children. Because their bodies are young and in development, children are high users of health care, and high-deductible policies may drive some families to skip visits or care they deem non-essential, it said.\n\n\n\nWhether the payment is for insurance or to the provider, it\u2019s still too high for people like Korobow. As a part-time IT consultant with sporadic free-lance jobs, Korobow, who was covered through his wife\u2019s insurance policy, says he might make around $20,000-$30,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford the full price of medical insurance,\u201d he said, \u201cor go to the emergency room at $500 a shot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Darragh may be reached at tdarragh@njadvancemedia.com.
