Yes, the Democrats have worked very hard to keep women back in the \u201860s, and now they are, literally, trying to convince American women that nothing has changed, and victims all will be. If the \u201cevil\u201d GOP wins, of course.\n\nThe problem for the Democrats is that women have realized the supposed feminist movement hasn\u2019t been about improving the quality of women\u2019s lives at all, but about promoting the liberal agenda, which as we see, continues to destroy everyone\u2019s quality of life.\n\nNoting the use of Ms. Steinem, in this newspaper Cheryl Chumley writes, \u201d \u2018The outcome of this election will be determined by one factor,\u2019 [Ms. Steinem] writes, in an email filtered through the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u2018Women.\u2019 The faults she slams as pure Republican: The GOP hasn\u2019t passed \u2018Equal Pay\u2019 laws and they constantly deny \u2018women their basic rights to make decisions about their own bodies,\u2019 she writes, in her email.\u201d\n\nThe irony, of course, is that same liberal agenda is on its way to destroying the very basic ability we have to control our own bodies. Obamacare not only canceled our insurance, it destroyed our ability to see our own doctors or use our preferred hospitals. Medical relationships between women and their health care providers for generations was destroyed because those same Democrats that harp about evil Republicans wanting to control your body, are actually the ones implementing an agenda that, well, controls your body.\n\nIt won\u2019t work. All they need do is look at the Colorado Senate race. Incumbent Sen. Mark Udall is trailing badly his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, after Mr. Udall\u2019s one-note campaign about women\u2019s rights. It has been viewed as pandering and so badly received in our complicated world that a Washington Post headline declared, \u201cMark Udall has been dubbed \u2018Mark Uterus\u2019 on the campaign trail. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats not only pander on the issue (while destroying our lives), they\u2019re also fielding Democratic Party women as candidates who have nothing to do with feminism and everything to do with pandering, incompetence and embarrassment.\n\nWendy Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas, is the perfect example of the fraud liberals and the so-called feminist movement are perpetrating on women nationwide.\n\nIn her race against Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, Ms. Davis illustrates the contempt liberals have for their own voters and for Americans in general. The absurdity of Ms. Davis and the Democrats as heralds for women and their concerns became even more apparent last week. On Oct. 20, Ms. Davis tweeted \u201cGreg Abbott won\u2019t say whether he\u2019d defend an interracial marriage ban \u2026 .\u201d\n\nTo use this as a base of attack is silly enough, but the more important revelation of the supposedly feminist Davis campaign is that she has never bothered to find out about Cecilia Abbott, the woman married to Ms. Davis\u2019 opponent. If they had, they would have learned about the very impressive Mrs. Abbott, who also happens to be the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants. Mr. Abbott\u2019s refusal to address a hypothetical query makes sense when you reject the nonsensical premise of your desperate opponent.\n\nDemocrats simply don\u2019t think women have minds of their own. We not only see, but live, the results of their craven, inept and corrupt policies. Obamacare is one thing, the ongoing economic stagnation that continues to drive wages down as we become an Obama part-time-job nation also makes life more difficult, whether you are a married or single woman.\n\nWe have a world on fire because of Mr. Obama\u2019s bizarre, passive allowance of tyrants to grow strong and wreak havoc. The Democrats think women care more about getting an abortion than the wars that will be fought by the loved ones and children of women, and by women themselves.\n\nSingle women have also had enough. All women must ask the question whether they\u2019re better off now than six years ago, and the answer for them, like everyone else, is a resounding no.\n\nIn fact, the latest Associated Press poll of likely female voters confirms that women are not lemmings for any political party:\n\n\u201cWomen have moved in the GOP\u2019s direction since September. In last month\u2019s AP-GfK poll, 47 percent of female likely voters said they favored a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 40 percent wanted the Republicans to capture control. In the new poll, the two parties are about even among women, 44 percent prefer the Republicans, 42 percent the Democrats \u2026 .\u201d\n\nThat is a nine-point swing in one month, and gives the GOP the edge. As voters begin to look closely at their options for the midterm elections, they reflect on how things are going. For most, including the women the Democrats have taken for granted, misled, used and lied-to, reality is trumping pandering, sloganeering and miserably inept female candidates, who are embarrassments for all of us who know what\u2019s truly possible.\n\nIn Ms. Steinem\u2019s desperate email to Democrats, she implores, \u201cThis election is our chance to show them that their relentless sexism will not stand \u2014 in fact, it will cost them their seats in Congress \u2026 .\u201d\n\nMs. Steinem is right, which is why the Democrats are losing not just the Senate, but the support of women.\n\nTammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, author and Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It looks as though the Democrats are panicking over the midterms enough that they\u2019ve called out the warhorse, Gloria Steinem.", "Author": "Tammy Bruce", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It looks as though the Democrats are panicking over the midterms enough that they\u2019ve called out the warhorse, Gloria Steinem.", "title": "TAMMY BRUCE: Democrats\u2019 phony \u2018GOP war on women\u2019 dredges up the \u201960s", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/27/tammy-bruce-democrats-phony-gop-war-women-dredges-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/24/4f48fb31d7697629630f6a706700c3ba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/24/4f48fb31d7697629630f6a706700c3ba.jpg", "title": "TAMMY BRUCE: Democrats\u2019 phony \u2018GOP war on women\u2019 dre", "description": "It looks as though the Democrats are panicking over the midterms enough that they\u2019ve called out the warhorse, Gloria Steinem.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Gloria Steinem, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd131d\"", "article_summary": "The absurdity of Ms. Davis and the Democrats as heralds for women and their concerns became even more apparent last week.\nThe Democrats think women care more about getting an abortion than the wars that will be fought by the loved ones and children of women, and by women themselves.\nNoting the use of Ms. Steinem, in this newspaper Cheryl Chumley writes, \u201d \u2018The outcome of this election will be determined by one factor,\u2019 [Ms. Steinem] writes, in an email filtered through the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nIn her race against Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, Ms. Davis illustrates the contempt liberals have for their own voters and for Americans in general.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:It looks as though the Democrats are panicking over the midterms enough that they\u2019ve called out the warhorse, Gloria Steinem."}
