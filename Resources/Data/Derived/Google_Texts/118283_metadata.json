The same coalition that asked for schools to close on Eid Ul-Adha the last few years is doing so again.\n\nBut with the deletion of all religious references from the calendar, the coalition is asking the board to declare that Eid Al-Udha a \"professional day.\" That means students would not have to report to school, but teachers would.\n\nStudents in Montgomery County already get most Christian and Jewish holidays off. Two years ago, the school system tracked the absentee rate on Eid Ul-Adha to see whether it was high enough to merit it being a holiday. It was around 5 percent, which officials ruled insufficient.\n\nMany Muslim parents argue the number isn't wholly accurate because they send their kids to class out of fear they'll fall behind on schoolwork and be punished. They say making Eid Ul-Adha a holiday \u2014 even if it isn't officially the reason \u2014 gives the Muslim community in Montgomery County a sign it is welcome.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Matt Bush", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "In 2014, Montgomery County schools removed all religious references to holidays on the official calendar, in response to controversy over demands from Muslims that schools be closed on certain Islamic", "title": "Coalition Renews Argument For Closing Montgomery County Schools On Muslim Holiday", "url": "http://wamu.org/news/15/11/06/in_montgomery_county_debate_over_religious_holidays_isnt_over_yet", "image": "http://wamu.org/sites/wamu.org/themes/wamu_dh_zen/dh/images/footer_wamu_logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "nid": 199838, "google-site-verification": "8AyE7rFVyUE7ZiqFGJ29mxnUk_L6YMXe4KHsLRUvvmQ"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd368c\"", "article_summary": "They say making Eid Ul-Adha a holiday \u2014 even if it isn't officially the reason \u2014 gives the Muslim community in Montgomery County a sign it is welcome.\nIn 2014, Montgomery County schools removed all religious references to holidays on the official calendar, in response to controversy over demands from Muslims that schools be closed on certain Islamic holidays.\nThe same coalition that asked for schools to close on Eid Ul-Adha the last few years is doing so again.\nStudents in Montgomery County already get most Christian and Jewish holidays off.\nTuesday, the county board of education will set the official calendar for the next school year."}
