The Houston Chronicle reported in an October 25, 2013 story that Sen. Ted Cruz, in a wide ranging interview, revealed that he hated avocados. This is turning out into a replay of the President George H. W. Bush hatred of broccoli in some quarters. Alison Cook, the Houston Chronicle’s food critic, has taken umbrage.

Cook admits to having hated avocados as well in her youth for the slimy, disgusting things that they are. But she admits that, after coming to Texas, she got her mind and her palate right.

“Of course, I changed my mind about avocados when I got to Texas a few years later. Avocados were ubiquitous here, and Tex-Mex restaurants softened me up with guacamole.

“Roughly mashed and zipped up with lime and onion and salt, to be scooped onto tortilla chips, avocados began to show me their charms. Once I sampled the way the insinuating herbal edge of cilantro set them off, I was pretty much hooked.

“My existential dread of the exotic fruit evaporated. Now avocados didn’t seem gruesomely soft and slimy to me, they seemed sensuous. Even opulent. Like most Houstonians, I gleefully ate them on salads, in sandwiches, in omelets, or laid like pale green-gold crescent moons onto a plateful of tacos or tostadas.”

Putting guacamole on chips (or anything at all) might seem to be eccentric, considering that Tex-Mex cuisine has so many other alternatives, such as salsa, America’s favorite condiment, and queso. But the takeaway is that Cruz cannot help but be controversial even in his food choices.
