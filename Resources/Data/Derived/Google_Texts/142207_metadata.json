In non-expansion states those figures on grew 5.1 percent and 6.1 percent respectively.\n\nIn Indiana, the state established HIP 2.0, its own modified version of a Medicaid expansion. The federal government approved that program in January, and it launched in February, attracting 18,000 applicants in the first week alone.\n\nThe state offers three different kinds of HIP 2.0 plans and has enrolled hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers in the program since its launch, and some experts say the state is on pace to match states of comparable size and eligible population.\n\n\u201cIndiana is really reflective of what we\u2019re seeing nationally,\u201d Covering Kids and Families of Indiana spokesperson Caitlin Priest says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an immediate, sustained uptake into HIP 2.o, and that\u2019s layered over the immediate, sustained entrance into the ACA Marketplace plan. Altogether, we have a really robust pool of Hoosiers who are entering the insurance marketplace for the first time.\u201d\n\nPriest says recent estimates anticipate enrollment levels will taper \u2014 the Kaisier study also expects Medicaid spending and enrollment to taper in 2016, too, predicting a 4 percent increase in enrollment and a 6.9 percent increase in spending \u2014 but by the end of open enrollment in 2016, Priest says nearly 10 million Americans will be covered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPriest says as more individuals become insured, long-term health care costs should decline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act meant record increases in Medicaid enrollment and spending nationwide in the 2015 fiscal year.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "The expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act meant record increases in Medicaid enrollment and spending nationwide in the 2015 fiscal year.", "title": "Medicaid Enrollment, Spending Reached Record Levels In 2015 | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/medicaid-88553/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/02-06-2012-HealthCare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/02-06-2012-HealthCare.jpg", "description": "The expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act meant record increases in Medicaid enrollment and spending nationwide in the 2015 fiscal year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Medicaid Enrollment, Spending Reached Record Levels In 2015"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nationwide Medicaid enrollment and spending saw record increases in the 2015 fiscal year thanks to the expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act.\nPhoto: Bill Shaw/Indiana Public Media News The study found overall enrollment and spending each jumped an average of 14 percent.\nIn the 29 states that elected to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, growth in enrollment was 18 percent and growth in spending was 17.7 percent.\nThe study found overall enrollment and spending each jumped an average of 14 percent.\nIn Indiana, the state established HIP 2.0, its own modified version of a Medicaid expansion."}
