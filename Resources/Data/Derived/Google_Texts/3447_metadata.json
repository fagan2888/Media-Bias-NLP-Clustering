Many of the earthquakes experienced since 2009, the U.S. Geological Survey noted, occurred near injection wells, which are used to dispose of wastewater from fracking. Earlier this month, a study published in the journal Science supported the connection, linking over 100 earthquakes experienced in the state to just four wells.\n\nThe AP has the scoop on the weekend\u2019s seismic activity, which saw seven quakes over two days:\n\nSunday\u2019s quakes ranged from magnitude 2.6 to 2.9 and were centered in the Guthrie, Jones and Langston areas, 15 miles to 30 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. The USGS said the quakes were recorded between 7:57 p.m. Saturday and 9:51 a.m. Sunday. No injuries or damage were reported. Those follow four other quakes, including a 4.3-magnitude temblor near Langston recorded shortly after noon Saturday. The other Saturday morning quakes ranged in magnitude from 2.9 to 3.2.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Record-shattering seismic activity linked to drilling is turning the state into the new California", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Record-shattering seismic activity linked to drilling is turning the state into the new California", "title": "Swarms of earthquakes continue to rock frack-happy Oklahoma", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/swarms_of_earthquakes_continue_to_rock_frack_happy_oklahoma/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_98836256.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Record-shattering seismic activity linked to drilling is turning the state into the new California", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_98836256.jpg", "title": "Swarms of earthquakes continue to rock frack-happy Oklahoma", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Swarms of earthquakes continue to rock frack-happy Oklahoma", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Earthquakes, fracking, frackquakes, Oklahoma, usgs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e6b\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this month, a study published in the journal Science supported the connection, linking over 100 earthquakes experienced in the state to just four wells.\nMany of the earthquakes experienced since 2009, the U.S. Geological Survey noted, occurred near injection wells, which are used to dispose of wastewater from fracking.\nThe other Saturday morning quakes ranged in magnitude from 2.9 to 3.2.\nTopics: Earthquakes, fracking, frackquakes, Oklahoma, usgs, Sustainability News, NewsOklahoma, which will heretofore be referred to as \u201cthe new California,\u201d is continuing to undergo a spike in earthquake activity, experiencing another swarm of tremors in an incredibly short period of time.\nThe USGS said the quakes were recorded between 7:57 p.m. Saturday and 9:51 a.m. Sunday."}
