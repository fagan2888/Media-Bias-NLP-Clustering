Though it originally started with religious undertones in the 19th century, in the modern day and age, it\u2019s a good way to remember how we can improve health care access and immunization for kids in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Childstats.gov, there are some 74 million people under the age of 18 in the U.S., and nine million \u2014 or 12 percent \u2014 of those kids are uninsured. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that there are about 6.6 percent of children who lack health insurance, while 3.8 percent of kids don\u2019t have \u201ca usual source of health care.\u201d The CDC also notes that the most common forms of death for children between 1 and 14 years of age are accidents, congenital malformations/deformations, or chromosomal abnormalities. Cancer is also on that list.\n\nAs kids grow and develop, it\u2019s essential to send them to the doctor for regular check-ups in order to catch any issues at the start. \u201cThe health of children depends at least partially on their access to health services,\u201d the 2013 Key National Indicators of Well-Being report states. Simple things that parents can regularly monitor include any significant weight gain or loss, sleep problems, fevers, rashes, or breathing problems.\n\nVaccinating your kids is also critical to their development and overall health. The same 2013 Well-Being data state that about 78 percent of children aged 19 to 35 months had received the six-vaccine series, but children living in families who were below the poverty level had less of a chance to be vaccinated. Vaccination among children aged 13 to 17 years has increased since 2006, but \u201ccoverage with vaccines recommended at 11 or 12 years of age remains low, especially for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine,\u201d the report says.\n\nOn its website, the CDC lists the recommended vaccines for children ages 0 to 18 as the Hepatitis B, rotavirus, tetanus and diphtheria, pneumococcal, poliovirus, and influenza vaccines, among others.\n\nNational Children\u2019s Day was first conceived by Reverend Charles H. Leonard, a pastor of a First Universalist church in Massachusetts, in 1856. The original Children\u2019s Day was a religious one: it was meant to set aside a Sunday to dedicate kids to Christianity, and to remind parents to raise their kids piously. Today, make National Children\u2019s Day a reminder to get your kids vaccinated, and to get checked up at the doctor and dentist.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "national children's day, vaccination, children's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Though National Children\u2019s Day may have originated with religious purposes, today it\u2019s a good time to educate yourself on children\u2019s issues in the U.S. and around the world.", "title": "National Children\u2019s Day 2014: A Reminder To Keep Kids Healthy, Vaccinated", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-childrens-day-2014-importance-keeping-our-kids-healthy-and-vaccinated-287064", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/07/childrens-day.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though National Children\u2019s Day may have originated with religious purposes, today it\u2019s a good time to educate yourself on children\u2019s issues in the U.S. and around the world.", "title": "National Children\u2019s Day 2014: A Reminder To Keep Kids Healthy, Vaccinated", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-childrens-day-2014-importance-keeping-our-kids-healthy-and-vaccinated-287064", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/07/childrens-day.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/07/childrens-day.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-07T15:06:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-07T15:06:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Though National Children\u2019s Day may have originated with religious purposes, today it\u2019s a good time to educate yourself on children\u2019s issues in the U.S. and around the world."}, "article_summary": "Today, make National Children\u2019s Day a reminder to get your kids vaccinated, and to get checked up at the doctor and dentist.\nYou may not have known that it exists, but there is a National Children\u2019s Day.\nNational Children\u2019s Day was first conceived by Reverend Charles H.
