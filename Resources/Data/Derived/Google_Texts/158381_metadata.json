Tweets suggested that we had played matters too \u201csafe\u201d and ended up with a beta-hunters list rather than a truly alpha-oriented compendium. Well \u2026 we\u2019re happy our critics are paying attention, though we have no idea whether they\u2019ll be any happier with this list than they were with that one.\n\nSo we move forward. This year\u2019s big stories read a bit as if Sheldon Cooper had decided to make a splash in the world of alternative investments. They are about statistics, algorithms, and some basic science. Though since the basic science involved in the first tem below is biology rather than physics, we should perhaps have invoked Amy Farrah-Fowler rather than Sheldon. But let us proceed.\n\nExcitement in Biopharm\n\nThese are exciting times in the world of basic biological/medical research. They\u2019ve been exciting at least since the completion of the map of the human genome in 2003, when attention turned to what can be done with that map.\n\nAt almost the same moment in those early years of a new millennium enterprising people and institutions invented the \u201cgene chip,\u201d a glass slide containing thousands of DNA sequences in an ordered array. The chip zeroes in on the sequences that do particular jobs, abstracting a particular geological class of mountain form the broader \u201cmap,\u201d so to speak.\n\nThe take-off of science in this area has interacted with a lot of other developments, including a regulatory version of arterial sclerosis, and a build-up of the cost management pressures attending the world of Obamacare. All this has given us a hedge fund tug-of-war over Clovis Oncology, the meteoric career of Martin Shkreli, and much more.\n\nAutomation, Dapps, etc.\n\nThough the theme this year is ascent of the nerds, we are compelled to mention two stories where the nerds seem to have fallen short. We reported back in March that block chains as a technology had gone far beyond bitcoins or other decentralized currencies, rendering possible robot-like corporations in the process, and we cited some speculation as to how the law may have to follow where this trend was headed.\n\nAlas, though, anyone working on bringing those robot corporations into reality has had a slow year since.\n\nMaidsafe, a \u201cmassive array of internet disks\u201d designed to give greater privacy/security than users of the Google/Facebook dominated internet have come to expect, hosts a blog devoted to the innovative uses of block chains. But the recent blog entries there have indicated little forward momentum. They have been, instead, tedious discussions of terminology: what exactly is a \u201cdecentralized\u201d network and how does it differ from a \u201cdistributed\u201d network? That sort of thing.\n\nMaybe there isn\u2019t a lot of money to be made there. Just now, anyway. Let\u2019s move along.\n\nDubious Claims about Black Swans\n\nThe year just passed also saw news that might confirm the theory that every revolution leaves much unchanged, that \u201cthe fundamental things apply as time goes by.\u201d\n\nOn August 28 a story appeared in The Wall Street Journal asserting that Universa Investments LP had just made $1 billion on the bad news from China, which had spiked volatility and fattened the tails of black swans everywhere. That $1 billion seemed a very practical bottom-line confirmation of the long-anticipated fractal revolution in finance. King Gauss was dead, long live King Mandelbrot!\n\nHere the real story is that the story was wrong. Further, much the same claim had been made, and had unraveled in much the same way, in 2009. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice\u2026.\n\nYes, there is a strong case to be made that the standard model has long understated risks, because the bell curve doesn\u2019t describe the distribution of financial outcomes properly. The safest conclusion from efforts to replace that model with anew equally actionable alternative is that this is doable but it isn\u2019t really scalable. So \u2026 black swan funds are here to stay, but talk of billion dollar overnight payoffs will remain just talk. Until of course, inflation proceeds to the point at which a \u201cbillion\u201d means a good deal less than it does.\n\nBig Dogs Make Big Bets on Big Data\n\nAfter two items on dogs that didn\u2019t bark, or that were wrongly thought to have barked, we get to return to actual canines making actual noise.\n\nThe year 2015 witnessed Silver Lake\u2019s $1 billion purchase of convertible senior notes of Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) payable in five years. The deal also involves the arrival of two Silver Lake managing partners as directors of MSI. Silver Lake is barking up a very specific tree within the forest of Big Data, the market for law-enforcement analytics.\n\nThe chart at the top of this entry shows MSI\u2019s stock price through the year ending December 24, 2015. The big drop at the beginning of April indicates investor frustration when MSI gave up on its efforts to find a buyer and instead became a buyer, acquiring PublicEngines, a privately-held provider of prescriptive-policing data.\n\nThough as you can see the market\u2019s reaction to the deal was unenthusiastic, MSI continued its own acquisitive course, entering into a partnership with New Zealand\u2019s Wynyard Group on June, thus acquiring software that will help Motorola\u2019s own services connect the dots, as a press release put it, among \u201cmultiple databases and evidence libraries to help investigators quickly prevent and solve crime.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this deal making and the new focus on crime-solving data, MSI in the summer had started showing growth momentum with the release of its second quarter results. Silver Lake\u2019s investment was a natural response to this successful turn-around.\n\nOf course there is much more to Big Bata than Big Policework. But the one can serve as a synecdoche of the other.\n\nConsolidation of the Chemical Industry\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll mention the consolidation of the chemical industry. This has been a multi-year trend, but it drew our attention in mid-year when Platform Specialty bought Alent for $2.3 billion, and with the blessing of activist investor Cevian Cap.\n\nThen our interest in that matter seemed almost quaint when the year went out with a real chem-industry bang, the proposed merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont, a deal which is in large part the consequence of pressure from alpha seeker Nelson Peltz.\n\nAsia is driving deal volumes in chem industry M&A. That continent represents more than 42% of the merger activity in this market. This dominance derives in part from China\u2019s need to reduce air pollution and in the process, to improve the efficiency of its industrial processes.\n\nLooking at this market by segments: both specialty chemicals and the fertilizer & ag segment showed a lot of merger activity in 2015, Low commodity process could be driving the moves in the latter of those, and those same low prices are a factor in the Dow/DuPont announcement.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd75dc\"", "article_summary": "This year\u2019s big stories read a bit as if Sheldon Cooper had decided to make a splash in the world of alternative investments.\nThe year 2015 witnessed Silver Lake\u2019s $1 billion purchase of convertible senior notes of Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) payable in five years.\nAll this has given us a hedge fund tug-of-war over Clovis Oncology, the meteoric career of Martin Shkreli, and much more.\nSo \u2026 black swan funds are here to stay, but talk of billion dollar overnight payoffs will remain just talk.\nWe\u2019re happy to observe, as preface to this year\u2019s version, that our list received some social media push-back last year."}
