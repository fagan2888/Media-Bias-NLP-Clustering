Born in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, Ortega's father earned 300 pesetas a month, a meager salary.\n\nOrtega's biographer described his memories of a childhood during which his family could not always afford enough food. He left school in his early teens, working his way up from the absolute bottom rung as a messenger boy in a shop.\n\nIt wasn't until he was 40 years old that Ortega got around to setting up Zara, the fast-fashion retailer that has gone from strength to strength \u2014 first growing in Spain, then neighbouring Portugal and France, then London. Now it's all over the globe.\n\nRelated: How Zuckerberg Could Become the Richest Person on the Planet\n\nAccording to Forbes, Ortega's wealth rose by 5.3%, another $4 billion, over the last 24 hours. That's partly down to a surge in Inditex shares, the parent company that owns Zara.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the market value of Inditex has risen by about 570%, the main driver of Ortega's climb up the ranks.\n\nIn an odd turn of events, Ortega has Mario Draghi to thank for his new rank \u2014 the head of the European Central Bank's hints that the ECB would boost its quantitative-easing programme on Thursday sent shares in the eurozone surging upwards.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.
