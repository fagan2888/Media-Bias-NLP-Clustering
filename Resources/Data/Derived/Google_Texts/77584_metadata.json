The simple use of a username and a password is pretty convenient not only to users, but also to others with ill-motives of accessing private data.\n\nHackers can easily take advantage of weak passwords or gullible individuals through brute force attacks and phishing scams. This is why passwords are now slowly becoming obsolete as cyber criminals are getting better at their craft. We can see this in the latest wave of celebrity hackings that shocked the world.\n\nWindows 10 provides answers to the hacking problem that\u2019s been plaguing the cyber world with two new features that epitomize Bill Gate\u2019s 2004 prediction of the password\u2019s death. The latest version of the premiere operating system from Microsoft introduces the Windows Hello and the Microsoft Passport.\n\nThe Windows Hello eliminates authentication via keyboard encryption. This new security feature makes use of the biometric authentication, wherein users can gain access just by scanning their fingerprints, iris, or faces.\n\nHowever, the usage of Windows Hello will require specialized hardware for the assurance of effectiveness. For example, for facial recognition to take effect, the Intel RealSense 3D camera will have to be installed on the user\u2019s PC, smartphone, or tablet. The camera uses the similar complex imaging technology in Xbox\u2019s Kinect, wherein there is little to no chance of bypassing the security by merely scanning a photo of the user\u2019s face.\n\nMicrosoft Passport will then ensure the security of how users sign-in. Passport eliminates the process of storing authentication information, such as passwords, in servers that hackers can potentially breach. Instead, two-factor authentication will take place, wherein Passport will authenticate to networks, apps, and websites on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nMicrosoft announced that Passport will work with a Microsoft Account, Microsoft Azure Active Directory account, Active Directory account, or other non-Microsoft services that support Fast ID Online (FIDO) authentication. The users will be able to access their PC or other desired applications after using Windows Hello or a simple PIN for authentication.\n\nThe giant technology company will be in affiliation with FIDO alliance to successfully achieve the goal of replacing the use of passwords with a more secure form of authentication.\n\n[RoSonic / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The introduction of Windows 10 may very well be the first step into the new age of online security and authentication where we will no longer be need passwords", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The introduction of Windows 10 may very well be the first step into the new age of online security and authentication where we will no longer be need passwords", "title": "Windows 10 At The Helm Of The Anti-Password Revolution", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2316123/windows-10-at-the-helm-of-the-anti-password-revolution/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Windows-10-Passwords.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T07:12:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-08T07:53:22+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Windows-10-Passwords.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-08-08T07:12:31+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "anti-password,internet privacy,internet security,password,windows 10,technology", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Windows-10-Passwords.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The introduction of Windows 10 may very well be the first step into the new age of online security and authentication where we will no longer be need passwords"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2621\"", "article_summary": "The latest version of the premiere operating system from Microsoft introduces the Windows Hello and the Microsoft Passport.\nHowever, the usage of Windows Hello will require specialized hardware for the assurance of effectiveness.\nThe Windows Hello eliminates authentication via keyboard encryption.\nThe users will be able to access their PC or other desired applications after using Windows Hello or a simple PIN for authentication.\nMicrosoft announced that Passport will work with a Microsoft Account, Microsoft Azure Active Directory account, Active Directory account, or other non-Microsoft services that support Fast ID Online (FIDO) authentication."}
