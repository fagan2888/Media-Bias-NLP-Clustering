The piece, while not the most damning example of McCrimmon\u2019s reporting, did not bring great news about Colorado\u2019s health insurance exchange, once a poster child for the state marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act. About 140,000 people had signed up for private health insurance through the exchange at the close of open enrollment\u2014a number that, as McCrimmon explained using a table showing the exchange\u2019s own projections, was \u201cfar below\u201d the lowest official estimate of sign-ups for the full year. Even if sign-ups continue at the same monthly rate as in 2014, she noted, enrollment will fall toward the lower end of official projections. The numbers may be cause for worry because enrollment fees will finance most of the exchange operations in coming years\u2014strong sign-up numbers are crucial for its solvency.\n\nUntil the last few weeks, McCrimmon has been all but alone in chronicling these and other concerns at the exchange. Other news outlets contributed stories now and then, but that coverage hardly rocked the boat. (Consider, for example, the Denver Post story on open enrollment signups, which totaled four paragraphs in print, six online). Ellen Daenhick, a former health exchange board member, told me that when she joined the board in 2013, a top exchange employee advised her not to talk \u201cto that blogger Katie McCrimmon.\u201d A look at some of McCrimmon\u2019s tough reporting shows why.\n\nOne of McCrimmon\u2019s 2012 pieces, as the exchange was revving up\u2014headlined \u201cColorado\u2019s exchange progressing, but IT problems loom\u201d\u2014has proved prophetic. As the second open enrollment period moved along in late 2014 and early this year, system glitches hampered those tasked with signing up new customers. The promise to operate lean and mean has turned out to be just a promise: In January, McCrimmon told readers the exchange was costing a lot more than anticipated and managers were asking the board for more emergency funds to cover IT cost overruns. The call center, McCrimmon wrote in November, is costing millions more than planned. Last summer, McCrimmon reported the exchange had spent nearly $7 million on a navigator network that had managed to sign up only 8,000 people for private insurance. (Many more signed up for Medicaid and the state\u2019s children\u2019s health plan.) And in December, McCrimmon summarized the report of a state audit that \u201cuncovered more than $32 million in problematic spending of federal tax dollars and possible illegal use of tax money to pay for barred activities such as lobbying and marketing.\u201d The legislature is deciding whether to authorize a new, more expansive audit, she told me.\n\nThe critical thrust of the reporting has often led to pushback, especially from Onsight Public Affairs, a Denver-based PR firm hired by the exchange. Onsight\u2019s Curtis Hubbard, onetime editoral page editor of The Denver Post, is frequently quoted in McCrimmon\u2019s work as the voice of the exchange\u2014and frequently pushes back on her reporting, challenging the framing and sometimes the facts. Soon after McCrimmon\u2019s Feb. 19 story was published, for example, Hubbard complained to Health News Colorado editor Diane Carman, Carman told me in a phone interview, wanting her to change the headline and lead of the story. \u201cThe pressure has been to edit our content just because they didn\u2019t like it,\u201d said Carman, who described regular \u201cdemands for corrections\u201d as an effort to intimidate. When I put these complaints to Hubbard, he told me by email that Onsight\u2019s \u201cstrategy has been to work with [Health News Colorado] to provide the correct information prior to publication and to reach out to correct errors when they are published.\u201d He added that Onsight also \u201creach[es] out\u201d to organizations that share Health News Colorado\u2019s content \u201cto alert them to what we consider errors.\u201d (It\u2019s worth noting that in 2013, McCrimmon wrote about the exchange\u2019s $118,000 \u201cPR tab\u201d from Onsight for \u201cadvice that included discouraging members of the oversight board from talking about the exchange as it launched.\u201d)\n\nBy McCrimmon and Carman\u2019s count, Health News Colorado has run three corrections (here, here, and here) and two editor\u2019s notes on her exchange reporting over four years. She describes the pushback from Onsight this way: \u201cWith every single story I wrote, they claimed there were errors or the implications were negative. They challenged every single story, so I buckled down and instead of walking away, I started covering [the exchange] more.\u201d\n\nRecently, other Colorado outlets have started to cover the exchange more, too. In January, Brandon Rittiman, a political reporter for KUSA, Denver\u2019s NBC affiliate, jumped into the mix and broke important news: The exchange had cancelled policies of Coloradans that were supposed to be automatically renewed, leaving them with gaps in coverage. A design flaw in the system caused the exchange to cancel up to 3,600 plans of policyholders who had browsed other policies while logged in to the exchange. \u201cThe exchange\u2019s overarching message was they knew about this, the system was designed this way, but they never thought it would be a problem,\u201d Rittiman told me.\n\nIn mid-February, he uncovered another glitch, this time reporting the exchange was combining some applicants\u2019 incomes from last year and this year, meaning many would qualify for lower subsidies than they were entitled to. Rittiman has reported the exchange doesn\u2019t know how many people were affected, but officials insist the glitch has been fixed. \u201cI don\u2019t see any effort on the part of the exchange or the state to proactively help these people,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens deserve to know who is responsible for the system that\u2019s caused this latest glitch. It\u2019s a question we still haven\u2019t gotten an answer to.\u201d (Rittiman has not encountered substantial pushback from the exchange, he told me.)\n\nThese are important examples of the media\u2019s role in holding government agencies accountable, a task that has become increasingly difficult for journalists. At Health News Colorado, the reporting \u201chas taken a lot of guts on Katie\u2019s part. They\u2019ve tried to undermine her reputation, but she doesn\u2019t give up or back away,\u201d says Carman. The editor says both she and McCrimmon are \u201csupportive of the whole concept\u201d of the ACA, and \u201cit takes some discipline to go after an agency you want to see succeed. But the fact is that\u2019s our job.\u201d The tough reporting in Colorado stands out among the cheerleading that has defined much Obamacare coverage for too long.\n\n\n\nLove news about local news?
