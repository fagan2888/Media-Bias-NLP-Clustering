Anthony Quintano CC BY 2.0\n\nOn this day last year, Chris Kennedy dumped a bucket of ice water over his head, uploaded the clip to YouTube, and started a phenomenon.\n\nMore than 17 million people participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge, which saw participants fill up a bucket (or helicopter, pool, bathtub, anything really) full of ice and water, dump the contents over themselves, then nominate their family or friends to do the same. Celebrities, athletes, scientists, and more joined in. Everyone was dumping ice and water on themselves and posting it all over the Internet.\n\nOnce the dust had settled and the ice had melted, the Ice Bucket Challenge was a complete success. Instead of just dumping the water on your head and showing off to your friends, the original concept of the challenge was to raise money and awareness for ALS. Plenty of people found themselves dumping the ice and moving on, but even more people donated to the cause of finding a cure.\n\nTwo-and-a-half million Americans donated $115 million to the ALS Association alone. The association said it was the largest episode of giving outside of a disaster or emergency. The most interesting thing about all the donated money was how it was going to be divvied up between all the organizations striving to fight against ALS.\n\nA year later, the ALS Association says it has spent or budgeted about 40 percent of the donations toward specific purposes. It has a goal, however, to divide the remaining $115 million into five buckets.\n\nThe ALS Association is saying how they plan to divide up the $155 million during last year's Ice Bucket Challenge ALS Association", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ice, bucket, challenge, one, year, later, whered, all, money, go", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The ALS Association has shown how it's going to spread out the $115 million donated during the Ice Bucket Challenge.", "title": "Where'd All The Money From The Ice Bucket Challenge Go?
