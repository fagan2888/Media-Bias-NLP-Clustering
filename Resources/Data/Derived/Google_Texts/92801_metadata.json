The United States was ranked ninth by the report.\n\nThis from the the Economist\u2018s second Quality of Death Index, which measures and ranks the effectiveness of palliative care in 80 different countries based on factors such as the environment of care facilities, human resources, affordability of care, quality of care, and \u201ccommunity engagement.\u201d\n\nThe UK also ranked number one when the Index was first published in 2010\u2014both times, the Economist cited the country\u2019s integration of hospice care into the national health care system, \u201ccomprehensive national policies,\u201d and a high level of public engagement with the cause. Other significant factors that contributed to the effectiveness of end-of-life care, according to the report, include access to opioids (i.e. morphine) for pain alleviation, availability of psychological support and end-of-life conversations, and nationally subsidized palliative care.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, spots on the \u2018Top Ten Places To Die\u2019 list are mostly filled by high-income nations, including Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Belgium, Taiwan, Germany, Netherlands, the U.S., and France. The list resembles the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s overall ranking of health care systems by country for 2014.\n\nStill, a select number of low-income countries have managed to make huge advances in palliative care in recent years. In Mongolia, for example, which is 28th in the Index, an effort to build a national end-of-life care system, make generic opioids available, and educate health care and social workers on palliative care has taken off in just the past 15 years, thanks to an effort by Dr. Odontuya Davaasuren, who in 2000 established the Mongolian Palliative Care Society. Panama ranks 31st, largely due to the establishment of a national palliative care system in 2010.\n\nAs for the United States, the report notes that the system for delivering palliative care is \u201copen and transparent, but not universally affordable,\u201d adding that \u201cthe number of specialists falls short of patient needs. There is only one palliative medicine physician for every 1,200 terminally ill patients.\u201d On a more positive note, it suggests that the Affordable Care Act may improve matters as the national healthcare focus shifts \u201cfrom fee-for-service reimbursement towards a focus on population health, team-based approaches to care and shared assumption of financial risk.\u201d\n\nOverall, the report pointed to a global shortage of adequate care for people in their final stages of life. Of the 80 countries included, only 34 attained above-average \u201cquality of death\u201d scores on the index\u2014the suggestion being: about 85% of the world\u2019s population still lacks access to the resources needed to help them die well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The UK is the best place to receive palliative care, according to The Economist's 2015 Quality of Death Index.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "But it sits on a fairly short list", "title": "The UK Is The Number One Place To Die Well", "url": "http://time.com/money/4064642/quality-of-death-index-united-kingdom/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/151007_em_uktodie.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/151007_em_uktodie.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "But it sits on a fairly short list", "site": "MONEY", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The UK Is The Number One Place To Die Well"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": "quality of death index, uk, palliative care, end of life, best places to die, places to die well", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "quality of death index, UK, palliative care, end of life, best places to die, places to die well"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bdf\"", "article_summary": "Panama ranks 31st, largely due to the establishment of a national palliative care system in 2010.\nThe list resembles the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s overall ranking of health care systems by country for 2014.\nOther significant factors that contributed to the effectiveness of end-of-life care, according to the report, include access to opioids (i.e.\nGiven the reputation of British cuisine, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the hospital food is helping\u2014but according to the Economist\u2019s Intelligence Unit, Great Britain is the best country in the world to receive end-of-life care.\nStill, a select number of low-income countries have managed to make huge advances in palliative care in recent years."}
