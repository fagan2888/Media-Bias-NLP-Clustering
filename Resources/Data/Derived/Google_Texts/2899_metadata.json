And Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz let loose one of his biggest howls, tweeting:\n\n\"Net Neutrality\" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government. \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014\n\nCruz really really does not like net neutrality. His stance is predictable, when you consider who is in favor of a neutral net: \u201cnearly every pro-consumer organization on Earth, including the Consumers Union and Common Cause. Also, the creators of the Internet (including Vinton Cerf) and the Web (including Tim Berners-Lee). And every true believer in free speech, innovation and the American way,\u201d as David Pogue wrote for Scientific American on March 18.\n\nAlso making Cruz\u2019s stance predictable is the President\u2019s support for net neutrality. If O\n\nbama said that breathing is important for life, Cruz would probably announce his eternal hostility to the tyranny of respiration. And so, in his latest verbal bomb toss, Cruz has compared net neutrality to that most infamous rightwing bugaboo: ObamaCare.\n\nStill, Ted Cruz almost has a point. Net neutrality does have some superficial similarities with ObamaCare.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act exists because the healthcare system is broken. Big corporations\u2014insurance companies\u2014were taking advantage of patients by denying coverage or charging ridiculous sums for preexisting conditions. And tens of millions had no insurance at all. Something had to be done.\n\nLiberals proposed government oversight to at least begin to level the playing field. And many millions of people who formerly were uninsured now have access to affordable health care coverage. Republicans pushed back, arguing that the insurance market might not be perfect, but it\u2019s the best system that we\u2019ve got. Big government will only make things worse.\n\nThe net neutrality lobby exists because the Internet is soon to be broken. Big corporations\u2014like Comcast and Verizon\u2014are trying to take advantage of consumers by denying broadband access, charging exorbitant sums for faster Internet speeds by creating a multi-tiered access system. Something has to be done.\n\nAgain, liberals have proposed government oversight. They want to empower the feds, through the FCC, to maintain the mostly level playing field that the Internet has been from its inception. Republicans are pushing back, arguing that the Internet might not be perfect, but it\u2019s the best system that we\u2019ve got. And big government will only make the \u201cit\u2019s not a big truck, it\u2019s a series of tubes\u201d worse.\n\nSo Ted Cruz is not completely out in left field. Well, in his case, deep right field. Net neutrality has a resemblance to Obamacare in that both systems aim to provide the most affordable, most comprehensive coverage to the most people. And, naturally, both systems come at a cost\u2014bigger government.\n\nWhile you're mulling that over, check out this Net Neutrality breakdown on The Oatmeal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama announced his support Monday for net neutrality.
