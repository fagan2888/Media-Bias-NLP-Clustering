She did two things that the men who were once front-runners have had a hard time doing: She bested Donald Trump in a tussle and she used her answers to set herself apart from the pack.\n\nJohn Dickerson John Dickerson is a Slate political columnist, the moderator of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, and author of On Her Trail. Read his series on the presidency and on risk.\n\n\n\nThe second GOP debate touched on issues from pot legalization to gun rights to how to defeat ISIS. And there were plenty of side moments. Jeb Bush and Trump debated whether the real estate magnate had tried to open a casino in Florida; Bush defended his wife; Ben Carson and Trump exchanged views on vaccinations; Fiorina spoke of burying a child who had died of drug addiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFor Republican voters the 11 candidate lineup represented the challenge of this campaign: so much to choose from, and little help winnowing the field. If anything, the choice is now harder. Every candidate had a moment they can promote, though some\u2014like Fiorina, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Gov. Chris Christie\u2014did better than others.\n\nFor Republican voters, the 11-candidate lineup represented a challenge: so much to choose from, and little help winnowing the field.\n\nFiorina\u2019s first success came when she gave an answer that combined the issues of Planned Parenthood and the recent nuclear deal with Iran. \u201cOne has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation.\u201d (Though her story about Planned Parenthood was misleading).\n\nThe substance of the answer would please anti-abortion conservatives, and the way Fiorina delivered it suggested she was confident in herself. Even on small issues, her answers suggested someone who had some convictions. When asked what woman she would put on the $10 bill, she said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change the $10 bill, or the $20 bill. I think, honestly, it\u2019s a gesture. I don\u2019t think it helps to change our history. What I would think is that we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group. Women are the majority of this nation. We are half the potential of this nation, and this nation will be better off when every woman has the opportunity to live the life she chooses.\u201d\n\nBush and Gov. Scott Walker, by contrast, never conveyed the same sense of ownership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe loudest applause of the evening came when Fiorina responded to Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about her face in Rolling Stone. Trump subsequently said that he was referring to her persona, so Fiorina was asked to offer an opinion about Trump\u2019s persona. \u201cYou know it\u2019s interesting to me. Mr. Trump said he heard Mr. Bush very clearly about what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d\n\nWhat was telling about her remark is that it was made on the fly. She was referring to something that Trump had said just moments before. She had to know this was going to come up, but she didn\u2019t give some prepackaged answer. She improvised. That probably added to the strong reaction she got after the face-off. (Or, as Trump would say, the \u201cpersona-off.\u201d) After the audience went nuts, Trump tried to make good by saying, \u201cI think she\u2019s got a beautiful face and I think she\u2019s a beautiful woman.\u201d (No one was buying that.)\n\nThat was not the only moment that Trump was on his heels. At the start of the debate everyone ganged up on the Donald. What may have hurt him the most wasn\u2019t when he was in the thick of the fight, but when he was silent. For a long stretch, when the candidates engaged in a somewhat specific discussion of the issues, he disappeared. Trump\u2019s answers were highly general and when things got specific he showed no interest in jumping in. When he talked about Syria, his answer went in circles. Could it be possible that what hurts Trump is not what he has said, but when he has nothing much to say?\n\nUp until now every candidate but Fiorina who has attacked Trump has fallen in the polls. In Wednesday night\u2019s debate it felt like everyone could attack Trump, and it wouldn't necessarily hurt their standing\u2014perhaps because the discussions were more rooted in policy this time around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRubio made the most of these policy debates. He was specific and forceful when talking about Syria and the threat of global terrorism. His strongest moment came when he made the case for foreign policy expertise, in light of Trump\u2019s assertion that he could just learn quickly on the job. \u201cYou had better be able to lead our country on the first day,\u201d said Rubio. \u201cNot six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You can\u2019t predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it. ... One thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.\u201d\n\nRubio also shined at the tail end of a back and forth between Trump and Bush on Trump\u2019s claim that Bush shouldn\u2019t speak Spanish. Rubio defended speaking the language and told the story of his grandfather\u2014an immigrant from Cuba\u2014who came to love America, and conservatism, and pass both loves on to Rubio. \u201cHe taught me that in Spanish. Because that was the language he was most comfortable in,\u201d Rubio said. He said he spoke Spanish to current-day immigrants to reach them: \u201cIf they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me, not from a translator at Univision.\u201d It was a moment that Bush was trying to exploit, but Rubio delivered.\n\nChristie played to the high road from the very start. In his opening statement he said the cameras should not focus on him but the audience, arguing that the debate wasn\u2019t about him but America. (All appeals to humility feel like they\u2019re aimed at Trump.) Later, as Trump and Fiorina got into a standoff over their business histories, Christie called them out for bickering.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m as entertained as anyone by this personal back and forth about the history of Donald and Carly\u2019s career,\u201d Christie said after Fiorina had brought up Trump\u2019s bankruptcies and Trump had dissed her tenure as a CEO. \u201c[But] for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight, who doesn\u2019t have a job, who can\u2019t fund his child\u2019s education, I got to tell you the truth, they could care less about your careers, they care about theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s start talking about that on this stage and stop playing the games.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nChristie wasn\u2019t the only one to make this point. CNN had decided to allow the candidates to mix it up and that led to much bickering. To get airtime, candidates like Christie, Kasich, and Mike Huckabee appealed to the high road, claiming that the bickering did nothing for regular people.\n\nBush and Walker were more in evidence in this debate than they were in the first one\u2014that\u2019s not a high bar\u2014but they are not likely to be in the conversation much as the debate highlights are passed around on Facebook. Bush\u2019s best moment came when he defended his brother after Trump criticized him. \u201cHe kept us safe,\u201d Bush said to big applause. Jeb showed some conviction in defense of his brother, which made for good theater, but it probably would have been better if it had been on a policy position or idea rather than that complicated issue of family relations. At one point during the immigration debate it seemed like Bush was on the cusp of using his policy dispute with Trump to show this passion and distinguish himself, but there wasn\u2019t much intensity.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Carly Fiorina impressed the crowd, while Donald Trump got lost in it.", "fb-share": "Carly Fiorina did the most to help her campaign in the three-hour CNN Iron Man debate.", "sailthru.author": "John Dickerson", "description": "Carly Fiorina did the most to help her campaign in the three-hour CNN Iron Man debate.
