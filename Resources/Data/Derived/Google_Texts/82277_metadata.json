And, why is that important? That\u2019s important because we are in a national competition to attract and retain the best talent,\u201d notes Tom Bacon, chairman of the Houston Parks Board Chairman, which is in charge of the project, in collaboration with the City of Houston\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation and the Harris County Flood Control District.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Dr Stephen Klineberg says Houston has been reinventing itself for the 21st century.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Dr Stephen Klineberg says Houston has been reinventing itself for the 21st century.", "title": "The Houston Area Survey Has Highlighted Important Topics In Over 30 Years Of Research | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/04/17/145520/the-houston-area-survey-has-highlighted-important-topics-in-over-30-years-of-research/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15162109/klineberg-bilboard.jpg", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15162109/klineberg-bilboard.jpg", "height": 667, "width": 1000, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15162109/klineberg-bilboard.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 474565841, "twitter": {"description": "Dr Stephen Klineberg says Houston has been reinventing itself for the 21st century.", "title": "The Houston Area Survey Has Highlighted Important Topics In Over 30 Years Of Research", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/04/17/145520/the-houston-area-survey-has-highlighted-important-topics-in-over-30-years-of-research/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15162109/klineberg-bilboard.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Al Ortiz", "wordCount": 508, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-04-17T06:00:54+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "stephen klineberg", "published_time": "2016-04-17T06:00:54+00:00"}, "keywords": "News, demographics, diversity, houston area survey, population, Rice University\u2019s Kinder Institute for Urban Research, stephen klineberg", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "/ DownloadRice UniversityRice University\u2019s Kinder Institute for Urban Research is releasing the new edition of its emblematic Houston Area Survey this week.\nAs for the growth in diversity of the population, Klineberg emphasizes that Harris County has one of the most even distribution of Anglos, Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians.\nDr Stephen Klineberg says Houston has been reinventing itself for the 21st century.\nFor example, the Greater Houston Partnership has the \u201cUpSkill Houston\u201d program, which promotes careers that require less than a four year college degree.\nFor him, Houston\u2019s demographic transformation is one of the main topics the surveys have helped to track."}
