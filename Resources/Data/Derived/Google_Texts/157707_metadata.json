Suddenly everything got much more dangerous, much more immediate, much more painful.\u201d\n\nOfficial figures confirm the picture she paints, with emergency admissions to child psychiatric wards doubling in four years, and those young adults hospitalized for self-harm up by 70 percent in a decade.\n\n\u201cSomething is clearly happening,\u201d says Evans, \u201cbecause I am seeing the evidence in the numbers of depressive, anorexic, cutting children who come to see me. And it always has something to do with the computer, the Internet and the smartphone.\u201d\n\nHard on the heels of Evans\u2019 interview comes the story of a 12-year-old Colorado girl who twice tried to poison her mother with bleach after her mother took away the girl\u2019s iPhone. The preteen was detained at the Boulder County Juvenile Center on two counts of attempted first-degree murder.\n\nChildren\u2019s dependency and addiction to electronics have been worrying child-development specialists for years. Evidence is mounting that heavy use of iPads for toddlers interferes with play and cognitive development. Young children cannot use such basic toys as building blocks because they have not developed the necessary motor skills.\n\n\u201cRising numbers of infants lack the motor skills needed to play with building blocks because of an \u2018addiction\u2019 to tablet computers and smartphones, according to teachers,\u201d reports a Telegraph article. \u201cMany children aged just three or four can \u2018swipe a screen\u2019 but have little or no dexterity in their fingers after spending hours glued to iPads.\u201d\n\nOlder children are also reportedly having trouble with traditional pen-and-paper exams because they are unable to properly hold a writing instrument and \u201cbecause their memory had been eroded by overexposure to screen-based technology.\u201d\n\niPads seem to be particularly seductive to youngsters, with its bright colors and infinite variety of games and pictures. Because using it is so easy \u2013 a swiping movement is all that\u2019s required \u2013 simple skills of even how to turn a page are often not acquired until children are much older.\n\nYounger and younger kids are even receiving therapy for electronics addition. Preschoolers who are abruptly deprived of their iPads or smart phones exhibit tantrums, agitation and even depressive symptoms. Because the devices are often given to children as pacifiers, youngsters may not develop critical social or relationship skills. There is also the question of whether parents develop necessary social and emotional ties with their children by plugging the children into electronic devices rather than coping with normal childish stages and emotions.\n\n\u201cPerhaps this all begins with mimicry,\u201d writes Chris Matyszczyk on CNET. \u201cThe children see their parents\u2019 deep involvement in their machines and want to do the same.\u201d\n\nEvidence is emerging that even adults are forgetting certain motor skills, such as writing. Keyboard use has become so heavy with tech-savvy people that writing by hand gets pushed aside. Known as \u201ccharacter amnesia,\u201d it\u2019s becoming endemic in Asian countries where traditional writing skills are being lost to keypad savvy.\n\n\u201cChinese schoolchildren grow up memorizing well over 3,000 different characters,\u201d reports Breaking News English. \u201cHowever, the study shows they rarely need to write them by hand and are forgetting their shape. Instead, young people are using their phones and computers to write. \u2026 University student Li Hanwei, 21, said: \u2018I can remember the shape, but I can\u2019t remember the strokes that you need to write it \u2026 It\u2019s a bit of a problem.'\u201d\n\nMatters are no better in Western countries, with studies showing a typical adult has not written anything for almost six weeks, and one in three has not written anything \u201cproperly\u201d for more than six months.\n\nThere are accompanying declines in the quality of handwriting and spelling, since more and more people rely on \u201ctext chat.\u201d\n\nYet multiple studies suggest handwriting is \u201cimportant for brain development and cognition \u2013 helping kids hone fine motor skills and learn to express and generate ideas,\u201d notes the Week. \u201cYet the time devoted to teaching penmanship in most grade schools has shrunk to just one hour a week.\u201d\n\nLong-term repercussions of electronic usage remain to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "An alarming trend is coming to light as psychologists and counselors see more and more young people addicted to the Internet and portable electronic devices.
