MONACO (AP) — Monaco has welcomed with joy the baptism of the principality’s five-month-old royal baby twins.

Crowds lined the streets Sunday to catch a glimpse of Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella, who looked serene in their white christening gowns and adorable bonnets. Prince Albert, 57, and Princess Charlene, 37, beamed in the bright May sunshine, holding their children to cheers from the crowds.

The baby twins were born December 10 just a couple of minutes apart and are the first and second in line to the throne.

Their trend-setting mother wore a cropped ivory top and matching skirt for the ceremony.
