Those cuts, along with prior budget reductions, have forced the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to reduce services for adult mental health patients.\n\nFor fiscal year 2012-2013, Idaho appropriated $43.2 million for behavioral health. While the state receives federal funds dedicated to mental health spending, behavioral health makes up just 3.4 percent of Health and Welfare\u2019s budget. The department receives the second-largest amount of funding in the state.\n\nThe department has 20 field offices offering mental health services across the state, said Casey Moyer with Health and Welfare.\n\nIdaho Health Regions\n\nA bulk of the adult and child clients they help are ordered by the court, he said.\n\n\u201cWe seek to be the backstop,\u201d Moyer said. \u201cWe want to make sure no one falls through the crack.\u201d\n\nFor two years, mental health advocates pushed for Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter and the Legislature to backfill the mental health cuts but their efforts so far have been unsuccessful.\n\nNow with the 2014 Legislative session approaching, opportunities to find funding for mental health services are just now starting to be discussed.\n\nDepartments will submit their budgets to the governor this week, said state Rep. Maxine Bell, R-Jerome. Otter will then review the proposals and submit his budget in January.\n\nAs chairwoman of the Joint Appropriations Finance Committee, Bell said she hasn\u2019t heard of anyone proposing backfilling mental health cuts but it\u2019s still early.\n\n\u201cIt has to be an issue and a pretty serious one,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much is available for backfill on any issue is just unknown at this point.\u201d\n\nHealth and Welfare is in competition with other frequently slashed programs for the available cash.\n\nOf Idaho\u2019s approximately 1.5 million resident, nearly 54,000 adults live with a serious mental illness and about 18,000 children live with serious mental health conditions, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nIdaho\u2019s public mental health system provides services to nearly 20 percent of adults with a serious mental illness, leaving the rest untreated or relying on private insurance or out of pocket expenses for treatment.\n\nMental Health Holds FY 2014\n\nIdaho continually ranks as one of the top states with the highest suicide rates. In 2011, the most recent year available, 284 people committed suicide in Idaho.\n\nIdaho could relieve its mental health funding burden by expanding its Medicaid eligibility requirements. Unlike the recent implementation of the online health insurance exchange, state-federal Medicaid expansion is the optional component under the federal Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nCurrently, Idaho\u2019s Medicaid program covers non-disabled adults only if they have children and make less than 20 percent of the poverty level, which is $4,584 annually for a family of four. Expanding eligibility under the federal system would allow up to 138 percent of poverty or $31,000 for a family of four. This prevents many single Idahoans who can\u2019t afford insurance accessing preventive care and mental health counseling or medication covered under Medicaid.\n\nEnrollment in the state\u2019s Medicaid program has grown more than 20 percent over the last three years. In 2008, enrollment was about 185,000. By 2012, it was nearly 229,000.\n\nOtter has already rejected expanding Medicaid once during the this year\u2019s Legislative session while at the same time endorsing building an online health care exchange. He, along with many other lawmakers, argued that Medicaid needed to be reformed before allowing more people into the system.\n\nWith the health exchange plagued with technical difficulties, low enrollment numbers and accusations saying exchange supporters promoted Obamacare, lawmakers may not jump to push expanding Medicaid this session, Bell said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that whole issue is going to be on the table or not,\u201d she said. \u201cIf our exchange had gone a little more smoothly, there might have been a bigger chance.\u201d\n\nExpanding Medicaid would be beneficial for communities because it helps prevent individuals with mental illnesses ending up in crisis situations, said Bill Aldrich, owner of the Twin Falls-based Community Support Center. The facility relies on Medicaid funding to provide services for people with mental disabilities, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and severe depression.\n\nPolice are often the first responders when there\u2019s a mental health crisis. Once on scene, they can decide if they need to take an individual to the hospital for evaluation of their mental state.\n\nThe costs then fall into a catastrophic medical fund, with county and state taxpayers picking up the tab. For example, Jerome County paid more than $114,000 for emergency care for adults with mental illnesses in 2012.\n\nThe county used to pay more, but as the bill continued to escalate, the county changed its payment process. Now they only pay when its court-ordered, said Kim Burlington, deputy clerk for the county\u2019s social services.\n\nLeft untreated, people with mental illnesses often end up on the streets or in jail, Aldrich said.\n\n\u201cIf you throw in Medicaid expansion, it\u2019s going to help communities and reduce the costs overall,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be less emergency costs, less people going to hospital emergency rooms and less arrests.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "local", "author": "Kimberlee Kruesi - kkruesi@magicvalley.com", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Falls Times-News", "description": "google.load(\"visualization\", \"1\", {packages:[\"corechart\"]}); google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart); function drawChart() { var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([ ['Region', 'Child Admissions', 'Adult Admissions', 'Child Discharges', 'Adult Discharges'], ['Region 1', 18, 49, -22, -59], ['Region 2', 10, 24,", "title": "Idaho Slow to Replace Reduced Mental Health Funding", "url": "http://magicvalley.com/news/local/idaho-slow-to-replace-reduced-mental-health-funding/html_01c8d762-56e8-11e3-bf3f-0019bb2963f4.html", "image": {"width": 699, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/ce/7ce9a1e8-5a48-11e3-b033-001a4bcf887a/529ac79844700.preview-699.png?crop=699%2C393%2C0%2C52&resize=699%2C393&order=crop%2Cresize", "height": 393}, "type": "article", "section": "Southern Idaho Local News"}, "twitter": {"site": "@twinfallstn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=375099832", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.magicvalley.news", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetimesnews/"}, "keywords": "local", "google-site-verification": "m1RFSu3HgkLm7UOImoVL_lGb_BBeAaZwOYKq8jsVoTc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "google.load(\"visualization\", \"1\", {packages:[\"corechart\"]}); google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart); function drawChart() { var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([ ['Region', 'Child Admissions', 'Adult Admissions', 'Child Discharges', 'Adult Discharges'], ['Region 1', 18, 49, -22, -59], ['Region 2', 10, 24,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc52f\"", "article_summary": "Of Idaho\u2019s approximately 1.5 million resident, nearly 54,000 adults live with a serious mental illness and about 18,000 children live with serious mental health conditions, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nThe department has 20 field offices offering mental health services across the state, said Casey Moyer with Health and Welfare.\nMore money is needed on almost every level to adequately provide mental health services to the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, they say, especially after years of drastic budget cuts to mental health programs.\nWhile the state receives federal funds dedicated to mental health spending, behavioral health makes up just 3.4 percent of Health and Welfare\u2019s budget.\nTWIN FALLS \u2022 The politics of Idaho\u2019s mental health funding is leaving thousands behind, argue proponents of Medicaid expansion."}
