Hands only CPR is the same as regular CPR, but without mouth to mouth resuscitation.\n\n\u201cAnd all the health departments are on board for hands-only CPR for World Heart Day,\u201d said Stefany Strong, the public information officer for the Volusia County Department of Health. \u201cMany of us are having programs, and it\u2019s just something we want to do to raise awareness.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, untrained bystanders are more likely to do hands-only CPR than mouth-to-mouth. And hands-only CPR is just as effective in those crucial first few minutes.\n\nStrong says they want more people to do two things when someone goes down: Call 911.\n\n\u201cAnd two, immediately start those quick, rapid compressions in an attempt to revive the person,\u201d Strong said.\n\nThere are more than 150 events planned statewide. Head here to find an event near you.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
