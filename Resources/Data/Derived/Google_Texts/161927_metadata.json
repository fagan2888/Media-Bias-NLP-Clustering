Its stock has fallen considerably as sales growth has slowed. After going public at $22 a share in November 2013, its stock jumped to more than $73 within a few months but gradually slid to a low of $9 a share in May.\n\nDuring the second quarter, net sales crept up 4% to $298 million but important measures of success are down, including the number of active customers, total orders placed and average amount per order. Year-end sales are expected to reach $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.\n\nQVC officials say acquiring Zulily opens huge opportunities for the \u201chighly complementary\u2019\u2019 retailers. Both employ the same strategy, which is to offer deep discounts for a limited period of time, but cater to different age groups, with QVC attracting older boomers and Zulily drawing millennial moms.\n\nOne possibility for growing Zulily would be to sell its products on TV. Currently, there is little overlap between the two companies, which just 6% of QVC shoppers buying on Zulily.\n\nQVC\u2019s programming is distributed to about 340 million homes worldwide.\n\nQVC and Zulily will continue to operate as separate brands but will leverage QVC\u2019s global scale, vendor relationships and video commerce knowledge to benefit Zulily. In turn, Zulily will use its younger customer demographic, eCommerce abilities and personalization features to enhance QVC.\n\nThe nearly 30-year-old QVC also plans to draw from its experience with easy-pay platforms and product returns to improve Zulily and could add Zulily vendors to its TV programming.\n\nThe sale, which was approved by both boards of directors, is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2015. Following the sale, Zulily will remain headquartered in Seattle, and Darrell Cavens will continue as its president and CEO.\n\nGet Free Updates!
