Houston now leads its division by 6 1/2 games and has the second-best record in the American League \u2014 but to say the Astros have an unusual offense would be an understatement.\n\nHouston leads the major leagues in home runs, while ranking 29th in batting average. The Astros have struck out more than any other American League team, yet they\u2019re third in the AL in runs.\n\n\u201cI think we actually expected a little bit of that, just given the back of the baseball cards of the guys that we have,\u201d manager A.J. Hinch said during the series in Detroit. \u201cWe have a lot of guys that have home runs on their resumes. We\u2019ve got guys that have some strikeouts, maybe some low batting averages. So it\u2019s played out that way \u2014 it\u2019s gone a little bit extreme I think.\u201d\n\nNo kidding. Evan Gattis hit his ninth homer of the year Sunday, but his three-hit day only raised his average to .201. Luis Valbuena is hitting .199 with 10 homers. Chris Carter is hitting .170 but has gone deep seven times.\n\nThis formula is working so far, and it\u2019s quite a stylistic contrast to the one AL team with a better record than Houston: the Kansas City Royals.\n\nKansas City has hit the second-fewest homers in the AL. That\u2019s not a huge change from last season, but the Royals have improved offensively.\n\nThey may not hit many home runs, but they\u2019ve hit plenty of doubles and triples \u2014 and the Royals remain the most strikeout-averse offensive team in baseball. Kansas City has scored even more runs than Houston this year, and the Royals lead the AL Central by three games.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Astros, the Royals and different ways to win", "title": "The Astros, the Royals and different ways to win", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Astros, the Royals and different ways to win", "title": "The Astros, the Royals and different ways to win", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/the_astros_the_royals_and_different_ways_to_win/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/astros-tigers-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Astros, the Royals and different ways to win", "title": "The Astros, the Royals and different ways to win", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/astros-tigers-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Noah Trister", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsDuring a 20-batter stretch in Sunday\u2019s victory at Detroit, every hitter for the Houston Astros either reached base or struck out.\nKansas City has scored even more runs than Houston this year, and the Royals lead the AL Central by three games.\nThis formula is working so far, and it\u2019s quite a stylistic contrast to the one AL team with a better record than Houston: the Kansas City Royals.\nThe Astros have struck out more than any other American League team, yet they\u2019re third in the AL in runs.\nThey may not hit many home runs, but they\u2019ve hit plenty of doubles and triples \u2014 and the Royals remain the most strikeout-averse offensive team in baseball."}
