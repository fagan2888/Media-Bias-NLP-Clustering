Dollar Tree also named a new president and COO of Family Dollar. The combined company will operate about 13,000 stores, making it the largest dollar store chain in the United States by store count.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce we have completed our acquisition of Family Dollar and we formally welcome the Family Dollar team to the Dollar Tree organization,\u201d stated Bob Sasser, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThis is a transformational opportunity for our business to offer broader, more compelling merchandise assortments, with greater values, to a wider array of customers. This acquisition will extend our reach to low-income customers, while strengthening and diversifying our footprint. We plan to leverage best practices across both organizations to deliver significant cost synergies. Combined, our growth potential is enhanced with improved opportunities to increase store productivity and to open more stores across multiple banners.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement first announced and unanimously approved by each company\u2019s Board of Directors in July 2014, Family Dollar shareholders are entitled to receive $59.60 in cash and 0.2484 of a share of Dollar Tree common stock for each share of Family Dollar common stock.\n\n\n\nThe company also announced that Gary Philbin, age 58, has been named president and COO of Family Dollar, effective immediately. In his new role, Philbin will continue to report to Bob Sasser.\n\n\n\nPhilbin joined Dollar Tree as SVP of stores in December 2001, and was later promoted to COO in March 2007 and to President in June 2013. Prior to joining Dollar Tree, Philbin held senior-level positions in both merchandising and operations during his thirty years in the retail grocery industry.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am very proud to announce that Gary will be taking on his new leadership role of Family Dollar Stores,\u201d Sasser said. \u201cGary has played an integral role in the success of Dollar Tree over the past fourteen years. Notably, Gary was instrumental in improving the Dollar Tree customer shopping experience and the related customer satisfaction, as well as leading the integration following our Canadian acquisition in 2010.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilbin said: \u201cI am very pleased to have the opportunity to lead the Family Dollar team. Throughout the due diligence and integration planning processes, I have been impressed with the experience, talent and dedication of the Family Dollar team members. Our focus as an organization will be on the customer - by consistently providing great values, affordable prices, and relevant items in a store environment that is convenient, clean, reliable and efficient. We are well-prepared for the integration process, which is now under way.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the company announced that Howard R.
