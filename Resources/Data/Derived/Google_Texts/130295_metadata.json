If they do, millions of Americans could lose their health insurance, and rates for millions more could rise if the insurance markets collapse in the more than 30 states that use the federal insurance exchange.\n\nThe speech was something of a victory lap for a health care measure Mr. Obama argued has defied \u201cdoom and gloom predictions\u201d and \u201cChicken Little warnings\u201d of economic calamity and freedoms revoked. But it was also a preview of the sharp political rebukes the president is prepared to deal to Republicans should they seek to upend the law in the wake of an adverse ruling later this month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether or not the court invalidates the subsidies, health care is almost certain to be a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama said, is no longer just a piece of legislation or an abstract theory, but \u201ca reality that people on the ground, day to day, are experiencing.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cTheir lives are better,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAmericans support this new reality.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were quick to counter Mr. Obama\u2019s speech even before it began, saying the president was divorced from reality and denying the negative effects of a health care overhaul they said had raised costs and caused some people to lose health coverage they liked.\n\n\u201cI imagine the families threatened with double-digit premium increases would beg to differ, as would the millions of families who received cancellation notices for the plans they had and wanted to keep,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, calling the Affordable Care Act \u201ca law that\u2019s failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sooner President Obama can get to grips with that reality, the sooner we can work together to replace the fear and anguish of Obamacare with the hope and promise of true health reform.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party sought to use the health law as a political weapon against the presumed Democratic presidential front-runner.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s skyrocketing costs, canceled insurance plans, or the law\u2019s legal issues, the problems caused by Obamacare rest squarely at the feet of this president, Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrat party,\u201d Michael Short, a Republican National Committee spokesman, said in a statement responding to the president\u2019s speech.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Mr. Obama made a familiar case that the 2010 law has brought huge improvements to the lives of millions of people who had previously been unable to afford basic health care, or who could not obtain coverage because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe cited statistics showing that the law has helped slow the growth of health care costs, and noted that the five years since its enactment has coincided with the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record.\n\n\u201cThe critics stubbornly ignore reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe Supreme Court case centers on a provision in the law that seems to say subsidies are available only to people living where the insurance exchanges had been \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Germany before returning from a meeting with European leaders, Mr. Obama said he was optimistic that the justices would not invalidate the subsidies with a \u201ccontorted reading\u201d of the Affordable Care Act and the intent of lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the Supreme Court will play it straight when it comes to the interpretation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t, Congress could fix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Republicans are signaling another drawn-out political fight over fixing the health law if the court rules the subsidies are invalid. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, who called the law an \u201cexpensive disaster,\u201d said Tuesday that members of his party \u201caren\u2019t interested in a one-sentence fix \u2014 unless that sentence is: \u2018Obamacare is repealed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s speech was part of a broader effort to shape and define the president\u2019s biggest domestic accomplishment in the face of partisan attacks.\n\nThe White House also unveiled a new website intended to put the Affordable Care Act into a broader historical context. The site features a timeline suggesting that efforts to expand health coverage began more than 100 years ago.\n\nCritics and doubters of the Affordable Care Act are unlikely to be swayed by the new promotional materials. But White House officials are hoping that Mr. Obama can make a convincing case that the law is working, and that it is here to stay, before he leaves office in 2017.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150609060005, "twitter": {"description": "Days before a ruling that could drastically undermine the Affordable Care Act, President Obama delivered a speech extolling its benefits.", "title": "Before Supreme Court Weighs in, Obama Makes His Case for Health Law", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/us/obama-speech-affordable-care-act-supreme-court.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003729930"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/09/us/10HEALTHWEB/10HEALTHWEB-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/us/obama-speech-affordable-care-act-supreme-court.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003729930", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/us/obama-speech-affordable-care-act-supreme-court.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Before Supreme Court Weighs In, Obama Makes His Case for Health Law", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "June 9, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Supreme Court (US),Health Insurance and Managed Care", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D.
