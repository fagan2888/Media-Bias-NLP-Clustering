Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n\nPhoto\n\n1. President Obama, speaking in honor of the 150th anniversary of the constitutional ban on slavery, took a swipe at Donald Trump\u2019s call for barring Muslim from entering the U.S. \u201cRemember that our freedom is bound up with the freedom of others, regardless of what they look like or where they come from or what their last name,\u201d Mr. Obama said, pointedly adding, \u201cor what faith they practice.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n2. U.S. officials offered a fuller picture of the couple they say killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., last week. Radicalized separately, they were \u201ctalking to each other about jihad and martyrdom\u201d before they became engaged in 2013, the F.B.I. director said. That raised questions about whether U.S. authorities missed something in the woman\u2019s visa process.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n3. The focus on the San Bernardino case and the political uproar stirred up since have slowed Congress\u2019s progress on a spending bill, meaning lawmakers plan to pass a stopgap bill by the Friday deadline. The Hill is a frenzy of lobbying, dealing and sparring over topics like new restrictions on Syrian and Iraqi refugees, environmental rules and campaign finance rules.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n4. Those last-minute provisions can have a huge impact. One Marco Rubio slipped into last year\u2019s spending bill has undermined the Affordable Care Act, forcing premiums to rise and some insurers to close. Still, the Obama administration boasted of robust sign-ups for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, with next Tuesday the deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Justices\u2019 questions at a Supreme Court hearing on affirmative action at the University of Texas suggested that the plan was in peril. The ruling is expected next year. A ruling against the university could mean trouble for affirmative action around the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n6. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel apologized for a fatal police shooting of a black teenager last year. But within hours, protesters shouting \u201c16 shots and a cover-up!\u201d blocked streets and demanded that he resign.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Our top movie critics have wide-ranging tastes. But both put \u201cCarol\u201d and \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d among their top films of the year. A.O. Scott called \u201cMad Max\u201d \u201ca master class in old-school, super-linear action filmmaking, full of nasty, punk-rock, dystopian Australian humor. Also the best recent eco-feminist-socialist allegory that isn\u2019t a novel by Margaret Atwood.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n8. \u201cSouth Park\u201d wraps up its 19th season tonight (10 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central) amid critical acclaim for its season-long send-up of rigid political correctness and the culture of outrage. \u201cIt was as if our culture had been shining an Eric Cartman-shaped Bat-signal and \u2018South Park\u2019 answered,\u201d our reviewer said.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n9. The mood remained cautiously optimistic as climate talks in Paris neared their official Friday close (though a Saturday finish is possible). Sticking points include how often to reconvene to assess compliance with emissions targets and how often to toughen those targets. Beijing suffered through another day of red alert pollution.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n10. A Colorado court charged Robert Dear with 179 counts, including first-degree murder, in the shooting rampage last month at a Planned Parenthood clinic. He declared himself guilty and appeared to settle any remaining questions about his motivation by yelling, \u201cI\u2019m a warrior for the babies,\u201d and referring to \u201cthe babies that were supposed to be aborted that day.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n11. The perplexing hunt for the founder of Bitcoin may be over. The Australian police raided the home of Craig Steven Wright, a computer expert and entrepreneur in suburban Sydney. Gizmodo and Wired magazine identified him as the likely creator of the digital currency.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n12. A 2,000-year-old stone block unearthed in the ruins of a synagogue six years ago near the Sea of Galilee could be a three-dimensional representation of the Second Temple, made while the original still stood. The Magdala stone \u2014 named for its discovery in the presumed hometown of Mary Magdalene \u2014 is reshaping the understanding of ancient Judaism.\n\n_____\n\nThe Evening Briefing by Email Get a nightly rundown of the day's top stories delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.\n\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\n\nWant to look back?
