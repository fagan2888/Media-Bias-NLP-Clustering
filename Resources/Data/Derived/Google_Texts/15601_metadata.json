(AP) - On a Wednesday morning, the delivery truck pulled in to Hake\u2019s Grocery in Dover Township.\n\nAllen McKinney stepped out, opened the truck\u2019s freezer door and unloaded about 100 half-gallon tubs of Carman\u2019s ice cream, which he made earlier that week.\n\n\u201cThe big guys make their ice cream in winter, store it in a warehouse and sell it in summer,\u201d McKinney said. \u201cI control the ice cream the whole way until the customer pulls it out of the freezer.\u201d\n\nFor McKinney, the long day spent driving to his 15 wholesale vendors in York County and Maryland is a Wednesday ritual.\n\nBut soon, the 59-year-old owner will retire. His two sons already have successful careers in the Coast Guard, McKinney said, and with nobody to take Carman\u2019s over, the business that\u2019s been in his family for three generations could come to an end.\n\nHenry Hutcheson, author of \u201cDirty Little Secrets of Family Business,\u201d said family businesses often outperform their competitors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the name of your family,\u201d Hutcheson said. \u201cYou\u2019re held to a higher ethical standard. When you do things right, the family gets the benefit from that.\u201d\n\nCompared to their corporate counterparts, though, family-owned businesses often fail to plan for a successor, Hutcheson said. Two-thirds of family businesses don\u2019t survive to the second generation.\n\nThe transition to the third generation has a similar rate of failure, he said.\n\nAn owner-operator who\u2019s ready to retire, Hutcheson said, might have several options: pass the business to an heir, sell it, or keep the business but find someone outside the family to run it. Each scenario is playing out in well-known York County businesses.\n\nPassing it on\n\nWith a Budweiser Clydesdale statue and flags visible from Interstate 83, Brewery Products Company is a York landmark.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way, though, according to John Keesee, the company president.\n\nKeesee started working there in the 1960s and eventually took over the business from his father-in-law. When Keesee started, it was a 3,000-square-foot operation with 10 employees at 333 W. King St. in York.\n\n\u201cEverything at that time was done by hand,\u201d said Keesee, who started out as a janitor while attending York College. \u201cIt was a very physical job at that time - no fork lifts.\u201d\n\nToday, Brewery Products operates a 65,000 square-foot warehouse and employs 72 people, according to Derek Siegel, Keesee\u2019s grandson and the fourth-generation heir to the company. Keesee said the journey from his father-in-law\u2019s small operation to the present day involved a lot of factors, including some luck.\n\nWhen he started, Ballantine ale was their top seller, Keesee said, and Budweiser, the only Anheuser-Busch beer the wholesaler carried, made up a small percentage of sales. That changed, of course, over the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to have some very good brands,\u201d Keesee said, referring to Budweiser\u2019s market dominance over the past 40 years.\n\nThat said, Keesee also attributed Brewery Products\u2019 growth to the company\u2019s success in acquiring new territory and brands.\n\n\u201cWe went from a company that covered one county to four counties in 1978 when we purchased Myers distributing,\u201d Keesee said. \u201cThe second biggest jump was when we acquired the Yuengling franchise.\u201d\n\nAt 69, Keesee is already semi-retired. He said his approach to keeping the business in the family was to get his daughter, Wendy Keesee, and grandson, Siegel, involved gradually over many years.\n\nWendy Keesee said that approach helped her to take charge of the company amid a male-dominated industry. Keesee said she also had a strong female role model, company board member Sue Whitsell.\n\nKeesee said she wasn\u2019t always set on taking over the business. But in her late 20s, after she had her children, she decided to get involved.\n\nShe started in administration in 1995, and said she held a number of positions over the next 12 years.\n\nSiegel said his mother and grandfather took the slow-immersion approach with him, bringing him to the office from a young age and hiring him on as a driver\u2019s assistant and eventually a Class A licensed driver when he was in college.\n\nWhile the beer wholesale market is relatively stable, Siegel said he doesn\u2019t take anything for granted in the business.\n\n\u201cWe have to do the right things today to make sure the future is guaranteed,\u201d Siegel said.\n\nOne example of that, he said, was using new technology to better manage deliveries.\n\nHe said his mother was instrumental in modernizing their operation, which went from having one \u201ccomputer room,\u201d so named because it was the only computer in the building, to having a delivery team that relies on mobile computing to take invoices.\n\nFrom adopting new trends to updating their brand every few years, Siegel said he\u2019s working to do whatever it takes to keep the company strong for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cI have a two-year-old son,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI want him to be able to experience the kinds of things I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\n\nA family investment\n\nMeanwhile in York\u2019s Market District, barbershop owner Tony Orr is planning for his retirement - and with it, the barbershop\u2019s transition to his successor.\n\nOrr, 52, got his start cutting hair at Leon Wilson\u2019s barber shop that used to be at 142 E. College Ave. He got licensed in 1989 and has been running Tony Orr Sons & Daughters out of his 116 W. Philadelphia St. property since 2000.\n\nThough he\u2019s the first generation owner of this particular barbershop, business ownership has been in his extended family since the 1930s. Orr said his cousin, David Orr Sr., owned a trucking company, and David Orr\u2019s son, David Orr Jr., owned The Basement barbershop at Princess and Pershing in York.\n\nOrr said he dabbled in cutting hair while studying business at Cheyney University. When he came home to York, he saw that Leon Wilson\u2019s barber shop in York was profitable, and he became Wilson\u2019s apprentice barber.\n\nA lot has changed since then, Orr said, including the value of the property he owns next to The White Rose Bar & Grill in the Central Market District. Further development of the Philadelphia and Beaver Street area has helped to attract customers to his barbershop.\n\nMost of Orr\u2019s five sons and three daughters have learned to cut hair at this point, Orr said, but with his children pursuing their own careers, he\u2019s uncertain if any of them will replace him behind the barber\u2019s chair.\n\nTo Orr, it\u2019s less important that one of his children takes over as a barber and more important that the business ownership itself stays in the family. Orr said other local business owners have offered to buy the building, but he declined those offers.\n\n\u201cThis is my legacy,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the property is for his family, Orr said the business is simply about employing quality barbers. One other barber, Elgin Kent, operates out of his shop. Kent and Orr both said the most important factor in the business was having a team of barbers who get along, have a good reputation in the community and who therefore tend to have a lot of repeat customers.\n\nOrr said Kent\u2019s input and his own faith will be what help him decide who will take over his barber chair.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, God allowed me to be in this barbershop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is his house, not mine.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of selling\n\nBack at Carman\u2019s Ice Cream in Loganville, McKinney said the clock is ticking toward retirement.\n\n\u201cI anticipate I\u2019ll have the business five to 10 more years,\u201d he said.\n\nThough his sons are unlikely to move back to York, let alone take over Carman\u2019s, McKinney said one cousin, living in Chicago, has expressed interest.\n\nStill, he knows it\u2019s a long shot, and it\u2019s more likely he\u2019ll end up selling the business that started in 1953 and which he has run since 1996.\n\nIf he gets to the point where he\u2019s looking for buyers, he said he\u2019ll look for someone who can maintain product quality while expanding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see someone with a bigger vision take over,\u201d McKinney said.\n\nThe challenge, he said, is making enough locally-sourced ice cream without \u201cstabilizers\u201d to extend the product\u2019s shelf life to support expanded production and distribution.\n\nHe and a couple part-time employees make the ice cream five to seven days a week, generating about 200 gallons per day. He\u2019s already turned down Giant Grocery stores when they tried to sign a deal with him to supply the ice cream. He decided he couldn\u2019t make enough to fill Giant\u2019s shelves without changing his means of production.\n\nMost importantly for him, McKinney said he wants the Carman\u2019s brand to survive, as well as the brand\u2019s reputation for fresh, old-fashioned ice cream.\n\n\u201cPeople come by the store and call me Mr. Carman, and I don\u2019t take offense to that at all,\u201d McKinney said.\n\nYork County small business facts\n\n33,176\n\nBusinesses with less than 500 employees\n\n1,731\n\nBusinesses with five to nine employees\n\n3,534\n\nBusinesses with one to four employees\n\n514\n\nBusinesses with zero employees\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1GqYe2Z\n\n___\n\nInformation from: York Daily Record, http://www.ydr.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a Wednesday morning, the delivery truck pulled in to Hake's Grocery in Dover Township.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/13/family-owned-firms-face-challenges-when-owners-ret/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "On a Wednesday morning, the delivery truck pulled in to Hake\u2019s Grocery in Dover Township.", "title": "Family-owned firms face challenges when owners retire"}, "twitter": {"description": "On a Wednesday morning, the delivery truck pulled in to Hake's Grocery in Dover Township.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Family-owned firms face challenges when owners retire"}, "Author": "BRETT SHOLTIS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca233\"", "article_summary": "Henry Hutcheson, author of \u201cDirty Little Secrets of Family Business,\u201d said family businesses often outperform their competitors.\nHe\u2019s already turned down Giant Grocery stores when they tried to sign a deal with him to supply the ice cream.\nHe and a couple part-time employees make the ice cream five to seven days a week, generating about 200 gallons per day.\nThe challenge, he said, is making enough locally-sourced ice cream without \u201cstabilizers\u201d to extend the product\u2019s shelf life to support expanded production and distribution.\n\u201cThe big guys make their ice cream in winter, store it in a warehouse and sell it in summer,\u201d McKinney said."}
