The over-the-top performance results even prompted Consumer Reports to recalibrate its rating methods.\n\nEven so, the Tesla creation was soundly given a score of 100, setting the magazine\u2019s new standard for excellence. Tesla\u2019s P85D even bested the original Model S score of 99 points in 2013. Prior to that, the only vehicle to come close in the rating was a Mercedes-Benz S-550.\n\nWhat Makes the Tesla Stand Out?\n\nTesla\u2019s off-the-charts score was based primarily on its acceleration and efficiency ratings. The vehicle was able to accelerate to 60 mph from a stopped position in an impressive 3.5 seconds in the vehicle\u2019s \u201cinsane mode.\u201d\n\nTesla has since released an even-faster \u201cludicrous mode.\u201d The new P85D is the company\u2019s high-performance, all-wheel-drive version of the standard all-electric Model S, which has pulled off an equivalent of 87 miles to the gallon.\n\nThe P85D\u2019s efficiency also scored incredibly high with Consumer Reports, but a more interesting gauge of its abilities in this arena came recently out of Denmark.\n\nA programmer from the University of Oslo, Bjorn Nyland, managed to claim a record for his Model S, driving some 453 miles before its battery ran out of power.\n\nTesla only claims a range of about 253 miles for its P85D, but Nyland pushed that limit by about 80%.\n\nA Few Faults\n\nWhile there was no denying the P85D\u2019s abilities, Consumer Reports found a few faults with the model, which has a starting price of $105,000.\n\nThe biggest knocks noted against the model included the quality, or lack thereof, of interior materials and the noise produced during operation.\n\nThe P85D\u2019s overall performance offers insights into what the future holds for electric cars, Consumer Reports\u2019 head of testing, Jake Fisher, has said. The advances shown in the new model are prophetic of what is yet to come.\n\n\u201cCars with the performance of supercars and the comfort, convenience and safety features of a luxury car while still being extremely energy efficient,\u201d Fisher said in a story for Bloomberg.\n\nA total of 21,577 Model S units were delivered to consumers during the first half of 2015. Tesla anticipates total auto sales of about 50,000 in 2015.\n\nGet Free Updates! Stay in the loop with a weekly newsletter, with all our news from the previous week.
