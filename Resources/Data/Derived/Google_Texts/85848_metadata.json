Or is it five? That depends on one of the two Senators unaffiliated with either major party. Bernie Sanders, a professed socialist, may run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2016, so a Sanders flip is unlikely in the extreme. But what about Maine\u2019s Angus King? He caucuses with Democrats now, but he\u2019s, er \u2026 mulling his options after opposing the Democratic pay-equity ploy:\n\nSen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with the Democrats, will decide after the midterm elections whether to switch sides and join the Republicans. He is leaving open the possibility of aligning himself with the GOP if control of the upper chamber changes hands. \u201cI\u2019ll make my decision at the time based on what I think is best for Maine,\u201d King told The Hill Wednesday after voting with Republicans to block the Paycheck Fairness Act, a measure at the center for the 2014 Democratic campaign agenda. King\u2019s remarks are a clear indication that congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle will have to woo the 70-year-old senator in order to recruit him to their side.\n\nThat would be quite a journey for King, who just this week offered to waterboard former VP Dick Cheney after the latter defended the Bush-era interrogation techniques. King has been firmly in Harry Reid\u2019s camp since replacing Olympia Snowe fifteen months ago. He explained that to Maine voters (who had rejected both Republican and Democratic options in the race) on purely practical grounds. Without an affiliation to a caucus, King would have had no committee assignments at all, and it\u2019s better to caucus with the majority to get more impact.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t expect King to vote in lockstep with the GOP if he switches. And it\u2019s not entirely clear that Senate Republicans will want him unless they absolutely need him. King backs ObamaCare, for instance, and voted in favor of Reid\u2019s nuclear option on the filibuster last year. He also wants federal legislation to limit firearms magazines to 10 rounds, but does not support an assault-weapons ban. King filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court arguing to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. Govtrack\u2019s analysis of his voting record puts him on the moderate side of the Democratic caucus, about equivalent with Mark Pryor and Tim Kaine, but slightly more liberal than the most liberal Republican \u2014 his colleague Susan Collins.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the GOP to woo him much, in other words, unless they really need him \u2014 and they will only really need him if they pick up exactly five seats. Six and they don\u2019t need him to take control; four and he can\u2019t help anyway, unless they can convince Joe Manchin to flip, and they might try him first at five, too. Manchin\u2019s voting record is closer to the GOP than King\u2019s, and the trend in his home state might make him more reliable, too. King will flip to the GOP if they win a majority to any extent, thanks the pragmatism that has him in Reid\u2019s caucus now.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Fair weather.", "title": "Angus King: I might caucus with GOP after the midterms", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/10/angus-king-i-might-caucus-with-gop-after-the-midterms/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-10T12:01:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-10T12:02:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, Angus King, midterms, US Senate,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0317\"", "article_summary": "Without an affiliation to a caucus, King would have had no committee assignments at all, and it\u2019s better to caucus with the majority to get more impact.\nKing will flip to the GOP if they win a majority to any extent, thanks the pragmatism that has him in Reid\u2019s caucus now.\nHe is leaving open the possibility of aligning himself with the GOP if control of the upper chamber changes hands.\nManchin\u2019s voting record is closer to the GOP than King\u2019s, and the trend in his home state might make him more reliable, too.\nIn other words, don\u2019t expect King to vote in lockstep with the GOP if he switches."}
