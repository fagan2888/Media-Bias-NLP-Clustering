Here are some of the worst parts of the column, which led to his firing:\n\n\u201cY\u2019all know how to make a black man feel welcome.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama in Detroit. Don\u2019t let the golfing enthusiast fool you.\n\nI\u2019m one of you, Obama was saying, but we know better, don\u2019t we?\n\nReal blacks don\u2019t hide roots to gain acceptance of the mainstream. You can\u2019t sound like an Uncle Tom, a denier of your heritage, and get a rousing welcome.\n\nObama doesn\u2019t speak in a black vernacular, not even the mangled version the younger generation barrels through out of love for heritage. When a reporter asked Obama if he wanted to say something in Ebonics, he walked away. We\u2019re proud of our chocolate city \u2014 and we give points to visitors who make an effort to recognize our language abilities.\n\nI\u2019m lying of course: all these odious statements would never actually be published in a major U.S. newspaper\u2026 in that form. These excerpts, with names and ethnicity changed, are all from a Miami Herald column published this morning. Turns out allegations of race treachery are perfectly okay when applied to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\n\nYes, according to Herald columnist Fabiola Santiago, Cruz and Rubio aren\u2019t actually Cuban, but are both \u201ccubano arrepentido\u2026 denier of your heritage.\u201d Their \u201cdenial of their heritage\u201d amounts essentially to their holding conservative political views: Rubio is \u201ca climate-change denier\u201d who doesn\u2019t support Obamacare, Cruz \u201chas no empathy for undocumented immigrants\u201d and likes guns.\n\nThis idiotic for several reasons, but mostly because anyone familiar with Cuban-American politics knows they are easily the most conservative Hispanic subgroup in the United States. Of the eight Cuban-Americans in Congress, six are Republicans. George W. Bush earned over 70% of the Cuban vote both times he ran. Turns out that when you\u2019re driven from your home by a communist tyrant, you tend to embrace the free market and support a strong U.S. foreign policy against said tyrant.\n\nSo right from the start, using liberal policies as a prerequisite for \u201cCubanness\u201d is more far-fetched than the usual \u201cCruz and Rubio aren\u2019t Hispanic!\u201d nonsense we get from the media. If climate change skepticism, support for guns, and opposition to Obamacare are all \u201canti-Cuban,\u201d that hasn\u2019t kept Cubans from voting and running on these ideas for decades.\n\nSantiago readily admits this, saying that Cubans are conservative but \u201con social issues they resemble their Democratic counterparts\u201d and they support \u201chelping the less fortunate and fought for Medicaid expansion.\u201d Setting aside the fact Rubio in particular actually talks a great deal about alleviating poverty, she presents no polling data indicating this is the case. How do we know Cubans are so different from other Republican-voting blocs? Well, she can just feel it, kinda like how she can just feel that they aren\u2019t real Cubans.\n\nThe pinnacle of this stupidity is when she claims both men aren\u2019t authentically Cuban because they oppose President Obama\u2019s warming of relations with Cuba, which she chalks up to blind hatred of Obama. Yep, the sons of Cuban exiles are now betraying their roots when they question cozying up to the Castros.\n\nSantiago doesn\u2019t stick to just politics. Oh no, she also frets that \u201cCruz doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, not even the mangled version the younger generation barrels through out of love for heritage and elders. When a reporter asked Cruz if he wanted to say something in Spanish, he walked away.\u201d\n\nOn this point, she\u2019s simply wrong. Cruz absolutely speaks Spanish, even if it is closer to the mangled version she describes (it\u2019s \u201clousy,\u201d by his own admission). As a political columnist, you\u2019d think she would have seen that during the debate last month when it was on full display. But I guess even Googling \u201cdoes Ted Cruz speak Spanish\u201d is too much research when you\u2019ve got an ox to gore.\n\nWe\u2019ve been through this before, when Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin demanded Cruz speak Spanish for him (which he later apologized for). The notion that learning and exclusively using English makes one no longer Hispanic is patently offensive. All other immigrants that have come to America have assimilated over time, with each generation speaking less of their native language and more English. Today, no right-thinking person believes that Italian-Americans or Asian-Americans or Indian-Americans or Arab-Americans have betrayed their heritage when they don\u2019t speak their home tongues fluently.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to drudge up some psychoanalysis about whether Cruz hates his own culture when by his own admission, he doesn\u2019t speak Spanish on the trail because he sounds like Peggy Hill. No one has demanded that Bernie Sanders speak Hebrew, Donald Trump speak German, or John Kasich speak Mailman on the campaign trail in order to prove that their backgrounds are legitimate. Only Hispanics are regularly asked to \u201cprove\u201d their heritage by reciting a foreign language before a judging committee. It\u2019s a terribly bigoted double standard, and it\u2019s a shame to see a Hispanic in a major newspaper uncritically forwarding it.\n\nI can\u2019t believe we have to say this in the 21st century, but erasing someone\u2019s heritage because you disagree with them politically is backwards, anti-intellectual, and demeaning even to those you do agree with. What Santiago demands of Cubans is nothing short of unadulterated loyalty to liberal ideals. If you dare to think outside the box, well you can\u2019t be a Cuban, because apparently all \u201creal\u201d Cubans are all slavish idiots who think and act the same way.\n\nIt really isn\u2019t too far afield from the sort of nonsense pushed by white supremacists, or the crackpots who complained when Jeb Bush spoke Spanish on the trail. Demanding that someone think and act a certain way because of the color of their skin or who their parents were goes against everything that drew immigrants to this country in the first place. I\u2019m just disappointed that some at The Miami Herald seem to have forgotten that.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turns out allegations of race treachery are perfectly okay when applied to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.
