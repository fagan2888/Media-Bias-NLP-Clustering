Again, I am in wholehearted agreement with the sentiment and alleged goal of repealing a truly terrible law, but a president will never sign a bill to kill what he views as his greatest achievement, meaning those votes, and others like them, are the legislative equivalent of crying wolf. Over time, it might become hard for constituents to discern the difference between a legitimate legislative effort and political posturing.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Congress]\n\nBlurring the lines between politics and governing is, of course, the unsavory goal of many elected officials and the genuine misunderstanding of others. But whether a member of Congress is casting a vote to to prove their conservative or liberal chops to their gerrymandered districts, or sponsoring legislation in order to create a negative talking point for a future campaign ad, none of this has to do with getting the work of governing done.\n\nHave both parties used political-posturing bills and votes like the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act for years? You bet. Do constituents see through this nonsense? My guess is that most of them do, making hollow votes a total waste of Congress\u2019 time.\n\nMoving and heralding a piece of legislation that is destined to hit a wall is an act of condescension to constituents, and voters can see that. The action assumes that constituents are too ignorant to realize that voting on these symbolic pieces isn\u2019t really the same thing as \u201cworking hard to defeat the Obama agenda\u201d or whatever other nonsense political fundraising letters might claim.\n\nIt\u2019s hard work to find a solution of consequence that can move through a divided government. A hard-working member of Congress invests time building relationships with unexpected partners and researching the ways he or she can find common ground with the opposition.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Immigration]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Congress Should Stop Wasting Time on Pointless Messaging Votes", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Congress should stop wasting time on legislation that has no hope of becoming law.", "title": "Make a Difference, Not Just a Point", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/12/05/congress-should-stop-wasting-time-on-pointless-messaging-votes", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a6/575614c6bc42375b7843be0d9fd911/media:2a447c1b392e40698d87ff87e2568c8eCongressBoehner.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress should stop wasting time on legislation that has no hope of becoming law.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress Should Stop Wasting Time on Pointless Messaging Votes"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,immigration,immigration reform,Congress,Republican Party,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Congress should stop wasting time on legislation that has no hope of becoming law."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbea0\"", "article_summary": "Have both parties used political-posturing bills and votes like the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act for years?\nIt\u2019s hard work to find a solution of consequence that can move through a divided government.\nMy guess is that most of them do, making hollow votes a total waste of Congress\u2019 time.\nOver time, it might become hard for constituents to discern the difference between a legitimate legislative effort and political posturing.\nThe vote on this act was reminiscent of the many votes that have been taken in the U.S. House to repeal the health care law."}
