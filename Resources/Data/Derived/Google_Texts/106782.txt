Mary J. Blige, Willie Nelson, John Fogerty, Romeo Santos and Common are headed to the White House to perform for American troops.

The eclectic roster of musical acts is gathering on the South Lawn of the president’s abode on Nov. 6, just days before Veterans’ Day, for “A Salute to the Troops: In Performance at the White House.”

A Thursday news release from the White House says a live audience filled with hundreds of military service members, their families and veterans will be in attendance. The band Daughtry, fronted by “American Idol” alum Chris Daughtry, will perform via satellite from a USO concert at Japan’s Yokota Air Base.

It’ll be a repeat visit to the White House for most of the entertainers there.

Common appeared at a 2011 poetry event at the White House which sparked controversy.

Republicans, including former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and former President George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove, criticized President Obama for inviting the rapper to the event, saying he had used violent lyrics in reference to the 43rd president and the police.

Willie Nelson famously admitted in 2012 that he rolled a joint on the roof of the White House while visiting during the Carter administration.

Mary J. Blige performed at a state dinner for French President François Hollande back in February. Romeo Santos sang at a Latin music event at the White House last year.

Next month’s concert will air on PBS stations across the country on Nov. 7.
