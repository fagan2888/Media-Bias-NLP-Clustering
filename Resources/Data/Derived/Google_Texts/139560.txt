HONOLULU (AP) - Rescue crews are searching for two men who were swept out to sea near the Halona Blowhole Lookout.

Hawaii News Now reports (http://bit.ly/1CZ5ty0 ) that three friends were on the rocks offshore Halona Beach Cove on Saturday afternoon when a wave knocked one man off the rocks and into the water. One of the others dove in to try to rescue him.

The current pulled both of them further out to sea.

The third man was also knocked off the rocks, but he was able to make it back to shore. His right leg was injured.

Rescue helicopters, boats and divers searched the water but found no sign of the missing men.

The Coast Guard continued to search overnight and the Honolulu Fire Department plans to restart its search Sunday morning.
