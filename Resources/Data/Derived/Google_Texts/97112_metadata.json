He then shot Nolen and ended his attack, according to KFOR.\n\nSgt. Jeremy Lewis says the alleged suspect, 30-year-old Alton Nolen had just been fired when he drove to the front of the business, hit a vehicle and walked inside.

As the second stabbing was ongoing Vaughn arrived at the scene and shot Nolen.\n\nOfficials say at that point, Mark Vaughn, an Oklahoma County reserve deputy and a former CEO of the business, shot him as he was actively stabbing Johnson. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero in this situation,\u201d Sgt. Lewis said, referring to Vaughn. \u201cIt could have gotten a lot worse.\u201d\n\nWTVR reports that Mark Vaughn is both an employee of the company Nolen attacked and a police officer.
