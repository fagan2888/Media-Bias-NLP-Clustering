Eligible organization A nonprofit religious organization like a college or a hospital that, for religious reasons, “opposes providing coverage for some or all” forms of contraception.

The organization or its plan ... Religious organizations like Religious organizations like Wheaton College and the University of Notre Dame strenuously object to this sentence, which directs them to deliver a copy of the form to their insurance company or health plan administrator.

Third party administrators ... Companies that review and pay claims and perform other services for an employer with a “self-insured health plan.” The employer ordinarily bears the financial risk, but does not have to pay for contraceptives if it has religious objections.

Obligations of the third party administrator An administrator that receives a copy of this form from a nonprofit religious organization must make or arrange separate payments for contraception and cannot require employees or employer to pay any of the cost.
