RICHMOND, Va. -- For the first time since 2000, Virginia’s 7th Congressional District will not be represented by Eric Cantor. The former House Majority Leader was upset in the June Republican primary by Randolph-Macon economics professor Dave Brat.

Both Brat, and his Democratic opponent Jack Trammell, have been invited to appear on CBS 6 News at 7. Trammell, a sociology professor also teaching at Randolph-Macon, accepted our offer on Monday. Listen to what Trammell has to say about a Democrat’s chances in the largely Republican 7th, about President Obama’s record including the Affordable Care Act and what his priorities would be should he emerge the winner.

We’re hoping Brat will accept our offer soon.
