He held a Sharpie in one hand, seeking signatures for the balls\u2019 white panels. Rookies, older players \u2014 he sought them all out.\n\nGolston\u2019s 10th time cleaning out his locker at Redskins Park at least occurred after joy during the season. He had gone through this routine after a losing season six times. Golston has seen the name on the coach\u2019s door change four times \u2014 more than he has been to the playoffs.\n\nHe\u2019s the longest-tenured Redskins player, a steady voice at defensive end whose time with the team is likely over. Since coach Jay Gruden was hired in 2014, Golston\u2019s playing time, role and results have all been reduced. He\u2019s 32 now, and at the end of his contract. Golston doesn\u2019t know if he will be back.\n\nSEE ALSO: Redskins hire Greg Manusky as outside linebackers coach\n\nHe does know what he has seen, though. Ten years at Redskins Park is enough tumult for multiple lifetimes. Golston had his best statistical season in his first year, playing for Joe Gibbs as a surprise sixth-round pick in 2006. He watched Robert Griffin III\u2019s ascension and demotion. In 2014, when the whole season appeared sponsored by Ringling Brothers, Golston held court with the media. Other players shouted at him not to talk. He felt he could have a level conversation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s drama in any NFL locker room, and any NFL city,\u201d Golston said. \u201cWhen you win, that\u2019s what you talk about, is the winning. When you lose, you talk about the losing and the reasons why you lost. When you continue to lose, you talk about the drama \u2026 you find stuff to report about that has nothing to do with football. That\u2019s where the drama is created. When you have football guys and football people and everybody on the same page, there is no drama, because it\u2019s all about what happens on the field.\u201d\n\nContrary to many assertions and assumptions, Golston said there were those types of players in the locker room even when things were bad. But, when the team is 4-12, 6-10, 5-11, 3-13 and 4-12 again, with a blip of glory in between, people don\u2019t want to hear that. If they did, they wouldn\u2019t believe it anyway.\n\n\u201cThis is a results-driven business and nobody cares about good guys in the locker room and this and that,\u201d Golston said. \u201cThey just want a winner. But, it\u2019s good to win with guys that care about it.\u201d\n\nGolston\u2019s on-field college history was an accurate measure for his career in Washington. He broke a leg in 2001, then played 14 games his freshman season at Georgia in 2002. In 2015, Golston broke a hand and missed one game, though he returned to the game in which he broke the hand. Often, like many NFL players, he toughed it out. Golston accepted that part of the job some time back. It\u2019s becoming more difficult as the years mount.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make it up my steps at night, right now,\u201d Golston said.\n\nGolston lived through the two years between Griffin roaring to the fore and the team\u2019s subsequent failings. Tangible on-field football concerns rarely made headlines. Everything else did. This past season, when Washington surprisingly won the hapless NFC East, he saw more steadiness in the locker room.\n\n\u201cYear in, year out, it\u2019s different,\u201d Golston said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a mindset to create atmosphere. I think we have the right guys in this locker room to create that, but it doesn\u2019t carry over just by carrying over. It takes a lot of time, energy and effort to create that.\u201d\n\nGolston signed a three-year contract in 2013, the longest of his career, and is now an unrestricted free agent. Moving into the offseason, he will focus on healing and grappling with what he prefers in his diet. Pizza, wings, french fries, hot dogs \u2014 lots of hot dogs \u2014 would often be on the menu if he wasn\u2019t trying to manage his weight. He doesn\u2019t feel stress from his uncertain football future.\n\n\u201cAll I anticipate right now is getting healthy and putting myself in the best situation, no matter what happens,\u201d Golston said. \u201cThose things will take care of themselves. I love this organization. Been here 10 years. It\u2019s all I know. This is a special place, so you definitely want to be a part of the good moments. I think there\u2019s some really nice days ahead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Golston has spent his entire career with the Redskins, joining the team as a sixth-round pick out of Georgia in 2006, and made just his third playoff appearance this season.
