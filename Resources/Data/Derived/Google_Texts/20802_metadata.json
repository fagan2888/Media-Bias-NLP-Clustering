Aside from positioning Castro as a possible vice presidential candidate in 2016, it\u2019s a promotion that his Republican home state couldn\u2019t offer anytime soon.\n\nDemocrats, led by architects of Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, are pouring millions of dollars into the state to put Texas back in play on the electoral map.\n\nNo Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas in two decades, the longest streak of political futility in the U.S. But the state\u2019s booming Latino population \u2014 Latinos since 2000 have counted for roughly two out of every three new residents \u2014 has given Democrats hope. At the same time, a turnaround could still be far off.\n\n\u201cIf we do what we\u2019re supposed to do, we\u2019re going to be OK in Texas for a long, long time,\u201d said Lionel Sosa, a Republican former adviser to President George W. Bush who helped the GOP capture 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004.\n\nCastro is an up-and-comer described as an \u201call-star\u201d Friday by Obama, who in 2012 picked him to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. A Mexican-American whose mother was a civil rights activist, Castro at the time was coming off an easy re-election in San Antonio, where he said he saw himself staying as mayor until term limits pushed him out in 2017.\n\nThose close to him said joining Obama\u2019s Cabinet now after spurning a previous opportunity wasn\u2019t a matter of Castro growing pessimistic or impatient about his future in Texas.\n\n\u201cA lot of people take the longer view of the demographic changes occurring in our state. I think that (Castro) has always known both the demographic and political realities in Texas,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, another of the party\u2019s rising stars in San Antonio. \u201cBut opportunity is only going to knock so many times when the president of the United States asks you to serve.\u201d\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Castro would become one of the highest-ranking Latino officials in the federal government. Two years ago, Castro spoofed the constant speculation about his political ceiling with a video in which he asks his iPhone\u2019s digital personal assistant, Siri, whether he should run for higher office.\n\n\u201cAy, mijo,\u201d the phone answered back in Spanish. \u201cOf course you should.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "HUD nominee Julian Castro leaves uncertain Texas future behind", "title": "HUD nominee Julian Castro leaves uncertain Texas future behind", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/24/hud-nominee-julian-castro-leaves-uncertain-texas-future-behind/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__20140525_A6_ND25CASTROp1.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__20140525_A6_ND25CASTROp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-24T17:43:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:49:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92e8\"", "article_summary": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro was long viewed as biding his time: waiting out shifting demographics in Texas until 2018, when a Latino Democrat with a national profile could be a formidable contender for governor.\nInstead, the 39-year-old rising political star has accepted President Barack Obama\u2019s offer to become the nation\u2019s housing secretary.\nNo Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas in two decades, the longest streak of political futility in the U.S.\nAside from positioning Castro as a possible vice presidential candidate in 2016, it\u2019s a promotion that his Republican home state couldn\u2019t offer anytime soon.\nThose close to him said joining Obama\u2019s Cabinet now after spurning a previous opportunity wasn\u2019t a matter of Castro growing pessimistic or impatient about his future in Texas."}
