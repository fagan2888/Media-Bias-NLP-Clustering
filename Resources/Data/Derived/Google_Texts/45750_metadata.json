(AP) \u2014 Many Americans assumed the Confederate flag was retired for good after governors in South Carolina and Alabama removed it from their statehouses this summer and presidential candidates from both parties declared it too divisive for official display.\n\nBut people still fly it, and not just in the South, despite announcements by leading flag-makers and retailers that they will no longer sell products showing the secessionist battle flag.\n\nSome who display it are motivated by pride in their ancestry or enthusiasm for Southern history. Others see it as a symbol of their right to challenge to authority in general, and the federal government in particular. And some have hoisted Confederate flags in recent weeks precisely because it\u2019s generating controversy again.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take it out on the flag \u2014 the flag had nothing to do with it,\u201d said Ralph Chronister, who felt inspired to dig out his old Confederate flag, which is decorated with a bald eagle, and hang it from his weather-beaten front porch on a heavily traveled street in Hanover, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against black people; I\u2019ve got nothing against anyone else,\u201d said Chronister, 46, who was raised in Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m just very proud of my Southern heritage. That\u2019s why I fly it.\u201d\n\nAn uncomfortable tolerance of the Confederate flag in mainstream society was upended in June when photos circulated on the Internet revealing that a young white racist charged with killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, had posed with the Confederate symbol. Dylann Roof also burned a U.S. flag for good measure.\n\nJohn Russell Houser \u2014 the right-wing extremist who shot 11 people, two of them fatally, before killing himself in a Louisiana movie theater in July \u2014 also flew a large Confederate flag outside his home, and hung a Nazi swastika banner outside a bar he owned in Georgia.\n\nMany politicians echoed South Carolina\u2019s Republican Gov. Nikki Haley to remove the Confederate flag after the Charleston killings, describing it as a relic that belongs in museums but not on official display. Haley called it \u201ca deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said \u201cit shouldn\u2019t fly anywhere.\u201d\n\nHundreds of Confederate flag wavers gathered this weekend in Georgia\u2019s Stone Mountain Park, home to the huge \u201cConfederate Memorial Carving\u201d featuring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, General Robert E. Lee and General Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson.\n\nBut the flags aren\u2019t hard to find in places like Hanover, a factory and farm community about six miles north of the Mason-Dixon Line that saw action during the Civil War\u2019s Gettysburg campaign.\n\nOne flies from a pole on the main road into town, by a National Rifle Association banner. Another was hung from a second-floor apartment, directly above a day-care downstairs.\n\nJeremy Gouge, a 44-year-old roofer, says family ties to the South are why he proudly flies a Confederate battle flag on a pole in his front yard, on a quiet residential street not far from Chronister\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s things that happened to slaves and things. I can\u2019t control what other people have done,\u201d Gouge said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next flag that someone is going to say, \u2018We don\u2019t like that flag, let\u2019s take that one down?'\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hardly the only place where Confederate flags fly in northern states. Hannah Alberstadt said she was surprised to see many of them in her hometown of Girard in northwestern Pennsylvania.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some Americans refuse to give up on Confederate flag", "title": "Some Americans refuse to give up on Confederate flag", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Some Americans refuse to give up on Confederate flag", "title": "Some Americans refuse to give up on Confederate flag", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/02/some_americans_refuse_to_give_up_on_confederate_flag/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/confederate-flag.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some Americans refuse to give up on Confederate flag", "title": "Some Americans refuse to give up on Confederate flag", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/confederate-flag.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Scolforo and Jeffrey Collins", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Nikki Haley to remove the Confederate flag after the Charleston killings, describing it as a relic that belongs in museums but not on official display.\n'\u201dIt\u2019s hardly the only place where Confederate flags fly in northern states.\nAnd some have hoisted Confederate flags in recent weeks precisely because it\u2019s generating controversy again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the next flag that someone is going to say, \u2018We don\u2019t like that flag, let\u2019s take that one down?\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take it out on the flag \u2014 the flag had nothing to do with it,\u201d said Ralph Chronister, who felt inspired to dig out his old Confederate flag, which is decorated with a bald eagle, and hang it from his weather-beaten front porch on a heavily traveled street in Hanover, Pennsylvania."}
