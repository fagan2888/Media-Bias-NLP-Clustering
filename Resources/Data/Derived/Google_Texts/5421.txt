A Topeka man facing charges linked to an explosion in his car that injured his 4-year-old son has pleaded not guilty and waived his preliminary hearing.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that through his attorney, Jacob Daniel Schell entered not guilty pleas on Friday in Shawnee County court to charges, including aggravated battery of the child and criminal use of explosives.

Schell has been released on bond.

Schell's son, Roman, who was 4 at the time, was injured July 5, 2015, when he was in a car with Schell and a sack containing explosives blew up in the child's lap.

An arrest affidavit says that a sack containing "several improvised explosive devices" blew up in the lap of Schell's son. A Kansas Highway Patrol trooper said the ignition source was a "little cap gun" the boy was using.

Schell described what exploded as leftover fireworks from a campout. But the state fire marshal's agent said damage to this vehicle was consistent with commercially made or homemade explosives.

Rather than scheduling a jury trial Friday, attorneys asked the judge to schedule a status conference because they're negotiating a non-trial resolution.

The status conference is March 11.
