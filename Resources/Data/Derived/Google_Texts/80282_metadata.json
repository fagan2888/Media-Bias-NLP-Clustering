Half the people in the country believe we are on the \u201cwrong track.\u201d Barely a fifth say we are on the right track. And 64 percent\u2013nearly two thirds of those surveyed\u2013said the country is \u201cout of control.\u201d\n\nPolitico notes there is no single issue that has left voters feeling anxious, but rather \u201cthe accumulation of disparate fears has created a sense of pessimism and frustration across the midterm landscape.\u201d Only 36 percent said they were \u201cconfident that the U.S. is in a good position to meet its economic and national security challenges.\u201d\n\nHow will this pessimism play on election day? \u201cIt\u2019s not a good atmosphere for incumbents,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, a Republican who represented Northern Virginia in Congress for 14 years and is considered an expert on elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s traditionally not good for incumbents [on the second mid-term of a two-term presidency,] but it\u2019s much worse than normal. Democrats may not do that badly on Senate races because they have tended to run better campaigns in recent years. But it\u2019s going to be tough for them. Voters are not happy and haven\u2019t been happy for some time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politico, terrorism tops the list of Americans\u2019 fears\u2013a full 84 percent view ISIS as a \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cvery serious\u201d threat to national security.\n\nHealthcare and Ebola are second and third. More than 57 percent of voters believe their health care costs will rise under Obamacare, but only 7 percent think they will decrease.\n\nFewer than one in four told pollsters they have \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d the government is \u201cdoing everything it can\u201d to prevent Ebola. A third have \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnot much\u201d confidence and 39 percent say they have only \u201csome confidence.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about their general outlook on the United States, 49 percent of respondents said they are \u201cgenerally optimistic\u201d and 50 percent said they were \u201cgenerally pessimistic.\u201d\n\nThe poll surveyed 840 likely voters in \u201cthe states and districts with the most competitive Senate and House races, as ranked by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\u201d It has a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you live in America today and you believe things are terrific, you\u2019re \u2026 well \u2026 deeply in the minority.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "If you live in America today and you believe things are terrific, you\u2019re \u2026 well \u2026 deeply in the minority.", "title": "A Majority of Voters Think the Country Is \u2018Out of Control\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141020_PoliticoPoll_Scanlon.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1w9bLWP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "If you live in America today and you believe things are terrific, you\u2019re \u2026 well \u2026 deeply in the minority.", "title": "A Majority of Voters Think the Country Is \u2018Out of Control\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141020_PoliticoPoll_Scanlon.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-22T09:36:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "poll, politico, voters, elections, 2014 election, midterms, midterm elections"}, "article_summary": "More than 57 percent of voters believe their health care costs will rise under Obamacare, but only 7 percent think they will decrease.\nHalf the people in the country believe we are on the \u201cwrong track.\u201d Barely a fifth say we are on the right track.\n\u201cIt\u2019s traditionally not good for incumbents [on the second mid-term of a two-term presidency,] but it\u2019s much worse than normal.\nIf you live in America today and you believe things are terrific, you\u2019re \u2026 well \u2026 deeply in the minority.\nDemocrats may not do that badly on Senate races because they have tended to run better campaigns in recent years."}
