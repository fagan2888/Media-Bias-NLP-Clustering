Sarah Schweickart also placed second in both the 100 butterfly and 500 freestyle, helping lead LHS to an overall-runner up showing in the team standings with 385 points, behind first-place Fossil Ridge (528).\n\nTeams make the exchange during the 200-yard medley relay at Saturday's Loveland Invite. (Sean Star/ Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nWullink's plenty familiar with the type of meet many of her club teammates are at right now in Texas, so Saturday provided a nice change of pace.\n\n\"I really like these meets because the competition is a little bit more reasonable,\" Wullink said. \"I feel like I'm winning more, and they're a lot more fun. With club, it's a lot more competitive, and this is more of a fun-competitive.\"\n\nThe strongest race of the day for Loveland was the breaststroke, where the Indians went 2-3-4. Kelsie Modlich led the way in 1:13.08 to finish second, ahead of Wullink in third (1:47.28) and Jessica Gauvin in fourth (1:19.16).\n\nAnd without the pressure of actually trying to win the meet, King-Schleiger was able to mix up the lineup in some other events, and the results were encouraging.\n\n\"Some of these girls stood out to me in that they were in events we haven't put them in that they should be in, which was McKenna Shuler in the 200 IM,\" King-Schleiger said of Shuler, who finished second in 2:34.81. \"She was fantastic.\"\n\nLoveland wasn't the only local team competing, though, as Mountain View's divers also were on hand. Kelsey Vreeman led the way with a six-dive score of 247.60 to place second, earning her the first of two required state cuts in the event. It was one of her best scores ever, and it came as a bit of a surprise to the MVHS junior.\n\n\"I was really nervous because it was all 5A schools, and we were the only 4A, so a lot of people were expecting not to get that high of scores,\" Vreeman said. \"This meet was huge for me. I'm really proud that I was able to pull off those dives and finish second.\"\n\nLoveland's Logan English also put together a productive day on the diving board, totaling 207.80 points to finish fifth. That score originally looked to be enough to qualify for state, but upon further review, the degree of difficulty wasn't high enough.\n\nHowever, considering English didn't hit the state cut until her final dive at conference last year, it was still certainly something to build on with plenty of meets still to go.\n\n\"Today was an easier lineup, it's still early in the season so I'm still learning my harder dives. I'm focusing on form instead of difficulty, so that helped,\" English said. \"Now I need higher difficulty for sure.\"\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050 ext. 512, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/rhpreps\n\nLoveland Invite\n\nAt Mountain View Aquatic Center\n\nTeam scores \u2014 1.
