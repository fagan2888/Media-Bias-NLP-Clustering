Nearly 100 million electronic health records were compromised, according to a December 2015 IBM Security report, blowing away the number of data breaches that occurred in the computer services and financial sectors.\n\nThe increase in stolen records was staggering, says John Kuhn, senior threat researcher at IBM Managed Security Services. Between January 2011 and December 2014, health care accounted for just 0.63 percent of the records compromised across all industries, the IBM report found. That figure ballooned to 33.6 percent for January through October 2015.\n\n[Top Six Actions You Need to Make to Manage Hospital Cybersecurity Risks]\n\n\u201cLast year, it seemed like criminals finally caught on to the value of this data,\u201d Kuhn says. \u201cWhen you think about health care records, that\u2019s your entire life \u2014 your health history, your address, your past addresses, your Social Security number \u2014 everything.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why medical records fetch $50 or more on the black market, compared with a dollar or less for credit card numbers. \u201cCredit card data expires,\u201d Kuhn explains. \u201cHealth care data is yours for life, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re after it.\u201d\n\nInsurers experienced the largest number of health care breaches last year, but hospitals were not immune. The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society surveyed 297 security professionals for its 2015 Cybersecurity Survey, mostly from hospitals. Sixty-eight percent of respondents reported that their organization experienced a significant security event in the recent past. Sixty-four percent said the cyberattack was carried out by somebody outside the organization.\n\nCyberattacks come in several forms. The term hackers commonly refers to programmers or engineers who have expertise in computer technology and can penetrate a security system. Social engineering involves conning a business\u2019s employees into inadvertently providing information that allows the bad guys to get past privacy mechanisms. Nation-state actors work for foreign governments to obtain digital information on a rival country\u2019s agencies, defense programs and major businesses. Hacktivists do all of the above to promote a social or political agenda.\n\n[Do you know what phishing, whaling or industrial espionage means? Here's a guide.]\n\nThe most common online attack in health care is called phishing and often involves an email that appears to come from a legitimate organization, such as a bank. The email includes a link to a convincing-looking but fake website. The purpose, as always, is to obtain confidential information, in this case, primarily credit card data. Last year, phishing accounted for 36 percent of external attacks on online health care data.\n\nPhishing has become much more sophisticated in the last couple of years. Gone are the days when someone half a world away would send an email promising \u2014 usually in poor English \u2014 that the recipient would earn millions of dollars for helping the individual out of a financial or legal problem just by sending along personal financial account information.\n\nNowadays, the message could look as though it comes from the hospital president, the facility\u2019s parent company, the help desk or the human resources department. \u201cIt has the official logo, looks very professional and might have graphics,\u201d says Lee Kim, director of privacy and security for HIMSS North America. \u201cYou can\u2019t necessarily tell by quickly glancing that it\u2019s phishing.\u201d\n\nHospitals are stepping up to the challenge. Eighty-seven percent of the HIMSS survey respondents said cybersecurity increased as a business priority in the past year. They\u2019re using a combination of technology, policy and training to lessen the chances that bad actors will succeed, and they\u2019re formulating plans to mitigate the damage if they do.\n\nTechnology as a barrier\n\nWhen it comes to phishing, some older technologies continue to be crucial prevention tools. Strong spam filters that can be updated quickly and easily as new threats emerge are essential, as are firewalls and malware.\n\nAt Munson Healthcare in Michigan, 95 percent of all external emails are filtered out immediately because they\u2019re either identified as spam or malicious, says Ryan Winn, information systems director of security and privacy. Nevertheless, a bad email occasionally gets through because vendors haven\u2019t yet added it to their spam filters.\n\nThat vulnerability means the old tools are no longer enough. \u201cThere are other technologies that you put in place [to create] a multilayered defense,\u201d says John D. Halamka, M.D., chief information officer for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston.\n\nCriminals often count on victims to click on email links to sites that either are laden with malware or that encourage the person to enter his username and password. \u201cSpam filters and virus detection look at emails for content; often the content may be fine but the link that you click is actually to a known virus site,\u201d Halamka says. So Beth Israel Deaconess uses a third-party service that screens the URLs employees click on and only allows access if the website is deemed appropriate and safe.\n\nPrevention tools are just one weapon in the technology arsenal. Increasingly, hospitals are turning to detection tools, which spot intrusions. In the HIMSS survey, 64 percent of security professionals said they use audit logs of each access to patient health and financial records. Nearly 55 percent have intrusion detection systems and 49 percent use network monitoring tools.\n\nMunson uses monitoring software and runs audits that look for a variety of suspicious activities. \u201cIf someone were to log in and start randomly looking at patient records, we\u2019d find them pretty quickly,\u201d Winn says. \u201cIf you assume you\u2019re OK but you\u2019re not monitoring for it, you just can\u2019t state that you\u2019re doing your job from a HIPAA perspective.\u201d\n\nAlerts allow his department to quickly investigate and act if an intrusion occurs. Winn estimates that a warning fires every other day. \u201cMost of the things we investigate turn out to be nothing, but we look at every alert that pops up and try to make sure there is no deeper issue,\u201d he says.\n\nAn essential part of network security is knowing where all the data are. Patient data could be on a number of information systems, on hard drives, laptops and phones. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know where the jewels that you\u2019re trying to protect are, it\u2019s very difficult to protect them,\u201d Kuhn says. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of getting granular visibility into the network.\u201d\n\nControls on access to information based on user need also protect patient and financial information in the case of a breach, Halamka notes. A criminal who successfully scams a hospital maintenance worker, for example, still won\u2019t have access to patient data if strong user controls are in place.\n\nUser privilege controls, called for under HIPAA, are especially important because criminals have started targeting hospital executives in sophisticated phishing schemes, a practice known as whaling. At Beth Israel Deaconess, the CEO doesn\u2019t have access to clinical data, so a phishing scam directed at him won\u2019t net patient medical records. Similarly, the chief medical officer doesn\u2019t have access to the financial systems. \u201cWe do everything we can to segregate access to data based on role,\u201d Halamka says.
