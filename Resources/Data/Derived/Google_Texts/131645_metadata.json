Before we can talk about this case, here is a little background.\n\nWhen grandma packs we feel safer\n\nThree years ago, almost to the day, I wrote an article that discussed, guns, self- defense and conceal and carry permits in California and around the country. State laws are not uniform. Vermont residents can go almost anywhere with a gun strapped to their side while in New York, a 64 ounce soda represents a clear and present danger. Check out this greatness in journalism.\n\nWhat is a \u201cconceal and carry?\u201d\n\nCarrying and concealing a weapon, in particular a handgun, is considered \u201cnormal\u201d in the majority of states in our country provided you have the appropriate training and licensure. This is not a license to use your weapon, just to conceal and carry it. If you find yourself in a situation where you used your gun, you\u2019d be arrested as the criminal you may be until the truth gets sorted out. Those who care about you will be relieved that you survived a life threatening ordeal. As the saying goes, \u201cit\u2019s better to be judged by 12 than carried by six.\u201d\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous article, you should never buy a gun or obtain conceal and carry licensure if you cannot visualize ever using your gun. Training and practice are necessary to increase your comfort and proficiency.\n\nLandmark case\n\nYou might have missed the recent landmark decision in California regarding conceal and carry if you\u2019ve been focused on the many challenges in our world: the violence in Syria and the Ukraine, Obamacare or the further alleged sexual adventures of a couple of our local supervisors , Adam Hill and Bruce Gibson, whom I am almost sure are not an item, but I try not to judge.\n\nThe U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Peruta, et al. v. San Diego County (February 13, 2014). The issue involved the existing conceal and carry permit process which made it virtually impossible to get a license. \u201cWriting for the majority, Judge Diamuid O\u2019Scannlain concluded that \u2018San Diego\u2019s good cause law permitting requirement impermissibly infringes on the Second Amendment right to bear arms in lawful self-defense\u2019\u201d (Washington Times). The court said that San Diego\u2019s requirement that an individual must prove a need to defend themselves before obtaining a permit was unconstitutional.\n\nThe ruling stated in part,\u201dThus, the question is not whether the California scheme (in light of San Diego County\u2019s policy) allows some people to bear arms outside the home in some places at some times; instead, the question is whether it allows the typical responsible, law-abiding citizen to bear arms in public for the lawful purpose of self-defense. The answer to the latter question is a resounding \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nToday in San Diego\n\nSo, you might ask, what is San Diego\u2019s official response to all of this? On Feb. 21, the sheriff of San Diego published his decision and included a note to the county supervisors. The sheriff in his note stated that \u201cthe opinion provides clear guidance in the issuing of CCWs (Conceal and Carry License) in California.\u201d However, he is buying time by saying that he isn\u2019t going to switch to the new process until the court\u2019s judgment becomes final. Not everyone is waiting. The sheriff of Orange County has already announced that she will comply with the ruling.\n\nCCWs in San Luis Obispo County?\n\nI had the opportunity to sit down with our Sheriff Ian Parkinson over coffee at the Nautical Bean, and he offered a candid appraisal of the CCW permit process, where he sees it going, and some of his concerns. Here are some summary points I made based on our conversation:\n\nIan is a supporter of the Second Amendment and has doubled the number of CCW permits issued during his watch compared to his predecessor. He has a dual concern: Citizens should have the rights given to them by the Second Amendment, but he is also working to keep everyone safe.\n\nHe believes that the job of law enforcement is to enforce the laws but not to write them. He will support the 9th Circuit Court\u2019s decision when it becomes final.\n\nCurrently, the sheriff\u2019s office processes a number of CCW requests that had previously been handled by some of our cities. When the court\u2019s ruling is finalized, Ian plans to shift part or all of the process back to the cities. (I suspect it is a workload consideration.)\n\nI asked Sheriff Parkinson if he had any concerns about the ruling. His concern seemed genuine when he said he worried about giving a license to someone who checks out fine, but who really isn\u2019t.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nA couple of things we already know. First, the sheriff in San Diego has announced that he will not appeal the court\u2019s decision. If you go to his department\u2019s web site and check the news for Feb. 21, you can read all about it, plus his note to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. Second, the Washington Times reported that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals believed their rulings would stand up to Supreme Court scrutiny, should anyone wish to take the decision in that direction.\n\nIt has been reported that the California Attorney General is not likely to cross the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling. One wonders if the California Legislature could pull itself together to adopt the CCW processes already in place in one of the other 34 states that have already addressed this issue. I suspect that some California legislators have placed themselves so far out of the mainstream on this issue, they\u2019ll find it impossible to accept the opinions of a court of law. That\u2019s what elections are for.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times suggested a novel solution\u2013legalize \u201copen carry.\u201d This would allow citizens to wear their handguns openly as in the Old West. Although this sounds fun, the real benefit of conceal and carry to a community is that the bad guys don\u2019t know who is armed and who is not. By the way, bad guys like to prey on places that are called \u201cgun free zones.\u201d Some recent examples include movie theaters (the bad guy passed a bunch of theaters in Colorado to find one with a gun-free sign), restaurants, colleges and schools.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I am still uncomfortable about giving certain politicians the right to carry. I guess we have to take the good with the bad.\n\nStay safe.\n\nLike CalCoastNews on Facebook and get links to opinions and more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION By ROGER FREBERG It\u2019s been an interesting year and its only February.
