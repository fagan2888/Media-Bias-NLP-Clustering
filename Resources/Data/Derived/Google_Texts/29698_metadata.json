This is an actual conversation with him\u2014I asked him if it was ok if I shared. He is not suicidal to my knowledge, nor has he ever been to my knowledge. Yet, that\u2019s precisely the point, right? We never know and so we shouldn\u2019t wait until we think that they might be. This is also dedicated to ALL of our little brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, biological or not\u2014I think they all can benefit from reading this. Chelsey and I started this series talking about \u201cuncomfortable conversations.\u201d This is the last in the Suicide Chronicles series and hopefully a model for one of those uncomfortable conversations for those who have difficulty with them\u2014almost all of us. Thank you for reading the series and Chelsey and I truly appreciate being able to have these important conversations with you. Love you all.)\n\nAntonio,\n\nFirst and foremost, I love you, nephew. You\u2019re one of the main reasons that I do what I do.\n\nI remember when I was 13 years old, my little brother (young uncle) Sutah Gyiyo was born\u2014the brownest, spiky-haired-est, baby-smelling-est, Indian-est boy that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I\u2019m of mixed blood and I love all of my ancestry. But at that moment when I saw him, I knew that I couldn\u2019t be anything else but Native because this little Indian boy was going to look up to me no matter what I did. I resolved at that moment\u2014the first time I held him\u2014that I wasn\u2019t ever going to drink alcohol or do drugs. Not for moral reasons, but because I am well aware of our peoples\u2019 history with those things and it seems like they affect Native men worse. People who say that Natives do not have a particular problem with alcohol are lying\u2014we do and we see it. Those are mainly people from outside of our communities who say that because they don\u2019t deal with our truths and many times are ashamed of our truths. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of -we just gotta work hard to fix it. Therefore, I resolved at that moment that I was going to try hard to give Sutah and you and ALL my nieces and nephews a different example than I had.\n\nThank you for giving me the strength to do what I do, nephew.\n\nSince your uncle Sutah was born, I\u2019ve been blessed with many nieces and nephews. You\u2019re one of the youngest, one of the babies. I\u2019ve been blessed with so many for so long that I\u2019ve now seen cycles repeat themselves. I\u2019ve observed the continuation of poverty, alcoholism, and drug abuse. I know that if nobody takes strong steps to change those unhealthy behaviors, they are almost guaranteed to keep repeating themselves in our communities. Fortunately, I\u2019ve also witnessed how families can change patterns of unhealthy behavior IF they really work and remain faithful and pay attention every single day to make sure that those spirits of bad health and drugs and alcohol don\u2019t creep into their families.\n\nIt can happen. We can change our worlds. It just takes hard work.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019ve seen how the spirit of suicide affects Native men within our communities. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s pride or testosterone or what, but it seems like that spirit attacks us men more than it does Native women. That\u2019s not to take away from the Native women who are suffering and who have suffered from this spirit of suicide\u2014but for right now, my concern is with you, Nephew. I\u2019m speaking to you because I see so many of your friends, young men just like you, listening to that spirit of suicide\u2026 giving in to that spirit of suicide.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that the spirit of suicide lies to you, nephew. You think that he wants you. But he\u2019s not after you. He wants to hurt your family and the ones you love. He\u2019s after your family\u2019s spirit. He\u2019s after your community\u2019s spirit. Where there is one suicide, rest assured there will be more. And you\u2019ll be helping others to kill themselves and to keep that painful cycle going.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing: suicide doesn\u2019t kill the person\u2019s spirit who commits suicide. That\u2019s too easy. It kills their whole family\u2019s spirit.\n\nIf you were to give in to that spirit of suicide, your family will be wondering what they did wrong for years, and maybe even for the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll want to have happy memories of you, but they won\u2019t be able to. Every single time your mom smiles thinking about you, it will quickly turn into tears and sobbing and uncontrollable sadness. There will be no more purely happy thoughts about you because every thought will lead back to \u201cI must have done something incredibly wrong because why else would he leave us like this?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d be hurting, in the deepest way, those who love you the most.\n\nThat\u2019s not a Native man\u2019s role. I say that because you\u2019re almost a man\u2014you\u2019re becoming a man. A Native man\u2019s role is to protect his family. That always has been our role, since before time was called \u201ctime.\u201d A Native man\u2019s role is to feed and protect his family\u2014to be someone that helps make his family\u2019s lives easier. Our role is to take care of our mothers and dads as they become older. Our roles are not to cause our parents and family eternal heartache. It is not to make them question themselves and to feel guilty for the rest of their lives. NO! The men in our communities always had to think of family first\u2014if they didn\u2019t, our communities suffered and sometimes disappeared. The men did everything they could to survive and avoid death because they knew their families needed them for protection.\n\nThey were necessary.\n\nYou are necessary.\n\nYou\u2019re loved.\n\nThere are times when you won\u2019t feel necessary or loved, but you are. That bad feeling will pass. I promise\u2014it always does. When you think your parents hate you or your girlfriend hates you or that the world hates you\u2026they don\u2019t. That\u2019s part of the spirit of suicide\u2019s lies. It will tell you that they hate you but they don\u2019t. They love you. There will be rain and hardship and difficulty, but our people have worked through rain and hardship and difficulty for tens of thousands of years.\n\nYou need to understand that you can get through anything - just like our people always have - if you just allow yourself time and forgiveness and space. Don\u2019t listen to the lies\u2014this hard time will pass. I promise.\n\nIt will get better.\n\nIf I can help, I am here. If I can not help, I am still here and we can work it out together.\n\nI love you.\n\nYour Uncle,\n\nGyasi\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS: Chelsey Luger is from the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe & Standing Rock Lakota Nation in North Dakota and focuses on spreading ideas for Native health and wellness.
