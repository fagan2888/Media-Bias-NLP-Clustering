Cold and flu season is upon us, but that annual concern is getting less attention this year because of two other illnesses: tuberculosis and measles.

A TB outbreak in Charlotte is forcing a lot of people to get a quick education in the disease, and a measles outbreak that started in California has re-ignited the debate over vaccines. We talk about the science of how these illnesses are spread, and hear public health advice on containing and preventing them from State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso.

Later in the hour, how global warming is exacerbating military conflicts around the world. Gen. Gordon Sullivan, U.S. Army (retired) will be speaking on that topic on Thursday evening at Norwich University as part of the Todd Lecture Series. Sullivan is a member of the CNA Military Advisory Board, which issued a report in May that called global warming a "catalyst for conflict." Sullivan previews his lecture for Vermont Edition.

And we read your comments to the program. Here is a link to the Women's Small Business Program Personal Financial Empowerment class.
