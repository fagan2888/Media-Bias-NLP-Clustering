Justin Morneau is making slow progress as he attempts to return from a neck injury and concussion symptoms, but the Rockies’ veteran first baseman said Monday that he still hopes to return this season. Morneau, 34, also said he’s not thinking about retiring from baseball.

“It’s been my plan all along (to return),” Morneau said. “I didn’t think I would be going through everything if it wasn’t for the purpose of trying getting back on the field. When that is, I don’t know. But I’m hopeful and that’s my goal.”

Morneau has been hitting off a tee in the batting cage over the last few days.

“I hope I make a little faster progress now,” Morneau said. “I’m feeling better for the most part.”

Morneau has been out of action since sustaining a concussion and a cervical neck sprain in a May 13 game against the Los Angeles Angels.

“The neck is more the issue than anything,” he said. “When I swing — how violent the torque is on it — (discomfort) is still there a little bit.”

The Rockies put Morneau on the 60-day disabled list on July 7.

Morneau missed substantial time in 2010 and 2011 after sustaining a concussion when he slid into the knee of Toronto Blue Jays infielder John McDonald during a game on July 7, 2010.

In 27 games before going on the disabled list this season, Morneau hit .290 with three home runs and nine RBIs. Last year, he was the National League batting champion when he hit .319 for the Rockies. Morneau is in the final year of a two-year, $12.5 million contract.
