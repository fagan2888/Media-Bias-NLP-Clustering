Hirschfeld and President of the Board of Trustees James M. Waterbury was sent just after a jury issued a mixed verdict in Labrie\u2019s case Friday afternoon. The jury determined Labrie was not guilty of felony sexual assault but found him guilty of three related misdemeanor charges, and a felony charge of luring a minor through a computer. He will have to register as a sex offender and could face up to 11 years in prison.\n\n\n\nThe girl alleged Labrie raped her in a remote area of the school after sending her an invitation to participate in the \u201csenior salute\u201d ritual, a tradition in which upperclass boys are said to compete to \u201cscore\u201d with as many girls as possible before graduation. Labrie said he and the girl never had sex. From the jury\u2019s mixed verdict, it seems that they believe the pair had sex, but were divided on whether it was consensual.\n\nIn the letter to the St. Paul\u2019s community, Hirschfeld and Waterbury said the sexual \u201ctraditions\u201d discussed during the trial were not actually part of the school\u2019s history. \u201cMany terms, including \u2018senior salute\u2019 and \u2018score\u2019 that are part of the student vernacular, have been discussed as part of the trial,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThere is no place for inappropriate and hurtful behavior that disrespects any member of our School. Conduct that is damaging to the fabric of our community and inconsistent with our values has never been\u2014and will not be\u2014tolerated.\n\n\u201cThe Rector first heard about the \u2018senior salute\u2019 in the spring of 2013,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cIt is not a decades-old \u2018tradition\u2019 as some have alleged.\u201d\n\nThe St. Paul\u2019s leaders also noted that the incident and subsequent trial could be considered a wake-up-call about the role of social media in romantic relationships, and how teenage sexual activity has changed in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWe have been painfully reminded of the fact that social media can provide an adult-free space for negative student culture to form and perpetuate itself,\u201d Hirschfeld and Waterbury wrote. \u201cWe have learned that what was once termed \u2018dating\u2019 or \u2018courting\u2019 behavior has been inverted in some instances from our traditional sensibilities\u2014sexual contact is now seen as the point of origin of many relationships, not a part of an emotionally developed relationship.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He notes the perils of 21st-century dating", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "They note the perils of 21st-century dating", "title": "St. Paul's School Leaders Respond to Rape Verdict", "url": "http://time.com/4015514/st-pauls-school-rape-verdict-response/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "They note the perils of 21st-century dating", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "St. Paul's School Leaders Respond to Rape Verdict"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "crime, owen labrie, prep school, rape, school, sexual assault, st pauls", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "st pauls, owen labrie, rape, sexual assault, prep school, school, crime"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Rector first heard about the \u2018senior salute\u2019 in the spring of 2013,\u201d the letter continued.\nIn the letter to the St. Paul\u2019s community, Hirschfeld and Waterbury said the sexual \u201ctraditions\u201d discussed during the trial were not actually part of the school\u2019s history.\n\u201cMany terms, including \u2018senior salute\u2019 and \u2018score\u2019 that are part of the student vernacular, have been discussed as part of the trial,\u201d the letter said.\nHe will have to register as a sex offender and could face up to 11 years in prison.\nThe leaders of St. Paul\u2019s School wrote a letter to the school community Friday, denouncing the culture of sexual competition described in the trial of Owen Labrie, who was accused of raping a 15-year-old girl while they were both students at the school."}
