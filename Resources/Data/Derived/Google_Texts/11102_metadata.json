(JNS) are up $4.44, or 39.65%, at $15.50, after the company this morning reported that Bill Gross, founder of bond giant PIMCO, has left his post as chief investment and joined Janus.\n\n\u201cToday, with a mixture of excitement and sadness, I am announcing that I have decided to join Janus Capital Group and end my association with PIMCO,\u201d Gross said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut now, after having spent considerable time serving in senior management, it is a time for me to reduce executive and people management responsibilities at a larger firm and focus on the pure aspects of portfolio management at a smaller one. Janus is the right fit at the right time in my career \u2013 and my life.\u201d\n\nJanus said Gross will manage a recently launched Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund and related strategies, and will join Myron Scholes, Ph.D., and other members of the Janus team focused on global asset allocation. Mr. Gross\u2019 employment will be effective September 29, 2014 and he will begin managing the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund and related strategies effective October 6, 2014.\n\nShares of Digital Ally, Inc.

The initial order is valued at approximately $200,000, with subsequent follow-on orders expected.\n\nDGLY has a most recent quarter price-to-book and t-12 price-to-sales ratio of 6.59 and 2.66, respectively.

The nosedive came after the specialty pharmaceutical company provided an update on a recently held a teleconference with representatives from the Food and Drug Administration on the plans for the resubmission of the company\u2019s New Drug Application (NDA) for Zalviso\u2122.\n\n\u201cThe discussion with the FDA was productive,\u201d Richard King, president and CEO of AcelRx said in a press release.\u201dOver the coming months we will prepare, submit and finalize with the FDA the protocols required to complete this work. Assuming timely review by the FDA on the protocols, we anticipate being able to complete the work with a target to refile the Zalviso NDA in the first quarter of 2015. However, depending on feedback from the FDA, the timing of the filing of the NDA could be later than the first quarter of 2015.\u201d\n\nIn the past 52 weeks, shares of Redwood City, California-based firm have traded between a low of $6.04 and a high of $13.64.
