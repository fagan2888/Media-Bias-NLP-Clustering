Panama City Beach lit up Saturday's sky with its 12th Annual Christmas Parade.

Around 70 floats strolled down Front Beach Road making their way into Pier Park.

From the Panama City Beach Police Department, to dancers hitting the streets, just about everyone was at this year's parade. There was even a special Christmas shoot-out by our very own NewsChannel 7 staff.

Parade goers said each year the parade just keeps getting bigger and bigger, spreading more holiday cheer.

"Christmas will be here before we know it and we just want everyone to know that the best you can ever give anyone is yourself your time and people on this beach are so wonderful to give themselves especially this time of the year, but we need to do this all year long," said parade participant Jane Brewer.

"We put this on to pay back to the community for all the help they've done to help us out over the years and this is our way of saying thank you and Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and all that," said Panama City Beach Optimist Club member David Blanchard.

Money raised from the parade goes back to the Panama City Beach Optimist Club. Optimist club members said every dime will go straight to several of their charities, including their cancer fund.
