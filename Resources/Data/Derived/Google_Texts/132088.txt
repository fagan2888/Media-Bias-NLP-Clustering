About a year ago Debi Young, a wife of a local law enforcement officer was in bed worried about her husband who was out patrolling during all hours of the night. It was then that Young decided to create the group "Bay County LEOW".

The group stands for Law Enforcement Officer Wives, and has roughly 150 members.

The purpose of the group is for law enforcement wives to support one another and raise awareness in the community.

Saturday, some of the members of "Bay County LEOW" gathered at Porter Park in Lynn Haven to create spring break survival bags for law enforcement officers in Bay County, that they will distribute to officers on the beach Saturday, March 12.

The bags are filled with goodies and late night necessities that have been donated from the community.

"They're excited that we're getting together and bonding and forming a group and a relationship," said Debi Young, President of "Bay County LEOW," "And they're excited that we're getting involved with them and meeting the other agencies." It's not just Bay County, we have Lynn Haven involved, Panama City, Panama City Beach and we're looking for Parker and Springfield to get on board as well," said Young.

The wives said once they told their husbands about the group, they were all thrilled with the idea.
