Video games have toyed with that idea for many years, and a new interactive historical epic called Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue tries it once again.\n\nIn this game, you theoretically turn full-on bad guy. The man you control, an 18th-century Irishman named Shay Patrick Cormac, switches allegiance from the freedom-loving Assassins, the good guys of this popular series, to the Templars, their nemeses. We\u2019ll be the enemy this time. We\u2019ll hunt Assassins.\n\nMost big-budget video games present more heroic fantasies. Be the righteous American soldier. Be the treasure hunter. Be the heavyweight champion. Be Batman. Succeed.\n\nTo play as a bona fide bad guy in a game is rare, not that this is quite what is happening in Rogue or its sister game, Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity, which was released on the same day last week by Ubisoft. Both games still allow players to feel like the good guy.\n\nIn Unity, you\u2019re Arno Dorian, an Assassin who at times crosses his flawed order. He does it for the woman he loves, a Templar. It\u2019s a fitting plot for a game set in Paris at the time of the French Revolution, itself a drama of faltering ideals. The vividly rendered city brings the strife home, with its thousands of computer-controlled protesters packing the squares, its to-scale landmarks and its walk-on appearances by Robespierre and Napoleon.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Rogue, we\u2019re overt rebels. Cormac sneers at his order\u2019s double standards. The Assassins help free slaves from the French in Haiti while they help the French crown in the North Atlantic. Later, he deems his brotherhood guilty of an atrocity that kills hundreds of innocent people. Soon, under the player\u2019s control, he is attacking the very characters we\u2019ve sided with in so many Assassin\u2019s Creed games before.\n\nIn both Unity and Rogue, we are at least shaken from the moral certitude gamers can usually assume justifies their efforts. Few games, especially the blockbusters, ask players to consider that they\u2019re wrong or to feel good about what they\u2019re doing while identifying with an unsavory group. But they could. Think of games as potential engines of empathy, transporting players into the shoes of those with whom they\u2019d usually disagree.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEight years ago, the game designer and critic Ian Bogost imagined an abortion video game that might do something like that. It would be made up of mini-games, each about an aspect of the abortion debate. One might be about being a teenage mother, another about testing how a city would run if all birth control were illegal. Each game would be weighted to favor one side of the issue. The overarching abortion game would detect how the player felt about the issues and serve up a mini-game that would most challenge the position and then another to challenge that one. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game that changes your opinion,\u201d he had said at the time, \u201cbut tells you why people have the opinion they do.\u201d\n\nMr. Bogost never made his game, but in the years since, we\u2019ve seen the occasional interactive experiment in experiencing a different perspective. The most notorious and disturbing might be the \u201cNo Russian\u201d level in the 2009 blockbuster Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The game let players control an undercover American agent who was embedded with a terrorist group as it massacred civilians in an airport. That mission was skippable, and some players reported playing it nauseously, their virtual rifles pointed to the ground. More nobly, the 2012 Assassin\u2019s Creed III let players experience the American Revolution through the eyes and behind the tomahawk of a half-Mohawk Assassin. Our playable hero buddied up with Sam Adams and mostly killed redcoats but also raged at the callous treatment of his people by that most unconventional of big-budget video game antagonists, George Washington.\n\nA problem that designers face, however, is that even if you are going against your own values and beliefs, the games need to feel, to some extent, good. It\u2019s not an aspirational thing. It\u2019s tactile. The actions that players take \u2014 the percussion of fingers on controller buttons, the responsiveness of what then happens on the screen \u2014 need to be satisfying, like the plucking of a guitar string to sound a note or the smashing of a hammer against a nail to strengthen a frame. A well-programmed game makes the landing of a plane, the construction of a castle, the firing of a machine gun or even the slashing of a sword through an orc\u2019s neck in some way pleasing to the virtual touch.\n\nRogue\u2019s solution to this problem is novel. It takes what used to feel good for Assassin\u2019s Creed players and puts it in the computer-controlled hands of our newfound Assassin enemies. They can perform the signature moves we ourselves used in earlier Assassin\u2019s Creed games. Now it is you, as Cormac, who must worry about Assassins jumping down from the rooftops to stab you or leaping out of a cart of hay to suffocate you.\n\nThe creators of Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue send a clear signal to players: You did that kind of thing before to someone like the character you\u2019re controlling now and felt good about it. You feel righteous now. Maybe you weren\u2019t the good guys before, after all.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20141116173807, "twitter": {"description": "In two new video games in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, you have the task (and pleasure) of fighting against your former comrades.", "title": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue and Unity, Moral Tables Are Turned", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/arts/assassins-creed-rogue-and-unity-moral-tables-are-turned.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003238195"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/17/arts/ASSASIN/ASSASIN-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/arts/assassins-creed-rogue-and-unity-moral-tables-are-turned.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003238195", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/arts/assassins-creed-rogue-and-unity-moral-tables-are-turned.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/videogames", "hdl_p": "Games Let You Become Your Own Worst Enemy", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/video-games/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 16, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Assassin's Creed Unity (Video Game)", "keywords": "Computer and Video Games,Assassin's Creed Rogue (Video Game),Assassin's Creed: Unity (Video Game),Assassin's Creed Unity (Video Game)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Stephen Totilo", "SCG": "video-games", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "17assassin", "byl": "By STEPHEN TOTILO", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In two new video games in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, you have the task (and pleasure) of fighting against your former comrades.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/17/arts/ASSASIN/ASSASIN-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "In two new video games in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, you have the task (and pleasure) of fighting against your former comrades.", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Video Games", "modified": "2014-11-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/video-games/index.jsonp", "tag": "Assassin's Creed Unity (Video Game)", "published": "2014-11-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141117160627, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/arts/assassins-creed-rogue-and-unity-moral-tables-are-turned.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/17/arts/ASSASIN/ASSASIN-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In two new video games in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, you have the task (and pleasure) of fighting against your former comrades.", "title": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue and Unity, Moral Tables Are Turned"}, "pdate": 20141116, "des": "Computer and Video Games", "col": "Critic\u2019s Notebook", "articleid": 100000003238195, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue and Unity, Moral Tables Are Turned", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/17/arts/ASSASIN/ASSASIN-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a45\"", "article_summary": "Video games have toyed with that idea for many years, and a new interactive historical epic called Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue tries it once again.\nThey can perform the signature moves we ourselves used in earlier Assassin\u2019s Creed games.\nSoon, under the player\u2019s control, he is attacking the very characters we\u2019ve sided with in so many Assassin\u2019s Creed games before.\nIt takes what used to feel good for Assassin\u2019s Creed players and puts it in the computer-controlled hands of our newfound Assassin enemies.\nMore nobly, the 2012 Assassin\u2019s Creed III let players experience the American Revolution through the eyes and behind the tomahawk of a half-Mohawk Assassin."}
