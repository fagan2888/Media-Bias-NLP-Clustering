easy to run for president and why think he's he's going to do due diligence to figure out if he is or is that the topic is make a final decision on its ok we had an editorial in the paper to die in recent days Sara and cause a lot of ... controversy was called Romney recycle than we ask ... if Mitt Romney is the answer ... what is the question ... hadn't ... he ... would he say ... well reason for him to run you know I I think part of the challenge that has been thus far the TRT deletion of rationales well and process articulation stand the the important thing is to think about the substantive case ... for why Governor Romney on a run again and I think that he articulated that are begin to articulate on Friday night in Sandy a go which is a combination of a foreign policy rationale an economic rationale by the hit but those two things together ... there is a compelling case to be May is gonna come out against Obamacare because that was one of the biggest problems with his campaign last time around why I think Apsel in unity as he said on Friday night opposition to Obamacare is one of the most important elements of the campaign going forward in and the reality is that Republicans by the way half to happen replacement for food created in the studio LP Beren against the need to be fair I think what the president did was to take elements of what happen in
