Vermonters interested in pursuing a career as a physician assistant have always had to get their training outside the state. But that may change next year, if the College of St. Joseph’s in Rutland is able to launch the state’s first graduate PA program.

Physician assistants are midlevel health providers that typically practice medicine alongside a supervising physician.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for physician assistants is expected to increase 38 percent from 2012 to 2022. Experts say that’s due to an aging population, a shortage of primary care doctors and an increase in the number of insured people under the Affordable Care Act.

An abundance of jobs, the relatively short schooling - two years of post graduate training required to become a PA - and annual salaries in the $80,000 to $90,000 range have made it a highly desirable field.

But there aren’t enough accredited programs to meet demand.

Catherine Gemmiti, a licensed Physician Assistant who has experience launching and directing several PA programs, was hired this fall by the College of St. Joseph’s in Rutland to develop and direct what will be the first graduate PA program in Vermont.

Gemmiti says historic buildings in Proctor formally owned by the Omya Corporation will provide spacious classrooms.

“The biggest challenge right now to starting any clinical programs,” she says, “is obtaining clinical sites.”

Because besides labs and classrooms, students also need hands-on training in a variety of health care facilities.

Gemmiti she says in the short time she’s been in Rutland she’s been excited by potential opportunities to collaborate with different facilities across the state and region.

She says the program will need to be accredited, but if all goes well, the first class of 26 students will begin in the summer of 2016.

Gemmiti says the college hopes to gradually expand the program to 40 students.
