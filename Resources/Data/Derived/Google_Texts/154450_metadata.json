E. Tammy Kim\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Two days after the Illinois legislature failed to meet its May 31 budget deadline, Greg Kusek chatted with a mobile outreach worker below a chilly North Side underpass. \u201cThis is my first time like this,\u201d says Kusek, 60, who lives in a tent and has lacked stable housing for seven years. \u201cYou flop around from place to place. That\u2019s the homeless life.\u201d He suffers from major depression and anxiety that long went untreated. Because he was uninsured, he used to receive care only in moments of crisis, first through the emergency room, then the psych ward. About a year ago, he obtained Medicaid, giving him regular access to a doctor, and when he finally gets a room in supportive housing \u2014 his caseworker from the mental-health nonprofit Thresholds says he is on the verge of being approved \u2014 Medicaid will fund on-site counseling and medication management to ensure his mental and physical well-being. Kusek only recently became eligible for public health insurance, though he has lived at or below the federal poverty level for years. In most states, traditional Medicaid doesn\u2019t cover low-income childless adults ages 19 to 64. But the Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed this rule and, beginning in 2013, gave states billions in federal dollars to insure adults with incomes of up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. It also made general improvements to mental-health and substance-abuse coverage for all Medicaid recipients. Illinois is among the 29 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that haven\u2019t fought Medicaid expansion, so ACA adults like Kusek are now technically covered through federal funds. Still, cuts to state and city programs can undermine the social infrastructure \u2014 housing, street outreach and local clinics \u2014 on which their health depends. And Illinois now faces a more than $6 billion deficit, which means major budget reductions are imminent.\n\n\u2018Illinois was going in a very good direction. [But now] we are in for a period of austerity.\u2019 John Bouman Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law\n\nIn February, Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican multimillionaire touting a \u201cturnaround\u201d agenda, announced a plan to shrink the state Medicaid program by $1.5 billion, the largest single-year cut in history. His proposed budget took millions more out of homeless youth services, community mental health programs and even burial funds for the poor. The legislature rejected these terms and proposed a $36 billion wish list but with no new revenue sources and a $3 billion gap. As it stands, there is no compromise and no money to keep the state going as of July 1. The budget impasse is already hitting individual providers: Last week Catholic Charities said it would close two shelters and two children\u2019s centers because of uncertainty in funding. The bigger worry is that an eventual compromise will snip and slash and thus unravel the progress made since the ACA. \u201cIllinois was going in a very good direction,\u201d says John Bouman, the president of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law. Now, it seems, \u201cwe are in for a period of austerity. Even if there are new revenues, it probably won\u2019t be enough to avoid cuts.\u201d\n\nEricka Hill of the nonprofit Teen Living Programs has been helping homeless young adults obtain Medicaid under the ACA. E. Tammy Kim\n\nTwo years ago, the nonprofit Teen Living Programs (TLP) opened a youth drop-in center on Chicago\u2019s South Side. It's located in a church basement on the corner of a broad, tree-lined street, a visible rejoinder to neighborhood stereotypes of shootings and blight. The center gives 18-to-24-year-olds a place to hang out during the day, wash up, eat two meals and access health and legal services. The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless estimates that 25,000 unaccompanied youth live on their own in Illinois, half of them in Chicago. Indeed, many of the young people at TLP are homeless \u2014 on the streets or staying at shelters that boot them out during the day. In early June, 20-year-old Brianna Williams arrived at the drop-in center from the Ujima Village night shelter. She played video games, ate lunch and spoke with an attorney about health insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable here,\u201d she says. \u201cThe staff have known me since I first came to Chicago, and I was using drugs then. A lot of people would say I\u2019ve changed. TLP has helped me out. I used to be an aggressive person, and now I\u2019m mellow.\u201d Before the ACA Medicaid expansion, she would have aged out of public health insurance at 19, despite her poverty and chronic health conditions (epilepsy, hearing loss, severe ADHD and depression). \u201cIt was one of the populations that fell through the cracks, because at 18, they stopped qualifying for \u2018kids care\u2019 [state children\u2019s health insurance] but didn\u2019t qualify for anything else,\u201d says Ericka Hill, manager of the TLP drop-in center.\n\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, right, has proposed draconian cuts to close a $6.2 billion state budget gap. Rich Saal / The State Journal-Register / AP\n\nRauner\u2019s office holds the state legislature \u201cand the Chicago political machine\u201d responsible for the \u201c$6 billion hole,\u201d according to an email from Catherine Kelly, his press secretary. With respect to health care, she says, \u201cmany people served by the services being discontinued are now covered by the expansion of Medicaid and coverage of mental health under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d A wide range of life-saving services is at stake: In Chicago, mobile visits to homeless, mentally ill adults and shelters and transitional-living programs for youths, to name a few. In May the state legislature wrote most of these safety-net services and a number of Medicaid benefits back into its proposal, spurred by the protests of advocates and economists who fear the long-term monetary and social costs of neglect. \u201cWe understood there have to be cuts to live within our means,\u201d says Democratic state Rep. Greg Harris, who chairs the Appropriations\u2013Human Services Committee. Yet he emphasizes that \u201cthe expansion of Medicaid and getting more people into early, preventive care have begun to pay off. For the first time, what we\u2019re proposing for fiscal year \u201916 is the exact amount of spending for fiscal year \u201915, and we have several hundred thousand more people on the rolls.\u201d Republican state Rep. Patti Bellock, who is also on the committee, acknowledges the \u201cheart-wrenching decisions over the Medicaid program\u201d but says that \u201cthe Democrats put forward a spending plan and no revenue. It\u2019s not a budget. What I\u2019m concerned about is the false hope, especially in social services and health care.\u201d At this point, no one seems to know what will happen. The legislature\u2019s plan quells the worst-case-scenario fears of mental-health and housing advocates, but still shaves Medicaid reimbursement rates by 2.25 percent, meaning providers would be paid less for their work. This worries patients and physicians, especially at smaller facilities. Illinois\u2019 rates are already at the low end of the national range.\n\n\u2018[Medicaid expansion has] really been a godsend for us \u2026 It felt good not having to say, \u2018Well, you have to wait two months for an appointment.\u2019\u2019 Nieal Marie Smith case manager, the Night Ministry", "article_metadata": {"description": "With major cuts imminent, the state's hard-won health care gains since the Affordable Care Act could unravel", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/11/illinois-budget-crisis-could-turn-obamacare-success-story-into-tragedy.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/6/11/illinois-budget-crisis-could-turn-obamacare-success-story-into-tragedy/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "With major cuts imminent, the state's hard-won health care gains since the Affordable Care Act could unravel", "title": "Illinois budget crisis could turn \u2018Obamacare\u2019 success story into tragedy"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/6/11/illinois-budget-crisis-could-turn-obamacare-success-story-into-tragedy/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "description": "With major cuts imminent, the state\u2019s hard-won health care gains could unravel", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Illinois budget crisis could turn \u2018Obamacare\u2019 success story into tragedy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, longform, Chicago, Illinois, Mental Illness, Poverty, Obamacare, Homelessness, Economy, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd724f\"", "article_summary": "Bruce Rauner, right, has proposed draconian cuts to close a $6.2 billion state budget gap.\nWhat I\u2019m concerned about is the false hope, especially in social services and health care.\u201d At this point, no one seems to know what will happen.\nAnd Illinois now faces a more than $6 billion deficit, which means major budget reductions are imminent.\nThe Chicago Coalition for the Homeless estimates that 25,000 unaccompanied youth live on their own in Illinois, half of them in Chicago.\nBecause he was uninsured, he used to receive care only in moments of crisis, first through the emergency room, then the psych ward."}
