Health advocates cheered this week when Oklahoma officials announced they were considering expanding Medicaid in that state. Oklahoma has been missing out on millions of federal health care dollars with its decision to not participate in the Affordable Care Act. But with ballooning budget problems and rising health care costs in the state, opting out no longer seems viable. And that means Texas could be next, reports member station KUT.

During a meeting at the Capitol in Austin yesterday, advocates said nowâ€™s the time for Texas officials to revisit the issue. Texas is lucky to not be in the same situation as Oklahoma.

Texas got a special deal from the federal government that prevented health costs from rising as much. But the deal is temporary, and advocates told lawmakers last week that Texas needs to start thinking about expanding Medicaid, too. But without the same economic squeeze as Oklahoma, it could be a tough sell.
