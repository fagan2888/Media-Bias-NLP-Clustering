COURTESY OF LEE & ASSOCIATES Related article \u00bb\n\nKaiser Permanente is moving forward to build a new medical complex in Murrieta.\n\nThe health care organization signed the $9.3 million land deal in Mapleton Park Centre for a hospital, treatment and diagnostic center, medical office building and central energy plant in the city\u2019s medical and technology corridor, according to Mike Tingus, principal of Lee & Associates.\n\nTingus, one of several brokers who represented the sellers in the transaction, Eliott Kahn Investments and the Goldman Family Properties, said Kaiser identified the 37.6 acre land site for the 824,500 square-foot health care complex about a year ago.\n\nKaiser\u2019s proposed complex is in a prime spot, Tingus said in a telephone interview.\n\nIt will front Interstate 215 at Keller Road, where a new interchange will be built.\n\nRELATED: Kaiser has 25-year timeline for proposed medical complex\n\nKaiser officials have said they will build the complex in phases. First on the construction list is an 80,000-square-foot medical office building with a pharmacy, laboratory, imaging services and urgent care facility. A central energy plant is next, followed by the hospital and diagnostic center.\n\nKaiser Permanente officials could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to all of us in real estate that hospitals have developed an enormous appetite for expansion since the passage of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Tingus said. Kaiser\u2019s decision to develop a new medical center reflects those expectations, but also the potential in this part of Inland Southern California for population growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great deal,\u201d Tingus said. \u201cNow, there will be two great medical anchors for that community.\u201d\n\nLoma Linda University Medical Center\u2013Murrieta is about three miles away. The medical center will supplement Kaiser\u2019s existing offices in Wildomar and Temecula, according to a press release.\n\nContact the writer: 951-368-9423 or dgruszecki@pe.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "DEBRA GRUSZECKI", "content_author": "DEBRA GRUSZECKI", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "business, medical, kaiser, center, tingus, complex, care, permanente, murrieta, land, new", "content_section": "business", "content_title": "MURRIETA: Kaiser Permanente inks $9.3 million land deal", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "DEBRA GRUSZECKI", "section": "business", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-07 14:55:27", "sailthru.title": "MURRIETA: Kaiser Permanente inks $9.3 million land deal", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nr510d-b88454143z.120150707145527000gunao46f.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nr510d-b88454143z.120150707145527000gunao46f.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-07-07", "Description": "Business: MURRIETA: Kaiser Permanente inks $9.3 million land deal | medical, kaiser, center, tingus, complex, care, permanente, murrieta, land, new", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "Business: MURRIETA: Kaiser Permanente inks $9.3 million land deal | medical, kaiser, center, tingus, complex, care, permanente, murrieta, land, new", "title": "MURRIETA: Kaiser Permanente inks $9.3 million land deal", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nr510d-b88454143z.120150707145527000gunao46f.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/medical-772660-kaiser-center.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "medical, kaiser, center, tingus, complex, care, permanente, murrieta, land, new", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nr510d-b88454143z.120150707145527000gunao46f.10.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb259\"", "article_summary": "MURRIETA: Kaiser Permanente inks $9.3 million land deal Share Pin It More Galleries Architectural rendering of the Kaiser Permanente medical center in Murrieta was released this week as Lee & Associates announced the $9.3 million land purchase for the hospital, medical office, diagnostic and treatment center and central energy plant.\nCOURTESY OF LEE & ASSOCIATES Related article \u00bbKaiser Permanente is moving forward to build a new medical complex in Murrieta.\nThe medical center will supplement Kaiser\u2019s existing offices in Wildomar and Temecula, according to a press release.\nKaiser Permanente officials could not be reached for comment.\nKaiser\u2019s decision to develop a new medical center reflects those expectations, but also the potential in this part of Inland Southern California for population growth."}
