Five acres of undeveloped land adjacent to the Long Beach Airport will soon be home to a medical office park that is to house several of the city's leading outpatient healthcare groups.

The 90,000 square-foot Douglas Park Medical Office Park broke ground Saturday amidst the occasional structures of 161-acre Douglas Park, which is currently being developed into a massive master-planned, mixed-use business complex. Urbana Development was the first to buy land at Douglas Park and is now constructing its contemporary medical offices that take advantage of the former Boeing site's ideal location.

“The Douglas Park Medical Office Park medical campus is the only new development in the area offering Class A medical buildings, ample surface parking and is in a central location for six major hospitals in the area," said Richard Lewis, managing member at Urbana. "We worked with local doctors to develop medical office space that responds to their needs. The response has been very strong with interested tenants ranging from pediatric care to ambulatory surgery, imaging and many other medical specialties.”

Separate physicians’ groups will independently own each building with Long Beach Gastroenterology Associates and Greater Long Beach Endoscopy Center/Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA) ambulatory surgery center already signed on to occupy Building One, and Laser Skin Care Center Dermatology Associates will occupy Building Two. 65,000 square feet of the total 90,000 square feet of office space has been pre-leased.

Construction begins this month and is expected to be complete in November, with full occupancy anticipated by early next year.

Douglas Park Medical Office Park is located at 3833 Worsham Avenue. For more information including leasing, visit douglasparkmedical.com
