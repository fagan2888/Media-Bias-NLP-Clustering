Today\u2019s total is double that amount spent on a midterm that, as The Washington Post quips, \u201calmost no one is paying attention to.\u201d And this year\u2019s spending is \u201csix times more than what had been spent in the 2010 midterms,\u201d reported Open Secrets.\n\nThe estimate includes the hundreds of millions of dollars of undisclosed spending, something that Open Secrets calls \u201cdark money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that in the 2014 midterm cycle, three times more dark money spending has already been reported to the Federal Election Commission than at this point during the 2012 presidential campaign. In that election, 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations and 501(c)(6) trade associations, which do not have to disclose their donors to the public, spent more than $310 million,\u201d the Center reported.\n\nMore nonprofit organizations filed under these two sections are spending money on candidate-targeted ads more than ever before, reported the Huffington Post.\n\nThey are different from Super PACs that are explicitly political and required to reveal donors and spending.\n\nHowever, this election cycle, \u201cmore money is being spent on advertising by the secret donors than by \u2018super PACs,\u2019\u201d reported the The New York Times.\n\n\u201cFifty-five percent of broadcast advertising in the midterm elections has been paid for by groups that do not fully disclose their donors, according to an analysis by The New York Times of advertising data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe major source of this undisclosed money is no surprise -- the political network run by billionaire oligarchs Charles and David Koch. Their network raised and distributed $400 million in the 2012 elections. This time around, the six groups at the center of the Koch operation (have already spent) at least $53.5 million (in September) just on candidate-specific ads,\u201d continued the Huffington Post.\n\nSome of the dark-money-funded ads are accused of distorting facts or outright lying about issues and candidates.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics and the fact-checking group politifact.com of the Tampa Bay Times revealed the lies a group called Freedom Partners -- a trade association funded by the Koch brothers -- told about Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley.\n\n\u201cThe ad claims that Braley \u2018takes tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry\u2019 who \u2018stand to make billions\u2019 from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201c\u2018Call Bruce Braley,\u2019 a masculine voice says in the ad. \u2018Tell him: Stand with Iowa. Stop supporting Obamacare.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs it turns out, the accusations in the ad are false,\u201d reported the Center.\n\nThere are people who question the ethics of anonymous campaign financing and the safety organizations feel to use other unethical tactics.\n\nHowever, Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, said the rise of donor-protecting organizations is a response to Democratic attacks on the Koch brothers and other big money donors.\n\nThis election\u2019s flood of secret money is \u201cat the center of a debate over the line between free speech and corruption\u201d and likely to impact the upcoming 2016 presidential campaign, reported The New York Times.\n\ndsutton@deseretnews.com | Twitter: @debylene", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chronicle-independent.com/archives/34265/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/chronicleindependent/article/2014/10/27/Dark_Money.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This year\u2019s midterm election will be the most expensive in history, ringing up a $4 billion tab, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 research site opensecrets.org.", "title": "Record 'dark money' spending in 2014 midterm elections"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Record 'dark money' spending in 2014 midterm elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e7b\"", "article_summary": "More nonprofit organizations filed under these two sections are spending money on candidate-targeted ads more than ever before, reported the Huffington Post.\nThe estimate includes the hundreds of millions of dollars of undisclosed spending, something that Open Secrets calls \u201cdark money.\u201d\u201cWe know that in the 2014 midterm cycle, three times more dark money spending has already been reported to the Federal Election Commission than at this point during the 2012 presidential campaign.\nHowever, this election cycle, \u201cmore money is being spent on advertising by the secret donors than by \u2018super PACs,\u2019\u201d reported the The New York Times.\nThey are different from Super PACs that are explicitly political and required to reveal donors and spending.\nStop supporting Obamacare.\u2019\u201cAs it turns out, the accusations in the ad are false,\u201d reported the Center."}
