Seven programs in six states \u2014 Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina \u2014 were closed, affecting about 7,000 kids.\n\nBut then, two heroes emerged.\n\nJohn and Laura Arnold, philanthropist billionaires from Texas, announced last week they would spend $10 million to keep those Head Start programs running until the end of the month.\n\nThe private donations were praised by the government and by groups that support Head Start.\n\n\u201cThe Arnolds\u2019 most generous act epitomizes what it means to be an angel investor; they have selflessly stepped up for Head Start children to ensure their path toward kindergarten readiness is not interrupted by the inability of government to get the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order,\u201d said Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association.\n\nThe shutdown only affected states with programs that received a grant on Oct. 1, but if the shutdown rolls into November almost all other states will also see their Head Start programs\u2019 subsidies cease, affecting an estimated 86,000 children.\n\nJoy Pullman, an education policy analyst at the Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank based in Chicago, said it\u2019s just more inconsistencies on education policy from the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not kind to families to cut it in the middle of the year, but really that program should be phased out because taxpayers are not getting a return on their investment for that program,\u201d she said.\n\nSince 1965, taxpayers have spent $180 billion on Head Start \u2014 more than 1,000 times the amount of the Arnolds\u2019 gift. Despite all that cash, a 2012 HHS audit found little to no long-term benefits to children who went through the program.\n\nBut if the Arnolds want to spend their own money on supporting Head Start for a few weeks, it\u2019s nice of the government to let them. Other offers of assistance have not been so well received \u2014 even to the point of stubbornness.\n\nThose national parks \u2014 The Grand Canyon in Arizona and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota \u2014 bring enough tourists to their respective states to count as major economic drivers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to turn away this kind of revenue,\u201d wrote Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in a letter to the National Parks Service, offering state dollars to keep the park open to tourists. \u201cTo do so will unnecessarily devastate the employment of thousands of Arizonans who depend on the Grand Canyon \u2013 especially when there is a common sense alternative.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the town of Tusayan, Ariz., presented Brewer with a check for $426,500 as a partial payment to open the park.\n\nNationally, the closure of the national parks is costing $76 million per day, according to an assessment of the parks\u2019 economic value to local communities done by the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees.\n\nAnd even on an individual scale, offers of help have been rudely turned aside.\n\nChris Cox, a South Carolinian who took it upon himself to mow the lawn on the National Mall, was ordered to cease and desist by law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe whole thing seems wildly inconsistent. It\u2019s great that private donations have been able to fill a gap in government services during the shutdown \u2014 whether you think those services should be provided by the government in the first place, or not \u2014 so why can\u2019t states and private donors do the same with the national parks? Florida Gov. Rick Scott declined to use state money to reopen the three national parks in the Sunshine State.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not return calls for comment. Neither did the National Park Service.\n\nSo if you\u2019re playing along at home, here\u2019s how it seems to work: offer to mow the grass in front of the Lincoln Memorial, get threatened with arrest.\n\nOffer to spend $10 million to keep 7,000 in a federal day care program, get hailed as a hero.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 43 of 51 in the series Shutdown 2013 \u00a0 By Eric Boehm | Watchdog.org They\u2019re from the government and they don\u2019t want your help.
