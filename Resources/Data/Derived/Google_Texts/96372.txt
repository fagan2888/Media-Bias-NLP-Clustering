The NFL’s Super Bowl-winning Baltimore Ravens will get $130,000 from Maryland taxpayers to push ObamaCare, according to documents obtained by Judicial Watch.

The team signed the deal with the state after the NFL turned down a White House plea to peddle ObamaCare nationwide.

Maryland officials appealed directly to the home team, announcing in early September that the Ravens would help market the state’s ObamaCare exchange.

Both parties refused to offer specifics at the time, and Judicial Watch filed a FOIL request for details.

The Super Bowl champs will be on TV, radio, the team’s official website, newsletter and social media platforms selling the problem-plagued health care plan to a skeptical public.

The NFL’s earlier decision was a blow to the White House’s efforts to sell the so-called Affordable Care Act.

“We have responded to the letters we received from members of Congress to inform them we currently have no plans to engage in this area and have had no substantive contact with the administration about [ObamaCare’s] implementation,” the league said in a statement several months back.
