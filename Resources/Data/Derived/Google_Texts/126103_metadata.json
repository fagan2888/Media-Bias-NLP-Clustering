Including the dental plans - which HHS said was a mistake \u2014 gave the impression that marketplace enrollment had passed the 7 million target. It had not.\n\nWhen Burwell was nominated in April to be HHS secretary, she pledged to bring a greater openness and management structure to the agency. She\u2019s generally made a good impression among lawmakers in her first six months on the job, but the flap over the enrollment numbers has created a new round of criticism for HHS about accuracy and transparency. Issa\u2019s House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee has asked Marilyn Tavenner, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid administrator who first announced the wrong number, to testify early next month.\n\nBurwell in her email reiterated that the inclusion of dental plans in the enrollment tally was a mistake.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: this mistake was unacceptable,\u201d Burwell wrote. \u201cOne of our most important obligations to the American people is to report information and data accurately. We are working quickly to understand what happened and to improve our processes in order to prevent similar mistakes from occurring again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "This comes after the House GOP discovered that officials had overstated Obamacare enrollment.", "title": "Burwell soliciting ideas for 'increased transparency' at HHS", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/sylvia-mathews-burwell-hhs-health-human-services-113135.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/24/141124_burwell_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,HHS,Sylvia Mathews Burwell", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "This comes after the House GOP discovered that officials had overstated Obamacare enrollment.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4380\"", "article_summary": "When Burwell was nominated in April to be HHS secretary, she pledged to bring a greater openness and management structure to the agency.\nPOLITICO Pro Burwell soliciting ideas for 'increased transparency' at HHSHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is looking for ways to make her department more transparent after the House GOP discovered that officials had overstated Obamacare enrollment.\nBurwell emailed senior HHS leadership Sunday night asking them to work toward a \u201cculture of increased transparency, ownership, and accountability.\u201d She asked them to meet with their staff and cull good ideas.\n\u201cLet me be clear: this mistake was unacceptable,\u201d Burwell wrote.\nIncluding the dental plans - which HHS said was a mistake \u2014 gave the impression that marketplace enrollment had passed the 7 million target."}
