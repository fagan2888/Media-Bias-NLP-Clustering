In Utah, that includes about 60,000 people who currently are ineligible for Medicaid or federal help paying for coverage.\n\nState officials have weighed the offer for three years but have failed to agree on a plan, with Republicans in Utah\u2019s House of Representatives citing fears that the state\u2019s share of the cost could balloon and Washington may not follow through on its offer to pay for the program down the road.\n\nSenate President Wayne Niederhauser said he thinks Utah\u2019s Senate will get behind whatever plan the House passes.\n\nLawmakers have floated four plans this year but have not voted on any idea.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the proposals:\n\n- Rep. Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, told The Salt Lake Tribune that he\u2019s working on a proposal that would cover about 16,000 people. The Deseret News reports that would include mostly childless adults who are homeless or on the verge of homelessness. It would also help some Utah\u2019s poor who have mental illness or addictions. The plan would cost Utah about $20 to $30 million, while the federal government would kick in about $70 million. Dunnigan said Utah\u2019s share could be paid for by an increased tax on hospitals. The Utah Hospital Association has said hospitals would benefit from expanding the program and are willing to help pay some of the cost.\n\n- Another proposal from Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, would cover 125,000 people. Ward\u2019s proposal is similar to one that Republican Gov. Gary Herbert proposed last year but House lawmakers later rejected. Participants would get private insurance and government subsidies to help pay their costs. The program would be open to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 a year for an individual. Ward\u2019s proposal would cost roughly $50 million a year. He\u2019s proposed the cost be partially paid for with a tax on hospitals and a new 86.5 percent tax on e-cigarettes so they\u2019re taxed like tobacco products.\n\n- Salt Lake City Republican Sen. Brian Shiozawa, who has been one of the key Medicaid negotiators in the Utah Senate, has proposed a plan this year that\u2019s similar to Ward\u2019s but would cover fewer people. His plan would expand Medicaid up to the poverty line, which is about a $12,000 annual income for an individual. His plan hinges on the federal government offering to cover 90 percent of the cost, but the Obama administration has repeatedly said it won\u2019t do so unless states cover everyone earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level.\n\n-Sen. Gene Davis, a Democrat from Salt Lake City, has a proposal that calls on Utah to expand its traditional Medicaid program by simply opening it up to everyone earning 138 percent of the poverty level. It\u2019s what the Obama administration has envisioned but is considered a nonstarter among most Republicans in Utah\u2019s Legislature. It would cover 125,000 people and cost Utah about $51 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah lawmakers have begun kicking around a few proposals to expand Medicaid in the state - including pared-back plans favored by GOP leaders and more expansive ideas that mirror past proposals from Democrats and Utah's governor.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/15/utah-lawmakers-have-4-medicaid-expansion-plans-thi/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Utah lawmakers have begun kicking around a few proposals to expand Medicaid in the state - including pared-back plans favored by GOP leaders and more expansive ideas that mirror past proposals from Democrats and Utah\u2019s governor.", "title": "Utah lawmakers have 4 Medicaid expansion plans this year"}, "twitter": {"title": "Utah lawmakers have 4 Medicaid expansion plans this year", "description": "Utah lawmakers have begun kicking around a few proposals to expand Medicaid in the state - including pared-back plans favored by GOP leaders and more expansive ideas that mirror past proposals from De", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "In Utah, that includes about 60,000 people who currently are ineligible for Medicaid or federal help paying for coverage.\nThe plan would cost Utah about $20 to $30 million, while the federal government would kick in about $70 million.\nIt would cover 125,000 people and cost Utah about $51 million.\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Utah lawmakers have begun kicking around a few proposals to expand Medicaid in the state - including pared-back plans favored by GOP leaders and more expansive ideas that mirror past proposals from Democrats and Utah\u2019s governor.\nHis plan would expand Medicaid up to the poverty line, which is about a $12,000 annual income for an individual."}
