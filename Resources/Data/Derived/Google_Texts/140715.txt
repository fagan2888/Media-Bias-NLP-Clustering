ABC political analyst Cokie Roberts had a sharp retort for Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich’s defense of Obamacare Sunday on This Week.

After Reich professed his belief that people would “stop complaining” as enrollments in the online health care exchange increased and that a year from now, all would be well, Roberts pointed out the implementation of the employer mandate could lead to mass cancellations of employer-based coverage and create an even greater public backlash against the law.

“Unless a year from now, people start seeing their employers dropping their health insurance and then you’ll start to have whole other wave of reaction against it,” Roberts said.

Full exchange:

ROBERT REICH: It was a terrible mistake for him to say what he did, but after a while, you’ve got to look at the fact that we have one of the most important reforms of the health care system of the United States ever enacted.

JONATHAN KARL: Is it going to be seen that way a year from now?

REICH: I think it is, because at the present rate of enrollment we’re going to have over 1 million people enrolled by January, and people are going to stop complaining.

COKIE ROBERTS: Unless a year from now, people start seeing their employers dropping their health insurance and then you’ll start to have a whole other wave of reaction against it.
