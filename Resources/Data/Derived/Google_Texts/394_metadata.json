Because I thought, well, people should follow me home. Talk to Malia and Sasha. I never call them the right names. I call Barack \u201cBo,\u201d it never works out really well.\u201d\n\nObama says that while she may have gotten Braley\u2019s name wrong during a \u201cGet out the Vote\u201d campaign event in Des Moines at Drake University, she was right about his values, citing his stance on the Affordable Care Act and his views on financing for higher education.\n\nMake no mistake about it. This race is going to be tight. Races like this can be won or lost by just a few thousand, even a few hundred votes. - Michelle Obama\n\nThe First Lady also urged Iowans, and especially students to vote early.

This race is going to be tight. Races like this can be won or lost by just a few thousand, even a few hundred votes. Just think about what happened in the 2012 Presidential election here in Iowa. The outcome of that race was decided by 46,000 votes. Now that may sound like a lot, but when you break it down, that\u2019s just about 27 votes per precinct.\u201d\n\nBraley is running against State Senator Joni Ernst in a race that could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Statehouse and Politics", "description": "At a campaign rally on the University of Iowa campus, First Lady Michelle Obama joked about a gaffe she made earlier this month when she called Democratic", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://iowapublicradio.org/post/first-lady-corrects-gaffe-urges-iowans-vote-early", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/201410/photo3.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "At a campaign rally on the University of Iowa campus, First Lady Michelle Obama joked about a gaffe she made earlier this month when she called Democratic", "title": "First Lady Corrects Gaffe, Urges Iowans to Vote Early"}, "story_id": 357906108, "twitter": {"site": "@IowaPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lindseysmoon"}, "author": "Lindsey Moon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "First Lady Corrects Gaffe, Urges Iowans to Vote Early"}, "nid": 48176, "datePublished": "2014-10-21", "keywords": ", , ,", "wordCount": 296, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "- Michelle ObamaThe First Lady also urged Iowans, and especially students to vote early.\nRaces like this can be won or lost by just a few thousand, even a few hundred votes.\nShe emphasized how close the race is between Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley and Republican State Senator Joni Ernst, comparing Iowa\u2019s Senate Race to the 2012 Presidential Election.\nThe outcome of that race was decided by 46,000 votes.\nThis race is going to be tight."}
