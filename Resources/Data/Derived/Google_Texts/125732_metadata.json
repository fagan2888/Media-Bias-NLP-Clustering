The funds will help consumers sign up for affordable Health Insurance Marketplace coverage in 2016.\n\nWith Marketplace Open Enrollment beginning Nov. 1, the funding will support outreach efforts designed to connect people with local help as they seek to understand coverage options and financial assistance available at HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of the project are uninsured individuals and families in Mississippi\u2019s three southernmost health care districts eligible for health insurance under the landmark Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Dr. Michael Forster, dean of the College of Health and principle investigator. \u201cAssessing options and matching them to people\u2019s needs is complicated, to say the least, hence the value of providing trained navigators to help in the process.\u201d\n\nThe health access project is a replication of the city of Hattiesburg\u2019s and School of Social Work\u2019s Educate, Enroll, Empower (E3) Health Initiative with the addition of Marketplace enrollment. The School will facilitate the project by hiring and training a project coordinator and three navigators. While grants could continue for three years, each year CMS will assess Navigator grantees\u2019 performance for ongoing support.\n\n\u201cNavigators will engage in two different types of tasks; in-reach, where they will recruit and train agency personnel who will help individuals enroll, and out-reach, where they will bring services to community agencies such as WIC distribution centers,\u201d said Dr. Laura Richard, assistant professor of social work and project co-director.\n\nNavigators and assisters are trained specialists who provide consumers with in-person help, answering their questions about their health insurance and financial assistance options and assisting them as they complete their application. Richard said navigators will also provide assistance with enrollment, referral to consumer assistance programs, translation services, and helping advocate for those who have been denied coverage but are eligible.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of the success the City of Hattiesburg\u2019s E3 Health Initiative has had over the past 12 months,\u201d said Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree. \u201cMany Hattiesburg children and families now have health coverage through Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan as a result of E3 efforts to simplify the enrollment process and to make health coverage more accessible. Our long-term partnership with the Southern Miss School of Social Work has again resulted in an opportunity to maintain and extend needed services not only to Hattiesburg, but now to the 24 southernmost counties in Mississippi.\u201d\n\nSocial work graduate students will also be trained on the enrollment process. While completing their internship at state agencies, students will be able to help consumers find health coverage.\n\n\u201cAs an applied discipline the goal is that we not only engage in scholarship for students and faculty, but that we do something for the community,\u201d said Dr. Tim Rehner, director of the School of Social Work. \u201cIn Mississippi, there are many social determinates that prevent people from having access to health care. This project provides a unique opportunity for the School of Social Work to make a difference in the health and well-being of residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always believed that if we could solve problems in Mississippi, we can solve those problems across the nation,\u201d said DuPree. \u201cEarning the Navigator Grant due to the success of a City of Hattiesburg program is proof that we are well on the way to doing just that.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the School of Social Work in The University of Southern Mississippi\u2019s College of Health, visit www.usm.edu/socialwork.
