But the Cruz jab, unusually personal, was the strongest signal to date about brewing conservative frustration with congressional leadership. Days later, a top Republican fundraiser told The Huffington Post that he was having trouble recruiting donors because of discontent with Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and McConnell. A conservative publication accused the Senate leader of having the yips.\n\nToward the end of July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) allowed for a vote on an amendment reauthorizing the Export Import bank as part of consideration on highway funding legislation. Outside the chamber, conservatives\u2014 who deem the bank a conduit for corporate welfare \u2014 were furious. Inside, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the Kentuckian a liar for supposedly breaking a promise not to revive the bank\u2019s charter.\n\nYes, Donald Trump launched a presidential campaign by calling Mexican immigrants illegally crossing the border \u201crapists.\u201d And yes, another Republican presidential candidate accused President Barack Obama of shepherding another Holocaust with his Iran nuclear deal. But those were viewed as rhetorical flourishes from the campaign trail \u2013 potentially damaging but not necessarily self-destructive.\n\nAt a certain point during the middle of the summer, Republican operatives began worrying that the party was flirting dangerously with self-immolation, though not for the reasons many suspected.\n\nWith Congress on recess these past few weeks, that flare-up has been largely forgotten, eclipsed by more theatrics from Trump. It likely won't be long, however, until the tensions resurface. Lawmakers must pass a government funding bill by the end of September. And already, there are signs it won\u2019t go smoothly, with conservatives demanding a defunding of Planned Parenthood during that process.\n\nThat could potentially spark another shutdown, like the one triggered by a push to defund Obamacare in 2013. But the bigger blow up may come weeks later.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Treasury Department will run out of money sometime between mid-November and early December. Administration officials think this is a bullish time frame, through the end date is hard to pin down because of the extraordinary measures being used to fund the government.\n\nRegardless, the deadline is nearing. And the mixture of an ongoing presidential campaign \u2013 which encourages lawmakers to play to their base \u2013 and the itching for more spending cuts from conservative groups suggests it won't pass without drama.\n\n\u201cLeadership constantly refers to the need to rein in mandatory spending,\u201d said Dan Holler, the communications director for Heritage Action for America. \u201cIf they do not use the debt limit as an opportunity to enact those policies \u2013 policies that are embedded in their bicameral budget \u2013 then they have no credibility on the issue. They should use the debt limit to drive down spending, both in the near term and long term, by demanding real entitlement reform such as Medicaid block grant and Medicare premium support.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration's posture is that they simply won\u2019t negotiate on raising the debt ceiling, not after the calamity that transpired in 2011 when they did deal with Boehner to get the ceiling raised.\n\nRepublican leadership, likewise, seems content to not even hint at fighting this issue. McConnell\u2019s office pointed The Huffington Post to a statement that the leader made before recess: \u201cWe are not doing government shutdowns and we are not threatening to default on the national debt.\" Boehner\u2019s office was far more vague, with the official company line being: \u201cThe debt ceiling is one of many issues that members will address when they return.\u201d\n\nWhen they do return, however, Boehner (and McConnell) likely will be torn choosing between a deep desire to avoid drama but a primal inclination to not be tarred as \u201cliars.\u201d Leadership, the moneyed interests of the party, and most rank-and-file members realize a debt limit breach is economically catastrophic and a standoff is politically so. But believing this and acting on that impulse are two different things. And there is dwindling confidence that they will be able to do both.\n\nAsked if he expected debt-ceiling fireworks, longtime GOP consultant Craig Shirley replied: \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP leaders want to avoid it.
