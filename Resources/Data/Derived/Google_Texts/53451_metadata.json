(photo by JOE CARABEO)\n\nOPPORTUNITY doesn\u2019t knock so much anymore. These days, it e-mails.\n\nAnd so Carolyn Belefski monitors that inbox like a freelancer at the open window, peering out for that professional opening. \u201cSometimes I just keep refreshing my inbox looking for the call to greatness,\u201d says Belefski.\n\nThen: \u201cThe moment happened.\u201d\n\nClick.\n\nHello, this is the White House.\n\n\u201cThe White House Office of Digital Strategy reached out to me \u2026 ,\u201d says Belefski, a Washington-area illustrator and creator of the comic \u201cCurls.\u201d \u201cThey approached me via e-mail with the idea of working with me on health-care comics.\u201d\n\nSeems the administration was looking for new ways to engage the public over the president\u2019s Affordable Care efforts \u2014 seeking new optics, as D.C. power brokers like to say, to get people to sign up through the window of HealthCare.gov ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline. And what\u2019s literally a more inviting and friendly optic than a cartoon?\n\n\u201cThe people who work there [in Digital Strategy] are multi-talented creatives and they wanted to attempt a project with visual storytelling,\u201d Belefski tells The Post\u2019s Comic Riffs. \u201cThese comics for the Affordable Care Act are a way to show these visuals, and try something new to make people aware that having health insurance is important.\u201d\n\nBelefski didn\u2019t make opportunity knock twice. \u201cI was immediately happy that the White House would be open to using cartoons to reach out to the public,\u201d says Belefski, whose impressive portfolio ranges from comic-book covers to webcomics. \u201cIt\u2019s like one of the e-mails you get where you open it up and smile. \u2026 I said, \u2018Yes, I\u2019d be interested.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInterested, yes, but as an accomplished freelancer, Belefski \u2014 who will appear at Awesome Con D.C. in May \u2014 had a few keen queries before saying yes to the president.\n\n\u201cAfter the initial e-mail, there were a couple of concerns I had in the beginning, before my pencil hit the paper, so we had a few phone calls and e-mails,\u201d the Virginia-born artist says. \u201cThey were able to answer my questions. I weighed the options and asked myself: \u2018How many people get asked to create art for the White House? This is really a great opportunity. No one should turn this down. I should go for it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow to set about settling upon a style. Clearly the White House creatives liked something they\u2019d seen.\n\n\u201cOnce we got started, I had them select examples from my portfolio of the styles they preferred. They liked the \u2018semi-flat style with hints of dimension.\u2019 Specifically, my comic strip Curls and the comic-book cover I did for Adventure Time. We agreed on a limited color palette to keep things simple, and I really like the colors I selected,\u201d says Belefski, who got her BFA in Communication Arts and Design from Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nThe agreed-upon approach to this visual storytelling was through the use of character types \u2014 individual comics that whimsically spotlight a bearded hipster, say, or an athlete or a daredevil.\n\n\n\nSketch courtesy of artist Carolyn Belefski.\n\n\u201cThe White House had the character personas all ready to go,\u201d says Belefski, who has also edited the D.C.-based comics newspaper Magic Bullet. \u201cSince cartoons are a great way for stereotyping, I can see that a hipster would wear glasses, have a beard, etc. The daredevil would have slightly messy hair blowing in the wind and a superhero cape. The caregiver would be someone you could trust with a loving smile.\n\n\u201cIf anyone has a problem with stereotypes, I always say they are there for a reason. The people that break stereotypes are the ones that change the world,\u201d says Belefski, noting that she still faces occasional calcified prejudice as a woman webcomicker. \u201cSometimes people can\u2019t believe that females can be cartoonists. It boggles their minds.\u201d\n\nWhat should boggle the mind instead is the degree of warmth and whimsy that Belefski is able to infuse into just a few limited-text panels. Her cute and quirky people pop off the page.\n\n\u201cI really think we nailed the characters,\u201d Belefski says. \u201cThere is a lot of activity going on. I enjoy the subtle hints that say to me: \u2018Even healthy people need health insurance in case an accident happens.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe characters live their lives and participate in activities they enjoy, which is what makes them who they are,\u201d she continues. \u201cI can look at the characters we created and truly believe these people are trying to be the best they can be, even if some come across as narcissistic in this modern world of selfies and hashtags. That\u2019s what makes them characters! They are not boring. They are all people I\u2019d like to know.\u201d\n\n\n\nSketch used courtesy of artist Carolyn Belefski.\n\nOnce the White House decided they liked the characters, too, Belefski experienced one of two major positives to taking on this mission: No inked-line item vetoes. \u201cIt was so great working with this client because I only drew a simple sketch of each character, scanned, sent to them and got approval. No edits! No rejections!\u201d\n\nAs smoothly as this assignment went, all of Washington should work so well. \u201cThere is the approval process [with freelance work], which depending on the client, can sit on someone\u2019s desk for months, or there is a \u2018too many cooks in the kitchen,\u2019 design-by-committee situation. Working with the White House had a great flow and no hold-ups.\u201d\n\n(Now there\u2019s an endorsement you don\u2019t hear as much from, say, Congress.)\n\nWhen it comes to health-care comic benefits, this government gig came with another one: the massive exposure that a White House web page can provide.\n\n\u201cThis project has been the first time something I\u2019ve done has gone viral. I was so excited to see that Michelle Obama released the athletic comic on Instagram and Twitter,\u201d says Belefski (noting that agrees with the first lady\u2019s stances in promoting exercise and healthy eating). \u201cIn one day, that image had over 16,000 \u2018likes\u2019 on Instagram. That\u2019s only likes. I wonder how many people saw it!\u201d\n\n(\u201cOne site mentioned that the cartoons are an effort to make Obamacare seem cool,\u201d Belefski says. \u201cTo me, that is a high compliment because my cartoons are cool!\u201d)\n\nThe White House, in other words, is stimulating the health of at least one cartoonist\u2019s career \u2014 this time on purpose.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, I create comics for myself, but also I want an audience to read and see my art,\u201d Belefski says. \u201cMy hope is that another opportunity will come around where many people can enjoy what has been created for them. I like to make people smile. The rewards are the smiles.\u201d\n\n\n\nA cartoon from the White House\u2019s healthcare.gov site. (used by permission of artist Carolyn Belefski)\n\nBelefski reads some of the comments of criticism that are part and parcel with creating pictures for a political effort. Her antidote is her belief in the effectiveness of her art form.\n\n\u201cThere are the people who say cartoons are for kids. I know the health-care debate is hot from all sides, but sometimes I wonder if people have hearts,\u201d Belefski says. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t read comics as an adult, was there ever a time even in childhood where you enjoyed reading newspaper comics or an animated TV show? Cartoons can be all-ages. Adults can enjoy them, too. Cartoons can be educational. They are a different medium to get a message across.\u201d\n\nAnd beyond message, the artist applauds the administration\u2019s choice of medium.\n\n\u201cSome people are better visual learners. I think this is The White House\u2019s way to reach a new audience and to be experimental with discussing what could be dry subject matter and turn it into a clever announcement,\u201d Belefski says. \u201cTake away the words, and almost everyone would agree that these cartoons are a blast.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Curls\" creator got an out-of-the-blue opportunity.
