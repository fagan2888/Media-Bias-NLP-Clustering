LOS ANGELES â€” Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers recorded his 300th strikeout of the season, becoming the first major league pitcher in 13 years to do so.

Kershaw had seven strikeouts in 3 2-3 innings Sunday against the San Diego Padres, leaving with a 2-0 lead. He reached the 300-mark with a swinging strikeout of Melvin Upton Jr. to end the third.

Kershaw concluded the regular season with 301 strikeouts, joining former Arizona teammates Randy Johnson (2000-02) and Curt Schilling (2002) as the only pitchers since 2000 to record 300.

He joined mentor Sandy Koufax as the only Dodgers to reach the mark. Koufax last did it in 1966.

Kershaw received a standing ovation from the crowd in his final tuneup before the Dodgers open the NL Division Series at home against the New York Mets on Friday.
