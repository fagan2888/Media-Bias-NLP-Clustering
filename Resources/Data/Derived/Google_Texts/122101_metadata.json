Despite previously lobbying to retain the exemption, Honolulu police officials have now come to an agreement with legislators to have the law changed in a revised version of the state's prostitution statutes. Prostitution is illegal in Hawaii , but the existing law states that the prohibition \"shall not apply to any member of a police department, a sheriff, or a law enforcement officer acting in the course and scope of duties.\"The issue was raised in February as Hawaii lawmakers debated ways to strengthen existing prostitution laws.
