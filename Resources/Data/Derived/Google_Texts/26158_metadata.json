Without exiting the building, patients also can receive medications and blood test results.\n\nTo determine what to offer at the clinic, Western Digital looked at which health care services employees were spending the most money on, said Jason Bibelheimer, vice president of human resources operations at Western Digital, in an email. \u201cOur health-management partner helped us to identify gaps in care and the multiple medical issues of our employee population,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Western Digital employees, preventive care is 100 percent covered, and other services at the clinic are offered at a competitive rate. Although the company offers three health plans, contributes $3,000 to an annual health savings account and provides cash incentives for making health care appointments, employees can opt out of coverage.\n\nSince the wellness center opened five months ago, 31 percent of employees have made appointments, and Western Digital reports a 99 percent employee-satisfaction rating.\n\nThe clinic is also likely benefiting Western Digital\u2019s bottom line. \u201cEmployers save on costs (with the implementation of the clinic),\u201d Walker said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t out sick and are more productive because they are able to work and be healthy instead of missing deadlines.\u201d\n\nDr. Christopher Celio, the resident doctor at Western Digital\u2019s clinic, described how access to an immediate treatment saved one Western Digital employee from taking a sick day. After getting a terrible migraine at her desk, the employee got pain medication from Celio and was able to continue working.\n\nAccording to Bibelheimer, Western Digital has saved roughly 2,300 hours of productivity since the clinic opened its doors, time that would have been taken as sick time.\n\nDespite the time-saving advantages of work-site clinics, some critics argue that health care in the office translates to less personal time for employees. As sleeping (see Google\u2019s sleep pods), eating and health care all move to the office, employees may find few reasons to leave the office \u2013 or have a life at home.\n\nLast year, an Ernst & Young study found that 24 percent of full-time employees in the U.S are having a harder time managing their work-life balance than they did five years ago. Proponents of work-site clinics claim employee efficiency is improved with ease of access to health care, presumably allowing employees to limit overtime and make it home, but the results have yet to be seen.\n\nA growing trend\n\nNationwide, 29 percent of companies with more than 5,000 employees provided work-site clinics in 2015, up from 24 percent in 2013, according to a survey by Mercer, a human resources consulting firm.\n\nBecause work-site clinics help companies ensure their employees have access to reasonably priced health care, the increased popularity of clinics among employers is likely due to coverage requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut as work-site clinics were heralded for saving companies millions in health care costs, the IRS released a murky \u201cnot so fast\u201d statement last year.\n\nUnder the ACA, health care costs spent through work-site clinics will be counted in 2018\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax, which enforces a 40 percent nondeductible excise tax on high-value plans.\n\nIn response to the Mercer survey, 15 percent of employers said their wellness clinics could threaten their chances at avoiding the excise tax and 11 percent think it\u2019ll help. The remaining respondents don\u2019t know or think the clinics will have no impact.\n\nDespite an uncertain future, St. Joseph Hoag Health is in talks with several other local employers interested in adding work-site clinics, Walker said. She is also hopeful the legacy of St. Joseph Hoag Health in Orange County will alleviate some of the concerns employees and employers may have.\n\nFor more than 90 years, St. Joseph Hoag Health has maintained a foothold in Orange County\u2019s health care system with multiple hospitals and a large network of medical professionals. Walker said the organization\u2019s main challenge is educating the public and employers on the new kinds of services offered by the brand.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t always know what they want,\u201d said Walker. \u201cThey can\u2019t even imagine what they could have if they don\u2019t know it\u2019s yet possible.\u201d\n\nAs the tectonic plates of health care shift under the ACA, Walker remains hopeful as she remembers a time when things were similarly ambiguous.\n\nIn the 1980s, Walker had to lay off employees for the third time in three years while she was the director of laboratory services at an Orange County hospital. As she again watched hard-working people exit the building, Walker decided she needed to move into a strategy development role.\n\nSince then, she has earned the Modern Healthcare's Innovation in Healthcare Technology Award and the Hospitals and Health Networks Innovator Award.\n\nWalker said that the clinic at Western Digital is just one example of St. Joseph Hoag Health\u2019s commitment to innovating and revolutionizing the delivery of health services.\n\n\u201cThe clinic at Western Digital is just a piece of the innovation to health care St. Joseph\u2019s is initiating,\u201d said Walker.\n\n\u201cTo be part of health care right now and create a different kind of health care for our grandchildren is the great honor of our generation.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: jljones@ocregister.com or on Twitter @JLJonesOCR", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: A doctor's office at the office: St. Joseph Health partners with Western Digital to create a work-site clinic | healthcare, health, time, employees, walker, digital, western, work, clinics, joseph", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JENNA L.
