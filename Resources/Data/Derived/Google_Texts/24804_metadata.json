Wolves have responded so well that they are no longer hunting just for deer and they are no longer living far from humans.\n\nFarmers tell about losing cattle routinely to wolves. Worse, they feel they have no control over a growing threat, said Mark Liebaert of South Range. A member of the Douglas County Board, he\u2019s also the treasurer of the Wisconsin Farmers Union Board of Directors. He hears from many northern farmers alarmed by increasing wolf attacks on their livestock.\n\nLiebaert farms cattle not deep in the North Woods but only 15 miles from downtown Superior. Wolves hunt his cattle and they are not frightened off by humans. \u201cThey have spread,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re into agricultural areas.\u201d\n\nThat is an effect of the extraordinary rebound that led wildlife experts in the U.S. Department of the Interior \u2014 as far back as 2011 \u2014 to determine that the gray wolf in the western Great Lakes is no longer endangered. The population was \u201cfully recovered and healthy,\u201d said President Obama\u2019s secretary of the interior.\n\nThis federal \u201cdelisting\u201d meant that state wildlife agencies could begin to manage the population so the wolf\u2019s ongoing role in the ecosystem did not come at the expense of farmers, loggers, sportsmen and people who simply live in the northern third of our state. Numbers have been growing so rapidly that the quota-limited, state-sanctioned wolf hunts during the winters of 2012-13 and 2013-14 resulted in just over 500 wolves being legally harvested.\n\nThe rapid growth in wolf numbers is also why so many people across the state are angry that in 2014, a judge in Washington, D.C., overruled the wildlife experts and returned the gray wolf to the Endangered Species List. The judge\u2019s decision ignored science and took the management of wolf population out of Wisconsin experts\u2019 hands. It left Wisconsinites with no say.\n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t walk their dogs\u201d safely in rural areas, said Liebaert. They fear losing beloved companions \u201cbecause the wolves come out of the woods.\u201d Farmers seeing their livestock attacked can do nothing. \u201cI could legally shoot my neighbor\u2019s dog if it were harassing my cattle,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I cannot shoot a wolf that\u2019s killing them.\u201d\n\nJohnson (Photo: Courtesy of Sen. Ron Johnson)\n\nProper wildlife management can prevent that kind of absurd situation. It means that wolves and people can get along. The first step is to return to the course that the U.S. Department of Interior deemed appropriate \u2014 delisting the gray wolf. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve each led congressional efforts in the House and the Senate by introducing bills last year, and pursuing legislative action to do just that. And just last week, Sen. Johnson filed an amendment to an energy policy bill to accomplish the same thing.\n\nThis amendment\u2019s language does not modify the Endangered Species Act, nor does it stop the Fish and Wildlife Service from returning the wolf to the endangered list if its experts determine the population is again in need of such protection. We agree with the Wisconsinites who say future gray wolf listing decisions should come from the experts in Wisconsin, not judges in Washington.\n\nRibble (Photo: File)\n\nAll of us can all agree that it\u2019s important to protect our environment \u2014 and that a crucial part of the success we\u2019ve seen has been the protections given by the Endangered Species Act to wildlife populations that have needed it. But we need to recognize a win. The wolf belongs in Wisconsin, but so do farmers and rural residents. Federal policy should accommodate both.\n\nRon Johnson is a U.S. Senator from Oshkosh.
