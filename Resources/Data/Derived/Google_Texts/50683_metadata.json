In addition to technology shifts, the \u201calways on\u201d work culture reflects lingering effects of the recession that has left fewer employees handling larger workloads.\n\nThe balancing act is particularly difficult for millennials, who are becoming managers just as they enter into parenthood.

Millennial parents place a high value on flexibility, and say that a flexible schedule would make them more engaged, less likely to quit, and more likely to work flexible hours. Even so, one in six says they have suffered a negative consequence for working a flexible schedule.\n\nMore than half of those surveyed said that they would make job and career changes in order to find a better work-life balance. Those findings echo the results of a CareerBuilder survey released last year which found that a third of workers don\u2019t want a leadership role because they don\u2019t want to sacrifice work-life balance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Even with (or maybe because of) the proliferation of apps and technology to help workers connect with their jobs round-the-clock, finding a balance between work and life is getting harder, according to a new report from Ernst & Young.", "title": "Work-Life Balance: Why Millennials Get Hit Hardest", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/06/Work-Life-Balance-Why-Millennials-Get-Hit-Hardest", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04112011_home-office_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/06/Work-Life-Balance-Why-Millennials-Get-Hit-Hardest", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04112011_home-office_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Even with (or maybe because of) the proliferation of apps and technology to help workers connect with their jobs round-the-clock, finding a balance between work and life is getting harder, according to a new report from Ernst & Young.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34a9\"", "article_summary": "More than half of those surveyed said that they would make job and career changes in order to find a better work-life balance.\nThose findings echo the results of a CareerBuilder survey released last year which found that a third of workers don\u2019t want a leadership role because they don\u2019t want to sacrifice work-life balance.\nMillennial parents place a high value on flexibility, and say that a flexible schedule would make them more engaged, less likely to quit, and more likely to work flexible hours.\nThe balancing act is particularly difficult for millennials, who are becoming managers just as they enter into parenthood.\nEven so, one in six says they have suffered a negative consequence for working a flexible schedule."}
