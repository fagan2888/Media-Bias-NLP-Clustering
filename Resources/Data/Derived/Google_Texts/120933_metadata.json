The group\u2019s main argument supporting this claim is that Democrats will reduce poverty\u0097a major factor in the choice to abort an unborn child.\n\nIt is a strategy that has worked well for the organization in recent years, convincing many Catholics that Barack Obama was the \u201creal\u201d pro-life presidential candidate in 2008 and 2012. Attracting funding from progressive pro-abortion funding sources in the past, it is likely that Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good\u0097not to be confused with the similarly named Catholics for the Common Good\u0097will continue to draw upon familiar sources. Those sources include Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, the Tides Foundation, and the progressive Wallace Global Fund.\n\nSince CACG\u2019s founding by Alexia Kelley\u0097who served as the Democratic National Committee\u2019s religious outreach director during John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign, and later as President Obama\u2019s Director of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships for the Department of Health and Human Services\u0097the organization has welcomed funding from sources opposed to Catholic teachings on life issues. The Open Society Foundations has long funded abortion through major grants to Planned Parenthood, as well as providing significant funding to the pro-assisted suicide organization Compassion and Choices (formerly known as the Hemlock Society). With assets of about $110 million, the Wallace Global Fund is a major funder of abortion initiatives and of population-control efforts. Its portfolio of grants includes the Sexuality Information and Education Initiative, Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health/Global Doctors for Choice, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Guttmacher Institute\u0097and Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. Helping CACG elect Democrats will ensure that access to abortion will continue to expand\u0097something that the Wallace Global Fund values highly.\n\nRevocation of tax-exempt status for CACG\n\nWhether these funding streams to CACG will continue is uncertain. On October 21, 2013, the IRS posted notice of a revocation of the organization\u2019s tax-exempt status for \u201cfailing to file a 990 series return for three consecutive years.\u201d While not having tax-exempt status might make it difficult for CACG to attract donors, this development also hands the group a real advantage: CACG will now be able legally to hide its funding sources, rather than simply failing to report them as it has done for the past three years.\n\nThe CACG 2014-1015 Strategic Plan projected a budget of $200,000 in 2014, and the group is soliciting donations on its website \u201cwith a goal of an additional $100,000 in philanthropic dollars from benefactors and foundations.\u201d The CACG Strategic Plan is an ambitious one that promises to \u201ccommunicate the fullness of the Catholic social tradition throughout the public square\u201d by \u201cincreasing our presence significantly in the media, particularly on television, where we will make our broadcast debut by Easter Sunday 2015.\u201d CACG also plans to \u201crecruit and train fifteen Catholic intellectuals and newsmakers to speak for our organization in various media capacities.\u201d CACG has revamped its logo, and launched a new website and social media network. In 2015 CACG plans to \u201cincrease the organization\u2019s intellectual network to ensure that CACG has relationships with the thirty best Catholic public policy scholars in the country,\u201d and \u201cwill increase the quality and number of writers for the CACG Common Good Forum.\u201d CACG also plans to make Millennial, their new outreach to young Catholics, \u201cone of the most important and most read journals of Catholic thought.\u201d\n\nAll of this is expensive\u0097especially the new inroads to television. There are several opportunities on the organization\u2019s website to donate to CACG, despite the organization\u2019s lack of tax-exempt status. In early December the organization added a notice to its donor page that \u201cdonations to Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good are not tax deductible,\u201d but it is not clear whether donors would have known about the organization\u2019s loss of tax-exempt status prior to that addition.\n\nPartisan leadership at CACG continues\n\nWhile CACG claims on its website that the goal of the organization is to \u201cmove beyond partisan and ideological divisions,\u201d the leadership of CACG reflects the leadership of the Democratic Party and its allies in organized labor. CACG\u2019s board chairman is Alfred Rotondaro, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, and a frequent contributor to the Huffington Post, with articles that are supportive of Democratic politicians and policies and critical of the Church and her teachings. In an article titled \u201cThe World Needs a New Vatican Council,\u201d Rotondaro criticizes the bishops\u2019 opposition to the Affordable Care Act because of what he interprets as the bishops\u2019 misplaced concerns about public funding for abortion. He also insists the Catholic Church has no right to bar women from ordination. \u201cI have never seen,\u201d he opines, \u201cany rational reason why a woman could not be a priest.\u201d Rotondaro concludes his article with the suggestion that homosexual behavior should be celebrated, writing, \u201cGay sex comes from God.\u201d\n\nIn a second, even more partisan article, \u201cAbortion and the Republican Party,\u201d published in 2011, Rotondaro claims, \u201cRepublicans have never really wanted to eliminate abortion. It doesn\u2019t fit their political goals.\u201d Additional articles Rotandaro published on the Huffington Post include \u201cThe Republican Lie Machine,\u201d \u201cCatholic Bishops Support Republicans,\u201d \u201cCatholic Bishops Trying to Find Relevance in Health Insurance Debate,\u201d and \u201cThe Church and the Fed: Too Big to Fail.\u201d\n\nAccording to an earlier version of the CACG \u201cLeadership\u201d webpage (accessed on December 2, 2014 and edited days later to remove the names of all but two board members), Rotondaro is joined on the CACG board by several union leaders, including Tom Chabolla, head of the Service Employees International Union, and Gerald Shea and Tiffany Heath, both of the AFL-CIO. Also on the board are several academics who supported Barack Obama for president, including Lisa Sowle Cahill of Boston College and Mary Jo Bane of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, among others. Paul Begala, formerly of the Clinton administration and now at Georgetown University, also serves on the CACG board, as does Benjamin Palumbo, who is described on the CACG website as having had a \u201clong and distinguished career in American politics.\u201d That is, of course, Democratic Party politics\u0097as Palumbo served as an assistant to New Jersey Governor Richard Hughes, chief of staff for US Senator Harrison Williams, and as campaign manager for Lloyd Bentsen\u2019s presidential bid. Palumbo also served as the staff director of the House Democratic Caucus and as a board member of the National Democratic Club.\n\nOne of the CACG board members, Betty Anne Donelly, is a representative from FADICA (Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities), a nonprofit member association that \u201cworks to strengthen and promote Catholic philanthropy.\u201d FADICA is a network of major philanthropists supporting Catholic-sponsored programs and institutions. Its mission is \u201cto enable its members to be informed, involved, and effective in addressing Church needs by their philanthropy.\u201d Interestingly, FADICA is now headed by CACG founder Alexia Kelley. While FADICA is \u201cnot a foundation itself, nor a clearinghouse for the grant-seeking public\u201d it does however \u201cprovide materials which are intended to assist the fundraiser with timely development research.\u201d FADICA could possibly facilitate funding for CACG, but it\u2019s not clear if that is the case. It would seem that CACG needs non-profit status as a 501c3 organization to draw significant funding, but there may be ways around that requirement.\n\nReaching out to millennials\n\nIn an attempt to attract young Catholics, CACG is now sponsoring Millennial\u0097an online journal that was ostensibly created to \u201chighlight the voices of a wide range of young Catholics.\u201d Headed by Christopher Jolly Hale, a senior fellow at CACG and a former writer at the Soros-supported organization Faith in Public Life, Millennial appears to be an attempt to capture the young Catholic vote for the Democratic Party. The fact that Hale once worked at Faith in Public Life is revealing; CACG has enjoyed a kind of \u201csister\u201d relationship with Faith in Public Life, much like the relationship CACG enjoyed with the group Catholics United, by which CACG paid the salary of Catholics United director Chris Korzen. Currently, there are CACG employees, such as Hale, who have worked at Faith in Public Life in the past, and former CACG employees, such as John Gehring, who now work at the highly-politicized Faith in Public Life.\n\nFounded by progressive Evangelical Protestant activist and author Jim Wallis, Faith in Public Life teamed up with Sojourners, Wallis\u2019 social justice organization, and PICO National Network, the USCCB-funded community organizing initiative in 2008, to create a \u201ctoolkit\u201d on the health-care reform debate. That toolkit, which was used in churches throughout the country, reassured Catholic parishioners that conscience protections would remain in place and that public funding for abortion would not be part of health-care reform\u0097even though no such assurance was offered in any of the versions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow Hale is heading the Millennial initiative at CACG. Claiming to be \u201cthe new faithful in a new century,\u201d Millennial writers pledge to \u201carticulate an authentic vision of the common good.\u201d Unfortunately, it seems that the Millennial vision of the common good does not include tradition-minded millennial Catholics. In an article titled \u201cThe Latin Mass Is Not the Key to the New Evangelization,\u201d Millennial contributor William Bornhoft criticizes those he calls the \u201cTLM Millennials,\u201d who are \u201cobsessed with tradition\u201d and \u201cat odds with the teachings of the Church.\u201d Suggesting that the TLM Millennials \u201clack a proper education on the theological reasons for liturgical reform,\u201d Bornhoft concludes that \u201cthe same poor catechesis that leads Catholics to misunderstand and oppose the Church\u2019s teaching on hot button cultural issues also lead [sic] Catholics to oppose the reforms of the past half century.\u201d\n\nIn an article titled \u201cThe Bishops: Right on Immigration, Wrong on Immigration Reform,\u201d contributing writer Matt Mazewski writes, \u201cLeft-leaning Catholics are used to being disappointed,\u201d and then includes a long list of those who have disappointed them, including, most prominently, the US bishops and conservatives: \u201cdisappointed by the Republican Party for its apparent indifference to the economic travails of the working class\u2026disappointed by conservatives within the Church who insist that Catholics are morally obligated to vote against pro-choice politicians\u2026disappointed by the Bishops who so often demonstrate their political tone-deafness and frustrating knack for contributing to at least some of the trends driving intolerance of the Church in modern society.\u201d\n\nCACG knows how important to the future of the Democratic Party it is to capture the millennial Catholic vote. Vinnie Rotondaro, son of CACG board leader Alfred Rotondaro, has been leading that charge for a few years now. But, in doing so, he has taken some openly partisan shots at Church leaders. In a Huffington Post article published prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act titled, \u201cThe Catholic Church: A Crisis of Trust,\u201d the younger Rotondaro argued that \u201cthe Catholic Church is collapsing into a state of moral bankruptcy\u201d because of its lack of support for President Obama\u2019s health-care initiative. Claiming that the bishops \u201chang on to paper-thin fears that the health-care bill would fund abortion,\u201d Rotondaro charges, \u201cThey fought its passage tooth-and-nail and gambled with the security of millions of Americans who live\u0097and die\u0097with little or no health care.\u201d\n\nVinnie Rotondaro is now promoting CACG and Millennial through his work as a national correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. In an article published during the Synod on the Family in October, \u201cMillennials Want a Messy, Earnest Discussion about Family,\u201d he interviewed Millennial\u2019s Christopher Hale, who stated: \u201cWhat we need to see more than anything is a church that is willing to listen and a church that\u2019s willing to engage. The church needs to realize that a large number of millennial Catholics did not grow up in a household with a mom and a dad. We are growing up in different times and we still need a church to minister to us. What once was alternative is now normal.\u201d\n\nHale, in a short telephone conversation with the author earlier this month, acknowledged the loss of IRS tax-exempt status for CACG. He was, however, reluctant to disclose funding sources for his new Millennial venture. Still, Hale promised \u201cbig announcements\u201d from CACG after January 1, 2015. The CACG Strategic Plan promises an ambitious agenda\u0097with three major \u201cadvocacy objectives\u201d for 2015 that mirror the advocacy objectives of the Democratic Party platform:\n\n1. \u201ccomprehensive and just immigration reform\u201d\n\n2. poverty reduction through \u201creal solutions that address structural poverty\u201d\n\n3. reducing gun violence through advocating for the return of the assault weapon ban.\n\nProtections for the unborn and those at the end of life are conveniently missing from the advocacy objectives of CACG. Unless CACG acknowledges that the Democratic Party\u2019s policies contribute to the greatest expansion in access to abortion here and abroad, faithful millennial Catholics\u0097those we at Franciscan University call the pro-life generation\u0097may be harder to convince than they think.\n\nRelated on CWR:", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Politics Anne Hendershott", "description": "The Catholic Con Regroups Gearing up for 2016, left-leaning Catholic political organizations prepare to make the case for the Democratic platform.
