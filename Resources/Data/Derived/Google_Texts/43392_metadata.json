It has high unemployment, poor economic performance, billions in unfunded pension liabilities, billions in unpaid bills, failing schools, the worst credit rating in the country, and rampant corruption and cronyism. According to a recent Gallup poll, a whopping 50 percent of respondents would even choose to move out of state if they had the chance.\n\nFor these reasons, voters in The Prairie State have chosen to pass on re-electing Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, or the \u201cfailure,\u201d as Republican challenger Bruce Rauner pegged him on the campaign trail.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re taking a chance on Rauner, a multimillionaire who has an economic vision to rescue Illinois from its downward spiral, and who's pledged to root out \u201cwaste, fraud, and corruption\u201d in the state in which four of the last nine governors have gone to prison.\n\nBREAKING: GOP Bruce Rauner wins election as governor of Illinois. @AP race call at 11:26 p.m. EST. #Election2014 #APracecall \u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) November 5, 2014\n\nDemocrats have controlled the governor\u2019s office for 12 years. With the damage that\u2019s been done, it will be interesting to see if Rauner delivers on his promises and turns the state around.\n\nUpdate:", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is huge for the state.
