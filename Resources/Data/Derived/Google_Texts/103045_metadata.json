Yes, he motivates and challenges his students, but not simply because he\u2019s a golf coach with cerebral palsy.\n\nInstead, his students say it\u2019s his commitment to self-directed learning that is so empowering.\n\nAt the center of his coaching is this question: \u201cWhen we teach, are we teaching people to think for themselves?\u201d\n\nOn Friday mornings, Turcios critiques the golf swings of able-bodied UC Berkeley students at the Tilden Park driving range. Some regulars have been coming for two years; others are holding a golf club for the first time.\n\nFor the uninitiated, it is surprising to see Turcios, with his spasmodic movements and halting gait, swing a golf club. But he says his disability is not his problem: \u201cMy problem is how people look at me with a disability.\u201d\n\nOppressive Misconceptions\n\nIn the 1960s, the disability rights movement grew out of the movement for civil rights. Activists criticized what they called the medical model of disability, which is the idea that people with, say, cerebral palsy are broken and must be rehabilitated by medical experts to rejoin society\u2014in other words, to \u201cfix\u201d them.\n\nThe social model of disability, by contrast, says that people with disabilities are actually the experts on their conditions, and that they should be free to define their own normal. Society\u2019s role is not to fix them, but to remove barriers to independent living by providing housing subsidies, assistive technology, choice of medical providers and other help.\n\nAnother barrier is the baggage that comes along with having a disability. Ingrid Tischer of the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund says misconceptions are a common burden. \u201cNobody wants to carry around being the personification of everyone\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d she says.\n\nTurcios, for his part, says cerebral palsy is not as disabling as the stereotypes that come with it. \u201cIt\u2019s a dismissive attitude\u2014\u2018we\u2019ll let you do this, but it\u2019s not real\u2014you\u2019re not doing it the way we would.\u2019 \u201d He says that if it weren\u2019t for him, disability and all, activities such as teaching golf in Concord to autistic teens and vets with PTSD wouldn\u2019t happen at all.\n\nTurcios, who is 55 and lives in Martinez, provides instruction every Tuesday to Veterans Administration patients at a Concord driving range. \u201cI really connect with them,\u201d Turcios said, \u201cbecause I probably suffered PTSD, too, only from the way I had to grow up.\u201d\n\nHe feels like he\u2019s had to defend his achievements, such as earning a master\u2019s degree in therapeutic recreation at San Jose State and starting a nonprofit organization to support his coaching. \u201cThere are even members of my family who think [my work] is a joke or affirmative action,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nThe late satirist and disability activist Stella Young discussed the negative effects of stereotypes, even if they\u2019re well-meaning. In a TED talk titled \u201cI\u2019m not your inspiration, thank you very much,\u201d she said: \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of times that I\u2019ve been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I\u2019m brave or inspirational \u2026 just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name. It\u2019s objectifying \u2026\u201d she said, calling the phenomenon \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d\n\nThe burden of these stereotypes contributed to Turcios\u2019 alcoholism. He\u2019s been sober for decades but says, \u201cI could fall apart all over again in a heartbeat. That\u2019s the reality of my life.\u201d\n\nCoaching gives him stability and a sense of meaning. \u201cI love to watch people \u2014 disabled and non-disabled \u2014 be successful at something they thought they couldn\u2019t do,\u201d he said. \u201cTo watch people change their outlook.\u201d\n\nAnd, he said, \u201cin a lot of ways I\u2019m helping myself more than anything else. I\u2019m getting out of my head, and that\u2019s why it works so well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teacher says his neurological disorder is not the problem: It's how other people deal with it.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Bay Area Golf Coach With Cerebral Palsy Defies Stereotypes (Video)\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/05\\/bay-area-golf-coach-with-cerebral-palsy-defies-stereotypes-video\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-05 12:00:09\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-18 07:50:51\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24140,\"author_id\":\"230\",\"author_name\":\"Jeremy Raff\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jeremy Raff\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/03\\/Marty_club-e1425585566718.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Teacher says his neurological disorder is not the problem: It's how other people deal with it.", "title": "Bay Area Golf Coach With Cerebral Palsy Defies Stereotypes (Video)", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/05/bay-area-golf-coach-with-cerebral-palsy-defies-stereotypes-video/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/03/Marty-Coaching-640x360.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c12\"", "article_summary": "Yes, he motivates and challenges his students, but not simply because he\u2019s a golf coach with cerebral palsy.\nIngrid Tischer of the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund says misconceptions are a common burden.\nTurcios, for his part, says cerebral palsy is not as disabling as the stereotypes that come with it.\nFor the uninitiated, it is surprising to see Turcios, with his spasmodic movements and halting gait, swing a golf club.\nBut he says his disability is not his problem: \u201cMy problem is how people look at me with a disability.\u201dOppressive MisconceptionsIn the 1960s, the disability rights movement grew out of the movement for civil rights."}
