A former clinic director at Planned Parenthood, Johnson is now the founder and president of And Then There Were None, a ministry to help abortion workers quit the industry.\n\n\u201cNo abortion clinic workers, no abortion clinics, no abortions. It starts with the workers,\u201d the organization states on its website.\n\nOne day while she was still working for Planned Parenthood, Johnson was asked to assist during an abortion. She was horrified by what she saw.\n\nShe quit her job soon after on Oct. 6, 2009.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal shortly before the sixth anniversary of the day she quit, Johnson said that the recently released undercover Planned Parenthood videos weren\u2019t difficult to watch, because she had \u201clived that life,\u201d but that \u201cit was difficult to see the faces of the people that I knew.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s former Planned Parenthood affiliate was featured in one of the videos released by the Center for Medical Progress.\n\n\u201cThat could have been me on that video,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat would have been me, sitting around eating chips and salsa, talking about the abortions we did that day. I did that all the time. That could have been me talking about selling body parts. That could have been me picking through aborted babies because I did that. And I think, what if that had been me?\u201d\n\nJohnson said that knowing she herself could have been one of the workers on the tape reaffirms her mission to rescue workers from the abortion industry.\n\n\u201cI pray for all workers to leave, but especially the ones that I knew, that I worked with,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI think now is an opportunity for the pro-life movement to re-evaluate our attitude toward workers. I\u2019m glad the information is out there, but I\u2019m concerned about where we\u2019re going to go from here. I\u2019m concerned about the post-abortive women who haven\u2019t healed; I\u2019m concerned about the workers who are still in there. Nobody is beyond the power of conversion.\u201d\n\nShe knows firsthand what it\u2019s like to leave the abortion industry.\n\n\u201cIt was a scary time. I made a lot of money at Planned Parenthood. I mean, that sounds so selfish, but it was scary to think about what we were going to have to sacrifice. It was scary to think about leaving all my friends. That was probably what I was most scared about, even more than the money, was about starting over. They were the only people I was ever around, they were my only friends. I worked 60, 70 hours a week, so I didn\u2019t have friends outside of my work. I realized that when I left, to these people, I was going to become their enemy. I didn\u2019t plan on going public with my story ever, Planned Parenthood forced me to, but I knew that because I wasn\u2019t touting their rhetoric anymore, that I would be their enemy.\u201d\n\nAfter Johnson left Planned Parenthood\u2019s employment, they filed a lawsuit against her, which was later dismissed.\n\n\u201cIt was a very anxiety-provoking time. I was nervous. And it was almost embarrassing, too, because I knew that if I left, I was going to have to admit to many people that I had been wrong. And not that I had been wrong for a few months, but I\u2019d been wrong for eight years. And then there was the realization that one day I\u2019m going to have to face the fact that I helped to take the lives of about 20,000 babies. And that was difficult to think about. I didn\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d\n\nDespite her fear, Johnson realized she had to leave.\n\n\u201cI tried really, really hard to stay at Planned Parenthood,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI tried really hard to make it OK in my mind, to try to say to myself, \u2018OK, let me try to justify what I saw on that ultrasound screen. Let me try to justify the lies that they had told me; let me try to make this OK.\u2019 But eventually I just couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t make it OK. I knew I was going to have to leave. But then, when I made the decision, I felt very empowered. Still a little nervous, but very empowered. I felt that I was making the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actual day I quit my job, Oct. 6, 2009, I remember packing up my stuff, I didn\u2019t feel nostalgic. I felt like I have got to get out of here,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI felt lighter. I had so much in front of me that was uncertain, but I just felt this incredible burden lifted from me.\u201d\n\nShe wrote a book, \u201cUnplanned,\u201d about her experience at Planned Parenthood and her decision to leave. Shortly after the book\u2019s publication, Johnson started receiving emails from abortion clinic workers who also wanted to leave the industry.\n\n\u201cThey needed help, and so my husband and I, just as best as we could, helped them financially transition out of the industry, you know, get help, get plugged into a pro-life community,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSeventeen workers left during those few months.\u201d\n\nJohnson started looking for a national pro-life organization that could assist clinic workers looking to leave the industry. She couldn\u2019t find any.\n\n\u201cThat has been the missing piece of the puzzle,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got all these great organizations reaching out to students, reaching out to post-abortive women, pregnancy centers, but nobody was proactively reaching into these clinics to try to rescue these workers and get them out.\u201d\n\nJohnson decided to start one herself and founded And Then There Were None.\n\n\u201cWe thought if we had 10 workers leave in a year, that would just be crazy successful,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for three years and we\u2019ve had 181 abortion clinic workers come to us, and of that 181, six of them have been abortionists who have left their jobs and who are now working to defend life. Clearly, they needed someone to be their advocate.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the most powerful part of the ministry is its ability to connect former clinic workers with \u201cother people who have lived the life that they have lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody is going to reach out to you who has been in your shoes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Johnson, the pro-life movement must fight the abortion industry from within.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have workers coming to us who are staunchly pro-choice. We don\u2019t see those workers. Not yet. They have to be sort of at this brink of conversion. But it is a journey. A lot of times, we have workers who will leave because they\u2019ve seen something terrible, like me, and there was this moment where they thought, \u2018I cannot do this anymore.\u2019 Some of them, they never wanted to be doing abortions in the first place, but they needed a job, and Planned Parenthood was paying well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are a lot of workers who are in the industry who are right on the brink of saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do this anymore.\u2019 They\u2019re starting to see the reality of the abortion industry, they\u2019re starting to see what\u2019s really taking place inside the industry, and they\u2019re just right on the edge of leaving. But they\u2019re scared. They\u2019ve got kids, they\u2019re single parents, and so they just need somebody to reach into their lives and to say, \u2018We love you, we care about you, and we want to help you.\u2019 Once they see that love and concern, I believe that\u2019s what brings about that conversion moment for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-lifers should reach out to abortion industry employees.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Pro-lifers should reach out to abortion industry employees.", "title": "Abby Johnson: Planned Parenthood Employees Need 'I Love You's", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150922_AbbyJohnson_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-26T17:21:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FL3tue"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Pro-lifers should reach out to abortion industry employees.", "title": "Abby Johnson: Planned Parenthood Employees Need 'I Love You's", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150922_AbbyJohnson_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-10-06T18:57:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-26T17:21:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood videos, Center for Medical Progress, And Then There Were None, pro-life, prolife, Abby Johnson"}, "article_summary": "One day while she was still working for Planned Parenthood, Johnson was asked to assist during an abortion.\n\u201cI tried really, really hard to stay at Planned Parenthood,\u201d Johnson said.\n\u201cNo abortion clinic workers, no abortion clinics, no abortions.\nI made a lot of money at Planned Parenthood.\nA former clinic director at Planned Parenthood, Johnson is now the founder and president of And Then There Were None, a ministry to help abortion workers quit the industry."}
