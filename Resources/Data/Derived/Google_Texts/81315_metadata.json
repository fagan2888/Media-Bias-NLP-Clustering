According to Cruz, \u201cRight now, the federal government is suing the Little Sisters of the Poor to try to force Catholic nuns to pay for abortion-inducing drugs.\u201d (As my colleague Luke Brinker pointed out, Cruz kind of has the whole who\u2019s suing whom thing backwards. And \u2014 all together now/once more with feeling \u2014 birth control is not the same thing as medication abortion.) But Cruz isn\u2019t the only one who will be trotting out his \u201cpro-life\u201d bona fides at the conference this weekend. There are panels scheduled to address the 2014 election\u2019s \u201cpro-life battleground,\u201d as well as breakout sessions dedicated to bringing Libertarians and young women on board with the \u201cpro-family/pro-life movement.\u201d It\u2019s the Value Voters Summit, after all. Family values rule the weekend.\n\nNow we\u2019re all grownups here, so we don\u2019t have to pretend to be shocked that the GOP is wildly inconsistent in its application of supposedly pro-family principles. Republicans love babies, but they don\u2019t love affordable healthcare or food assistance programs or living wages for the parents of those babies. And the GOP expresses its apparent concern for women\u2019s health by shuttering clinics and stripping them of basic access to reproductive healthcare like contraception and abortion, while also fighting hard to reverse even the modest gains made through implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo given what we know, it\u2019s not at all surprising that these same politicians and conservative movement leaders have been noticeably silent about a new report out from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealing that the infant and maternal mortality rates in the United States are shamefully high, and that more babies in the United States are dying before their first birthday than in most of Europe and other similarly wealthy nations. It\u2019s not surprising that the GOP is largely silent, but it\u2019s still completely terrible.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve known for a long time that the U.S. has a higher preterm birth rate, but this higher infant mortality rate for full-term, big babies who should have really good survival prospects is not what we expected,\u201d Marian MacDorman, the lead author of the report and a senior statistician and researcher with the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, told MedicineNet.com.\n\nAs Sam P. K. Collins at ThinkProgress noted, these numbers remain high despite an advanced healthcare system and a decades-long spending increase on maternal healthcare. While it\u2019s true that our healthcare system is advanced, the disparities within that system are life-threatening. And our maternal and infant mortality rates map pretty neatly along those disparities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is stumping on \"family values\" while ignoring the deaths of mothers and infants in the United States", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ted Cruz is stumping on \"family values\" while ignoring the deaths of mothers and infants in the United States", "title": "The U.S. has a shamefully high infant mortality rate.
