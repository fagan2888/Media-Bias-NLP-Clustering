But some Packer fans are less than enthused this year.\n\nAll day the snow has been falling and the wind has been blowing. Perhaps this recent storm is a sign that Mother Nature is just as disappointed as many Packer fans in Wisconsin.\n\nJoe Baumann with the VFW Post 7591 recalls, \"We were watching the NFC Championship game and near the end of the game, the Packers were so far ahead, people started to leave and all of a sudden it took a turn for the worst.\"\n\nFor those that haven't blocked that game out of their memory, you'll recall there was a lot of nail-biting and disbelief in the end.\n\nBaumann adds, \"We figured they were dead to us, so we decided we would have a funeral lunch for the Super Bowl instead of celebrating the Super Bowl like we really wanted to.\"\n\nIn a dark bar, with a few friends and some cold drinks. It seems appropriate enough for fans that could almost taste a Super Bowl berth.\n\nBaumann says, \"Oh, we're taking it with stride, we're getting pretty excited about the Puppy Bowl right now, so it is what is, we got to make do somehow. There's always next year, you bet.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "For some Green Bay Packer fans, this Super Bowl is not one to be celebrated.
