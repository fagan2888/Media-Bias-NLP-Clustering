Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on Sunday that his party’s upcoming presidential debates are based on merit.

Priebus argued that the most successful GOP White House hopefuls will get the most debate spotlight.

“The reality is — and it might be a little harsh — you can’t necessarily treat someone that’s polling at 18 or 20 percent the same as someone polling at a half a percent or 1 percent,” Priebus told host Jonathan Karl on ABC’s “This Week.”

“So the point is there is a meritocracy involved,” he added of the GOP’s crowded field containing 17 presidential contenders.

Priebus cited the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominating process as proof the RNC is not setting a new precedent with its debates this year.

“I think we’ve got amnesia,” he told Karl.

“Four years ago, do you remember that Jon Huntsman and Gary Johnston didn’t make the cut of some debates?” Priebus asked.

Fox News is hosting the GOP’s first presidential debates on Thursday evening.

It is partitioning the party’s large 2016 field based on an average of national polling numbers concluding Tuesday night.

Priebus charged on Sunday that none of the GOP’s Oval Office seekers are getting lost in the shuffle.

“I actually think they’re doing a great job,” he said of Fox News and CNN, another upcoming debate host.

“I’m actually very grateful to Fox News and CNN for the fact that they’re letting every single person, all 17, participate in debate night,” Priebus said.

“Everyone is going to have an opportunity,” he added. “I think it’s great.”

Fox News is spotlighting the top 10 GOP presidential candidates based on national polling averages during its main stage debate next week.

The remaining contenders will meet in an earlier, runoff debate conducted on the same evening.
