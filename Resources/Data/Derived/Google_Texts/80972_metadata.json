The DNR says it must be allowed to weigh in because of the impact on Minnesota farmlands.\n\nBut the department recently released a draft report that would seem to favor the diversion.\n\nThe report looked at the large-scale storage of water on farmlands as the only alternative to the diversion and concluded storage alone would not provide protection the Fargo-Moorhead area needs.\n\nBerseth said in theory, if the DNR approves the diversion as the corps designed it, his group would have to dismiss charges that involve the DNR. The more likely scenario, he said, is the DNR would agree a diversion is needed but it should be large enough just to protect currently developed areas, not as-yet vacant land.\n\nThe DNR is a key part of the lawsuit.\n\nThe Joint Powers Authority argues, among other things, that the corps has ignored federal environmental law by not taking into account the DNR\u2019s input and that it is violating Minnesota state law by starting a project the DNR has not approved.\n\nThe DNR is also a party to the lawsuit as an amicus curiae, or interested group, because it says its regulatory powers are threatened. The Diversion Authority claims that the corps\u2019 authority to build flood-control projects supersedes a state agency\u2019s authority, which the DNR disagrees with.\n\nBerseth said his group stays in close contact with the DNR, but has no influence over the state agency.\n\nBoth the Joint Powers Authority and the agency believe the diversion project as designed by the corps is larger, more expensive and potentially more economically damaging than is needed to protect existing Fargo-Moorhead properties. In other words, they say the project will also protect vacant land so metro-area developers can build more houses.\n\n\u201cThe Project would flood thousands of acres of Minnesota farmland in order to expand development opportunities in the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area,\u201d the DNR said in a filing.\n\nThe department is expected to release its draft findings on the diversion project in May or June.\n\nReaders can reach Forum reporter\n\nTu-Uyen Tran at (701) 241-5417", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,legislature,Diversion,DNR", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tu-Uyen Tran", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Though supporters of the flood diversion here see a recent report from the state of Minnesota as vindication of their position, an opponent of the project said it will not change his group\u2019s lawsuit \u201cone iota.\u201d\r\nNathan Berseth, a spokesman for the Richland-Wilkin Joint Powers Authori...", "title": "Diversion foes say DNR report won\u2019t affect lawsuit", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/legislature/3658700-diversion-foes-say-dnr-report-wont-affect-lawsuit", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Berseth-Nathan.jpg?itok=oPkooCXp", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FARGO \u2013 Though supporters of the flood diversion here see a recent report from the state of Minnesota as vindication of their position, an opponent of the project said it will not change his group\u2019s lawsuit \u201cone iota.\u201d\r\nNathan Berseth, a spokesman for the Richland-Wilkin Joint Powers Authori...", "creator": "TuUyenTranFCC", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/legislature/3658700-diversion-foes-say-dnr-report-wont-affect-lawsuit", "image": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Berseth-Nathan.jpg?itok=pa7NqLmH", "title": "Diversion foes say DNR report won\u2019t affect lawsuit", "site": "inforum", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1451861908361756}, "keywords": "News,legislature,Diversion,DNR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inforumFM", "tag": "News,legislature,Diversion,DNR", "modified_time": "2015-01-18T23:35:41-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Nathan Berseth, a spokesman for the Richland-Wilkin Joint Powers Authority"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Though supporters of the flood diversion here see a recent report from the state of Minnesota as vindication of their position, an opponent of the..."}, "article_summary": "The Diversion Authority claims that the corps\u2019 authority to build flood-control projects supersedes a state agency\u2019s authority, which the DNR disagrees with.\nThe department is expected to release its draft findings on the diversion project in May or June.\nHis group is suing the corps and the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Board of Authority in part because they\u2019ve begun construction without DNR approval.\nBerseth said in theory, if the DNR approves the diversion as the corps designed it, his group would have to dismiss charges that involve the DNR.\nThe DNR is also a party to the lawsuit as an amicus curiae, or interested group, because it says its regulatory powers are threatened."}
