Hospital execs are inundated with informative data and monthly reports, but the leaders who often make the best decisions to improve patient safety are the ones who step away from their desks every so often and walk around the organization to talk with staff and patients.

Leadership rounds are an informal way for CEOS to connect with frontline staff to discuss patient safety issues and ideas for systems improvement, says Catherine Miller, R.N., J.D., risk management and patient safety specialist for the Cooperative of American Physicians Inc.' CAPAssurance Program. And, she says, nearly every major patient safety organization considers rounding to be one of the best way leaders can show their commitment to patient safety. It reinforces to staff that their work matters.

"Staff are the greatest untapped resource in the hospital," says Miller, pictured right, during an exclusive interview with FierceHealthcare. "They are the ones who are ultimately familiar with the work and have the best ideas for fixing things. For CEOs to talk to staff directly and use the rounding to reinforce the organization's mission, it is a way for them to recognize staff for setting the standardâ€¦.It allows leaders to acknowledge staff on the spot. "

Two of the biggest obstacles to conducting these rounds are time and competing interests, but Miller says it's important to schedule the rounds and commit to them. "Like exercise, it's easy to put it off. There is always something burning and requires immediate attention. If it's not on your schedule and you plan for it, you can come up with excuses not to do it," she says.

But once it appears on the calendar, it's more than simply walking out the door and visiting units. Leaders must plan how to approach these visits. "You need to have a planning meeting for these to be successful," she says. "You can't just get together in a group and head out."
