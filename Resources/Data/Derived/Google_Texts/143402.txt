The 2016 Bassmaster Classic continues Saturday at both Grand Lake and in Tulsa.

Saturday is the second day of competition for the 55 professional anglers on Grand Lake.

Green Country's own Jason Christie is the leader after day one, with almost 2 pounds more than the angler in second place, Greg Vinson.



The anglers launched their boats at 7 a.m. from the Wolf Creek boat ramp.



Duck Creek was a hot spot for the pros during Saturday's round of competition.

Broken Arrow's James Elam had a big following on the lake.



"It's a lot of fun to watch him because he's young enough," spectator Lance Robinson said. "Because we've watched him grow up and been around the tournament circuit, it's a lot of fun to watch these local guys we want to see the local guys win this if we can."



Folks took out boats and followed around their favorites, with locals like Christie, Elam and Edwin Evers getting a lot of love.



"I think a lot of people will take advantage of the weather and come out to the lake and try and be apart of watching these guys work, and I think it's great..." said Ray Hoyt with Visit Tulsa.



Patrick Hildebrand and his friends won a trip to see the 2016 Bassmaster Classic through Yamaha after submitting a winning photograph of his daughter fishing.



"This is like a kid going to Disney World for us," Hildebrand said. "This is awesome."



Hildebrand and his buddies enjoy seeing the anglers up close.



"We love to do it," he said. "It's a passion... a dream come true for us."

Officials say boaters are free to go out and watch, but they need to make sure and stay out of the way of the competitors.

The weigh-in began at Tulsa's BOK Center at 4:30 p.m. Oklahoman Jason Christie is maintaining his spot on top.
