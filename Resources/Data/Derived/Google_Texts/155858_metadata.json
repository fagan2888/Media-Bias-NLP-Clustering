The fact that there is a little bit of confusion is not surprising to me.\u201d\n\nOpen enrollment for the Obamacare exchanges, or marketplaces, begins Nov. 1. However, Earnest said that because of the GOP\u2019s dishonesty, there might be fewer people signing up than there should be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible that we continue to see Republicans spend so much time and energy lying about the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just have political consequences, it has potentially real life consequences.\u201d\n\nEarnest said not to judge the success of the controversial law by polling results.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the success of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, I wouldn\u2019t consult poll numbers, I would actually consult the 17.6 million Americans who have gained coverage since the law went into effect,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nAsked about double-digit premium hikes, Earnest said, \u201cDouble-digit increases were quite common prior to the Affordable Care Act going into effect.\u201d He added, \u201cEighty-four percent of the people who received plans through the marketplace received financial assistance to make it affordable to them. \u201c", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;
