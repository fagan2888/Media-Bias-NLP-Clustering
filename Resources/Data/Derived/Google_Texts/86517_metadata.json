Political commentators \u2014 in the industry and elsewhere \u2014 expect at best only a slight loosening of Congress\u2019 legislative logjam this year.\n\nThey also expect President Barack Obama, for the first time in his presidency, to start wielding his veto power against bills dear to the GOP.\n\nFor the tire industry, there will be plenty of issues to address both in and out of Congress. The following is a look at what issues should draw increased attention in 2015.\n\nTire registration\n\nThe issue that promises to be the most contentious arose in the last month of 2014. On Dec. 9-10, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hosted a symposium in Washington on passenger tire safety. At that meeting, the Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) proposed an end to the voluntary tire registration rule approved by Congress in 1982 and a return to the mandatory system begun in the 1970s.\n\nThis recommendation was opposed by the Tire Industry Association (TIA), whose predecessor organization, the National Tire Dealers & Retreaders Association, fought a hard battle to end mandatory registration in the first place.\n\nAt a time when the NTSB is investigating fatal accidents involving recalled tires that somehow stayed on the road, strong measures are needed, according to Dan Zielinski, RMA senior vice president of public affairs.\n\n\u201cAfter more than 30 years of experience with voluntary tire registration, the difference in registration rates between independent retailers and company-owned stores is stark,\u201d Mr. Zielinski told Tire Business.\n\n\u201cThe system has not worked.\u201d\n\nBut while TIA favors stronger measures to register tires, it cannot support a registration system that places all the burdens and penalties solely on retailers, according to TIA Executive Vice President Roy Littlefield.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other product safety registration system in which the retailer is held responsible,\u201d Mr. Littlefield said.\n\n\u201cIf a child safety seat is recalled and can\u2019t be recovered, Wal-Mart doesn\u2019t get fined.\u201d\n\nAccording to TIA, fines for failing to register tires can total up to $16 million per retailer.\n\nTIA is doing everything it can to inform tire retailers and consumers about their responsibilities under the tire registration law, according to Roy Littlefield IV, TIA government affairs manager. Soon it will issue a video, \u201cTire Safety Begins with Tire Registration,\u201d which retailers can download free and play in their showrooms, he said.\n\nTire registration also will be a major part of TIA\u2019s Lobby Day, scheduled for Feb. 5, according to Messrs. Littlefield. During Lobby Day, TIA members will have a chance to meet with key legislators and congressional staff members to discuss the issues most crucial to tire retailers.\n\nRMA President Charles Cannon said that responsibility for tire registration properly belongs at the point of sale. But he also said his association is more than willing to work with TIA to create workable alternatives to the current system.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re suggesting is finding the best way to collect information if we\u2019re going to conduct a reasonable tire recall,\u201d Mr. Cannon said. The RMA told TIA in advance that it would recommend a return to mandatory registration at the NTSB symposium and looks forward to working with TIA to find mutually acceptable solutions, he said.\n\nMr. Littlefield, however, said TIA felt blindsided by the RMA\u2019s actions. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate the way things happened,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Littlefield said on Dec. 15 that he looked forward to discussing alternatives with the RMA, but also said he was still waiting for Mr. Cannon\u2019s call.\n\nChanging the current tire registration law would take an act of Congress. The NTSB report on tire safety is expected to be issued this summer.\n\nThe NTSB has no legislative power, but if it recommends a return to mandatory registration, that recommendation would have considerable persuasive force.\n\nTire safety, fuel efficiency\n\nOn the same day the NTSB symposium began, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx held a press conference at the White House to announce a new series of initiatives by the Obama administration designed to inform consumers on buying fuel-efficient tires and making sure their tires offer them maximum safety, fuel efficiency and service life.\n\nAmong other things, Mr. Foxx announced the release of a \u201cBe TireWise\u201d guide to tire safety and fuel efficiency; a \u201cDrive for Safety\u201d initiative with NASCAR during the 2015 racing season; and the designation of Dec. 9-Jan. 9 as \u201cTire Safety Awareness Month.\u201d\n\nAll of the RMA\u2019s tire manufacturing members pledged to support the administration\u2019s efforts, as did a number of major tire retailers.\n\nDuring the press conference, Mr. Foxx said that the long-planned tire fuel-efficiency labeling system would be released in 2017. Whereas tire manufacturers have been waiting for the labeling final rule since March 2010, Mr. Cannon said the RMA is not unduly upset about the further wait.\n\n\u201cThe administration sent all the right messages that day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis has certainly been a very long process, but when the White House sends a message saying that something is going to be done, we are confident it will be.\u201d\n\nMr. Littlefield was less pleased, however, because this means the consumer education portion of the tire fuel efficiency rule also will have to wait at least that long to be issued.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that this is taking so long,\u201d he said.\n\nScrap/used tires\n\nThe RMA scored a coup in the summer of 2014, when it won passage in Colorado of a bill designed simultaneously to clean up the state\u2019s 60-million-plus scrap tire monofill and ban \u201cunsafe\u201d used tires from its roads.\n\nThe details of the used tire portion of the Colorado bill are still being worked out, according to Mr. Zielinski. However, he said, the provisions would be simple enough: Any tire that a professional technician would remove from service \u2014 whether because of sidewall bulges, improper repairs, insufficient tread or visible damage \u2014 would be illegal under the Colorado bill.\n\nThe RMA will be particularly active in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas in seeking passage of used tire bills this year, while other states are \u201cbubbling,\u201d Mr. Zielinski said.\n\nScrap tire laws in other states seem to be working as they should, according to Mr. Zielinski. However, the RMA needs to be vigilant to make sure cash-strapped state legislatures don\u2019t start diverting scrap tire abatement funds to their states\u2019 general funds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for states when there\u2019s a downturn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the economy improves, they don\u2019t always send the money back.\u201d\n\nScrap tire markets also were rattled in 2014 by an NBC News story about soccer players on crumb rubber-enhanced athletic fields who were diagnosed with blood cancers. The RMA was quick to point out all the extant studies that show no correlation between rubber athletic turf and human disease.\n\n\u201cTo be fair to NBC, they found no technical basis for that claim,\u201d Mr. Zielinski said.\n\nTire aging\n\nTire aging has been an issue since 2003, when the first news reports about it appeared, according to the RMA.\n\nThe association expects to see more state legislatures consider bills this year to ban tires older than a certain age, despite the May 2014 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In that report, the agency said that stringent new tire safety standards and improved tire technology made tire-aging rulemaking unnecessary.\n\n\u201cPeople often intermingle tire aging and tire age,\u201d Mr. Zielinski said. Tire aging \u2014 based far more on inflation, maintenance and storage than on the date of manufacture \u2014 determines a tire\u2019s service life, he said.\n\nTIA expects to see a lot of state bills on the tire-aging issue. A way out of the tire-aging controversy, according to Mr. Littlefield III, might be the public safety standards developed in Europe and now adopted in 31 countries. \u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle, but it\u2019s the right battle,\u201d he said.\n\nImport duties\n\nThe United Steelworkers (USW) union filed petitions with the International Trade Commission (ITC) in June 2014 for countervailing and antidumping duties against Chinese passenger and light truck tires.\n\nIn its petitions, the USW complained that Chinese imports had soared since the end of Section 421 tariffs in September 2012. The Commerce Department made a preliminary determination Dec. 1 finding material injury in the countervailing duty case, and is scheduled to make its preliminary determination in the antidumping duty case Jan. 21.\n\nTIA remains opposed to duties on passenger and light truck tires, although it sees them as likely.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the issue, Obama\u2019s on safe ground,\u201d Roy Littlefield III said. \u201cHe can do a favor for the unions while saying he\u2019s protecting American jobs.\u201d\n\nTIA, however, sees the issue as skewing free trade and tire distribution without any real benefit to the economy. \u201cThe average retailer carries seven or eight brands of tires, and there are reasons for that,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of those reasons is cost.\u201d\n\nTIA plans to meet with Commerce officials before the January antidumping ruling, according to Mr. Littlefield. However, the association has not taken any position on duties against Chinese off-the-road tires, although Mr. Littlefield said he is puzzled by the change at the Commerce Department in determining antidumping duties.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that the petitioner had to prove that the tire was being sold at less than fair value,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, Commerce can justify a 105-percent duty against Double Coin by determining a percentage of ownership.\u201d\n\nTransportation\n\nAlong with tire registration, legislation to fund the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure \u2014 and what it might contain \u2014 will be the focus of TIA\u2019s Federal Lobby Day, according to Mr. Littlefield.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Let the Highway Bill Jeopardize Your Business\u201d is the headline for the first of TIA\u2019s Federal Lobby Day fliers. The current stopgap measure signed by President Barack Obama last August lasts only until May 2015, and its successor, TIA said, could contain many things detrimental to tire retailers and retreaders. These include:\n\nAn increase in the motor fuel tax of anywhere from 15 cents to $2 per gallon;\n\nReinstatement of the federal excise tax (FET) on passenger tires;\n\nA 10-percent increase of the truck tire FET;\n\nReinstatement of a tax on tread rubber of 5 to 15 cents per pound; and\n\nA 10-percent increase of the FET on trucks and truck parts.\n\n\u201cOur infrastructure\u2019s falling apart, and we have to fix it if we want a sound economy,\u201d Mr. Littlefield said. \u201cThe question is how you\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d\n\nHealthcare\n\nWith both houses of Congress in Republican control, legislation to repeal or revamp the Affordable Care Act seems virtually certain. Meanwhile small businesses must cope with some difficult provisions in the health care law, Mr. Littlefield said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate how the Affordable Care Act is playing out in the workforce,\u201d Mr. Littlefield said.\n\nBecause of the clause exempting small businesses from providing health care benefits to employees working less than 30 hours a week, small businesses are cutting hours for formerly full-time employees to avoid dealing with the law, he said.\n\n\u201cThis was an unintended effect of the law, and it\u2019s bad for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nEstate tax/tax extenders\n\nThe 113th Congress ended late on Dec. 16 with passage of a bill temporarily extending various tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including several popular with small business. These include expedited expensing of capital investments and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which allows small businesses to deduct a portion of the first-year wages of disadvantaged workers.\n\nOne tax break TIA and other small business associations advocate is repeal of the estate tax, which they have advocated for many years.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll get a bill through Congress for the first time in years,\u201d Mr. Littlefield said.\n\n\u201cBut it will be more symbolic than anything,\u201d he said, since President Obama has promised to veto any bill repealing the estate tax.\n\nEven more worrisome to TIA than the estate tax is the potential repeal of LIFO, the \u201clast in, first out\u201d accounting system that assumes that assets produced or acquired last are the ones sold, used or discarded first.\n\nIf LIFO is repealed, it would cost small business an estimated $80 billion in the first year alone, according to Mr. Littlefield.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lobbying a lot right now to save LIFO,\u201d he said. \u201cMany members of Congress are sympathetic to LIFO, but they don\u2019t want to go public. LIFO repeal could go into a tax package, and they don\u2019t want to go back on their promise to raise revenue without raising taxes.\u201d\n\nEPA\n\nMany initiatives at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) affect the tire industry either directly or indirectly, according to Tracey Norberg, RMA senior vice president and general counsel. The RMA participates in many coalitions following broad EPA actions, such as one monitoring the pending National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, she said.\n\nOne EPA action affecting the tire industry directly is its request for comments on the use of biomass as an energy feedstock, according to Ms. Norberg.\n\n\u201cScrap tires are being treated favorably because of their natural rubber content,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a real opportunity to promote an end-use for tires as fuel.\u201d\n\nRight to Repair\n\nThe automotive aftermarket won a double victory early in 2014 in its advocacy of the Motor Vehicle Owners\u2019 Right to Repair Act.\n\nThe Right to Repair Act requires auto makers to provide to independent auto repair shops\u2014at a reasonable price and in an accessible manner\u2014the same repair and diagnostic information and tools they give their franchised dealers.\n\nIn January 2014, the Massachusetts legislature gave final approval to its version of the Right to Repair Act. Shortly thereafter, auto makers signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with aftermarket associations to provide diagnostic tools and information to independent garages.\n\nMr. Littlefield said he anticipated no legislative action on Right to Repair. \u201cFrom what we\u2019re hearing from New England, we\u2019re happy and optimistic that the information will be distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re more concerned about the cost than anything else.\u201d\n\nThe Automotive Service Association (ASA), which negotiated its own information agreement with auto makers in 2002 and opposed Right to Repair legislation, said it is happy with the current state of affairs.\n\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re getting the information, we\u2019re good to go,\u201d said Robert L. Redding, ASA Washington representative.\n\n\u201cThe MOU is a good thing. Right to Repair bills have dropped off, and they were a major distraction. We had to use our very limited resources to fight them, not just staff members but volunteers, and shop owners had to take time off from their businesses to tell state legislatures that they were satisfied with the information they were getting.\u201d\n\nIt is very difficult to predict from the Massachusetts law which informational tools auto makers will include in their offerings to independent garages, Mr. Redding said.\n\nThis is particularly problematic in relation to telematics, the technology of transmitting vehicle information via telecommunications, he added.\n\nEnsuring the rights of motorists and shop owners to telematics-related information will be a major focus for the ASA in 2015, he said. The association had a telematics seminar at its annual NACE/CARS event in Detroit in 2014, and plans to do the same in 2015, he said.\n\nSafety inspections\n\nOnly 17 states have some sort of periodic vehicle inspection laws on their books, Mr. Redding said. Now, however, the ASA and its allies may have a chance to increase that number.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where there\u2019s a lot of buzz and a lot of interest about vehicle safety,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no road map for that effort to move forward.\u201d\n\nIn collaboration with the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association and the American Maintenance & Repair Association, the ASA hosted a vehicle safety meeting in Pennsylvania in November to promote vehicle safety inspections, according to Mr. Redding. The associations were very pleased with the result, with attendees including government administrators, policy makers, aftermarket manufacturers and auto repair professionals, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it again in 2015, and we plan to take it on the road,\u201d he said.\n\n______________________________________\n\nTo reach this reporter: mmoore@crain.com.", "article_metadata": {"category": "NEWS", "article_guid": "019768DE-09CD-4758-807A-62D95B0FCFAC", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The new year promises to be an intense one in legislation and rulemaking for all stakeholders in the tire industry.2015 also will usher in a new Congress in which the Republicans will be in firm control of both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.
