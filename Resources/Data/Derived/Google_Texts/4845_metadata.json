On a day so hot at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore., that Coburn wore a cooling vest before her race, she tucked behind leader Stephanie Garcia about two-thirds of the race before easing her way to the front and cruising to her fourth U.S. title in 9 minutes, 15.59 seconds, topping her own meet record set last year (9:19.72).\n\nAnd she made it look easy.\n\n\u201cI felt comfortable, and I was happy to have some company,\u201d Coburn told The Denver Post. \u201d I was surprised when I saw the time because my last 150 I let off the gas a little bit. I didn\u2019t kick like I was trying to break an American record. I wasn\u2019t paying attention at all to splits. The goal was just to win.\u201d\n\nGarcia (New Balance) finished second in 9:23.48 and Colleen Quigley (Bowerman Track Club) was third in 9:24.92.\n\nThe win earns Coburn (New Balance), the former CU steeplechase star who was running just her second steeplechase of the year, a spot representing the United States on the world team in Beijing from Aug. 22-30. It\u2019s her second world team (she also made it in 2011).\n\nCoburn nearly tripped in the latter part of the race, stumbling briefly on the railing. She said she was looking up at her coaches, CU\u2019s Mark Wetmore and Heather Burroughs, for guidance when it happened. By then, though, she and Garcia had separated considerably from the rest of the pack, and she quickly regained her composure.\n\nHer race strategy was based partly on how last year\u2019s race played out \u2014 someone jumped to the lead, and she was able to eventually win. Garcia\u2019s pace was fast enough for the pack to string out.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t be predictable that I\u2019m going to take it from the gun every time,\u201d she said. \u201cI enjoy racing that way, but I can\u2019t let my opponents know that that\u2019s the only way I know how to race.\u201d\n\nCoburn \u2014 who said she was in the best shape of her life \u2014 will return to Boulder for training before turning her attention to two Diamond League races in Lausanne, Switzerland, on July 9 and Monaco on July 17. She\u2019ll return to Boulder before arriving in Beijing a week or two before her first race at the world championships on Aug. 24.\n\n\u201cI hope my race indicated I\u2019m at least where I was a year ago if not a couple of steps ahead,\u201d she said. \u201d I feel fit, and it\u2019s just a matter of getting in some fast races and testing my fitness with that time. \u2026 My workouts have been going really well. And I\u2019m just excited to get in some races where winning isn\u2019t necessarily paramount.\u201d\n\nTo realistically make the podium at worlds, Coburn said she\u2019ll have to run between 9:05 and 9:08 (her best is 9:11.42, set last year). She was the No. 2-ranked women\u2019s steepler last year and Saturday\u2019s time also puts her at No. 2 in the world this year.\n\nLast year, several top competitors in the event either weren\u2019t competing or weren\u2019t racing well. Coburn said her goal was to finish in the top 5 in Beijing, but there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019s a medal contender. Still, she deflected talk that she would make the podium, saying it was too early in the track season to gauge her fitness in seven weeks and the performances of her rivals.\n\nAnother former Colorado steeplechaser, Shalaya Kipp, finished sixth in 9:37.09. The top three finishers in each event advance to the world championships, assuming they have the minimum world standard.\n\nOn Sunday, Coburn\u2019s training partners, Jenny Simpson and Kara Goucher, will both compete in the final day of the championships \u2014 Simpson in the 1500 meters and Goucher in the 5,000.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emma Coburn cruises to fourth U.S. steeplechase title in Eugene", "title": "Emma Coburn cruises to fourth U.S. steeplechase title in Eugene", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/27/emma-coburn-cruises-to-fourth-u-s-steeplechase-title-in-eugene/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150628_120325_emma-coburn-steeplechase-usa-outdoors-2015.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150628_120325_emma-coburn-steeplechase-usa-outdoors-2015.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-28T00:00:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T17:45:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "The top three finishers in each event advance to the world championships, assuming they have the minimum world standard.\nIt\u2019s her second world team (she also made it in 2011).\nEmma Coburn tested a decidedly different strategy in the 3,000 meter steeplechase final at the U.S.\n\u201cI felt comfortable, and I was happy to have some company,\u201d Coburn told The Denver Post.\nShe\u2019ll return to Boulder before arriving in Beijing a week or two before her first race at the world championships on Aug. 24."}
