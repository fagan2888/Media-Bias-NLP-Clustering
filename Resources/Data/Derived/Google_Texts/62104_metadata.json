The decline in private practice physicians actually began a few years ago when changes to Medicare forced many physicians who practiced individually or in small group offices to make the move to a salaried position in a hospital.\n\nBut there is no doubt that Obamacare has exacerbated the problem. The onerous recordkeeping is one big reason why private practice physicians are becoming extinct. Private physicians can't afford the extra employees to meet the demands of Obamacare paperwork.\n\nDr, Paul Hsieh explained in a PJ Media series we published on the rollout of Obamacare:\n\nThe second component of Big Medicine is the shift of doctors away from independent private practice and towards becoming hospital employees. Doctors face many of the same pressures as hospitals. As eWeek reported, \u201cDoctors are abandoning their private practices to join large health organizations so they can lower their costs and meet government mandates on electronic health records.\u201d By becoming hospital employees, doctors lose autonomy, but enjoy more regular hours and a more predictable salary. In return, hospitals gain access to a guaranteed supply of patients from their employee-physicians. Last year the Washington Post reported, \u201c[T]he number of physicians who own their firms dropped from 57 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2009, and it\u2019s projected to continue falling to 33 percent by 2013.\u201d As oncologist Patrick Cobb recently told CNN, \u201cWe have a joke that there are two kinds of private practices left in America. Those that sold to hospitals and those that are about to be sold.\u201d [...] In contrast, the shakeup in health care is towards greater \u2014 not lesser \u2014 consolidation. This is because the government \u2014 not patients \u2014 will be increasingly in charge of the money. Under ObamaCare, government is projected to account for a whopping 66% of overall health spending. More centralized control of health spending will inevitably mean more centralized control of health care. Nor is this centralization of health care some \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of ObamaCare. Rather, it is an explicitly desired goal. In 2010, Obama health advisor Nancy-Ann DeParle wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine that the health law will \u201caccelerate physician employment by hospitals and aggregation into larger physician groups\u201d and that \u201cphysicians will need to embrace rather than resist change.\u201d\n\nWhether physicians resist the change or not is beside the point. The precipitous decline of private practice physicians will allow hospitals to jack up their prices -- exactly the opposite effect of what the government intended with Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Doctors Abandoning Private Practice in Droves to Work at Hospitals | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Driven out by Obamacare.", "title": "Doctors Abandoning Private Practice in Droves to Work at Hospitals", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/doctors-abandoning-private-practice-in-droves-to-work-at-hospitals/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/02/1-322.jpg", "updated_time": 1464127952, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Driven out by Obamacare.", "title": "Doctors Abandoning Private Practice in Droves to Work at Hospitals", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/doctors-abandoning-private-practice-in-droves-to-work-at-hospitals/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/02/1-322.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Doctors Abandoning Private Practice in Droves to Work at Hospitals | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Doctors Abandoning Private Practice in Droves to Work at Hospitals", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce738\"", "article_summary": "Doctors Abandoning Private Practice in Droves to Work at HospitalsDoctors are leaving private practice to become employees of hospitals, according to this story in the New York Times.\nThe onerous recordkeeping is one big reason why private practice physicians are becoming extinct.\nThe precipitous decline of private practice physicians will allow hospitals to jack up their prices -- exactly the opposite effect of what the government intended with Obamacare.\nMore centralized control of health spending will inevitably mean more centralized control of health care.\nThe decline in private practice physicians actually began a few years ago when changes to Medicare forced many physicians who practiced individually or in small group offices to make the move to a salaried position in a hospital."}
