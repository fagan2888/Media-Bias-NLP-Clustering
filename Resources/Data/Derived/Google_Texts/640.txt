Sioux Falls, SD

The Outdoor Campus continues to bounce back after a suspicious fire burned down a storage shed and destroyed much of their equipment with their 5th Annual Outdoor University event.

The free event gives people of all ages a chance to try out kayaking, canoeing, fishing, rock climbing, and other activities the Outdoor Campus offers. There will be wildlife and hunting activities for kids as well.

Head to the Outdoor Campus from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to participate in the event. No preregistration is required.

Over $10,000 has been donated to the Outdoor Campus since the fire, allowing them to purchase 13 kayaks and four canoes so far.
