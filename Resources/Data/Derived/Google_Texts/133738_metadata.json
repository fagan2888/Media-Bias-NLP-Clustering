One after another, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, Huffington Post, National Public Radio and pretty much every other media organization you can name issue their proprietary, definitive lists of the best books of 2014. Even Bill Gates publishes a list of his own favorites.\n\nGates\u2019s picks include Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty-First Century (a hot title this year) and the yet-to-be-published The Rose Effect by Graeme Simison (sadly, I can\u2019t share Gates\u2019 enthusiasm for the book.) Gates\u2019s list includes old and new books he read over the course of the last 12 months, and if I were including older books on my list, one of the novels topping it would be Hans Fallada\u2019s Every Man Dies Alone. First published in 1947, shortly after the author\u2019s death, it wasn\u2019t even translated into English until 2009, and it\u2019s the kind of book that I want to shove into the hands of every serious reader I know. But looking just at the \u201cbest\u201d of the fiction published in 2014, Fallada\u2019s novel, alas, doesn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nRelated: 6 Great Novels Worth Reading in 2014\n\nThe criteria for the books that do make it: A great novel is a perfect three-legged stool. It features characters who are so vividly drawn that I am convinced they are real; a plot that is engaging and convincing enough not to pull me away from the narrative in either skepticism or incredulity; and finally, a writing style that is clear, vivid and distinctive. Put all three together, above a certain level, and magic happens.\n\nSome of the books below you\u2019ll find on other lists. Some of them you won\u2019t \u2014 and I\u2019d argue they\u2019ve been unfairly overlooked, of course. But in all cases, I\u2019m confident that they represent a cross section of the best that publishers had to offer readers over the course of 2014. And if you\u2019re looking for something to read \u2014 or something to give \u2014 for the holidays, these lists are a great place to start. And check back tomorrow for our non-fiction picks.\n\nRelated: 6 Top Non-Fiction Books for Your 2014 Reading List\n\nAn Unnecessary Woman by Rabih Alameddine\n\nAaliyah Saleh lives alone in her Beirut apartment \u2014 the unnecessary woman of the title, it is her self-imposed work of translating a great work of literature into Arabic that keeps her going. But at the age of 72, change may be afoot. Ruthlessly unsentimental but tremendously moving, Alameddine has created in Aaliyah a memorable heroine with a vivid, forceful personality and a strong narrative voice. An Unforgettable Woman may have been a better title. Short-listed for the National Book Award.\n\nBarracuda by Christos Tsiolkas\n\nTsiolkas has a knack for making readers uncomfortable. His characters are rare people we\u2019d love to have become our closest friends, and the problems they create for themselves make for difficult reading. But Tsiolkas, whose latest novel was long-listed for this year\u2019s Man Booker Award, also has an incredible knack for crafting great stories out of compelling themes. In the case of the story of Daniel Kelly, a confused, angry and shame-ridden boy from the wrong side of the tracks, it\u2019s the tale of how the dream of competing for gold medals in swimming on behalf of Australia went sour, and what happened next. Yes, the tale skips around in time; yes, it\u2019s gritty and sometimes unpleasant \u2014 but it\u2019s heartbreakingly real.\n\nThe Quick by Lauren Owen\n\nI don\u2019t like vampire novels. Really, I don\u2019t. But I loved this novel. And if you\u2019re looking for something light \u2014 well, actually, a memorably eerie homage to some of great classic horror novels \u2014 you would do well to check this out. Charlotte Norbury discovers an underground London in 1892, when her younger brother disappears from sight. She soon discovers that rescuing him from the Aegolius Club will be a tall order\u2026 Creepy. Not literary, but fabulous genre fiction.\n\nThe Paying Guests by Sarah Waters\n\nWaters bridges the gap between a mystery novel and a novel of social commentary in this book, set in the 1920s. The times have changed, and the no-longer-wealthy Wray family live in genteel poverty; forced to take in paying guests (aka lodgers) to keep themselves from starving and their large house in a leafy enclave of south London from collapsing, they end up playing host to a couple several rungs beneath them on the social ladder, to Mrs. Wray\u2019s horror. But Frances, her 26-year-old daughter, is fascinated by Lillian Barber \u2014 perhaps overly so. And that fascination sets in train an unimaginable chain of events. It\u2019s slow to unfold, but every scene is pure gold in terms of atmosphere and character.\n\nThe Betrayers by David Bezmozgis\n\nIf you haven\u2019t encountered Bezmozgis\u2019 writing, get him on your radar screen with this novel. The tale of betrayal that unfolds is almost epic in scale, even though it takes place over the course of only 24 hours in the life of an Israeli politician and former Soviet refusenik. Fleeing a political and sexual scandal in Israel, Baruch Kotler and his mistress end up in Yalta and face the ghosts of Kotler\u2019s past. Brilliant prose; captivating stories. He has been compared to Philip Roth, but I find his writing more consistently accessible. This was shortlisted for Canada\u2019s Giller Prize.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nThe Blazing World by Siri Hustvedt\n\nby Siri Hustvedt Euphoria by Lily King\n\nby Lily King Moriarty by Anthony Horwitz\n\nby Anthony Horwitz The Rise and Fall of Great Powers by Tom Rachman\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This is the time of year when booklovers feel overwhelmed, not only by the choice of b", "title": "The Best Books of 2014: Our 5 Favorite Novels", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/21/Best-Books-2014-Our-5-Favorite-Novels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-09-06T135043Z_1_CBRE98512GU00_RTROPTP_2_APPLE-E-BOOKS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/21/Best-Books-2014-Our-5-Favorite-Novels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-09-06T135043Z_1_CBRE98512GU00_RTROPTP_2_APPLE-E-BOOKS.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This is the time of year when booklovers feel overwhelmed, not only by the choice of b", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: 6 Great Novels Worth Reading in 2014The criteria for the books that do make it: A great novel is a perfect three-legged stool.\nBut looking just at the \u201cbest\u201d of the fiction published in 2014, Fallada\u2019s novel, alas, doesn\u2019t make the cut.\nThis is the time of year when booklovers feel overwhelmed, not only by the choice of books at hand, but by the lists.\nGates\u2019s list includes old and new books he read over the course of the last 12 months, and if I were including older books on my list, one of the novels topping it would be Hans Fallada\u2019s Every Man Dies Alone.\nBut in all cases, I\u2019m confident that they represent a cross section of the best that publishers had to offer readers over the course of 2014."}
