Graduation season is in full swing, meaning thousands of local students will be transitioning from high school to colleges across the nation.

Several Southeast High School seniors received full-ride scholarships, an accomplishment anyone should be proud of, but especially for one student who's biggest challenges were outside of the classroom.

Among the hundreds of graduates from Southeast, you won't find many more decorated than Simeon Willis.

"ROTC cord for being a part of ROTC for 4 years, another avid cord..." says Simeon.

Many students see Simeon as a leader, but most don't know the every day struggles he often deals with alone.

"Parents, stable parents being there," he says.

Simeon grew up moving in and out of houses and spent years without basic necessities like a bed.

"There's a lot of necessities that other students had that I wasn't offered, but I think I did pretty well with what I had."

The turning point was freshman year when he joined JROTC, a military regulated program to teach high school students about leadership.

"That program really focused on my academics and supported me in my decision to want to go to West Point."

West Point Academy had been Simeon's dream college throughout his years at Southeast. After working hard alongside mentors in the classroom and in the gym, test scores and physical fitness tests were matched with a prestigious acceptance letter.

He wants his journey to be a message to other young students facing adversity in every day life.

"Strive for the best because although you may not have all the things that you need or all the things that you want, you can still do it, even if you have to be independent and have support from other people. It's possible."

Simeon will spend one year at the West Point Prep School, then will head to the academy. He hopes to have a successful career in the military.
