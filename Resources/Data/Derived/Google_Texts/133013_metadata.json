No one is ever going to see a McCarrick uniform again after (the Snapple Bowl), so this is like the closing of Cardinal McCarrick pretty much for sports.\u201d\n\nUnlike the football players, who wore custom-made Nike uniforms in the game, the Snapple Bowl cheerleaders sported their distinctive high school uniforms, forming a kaleidoscope of colors while rallying the crowd from the sidelines and performing their halftime routine.\n\nA South Amboy resident, Leff was clad in the school\u2019s blue, gold and white uniform with Cardinal McCarrick High School\u2019s initials \u2014 CMHS \u2014 emblazoned across the chest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that Sabrina (had) a chance to represent the school one more time,\u201d said former Cardinal McCarrick Athletics Director Gil Pritchard, who worked at the South Amboy-based parochial school since 1978.\n\n\u201cCertainly, it\u2019s a little sad, but when you think about the history of the school, so many people have always helped us, so it\u2019s great when our kids have the opportunity to give back to the community.\u201d\n\nCheering in the Snapple Bowl, which has raised more than $485,000 over the past 21 years for Children\u2019s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside and the Edison-based Lakeview School, a program of the New Jersey Institute for Disabilities, had added meaning for Leff, who visited the Lakeview students this week.\n\n\u201cKnowing I was picked to cheer in the game really means a lot to me,\u201d said Leff, who is among the youngest cheerleaders to ever participate in the Snapple Bowl.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fabulous,\u201d Middlesex County cheerleading coach Colleen Meyers said, noting Leff was a fitting candidate to represent Cardinal McCarrick. \u201cShe represents Middlesex County well, as all these girls do. I\u2019m very happy that she\u2019s our last Cardinal McCarrick representative because she really does embody all that is good about cheerleading.\u201d\n\nMarcus Borden, the game\u2019s founder and director, who graduated in 1973 from Notre Dame High School, a catholic school in Utica, New York, called Thursday night \u201ca sad day for McCarrick but a great day for Sabrina to be able to go out and be the last one to represent her school.\u201d\n\nBorden said he is all too familiar with the struggles of Catholic schools nationwide and locally.\n\n\u201cI can appreciate the circumstances with parochial schools closing,\u201d Borden said. \u201cTuition and enrollment have always been an issue.\u201d\n\nWith the 2010 closing of St. Peter\u2019s in New Brunswick, and St. Pius X in Piscataway shutting its doors 20 years earlier, Middlesex County now has just two parochial high schools, both of which field football programs. Linebacker Alex Dawes and wide receiver Javon Hicks represented Bishop Ahr and St. Joseph, respectively, as Middlesex County parochial school players in Snapple Bowl XXII, while Bishop Ahr\u2019s Titilayo Agbabiaka and Jenna Juarez both cheered Thursday night.\n\nNo parochial schools play football in Union County, where Catholic schools, such as reigning New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) Tournament of Champions winner Roselle Catholic and Union Catholic, are known more for their success on the basketball court. In Somerset County, Immaculata remains a Catholic school football power, having won four state championships in 27 NJSIAA playoff appearances.\n\nCiting declining enrollment and mounting deficits, the Diocese of Metuchen announced in late May that Cardinal McCarrick would close at the end of the 2014-15 academic year. The high school, formerly known as St. Mary, had a rich athletics tradition.\n\nCardinal McCarrick\u2019s most notable graduates include former Major League Baseball managers Tom Kelly and Jack McKeon, who won World Series titles with the Minnesota Twins and Florida Marlins, respectively, and former New York Yankee and Cleveland Indian Allie Clark, who won a World Series ring with each of those clubs as a player.\n\nMost of Cardinal McCarrick\u2019s boys basketball program, which won two Greater Middlesex Conference Tournament titles in the past 13 years and reached the finals one other time during that span, has transferred to Mater Dei, where former Eagles mentor Ben Gamble recently was hired as head coach.\n\n\u201cAll my friends are going to be split up,\u201d said Leff, noting that most former Cardinal McCarrick students will attend either Bishop Ahr in Edison or Mater Dei.\n\nShe said she remains concerned for those teachers and administrators who remain unemployed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know all the teachers don\u2019t have jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nPritchard is among those who remain under the Diocese of Metuchen\u2019s employ. He recently was named principal of Sacred Heart Elementary School in South Amboy.\n\nIn addition to cheering for the Snapple Bowl\u2019s beneficiaries, Leff said that she will in a way be cheering for all of Cardinal McCarrick\u2019s former students and staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to close it off with respect and spirit,\u201d she said, \u201cand to really show that McCarrick is a good school.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Mx5g4U", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Snapple Bowl provides Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader last hurrah", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Snapple Bowl provides Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader last hurrah", "title": "Snapple Bowl provides Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader last hurrah", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/outreach/caring-communities/2015/07/16/snapple-bowl-provides-cardinal-mccarrick-cheerleader-last-hurrah/30267531/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Snapple Bowl provides Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader last hurrah", "title": "Snapple Bowl provides Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader last hurrah", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f25767e5d6651236cb2418fcefd545eb4d48662e/c=261-0-1739-1478&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/16/Bridgewater/B9317969069Z.1_20150716191532_000_G0VBCBQJP.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "\u201cShe\u2019s fabulous,\u201d Middlesex County cheerleading coach Colleen Meyers said, noting Leff was a fitting candidate to represent Cardinal McCarrick.\nA South Amboy resident, Leff was clad in the school\u2019s blue, gold and white uniform with Cardinal McCarrick High School\u2019s initials \u2014 CMHS \u2014 emblazoned across the chest.\n\u201cEven though I\u2019m going to another school, my heart is always going to be at Cardinal McCarrick.\nCiting declining enrollment and mounting deficits, the Diocese of Metuchen announced in late May that Cardinal McCarrick would close at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.\nCiting declining enrollment and mounting deficits, the Diocese of Metuchen announced in late May that Cardinal McCarrick would close at the end of the 2014-15 academic yearBuy Photo Cardinal McCarrick cheerleader Sabrina Leff represents the now-defunct catholic school at Snapple Bowl XXII, Thursday, July 16, 2015, in Union, NJ."}
