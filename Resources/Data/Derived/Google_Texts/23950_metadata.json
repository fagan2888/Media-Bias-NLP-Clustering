Russell, Gabourey Sidibe, Hollywood, lupita nyong'o, mia farrow, Oscars 2014, The $11 billion year, the oscars, Viola Davis, Woody Allen, Entertainment News\n\nAnne Thompson knows the Oscars.\n\nThe veteran journalist, now affiliated with Indiewire, has been covering the Academy Awards for years; her new book, \u201cThe $11 Billion Year,\u201d runs through the events of 2012, culminating in the Oscar campaign that saw Ben Affleck\u2019s \u201cArgo\u201d take the 2012 best picture trophy. (Was it just last year?)\n\nReached by phone at LAX as she prepared to leave Los Angeles, post-Oscars, Thompson discussed the \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d Oscar win, which had come to seem something of a surprise after widespread predictions that its themes made it a less-than-ideal movie for a stodgy, largely white group to honor. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this year was ugly,\u201d said Thompson, noting that the arguments that academy members wouldn\u2019t watch the film were overblown.\n\nAs for the future of \u201cSlave\u201d star Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who became a red-carpet icon before picking up the best supporting actress Oscar, Thompson nodded to Gabourey Sidibe and Viola Davis, both of whom have worked consistently since their Oscar nominations despite a paucity of roles for black women, as potential role models. As for Cate Blanchett\u2019s best actress win \u2014 despite her appearing in a film by Woody Allen, recently the subject of great controversy over allegations raised by his daughter, Thompson said: \u201cThe scandal was a long time ago. You have this very noisy media vortex that takes on a life of its own.\u201d As her book documents, she\u2019s been at the center of that vortex through good and bad for quite some time.\n\nYour book describes the opponents of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d whose opposition arguably led to that film underperforming at the Oscars. Did you see any ugly campaigns this year?\n\nWell, it isn\u2019t so much ugly. I wouldn\u2019t say this year was ugly. What you saw were memes. Working with such a small group of about 6,000 academy members, it\u2019s very easy to plant an idea. That\u2019s why the trades are so powerful; you can plant things in the conversation. There was a lot of talk that people weren\u2019t going to watch \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d I knew that since it was one of the top contenders people would still be watching it, they\u2019d be obligated to watch it. I don\u2019t believe anybody voted for it without seeing the film. The academy \u2014 they\u2019re all guilty of working on crap a lot of the time, but they believe in art. They want to do the right thing, they\u2019re all pretty liberal.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Lupita Nyong\u2019o? Actresses have often had trouble finding great roles after Oscar wins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The author on Mia, Woody, Lupita and the \"12 Years a Slave\" victory", "title": "Hollywood journalist Anne Thompson on the Oscars: \u201cInside the Academy, they know Mia Farrow\u2019s a sophisticated media operator\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The author on Mia, Woody, Lupita and the \"12 Years a Slave\" victory", "title": "Hollywood journalist Anne Thompson on the Oscars: \u201cInside the Academy, they know Mia Farrow\u2019s a sophisticated media operator\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/hollywood_journalist_anne_thompson_on_the_oscars_inside_the_academy_they_know_mia_farrows_a_sophisticated_media_operator/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/oscars_backstage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The author on Mia, Woody, Lupita and the \"12 Years a Slave\" victory", "title": "Hollywood journalist Anne Thompson on the Oscars: \u201cInside the Academy, they know Mia Farrow\u2019s a sophisticated media operator\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/oscars_backstage.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 12 years a slave, Academy Awards, American Hustle, anne thompson, cate blanchett, David O.
