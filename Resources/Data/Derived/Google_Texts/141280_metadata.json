Payrolls nationwide rose by 2.2 percent.\n\n\u201cDuring the recession, we lost more jobs percentage-wise than California or the U.S. because we relied so much on construction and sub-prime mortgage companies,\u201d said Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi. \u201cNow we are in catch-up mode.\u201d\n\nOrange County\u2019s jobless rate, which is not adjusted for seasonal changes, dropped to 4.1 in April, the lowest it has been since June 2007. Last month, it stood at 4.4 percent and a year earlier at 5.1 percent.\n\nCalifornia and U.S. rates, which are seasonally adjusted, were 6.3 percent and 5.4 percent respectively.\n\nSignificantly, unemployment rates did not just drop over the year because people decided to stop looking for work, as happened throughout the recession. The labor force, which includes both workers and job-seekers, expanded by 1.7 percent in Orange County, faster than local population growth.\n\nJobs in Orange County rose over the year across almost all sectors, including manufacturing, where employment grew at a rate of 2.6 percent. In all, the county added 50,500 jobs.\n\nThe recent building boom is particularly good news because construction jobs tend to have a domino effect. With the purchase of new homes, people buy more furniture, appliances and services such as landscaping.\n\n\u201cPrices are up and inventory for resale homes is extremely tight,\u201d Adibi said. \u201cSo builders are responding to the high demand, particularly for multi-family housing. Also, some people have recaptured equity in their homes, and so they are remodeling. \u201c\n\nOther sectors that expanded in the twelve months through April include:\n\n\u2022 Professional and Business Services, which added 10,300 jobs, with 60 percent of the growth in professional, scientific and technical services. Law is the only profession to have lost jobs, reflecting a national trend.\n\n\u2022 Educational and health services, which added 9,900 jobs, with 66 percent of the increase in social assistance and health care. Expanded health insurance under Obamacare has fueled the growth.\n\n\u2022 Leisure and hospitality, including restaurants, hotels and theme parks, which grew by 4,100, at a 2.1 percent rate.\n\n\u2022 Government, a category that fell dramatically during the recession, but which has bounced back, adding 3,308 jobs, including 1,800 in local public schools.\n\n\u2022 Financial activities, including those at banks and other lenders, which grew by 3,400, at a 3 percent rate, thanks in part to a pick-up in home purchasing and refinancing.\n\nStatewide, the 6.3 percent unemployment rate is the lowest since February 2008, and the gap between California\u2019s rate and the nationwide rate has narrowed to where it was before the recession.\n\n\u201cThe wage and salary job gains we\u2019ve been seeing for many months have been impressive,\u201d said Robert Kleinhenz, an economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s economy is pulled forward by tech and tourism,\u201d he added, noting that with the slowdown in the Texas energy industry, the Golden State has pushed past the Lone Star State in job creation.\n\nThe competition between the two states with the biggest job markets has been fierce in recent years, with Texas officials seeking to lure California companies. However, Texas payrolls increased by just 1,200 jobs in April, while California added 29,500 new positions.\n\nWith the state\u2019s payroll growth of 457,000 year over year, \u201cCalifornia has accounted for roughly one of every six jobs added in the country this past year,\u201d noted Mark Vitner, a Wells Fargo economist.\n\nContact the writer: mroosevelt@ocregister.com; on Twitter @MargotRoosevelt", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: 9.8% gain in construction jobs fuels economic recovery in O.C. | percent, year, jobs, county, orange, california, construction, payrolls, adjusted, recovery", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "MARGOT ROOSEVELT", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "A rapid recovery in the building industry is fueling Orange County\u2019s economy, along with healthy growth in nearly all other employment sectors.", "title": "Orange County economy: Broad recovery fueled by construction jobs", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/percent-662750-year-jobs.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/noripw-b88416223z.120150522104405000gmf7fspe.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/noripw-b88416223z.120150522104405000gmf7fspe.10.jpg"}, "description": "A rapid recovery in the building industry is fueling Orange County\u2019s economy, along with healthy growth in nearly all other employment sectors.", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Orange County economy: Broad recovery fueled by construction jobs"}, "content_author": "MARGOT ROOSEVELT", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/noripw-b88416223z.120150522104405000gmf7fspe.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "percent, year, jobs, county, orange, california, construction, payrolls, adjusted, recovery", "publication_date": "2015-05-22", "access-type": "paid", "section": "business", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Orange County economy: Broad recovery fueled by construction jobs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf8c\"", "article_summary": "California jobs grew by 2.9 percent in a year.\nThe labor force, which includes both workers and job-seekers, expanded by 1.7 percent in Orange County, faster than local population growth.\n\u2022 Government, a category that fell dramatically during the recession, but which has bounced back, adding 3,308 jobs, including 1,800 in local public schools.\nJobs in Orange County rose over the year across almost all sectors, including manufacturing, where employment grew at a rate of 2.6 percent.\nHowever, Texas payrolls increased by just 1,200 jobs in April, while California added 29,500 new positions."}
