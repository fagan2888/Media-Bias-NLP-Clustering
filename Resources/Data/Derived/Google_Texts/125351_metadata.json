A drug\u2019s list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access.\u201d\n\nBut medical experts said the pills, even at $375 each, would be too costly for most patients.\n\n\u201cA 50 percent reduction after a 5,000 percent price increase still makes this an extremely expensive drug, and still prevents most hospitals from keeping it in stock,\u201dsaid Joel Gallant, of Southwest CARE Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cSuffice it to say that this announcement doesn\u2019t satisfy anyone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Turing will offer the hospital discount to insurers, although the company said it would provide free samples to some health-care providers and sell smaller bottles of the pills to make them more affordable.\n\nShkreli led a group of investors this week in buying up 70 percent of outstanding shares of the troubled biotech company KaloBios Pharmaceuticals \u2014 or, as a Dealbreaker headline announced: \u201cDesperate pharmaceutical company hits rock bottom, names Martin Shkreli CEO.\u201d\n\nTuring is currently under investigation by lawmakers for alleged price-gouging, although Shkreli has said he won\u2019t cooperate without a subpoena.\n\nA \u201creal f*cking doctor\u201d shredded Shkreli\u2019s arguments during an online question-and-answer session after the CEO was unable to explain why the drug\u2019s price should be dramatically increased.\n\nDaraprim, which is listed as an essential drug by the World Health Organization, isavailable in other countries for less than $1 a pill.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Imprimis said last month that it would produce a generic alternative to the drug for $1 a pill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shkreli indicates no retreat from jacking up the price of a drug he bought by more than 5,000 percent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Shkreli indicates no retreat from jacking up the price of a drug he bought by more than 5,000 percent.", "title": "\u2018Pharma Bro\u2019 Martin Shkreli Weasels out of Promise to Roll Back Insane Cost Increase of Pills", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/economy/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-weasels-out-promise-roll-back-insane-cost-increase-pills", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/screen_shot_2015-11-27_at_2.28.35_am.png", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "\u2018Pharma Bro\u2019 Martin Shkreli Weasels out of Promise to Roll Back Insane Cost Increase of Pills"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T07:07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2018Pharma Bro\u2019 Martin Shkreli Weasels out of Promise to Roll Back Insane Cost Increase of PillsShkreli indicates no retreat from jacking up the price of a drug he bought by more than 5,000 percent.\nThe price-gouging \u201cpharma bro\u201d is backing out of his promise to lower the cost of Daraprim after jacking up its price by more than 5,000 percent.\nThe pharmaceutical company Imprimis said last month that it would produce a generic alternative to the drug for $1 a pill.\nThe company\u2019s chief commercial officer, Nancy Retzlaff, pledged that no patient would ever be denied access to Daraprim but defended the continued price increase.\nDaraprim, which is listed as an essential drug by the World Health Organization, isavailable in other countries for less than $1 a pill."}
