I was thinking, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could reboot America like that? And then it occurred to me, we had. With Barack Obama in the role of J.J Abrams.\n\nIn both cases, Star Wars and the White House, people said it was time for a change. Both were elected twice: Obama in \u201908 and \u201912, and Abrams for Star Trek, and then a second time, for Star Wars.\n\nWe even got a black man with each. Is this a sign of a sea change? We will find out in December 2015. We need sea change, but in race relations in this country, such change has been mostly incremental. Barack Obama was an exception to that rule. Meanwhile, we can say that with each, the reaction was the same: outrage.\n\nReminiscent of reactions to Idris Elba playing Heimdall in Thor, Barack Obama was attacked because he is a black man in a role that always goes to white men: President. In Star Wars, John Boyega was attacked because he is a black man in a role that always goes to white men: a Storm Trooper. They have even had pretty much the same response to criticism: \u201cget used to it.\u201d President Obama has never apologized. Neither has John Boyega.\n\nThere are all sorts of parallels.\n\nGeorge Lucas got the ball rolling in 1977 with Star Wars (later to become Episode IV: A New Hope). He moved forward a bit with 1980\u2019s The Empire Strikes Back and 1983\u2019s Return of the Jedi. Then, rather than kicking the ball downfield to show us what transpired after the good guys won, he went backwards, to what became Episode 1: 1999\u2019s The Phantom Menace, quickly followed by Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005).\n\nThis decision was not met with enthusiasm. Nor were the films themselves by many hardcore fans. In a way, Lucas\u2019 predicament is analogous to that of the Founding Fathers, who, after having gotten the ball rolling with the Declaration of Independence, found themselves faced with an equally zealous fan-base. There were as many ideas of what the new country was (or even if it was a country) as there were ideas of what next took place for Luke and Leia.\n\nThe Declaration was clearly canonical. Like the first Star Wars, without it, no franchise. Much of what followed from it was not, and just sort of \u201chappened\u201d in spontaneous bursts of enthusiasm. With Star Wars it was the \u201cExpanded Universe.\u201d With Independence (and within the loose strictures of the Articles of Confederation) the Founders called these the \u201cexcesses of democracy,\u201d as the majority proceeded with great glee to bully the minority and other evils. In both respects, all sorts of unintended consequences took place.\n\nWhere Lucas\u2019 response was to go back in time, the Founders went forward. Rather than returning to the embrace of England (as some wanted or thought inevitable) or handing somebody a crown, what they gave us was the United States Constitution. Like the Star Wars prequels, this move was not met with universal acclaim.\n\nThe Founders could have, like Lucas, washed their hands of the whole thing, but they did not. They pressed forward with the idea of a new nation, one conceived on the principal that political power derives from the people. As if that was not revolutionary enough, they invented the idea of separation of church and state to save us from the religious strife of what was, for them, the recent past.\n\nThe Founders realized they could not kick the ball down field. They realized that they were progenitors, and that each new generation would have to carry the ball forward. If he did not use a soccer metaphor, Thomas Jefferson, in particular, was conscious of the idea that each new generation was its own (Thomas Jefferson to John Wayles Eppes, 1813; Thomas Jefferson to Joseph C. Cabell, 1814), and would have to deal with the problems left unresolved by the last. In the same way, I suppose, that J.J. Abrams will now deal with the problems left unresolved by George Lucas.\n\nOne thing Abrams has done is to jettison the Expanded Universe. Which, as Entertainment Weekly observes, \u201cis sad news for Mara Jade fans\u201d (me among them). I will miss Grand Admiral Thrawn as well, whose clone was eventually destroyed by Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade.\n\nReboots are always full of good news/bad news, which is also true of life, which is, like politics is supposed to be (and used to be) a series of compromises. Without compromise, you can\u2019t move forward. Which is why we are where we are right now at the end of 2014. Why the Stars Wars franchise was where it was before Lucas sold it to Disney.\n\nSometimes, you need change. When you get it, you have to embrace it. There will be inevitable disappointments. We never \u2013 any of us \u2013 get everything we want. I\u2019d like to have seen Bush\u2019s First Amendment-violating Faith Based Initiatives deep-sixed, but Obama didn\u2019t give me that. But I can also live with it, because look at all the other change I got:\n\nA jump-started and revitalized economy;\n\nAnd end to two wars;\n\nAn end to torture;\n\nHealthcare reform;\n\nNo new wars, and more.\n\nIn the new Star Wars we will get:\n\nLuke, Leia, Han, and Chewie back;\n\nAnd end to Jar Jar Binks \u2013 but maybe an Ewok?;\n\nMore story than CGI (or at least a better balance;\n\nSomething truer to the original franchise.\n\nA new bad guy, a champion of the old order (Ted Cruz?).\n\nOf course, sometimes change brings outrage as well, like J.J. Abrams\u2019 new lightsaber. Or Obamacare. Both addressed problems: in Star Wars, how to prevent hands from being lopped off. With Obamacare, how to treat those folks whose hands get lopped off.\n\nI guess you can\u2019t please everyone. But lets face it: both problems demanded solutions and we got solutions. They may not be perfect solutions, but they\u2019re better than what we had before.\n\nFans should not hate on George Lucas for how all this has fallen out, but even now fans find reason to be angry with him. Once the ball is kicked, nobody can be quite sure what will happen. Star Wars took on a life of its own. So did the United States.\n\nJust as Star Wars is where it is because of that first kick, so the United States is because of the Founders\u2019 first kick. For the same reason, people should not be mad at the Founders for doing what they did (the Constitution \u2013 very contentious at the time), Abrams for doing what he did, or Obama doing what he did. All of them have existed within a context and nobody gets to do everything they want. Life just doesn\u2019t work that way. We are all of us constrained by our shared reality.\n\nWhich brings me to my final analogy: the Sith and the Republican Party. These folks don\u2019t like change. They don\u2019t like being constrained by reality. And they don\u2019t like having to share that reality with the hoi polloi. At best we are an inconvenience to them, at worst, people who should just die already.\n\nWhich is why we need heroes. We got Barack Obama (yes, Obama is a hero), our own New Hope, and we have more heroes coming in both in The Force Awakens and in real life too, with Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn this future, no doubt Obama will take on Bill Clinton\u2019s role of Old Ben, and like Old Ben and Old Bill, carry the torch of hope \u2013 and sanity \u2013 into the future. We can hope that Hillary will make an admirable Leia, and stare into Ted Cruz\u2019s eyes and denounce his \u201cfoul stench.\u201d\n\nI will always remember a rainy spring day in 1977 when I saw Star Wars, and I will always remember a cold winter day in 2009 when I saw a black man become president. They both energized me, if for vastly different reasons, and engendered in me feelings that give me the chills even today, years later. They are neither one of them feelings I ever want to lose.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama and John Boyega were both attacked for taking a traditional white man's role: president and storm trooper", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Barack Obama and John Boyega were both attacked for taking a traditional white man's role: president and storm trooper", "title": "Of Black Men and Sea Changes - and Hope", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/12/11/black-men-sea-hope.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John_Boyega.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-11T08:00:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,america,Barack Obama,Declaration of Independence,Elizabeth Warren,George Lucas,J.J.
