Then at 11 p.m., Ali will be deejaying what he hopes is a Super Bowl champion celebration.\n\nAli, 38, whose career began in his freshman year at McNair Academic High School in Jersey City, said he does 70 or more weddings a year \u2014 many at the Hyatt. In fact it was hotel representatives who recommended him to the Broncos.\n\n\u201cThey love me at the Hyatt because I do a lot of weddings there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call me their favorite DJ.\u201d\n\nHermes, the New Jersey Nets, Environmental Defense Fund, Al Gore, Sen. John McCain, Mark Ecko, and Walt Frazier have all been past clients of Ali\u2019s, so he won\u2019t be starstruck working with the Broncos. But the hype surrounding the Super Bowl makes the party unlike anything he\u2019s been tasked with before.\n\nAli hopes tomorrow\u2019s gigs will lead to even bigger and better things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a stepping stone. I have quite a few established clients who are not as cool to publicize, but this is definitely a nice thing to promote,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "Super Bowl 2014: DJ with Jersey City-based company books pre- and post-game parties for the Broncos", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Super Bowl 2014: DJ with Jersey City-based company books pre- and post-game parties for the Broncos\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/super_bowl_2014_dj_with_jersey.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/jjxdj0201jpg-7582b082abe6d77d.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12108707\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-01T08:03:12Z\", \"author\": \"Joseph R.
