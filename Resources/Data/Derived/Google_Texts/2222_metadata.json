I mean, it matters, but I\u2019m not going to put a number on it,\u201d McCloughan began.\n\n\u201cI know this: When you play the Redskins this year, you\u2019re going to know you played us. You\u2019re going to feel us, from the standpoint of being physical. The next morning, you\u2019re going to be sore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every game. But I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re going to compete, no matter what. \u2026 We will not back down. And if we do, then changes will be made.\u201d\n\nThat certainly sounds good. And it constitutes a step up from Redskins President Bruce Allen\u2019s much-mocked December boast about \u201cwinning off the field.\u201d\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how long it might take for McCloughan to do what he was hired to do: turn the team around.\n\nThe most obvious, and possibly significant change from 2014 to 2015 is that Robert Griffin III is no longer the starting quarterback as Washington prepares to host Miami. Instead, the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year has been supplanted by Kirk Cousins, a fourth-round pick in the same draft in which RG3 went No. 2 overall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all behind Kirk,\u201d said Terrance \u201cPot Roast\u201d Knighton, part of McCloughan\u2019s major overhaul of the defensive line. \u201cEverybody\u2019s talking about our quarterback situation. But the coach made the decision that he felt was best for the season. We\u2019re going to back our coach up on that, and we\u2019re going to back up our quarterback.\u201d\n\nIn Jay Gruden\u2019s first year as an NFL head coach, very little went according to plan. That included a rotation of QBs that saw Griffin, Cousins and McCoy all start and then be sidelined by injury, a benching or both.\n\nAs Gruden heads into Year 2, one key question is whether the most important position will again be a problem. Gruden, after all, was brought aboard because of his offensive acumen.\n\nHe also maintains that - with McCloughan in charge - there is a better 53-man roster at his disposal.\n\n\u201cObviously, this time of year, everybody has high hopes. We had high hopes last year,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBut I think from last year comparing to this year, I think you can see we have more players that are NFL-quality backups, special-teamers, all that stuff. You can see that we\u2019re bigger, we\u2019re stronger, and I think we\u2019re faster. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nHere are some issues facing the Redskins this season:\n\nOFF THE FIELD: Hardly a day goes by in Redskinsland without some sort of crisis. There was the bizarre Twitter episode involving McCloughan\u2019s wife. The reversal of Griffin\u2019s status for an exhibition game, when he was cleared, then not cleared to return from a concussion by a doctor who has since resigned. There was the signing of Junior Galette after he was cut by the Saints because of off-field issues, and then the pass rusher\u2019s season-ending injury. There are still the intertwined issues of the team\u2019s nickname and negotiations for a new stadium site. What else will crop up?\n\nO-LINE: McCloughan has made clear he strives to have success in the trenches. The team is counting on an inexperienced right side of the offensive line, with No. 5 overall draft pick Brandon Scherff at guard and second-year player Morgan Moses at tackle, and has no reliable backup to Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams. How good will pass protection be?\n\nNEW DEFENSE: A defense that failed to stop anyone was overhauled, with Joe Barry replacing Jim Haslett as coordinator and all sorts of additions, including cornerback Chris Culliver, safeties Dashon Goldson and Jeron Johnson, and linemen Knighton, Stephen Paea, and Ricky Jean-Francois. How much better will it be?\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nTwo of the team\u2019s top three tight ends, Niles Paul and Logan Paulsen, are injured and out for the season. The other, Jordan Reed, has yet to show he can stay healthy. Will this position be a big problem?\n\n___\n\nFreelancer Ian Quillen in Ashburn, Virginia contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich", "article_metadata": {"description": "Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan was asked what would constitute a successful season for a franchise coming off a 4-12 record and six last-place finishes in the past seven years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan was asked what would constitute a successful season for a franchise coming off a 4-12 record and six last-place finishes in the past seven years.", "title": "Redskins go from RG3 to Cousins, eye more wins", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/7/redskins-go-from-rg3-to-cousins-eye-more-wins/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/07/685b14e43e715428810f6a706700c11b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/07/685b14e43e715428810f6a706700c11b.jpg", "description": "Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan was asked what would constitute a successful season for a franchise coming off a 4-12 record and six last-place finishes in the past seven years.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins go from RG3 to Cousins, eye more wins"}, "Author": "HOWARD FENDRICH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c25\"", "article_summary": "Instead, the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year has been supplanted by Kirk Cousins, a fourth-round pick in the same draft in which RG3 went No.\n___Online:AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL___Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\u201cI know this: When you play the Redskins this year, you\u2019re going to know you played us.\nYou\u2019re going to feel us, from the standpoint of being physical.\nThe next morning, you\u2019re going to be sore,\u201d he said."}
