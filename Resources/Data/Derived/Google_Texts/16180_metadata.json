But when you hang around with President Barack Obama, you had better figure it out.\n\nAmyx was part of a group of people who got to shake Obama\u2019s hand and exchange a few brief words with the president before his speech Thursday at Anschutz Sports Pavilion. Amyx also got his photo taken with the president, and that\u2019s when Amyx noticed something odd start to happen.\n\n\u201cI had a bunch of people I didn\u2019t know who wanted to take a photo with me because I took a photo with him,\u201d Amyx said. \u201cIt was wild.\u201d\n\nIt was that kind of day in Lawrence.\n\nPhoto Gallery President Obama visits Lawrence, KU President Barack Obama spent the morning in Lawrence, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2015.

A four-year-old with a bullhorn participated in one of a handful of protests around town. And a local pizza delivery driver will always wonder whether she had just delivered \u2014 indirectly, anyway \u2014 pizza to the president.\n\n\u201cWe joked about 'what if these are for the president?' \u201d Jon Studtman general manager at Minsky\u2019s Pizza, said about the 9 to 10 large pizzas that were ordered by a guest at the Holiday Inn.\n\nWhen the delivery driver arrived about noon on Thursday, she reported that the pizzas had indeed been for a crew of Secret Service officials.\n\n\u201cI would like to think that Mr. Obama got to try a slice,\u201d Studtman said.\n\nThe timing suggests that may be unlikely. But who knows, perhaps the leader of the free world issued an executive order to save him a slice.\n\nScores and scores of Lawrence residents were left to let their imaginations run wild about the president and what he may or may not do in Lawrence. Amyx, a downtown barber shop owner and longtime mayor and city commissioner, said he had a hard time imagining what it was going to be like to shake the president\u2019s hand and make a few brief comments. Amyx said he thanked the president for his service and managed to make a brief statement about Lawrence\u2019s efforts to build a technical training center, thinking it tied in well with Obama\u2019s remarks in the State of the Union address about community colleges.\n\nBut Amyx said he was surprised by what happened a few moments later. The president during his address thanked Amyx by name for the community\u2019s hospitality. Amyx was one of just three people Obama mentioned in the opening, with the other two being Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole.\n\n\u201cYou could have knocked me down with a feather,\u201d Amyx said about hearing his name on stage. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of our community. It was great to see all the excitement. Stories from this day will fill a lot of time in this barber shop for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe town generally was in a good mood to see the president. Protests surrounding the event were relatively sparse. A group of about eight members of the Missouri chapter of Overpasses for America came to demonstrate on the Irving Hill overpass that spans Iowa Street and connects KU\u2019s main campus with West Campus.\n\nThe group promotes the idea that \u201cgovernment is the problem and is in need of massive reform.\u201d When asked about specific issues they were protesting on Thursday, one member said to wait a second and he would get out his list. Then he took out his wallet and removed a list that he carries with him: Benghazi, the IRS, Fast and Furious, and \u201cthat Obamacare is just a terrible mess.\u201d\n\nJust up the street, there was a larger demonstration of about 20 people. It mainly was comprised of Obama supporters who were there to urge the president to remain strong in his opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline project.\n\nThe group would chant \u201ckeep the tar sands in the soil,\u201d and then 4-year old Everett White \u2014 with the aid of a bullhorn \u2014 would chant: \u201cwe don\u2019t want that dirty oil.\u201d Another sign read \u201cdon\u2019t be chicken, use your veto.\u201d It came complete with a rubber chicken tied to it.\n\nSigns weren\u2019t the only thing to be seen, though. T-shirts commemorating the day also were available. ACME, a Lawrence-based shop downtown, was capitalizing off the event by selling shirts with a drawing of Obama\u2019s face and the phrase \u201cBarack Chalk.\u201d Cody Drake, an assistant manager at the shop, said the T-shirt design actually had been available for about three years at the store, but sales recently took off with the news that the president was coming to Lawrence.\n\nThere also were more serious sentiments expressed Thursday. Obama made a visit to the Community Children\u2019s Center, a Head Start preschool at Plymouth Congregational Church. The church was founded in 1854 before Kansas was even a state. Its founders were abolitionists who were deeply committed to ending slavery. Peter Luckey, senior pastor at the church, said it wasn\u2019t lost on him that it was fitting America\u2019s first black president was in Lawrence, a town founded on the idea of ending slavery.\n\n\u201cTo feel like our history is some small part of the story that made it possible that a black man could be president of the United States,\u201d Luckey said. \u201cWell, it is a special day.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it was that kind of day in Lawrence.\n\nMore reports from President Obama's visit to Lawrence\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
