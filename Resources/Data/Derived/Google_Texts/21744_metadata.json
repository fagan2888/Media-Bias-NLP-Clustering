But perhaps no annual event exposes the depths of this bias more transparently than the March for Life. Hundreds of thousands of pro-lifers showed up this year to defend and lift up their voices for the unborn\u2014facing some unhappy and virulent pro-choice activists along the way. And yet, despite the seriousness of this issue, the major news networks devoted altogether 15 seconds of attention to it.\n\nNewsBusters has the exclusive (emphasis theirs):\n\nOn Jan 22, 200,000 people descended on Washington, D.C. for the annual March for Life, commemorating the 57 million babies destroyed since 1973\u2019s Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. Of the three broadcast networks, only CBS mentioned the 2015 March for Life, allotting it just 15 seconds. That\u2019s one second for every 13,000 people who put work and school aside and traveled from as far away as the West Coast. It\u2019s one second for every 3.8 million babies aborted in the last 42 years.\n\nClick through to read more about which news stories garnered more breathless attention than the march.
