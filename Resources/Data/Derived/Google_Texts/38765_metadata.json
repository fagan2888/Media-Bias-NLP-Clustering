While it proves that Nashville is an \u201cIt\u201d city, some aren\u2019t pleased because they want stars to be able to lead normal lives here.\n\nFor instance, Sheryl Crow once recalled running into Faith Hill at a Franklin boutique, and no one bothered either star. Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman are frequently spotted at Starbucks when they\u2019re in town.\n\nTMZ executive producer Harvey Levin says TMZ doesn\u2019t have an office here yet, but he plans on having a full-time presence, with a photographer at the very least, \u201cto get able to get some color and texture of the city and country music and of a really rich part of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people in Nashville are great,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are fun and there are a lot of stars there. It broadens TMZ. We get country people whenever we can in big cities, but when we went to Nashville a year ago and just experimented, we realized how fun it was. We decided it would be great for the show and for the website and it has been.\u201d\n\nNashville stars are less edited than Hollywood celebs, he says. \u201cThey are fun and they are just not managed as much, and they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nTMZ\u2019s focus isn\u2019t about covering the most popular stars, but providing the most appealing content. (Hello, Kellie Pickler!) \u201cYou can have a huge star who is kind of boring and people don\u2019t care, and you can have a much lesser star who is really entertaining and they resonate. The world order here is entertaining trumps all.\u201d\n\nDespite some locals who don\u2019t want TMZ here, Levin says TMZ been well received. \u201cAll of the people we\u2019ve had on the show, we\u2019ve gotten feedback from people saying, \u2018We love that. Thanks a lot.\u2019 It has been great so far.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m among those who weren\u2019t thrilled with TMZ\u2019s plans. I\u2019d hoped Nashville would stay paparazzi-free. However, I also read TMZ daily. Does that make me a hypocrite? Probably. It also makes me pretty normal.\n\nWhile the Internet has taken documenting celebrity behavior to unprecedented (and invasive) levels, the interest in celebrities\u2019 lives is as old as gossip itself. (Just ask Cleopatra researcher Karen Essex.)\n\nMTSU psychology professor Tom Brinthaupt says gossip about celebrity behavior allows us to determine what we would do if we were in their shoes. \u201cFrom a psychoanalytic perspective, one might argue that people are also sometimes dealing with their dreams and fantasies when they gossip about celebrities. For instance, it is easy to find instances of outlandish celebrity behavior that may tap into the repressed unconscious wishes or fleeting desires of the gossiper.\u201d\n\nBrinthaupt says gossip often includes spite or nastiness. (Example A: Kim Kardashian.) \u201cThis seems particularly relevant to gossiping about celebrities, if people are envious or jealous of these people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is also low-risk behavior, since gossiping about celebrities is much less likely to come back and haunt the gossiper than would talking about a friend or neighbor.\u201d\n\nLevin says the realness of Nashville stars reflects the key to TMZ\u2019s popularity. \u201cThe reason TMZ has worked is because we are not red carpet. ... We talk to people about real things and fun things and they get to show their personalities.\n\n\u201cI just love the interaction that we get with some of the celebrities in Nashville. It\u2019s fun. That is really what I\u2019m looking for right now.\u201d\n\nTherefore, what happens in Nashville won\u2019t stay in Nashville anymore. Don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.\n\nJournalist Beverly Keel is also a professor and chair of Middle Tennessee State University\u2019s Department of Recording Industry.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/06/15/beverly-keel-tmz-mesh-nashvilles-culture/10526287/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The celebrity news website and TV show has announced plans to open an office here.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The celebrity news website and TV show has announced plans to open an office here.", "title": "Beverly Keel: TMZ doesn\u2019t mesh with Nashville\u2019s culture", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/06/15/beverly-keel-tmz-mesh-nashvilles-culture/10526287/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The celebrity news website and TV show has announced plans to open an office here.", "title": "Beverly Keel: TMZ doesn\u2019t mesh with Nashville\u2019s culture", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f27202905951bd778580a47d053530c32f99916a/c=0-412-2250-2662&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Faith Hill", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Faith Hill", "title": "Beverly Keel: TMZ doesn\u2019t mesh with Nashville\u2019s culture", "author": "Beverly Keel", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68dc2b23c6e1ccd9d1696d7e2ec5d6db4d18d02d/c=0-38-2250-3038/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b6710315a7e3290d93729ea2a377ab6d89076ee/c=0-412-2250-2662/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67975da6598731af2245c507fc14968c69eac705/c=0-694-2250-2382/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6220a72ffc04a8c0b7d6f38e783c01d1a11adacb/c=0-904-2250-2170&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-14T23:14:43.397000-05:00", "shorthed": "TMZ clashes with Nashville\u2019s culture", "articleid": 10526287, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ec70fbd74c5465195d5016e1d92822cf87c84f8/c=0-904-2250-2170/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/92bafb41871153335c5ca962211ec604bb2668df/c=260-0-1990-3075/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/-bevlargeheadshot.jpg20100914.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4c4\"", "article_summary": "The world order here is entertaining trumps all.\u201dDespite some locals who don\u2019t want TMZ here, Levin says TMZ been well received.\nMTSU psychology professor Tom Brinthaupt says gossip about celebrity behavior allows us to determine what we would do if we were in their shoes.\nBeverly KeelThere\u2019s been great interest on Music Row at the news that TMZ, the celebrity news website and TV show, is coming to Nashville.\nWhile the Internet has taken documenting celebrity behavior to unprecedented (and invasive) levels, the interest in celebrities\u2019 lives is as old as gossip itself.\nThat is really what I\u2019m looking for right now.\u201dTherefore, what happens in Nashville won\u2019t stay in Nashville anymore."}
