But none of us can deny that the discounts and promotions on offer are a marketing and sales tactic that works. Each year, retailers across America work to bring their accounting books into the black on this day, the symbolic beginning of the holiday shopping season. Most shoppers and sellers end the day satisfied and happy, both having taken full advantage of the bounty of the free market.\n\nBut once again this year, on display next to the Black Friday sales, happy customers, and in-the-black retailers, will be another sales tactic \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t work, and in fact is more of a public nuisance than a successful advertising pitch. Gathering outside Walmarts in Washington, D.C., and other cities will be Black Friday protestors sponsored by a group known as Organization United for Respect, aka OUR Walmart.\n\nYes, the protests are a sales tactic. But rather than something most people want, the product for sale is union membership. OUR Walmart, while claiming to be independent, is actually affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW), which for years has tried to unionize Walmart\u2019s associates. And the protests, despite any other pretense, will be in furtherance of that goal.\n\nOf course, given the product they have to offer, OUR Walmart\u2019s annual protests haven\u2019t succeeded in reversing the decline in union membership. Fewer than seven percent of private-sector workers belong to unions in the U.S. today, and Walmart\u2019s associates have not embraced the UFCW.\n\nBut despite this lack of success, OUR Walmart does their best each year to get between shoppers and the bargains they seek, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 in front of as many television cameras as possible. Protestor spokespersons (spokesprotestors?) say they\u2019d like higher wages and more full-time jobs, but the reality is that most of these demonstrators don\u2019t actually work for Walmart themselves. Instead they are recruited, like actors, to hold signs and shout slogans. They are essentially a living advertisement for unionization.\n\nBut to be clear: You won\u2019t hear protestors actually talk about forming a union. Their talking points are developed to sound righteous, not to sound like a sales pitch. This year\u2019s focus will be on \u201cfasting,\u201d specifically urging people to go on a 15 day fast for $15 an hour. Urging people to fast during the Thanksgiving holiday may not be the most effective recruiting tool, but hey, it\u2019s a free country, and every group, individual and company is entitled to advertise however they\u2019d like.\n\nThat said, when an advertising technique isn\u2019t working, it becomes nothing more than a nuisance. And when it\u2019s pushed too aggressively, advertising can also become something from which potential consumers actually need to be protected. Little surprise then that as a result of its protests, courts in seven states have ordered OUR Walmart and its protestors not to enter Walmart stores for any purpose other than shopping.\n\nShrewd observers \u2013 including the media \u2013 should take these made-for-TV shenanigans with a grain of salt, especially in a city like Washington, D.C., where workers are already paid a wage well in excess of the federal minimum. Indeed, they should be viewed as the sales tactic they clearly are.\n\nIt would be better if the UFCW would simply find something else to do. Perhaps they could ask themselves, if protesting on Black Friday doesn\u2019t sell union memberships, isn\u2019t it time to try a new sales tactic that isn\u2019t such a nuisance for holiday shoppers?\n\nDon\u2019t expect an answer, at least not this year. But in the meantime, don\u2019t let a protestor who has foregone a turkey dinner come between you and a great deal on Black Friday.\n\nGlenn Spencer is vice president of the Workforce Freedom Initiative at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, www.workforcefreedom.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't let a protestor who has foregone a turkey dinner come between you and a great deal on Black Friday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Don\u2019t let a protestor who has foregone a turkey dinner come between you and a great deal on Black Friday.", "title": "GLENN SPENCER: Bad advertising: OUR Wal-Mart\u2019s Black Friday protests", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/26/glenn-spencer-bad-advertising-our-walmarts-black-f/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/25/Black_Friday_Rural_Alaska.JPEG-0d339.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/25/Black_Friday_Rural_Alaska.JPEG-0d339.jpg", "description": "Don't let a protestor who has foregone a turkey dinner come between you and a great deal on Black Friday.", "card": "summary", "title": "GLENN SPENCER: Bad advertising: OUR Wal-Mart\u2019s Black Friday prot"}, "Author": "Glenn Spencer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor"}, "article_summary": "But none of us can deny that the discounts and promotions on offer are a marketing and sales tactic that works.\nYes, the protests are a sales tactic.\nOf course, given the product they have to offer, OUR Walmart\u2019s annual protests haven\u2019t succeeded in reversing the decline in union membership.\nIndeed, they should be viewed as the sales tactic they clearly are.\nGathering outside Walmarts in Washington, D.C., and other cities will be Black Friday protestors sponsored by a group known as Organization United for Respect, aka OUR Walmart."}
