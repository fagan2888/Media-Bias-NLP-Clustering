It is now on \u201cindefinite hold\u201d as the Sanders campaign tries to figure out how to sell the full Socialist package without completely turning off the majority of Democratic voters.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re probably going to do to begin with is hold a major speech in the not-too-distant future, to define exactly what I mean by Democratic socialist,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa. \u201cTo me, Democratic socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us, not just the wealthiest people in the country.\u201d But it\u2019s been postponed indefinitely because Sanders has not yet finished writing the high-risk speech, or agreed that he is ready to deliver it. The delay highlights another issue facing the Sanders camp \u2013 an apparent disconnect between the candidate and his staffers, who say they are pushing the senator to give his speech sooner rather than later. \u201cI personally think we\u2019re ready, he\u2019s just got to agree we\u2019re ready,\u201d said senior strategist Tad Devine. \u201cIt\u2019s very much on the horizon, it\u2019s just a question of timing. He wants to finish the speech first.\u201d\n\nIt could be because the Sanders campaign is having a tough time figuring out how to pay for everything without taxing the \u201cMiddle Class,\u201d which even Sanders has trouble defining. The campaign says it\u2019s still working on the numbers, but there are some hints as to how Sanders would ultimately pay for much of his welfare program in his past legislative dealings: payroll taxes (sometimes as high as 6%) and an across-the-board income tax raises (2.2%). Both of these would impact people clearly not in the 1%, and the Clinton campaign is already addressing his massive government program as a \u201c9% tax on middle-income families,\u201dadding the two numbers, according to POLITICO.\n\nSanders says he won\u2019t tax anyone who \u201cisn\u2019t making a lot of money,\u201d but like with Barack Obama in his initial campaign, the definition of a person \u201cmaking a lot of money\u201d is a loose one. For Obama, it was anyone making over $250,000, even though that included many small business owners whose income operated as reinvestment into their businesses. And for Sanders, it\u2019s also a question of whether people will want to pay more than they already do, socking them with a grand plan when most of them are trying to navigate Obamacare-related healthcare cost hikes.\n\nIf Sanders thinks there\u2019ll be a right time, though, he\u2019s mistaken. He may as well just pull the Band-aid off and take the ten point slide. I\u2019m sure Hillary wholeheartedly agrees.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It is now on \u201cindefinite hold\u201d as the Sanders campaign tries to figure out how to sell the full Socialist package without completely turning off the majority of Democratic voters.\nHe wants to finish the speech first.\u201dIt could be because the Sanders campaign is having a tough time figuring out how to pay for everything without taxing the \u201cMiddle Class,\u201d which even Sanders has trouble defining.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re probably going to do to begin with is hold a major speech in the not-too-distant future, to define exactly what I mean by Democratic socialist,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa.\nIf Sanders thinks there\u2019ll be a right time, though, he\u2019s mistaken.\n\u201cI personally think we\u2019re ready, he\u2019s just got to agree we\u2019re ready,\u201d said senior strategist Tad Devine."}
