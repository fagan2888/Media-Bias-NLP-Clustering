(Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night was long. It was also pretty chock full of complex topics and political language that requires a bit of decoding.\n\nWhich is where The Fix comes in. Below, we have isolated some key passages of Obama's prepared remarks and then provided a political translation. (And here's the full transcript.)\n\n\u201cWe are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: I was dealt a tough hand. This is my periodic reminder of that.\n\n\u201cTonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. ... The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: We have made tangible progress \u2013 so much so that I\u2019m willing to use the b-word, \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: I know the recovery is disproportionately helping the wealthy \u2013 something Republicans and Democrats actually agree on. And I know that will temper your view of my economic record. But I\u2019m not done yet.\n\n\u201cIn two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Except for that part about raising taxes, of course. (Then again, when has any politician admitted that he or she was being partisan?)\n\n\n\nVice President Biden and Speaker of the House John A. Boehner (R) applaud as President Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Jan. 20, 2015. (REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n\u201cSeven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: This is the part where I provide an anecdote about an all-American couple and their struggle. (After all, who doesn\u2019t love a couple from Minnesota?) Results not necessarily typical.\n\n\"We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: Congress can get things done. Or at least it could when I had two Democratic majorities and we passed Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act before the GOP won the House in 2010.\n\n\u201cAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: The Obamacare doomsday stuff hasn\u2019t come true, now, has it?\n\n\u201cSo the verdict is clear: Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: And by \"politics,\" I mean \"Republicans.\"\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality child care more than ever. It\u2019s not a nice-to-have \u2014 it\u2019s a must-have. It\u2019s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a women\u2019s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that\u2019s why my plan will make quality child care more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America \u2014 by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Here\u2019s a bona fide, specific thing Congress can do to help middle-class Americans. Republicans, I dare you not to side with me on this.\n\n\"That\u2019s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It\u2019s 2015. It\u2019s time.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: C\u2019mon, Republicans. You know you have problems with women.\n\nWe still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.\n\nTRANSLATION: I know you unions are struggling -- and especially now that Republican have an almost unprecedented amount of control at the state level. I see you.\n\n\u201c21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure \u2014 modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: I'm still not approving the Keystone XL pipeline, but let's talk about some other infrastructure stuff.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. Let\u2019s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Obligatory shout-out to tax reform, which (spoiler alert) probably isn't going to happen.\n\n\u201cWhen we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military , then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That\u2019s what our enemies want us to do.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: I\u2019m still the guy who sought to end wars, not start them. Also, I still don't like the media and their \"headlines.\"\n\n\u201cI believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don\u2019t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing right now \u2013 and around the globe, it is making a difference.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: I know you guys are down on my foreign policy. First there was the red line in Syria and then the lingering troop presence in Iraq and now the decision not to send someone high-ranking to the rally in Paris. But give me a chance to make diplomacy work.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists \u2014 from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Figuratively, of course, because we didn't actually send someone high-ranking to the Paris rally. Oops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re upholding the principle that bigger nations can\u2019t bully the small \u2014 by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That\u2019s how America leads \u2014 not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: I know you think I wasn't tough enough on Vladimir Putin \u2013 in fact, three-quarters of America said that. But look where he is now. This is my victory lap.\n\n\u201cAnd tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: I\u2019m going to make some news here. I know that my White House has said it didn\u2019t need to seek congressional approval to strike at the Islamic State, or what we call ISIL. But I've heard the objections to that policy from both parties, and I\u2019m going to ask for authorization anyway.\n\n\u201c2014 was the planet\u2019s warmest year on record. Now, one year doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this does \u2014 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Climate change is a top priority -- now that I don't have to worry about red-state Democrats losing reelection.\n\n\u201cAs Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice, so it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been president, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of GITMO in half. Now it\u2019s time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Everyone says it won\u2019t happen, and it probably won\u2019t, but I still say we should shut down Guantanamo.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision (of one America). How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It\u2019s held up as proof not just of my own flaws \u2014 of which there are many \u2014 but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and na\u00efve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Don't believe the mainstream media when they tell you I was overly idealistic. My 2004 Democratic National Convention speech is still how I view this country.\n\n\"A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than 'gotcha' moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people\u2019s daily lives.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: Have I mentioned that I dislike the mainstream media?\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have arguments, let\u2019s have arguments, but let\u2019s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.\u201d\n\nTRANSLATION: Congress needs to stop being so childish.\n\n\"We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can\u2019t walk home without being harassed. Surely we can understand the wife who won\u2019t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: This is me talking about Ferguson and Eric Garner without taking sides. I still won\u2019t do that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's what he really meant.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Here's what he really meant.", "title": "Obama\u2019s State of the Union, translated", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/21/state-of-the-union-what-obama-said-and-what-he-meant/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-01-20/Reuters/2015-01-21T022024Z_01_WAS523_RTRIDSP_3_USA-OBAMA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aaronblake"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/21/state-of-the-union-what-obama-said-and-what-he-meant/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama; obama state of the union; washington post politics; aaron blake; the fix", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama; obama state of the union; washington post politics; aaron blake; the fix"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6454\"", "article_summary": "The Post's Aaron Blake reads between the lines of President Obama's State of the Union address.\n(Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night was long.\n\u201cTonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\nBelow, we have isolated some key passages of Obama's prepared remarks and then provided a political translation.\nTRANSLATION: I know you unions are struggling -- and especially now that Republican have an almost unprecedented amount of control at the state level."}
