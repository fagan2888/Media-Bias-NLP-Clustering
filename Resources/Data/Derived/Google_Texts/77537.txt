Donald Trump wants a soft media vetting even as he promises to carry out a hard line presidency on immigration, terror, and civil rights. But to cite his own line, “we don’t have a country” when a nominee for President refuses to release his taxes. Why? Because in 1972, when the elected Vice President plead no contest to tax evasion and the elected President’s returns were being audited; the country clearly decided it did not want criminals in charge of its government, the world’s highest office.

Trump does not get the idea of standards. Paying taxes properly shows a standard of responsibility, without the excuse of government “throwing money down the drain.” Trump believes there are no standards he cannot bend; is it also true of his taxes?

The nine Chairs of House committees who endorsed him certainly gave him soft vetting and demonstrated their lack moral integrity and the absence of character strength in this doyens of democracy by their recent announcement: “This great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House. . . It is paramount that we . . . maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Any other outcome is a danger to economic growth, puts our national security in peril, enshrines ObamaCare as the law of the land, entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence, and undermines our constitutional republic. . .To solidify this partnership, we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him.”

Once their greatest danger, Trump is now their saving answer.

And the 74 months of job creation, the rescue from the global depression, the limits on combat–and even, healthcare–don’t count! (Except as dangerous acts!)
