He also mocked rival Donald Trump a few times and talked tough on defeating ISIS terrorists.\n\n\n\n\"Come January 2017, a day of reckoning is coming. We are not going to weaken, we are not going to degrade, we are going to utterly and completely destroy ISIS,\" Cruz said.\n\n\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich said he's running for president because he was called to serve to use his experience in government and business, and said he understands voters who are leaning toward Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\"They worry about the fact that they could lose their job, that they're 52 years old and somebody comes in someday and says, 'You're out of work,' or some politician made some deal and somehow they lost out,\" Kasich said.\n\n\n\nTrump was not there, but sent former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to campaign for him.\n\n\n\n\"Only Trump talks rationally about listening to top brass as president and hiring the best of the best to work alongside our commander-in-chief to work with those who share our interests in stopping the Islamic threat,\" Palin said.\n\n\n\nWhile Palin spoke for Trump on Friday night, Trump will resume campaigning in Wisconsin on Saturday. He'll speak in Racine at noon.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 01 Apr 2016 23:07:16 CDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Terry Sater", "og": {"site_name": "WISN", "description": "Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Sarah Palin speak at a GOP dinner at Serb Hall on Friday night.", "title": "GOP candidates, supporters speak at dinner at Serb Hall", "url": "http://www.wisn.com/politics/gop-candidates-supporters-speak-at-dinner-at-serb-hall/38829924", "image": "http://www.wisn.com/image/view/-/38829342/highRes/3/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/6e63ptz/-/img--Serb-Hall-GOP-event-in-Milwaukee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wisn.com/politics/gop-candidates-supporters-speak-at-dinner-at-serb-hall/38829924", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wisn://content/article/38829924", "iphone": "wisn://content/article/38829924", "googleplay": "wisn://content/article/38829924"}, "name": {"ipad": "wisn", "iphone": "wisn", "googleplay": "wisn"}, "id": {"ipad": 505514957, "iphone": 505514957, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wisn"}}, "site": "@WISN12News", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wisn://content/article/38829924", "app_name": "wisn", "package": "com.hearst.android.wisn"}, "ios": {"url": "wisn://content/article/38829924", "app_store_id": 505514957, "app_name": "wisn"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 99878194705}, "keywords": "Serb Hall, GOP, Republican, Milwaukee, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, John Kasich", "google-site-verification": "i4ZqbhDql_xSQP108vpUMcxQym-PFphj-iSCavxm6tw", "news_keywords": "Serb Hall, GOP, Republican, Milwaukee, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, John Kasich", "description": "Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Sarah Palin speak at a GOP dinner at Serb Hall on Friday night."}, "article_summary": "Two of the Republican candidates and Sarah Palin spoke at a GOP dinner at Serb Hall in Milwaukee on Friday night.\nWhile Palin spoke for Trump on Friday night, Trump will resume campaigning in Wisconsin on Saturday.\nAll five candidates, or their biggest supporters, spent the day in Wisconsin to try to win your vote.\nSarah Palin to campaign for him.\nWe are not going to weaken, we are not going to degrade, we are going to utterly and completely destroy ISIS,\" Cruz said."}
