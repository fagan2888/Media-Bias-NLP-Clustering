The documentarian\u2019s last two features, Capitalism: A Love Story and Sicko, didn\u2019t leave as much of an impression as Fahrenheit: 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine did. Will Where to Invade Next be Moore\u2019s next film to strike a chord with the American public?\n\nAfter the jump, watch the Where to Invade Next trailer.\n\nThe film opens with Moore \u201cmeeting\u201d with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pleading with him to travel the world and find a country they can invade next. The documentary follows Moore as he explores the social programs and policies in other countries \u2014 and some of the policies and programs he discovers are quite astonishing.\n\nHere\u2019s the Where to Invade Next trailer (source: Yahoo! Movies):\n\nAs Moore says in the trailer, he\u2019s become an optimist, and Where to Invade Next is actually pretty optimistic. After the documentary premiered to mostly positive reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival, though, the director struggled with the MPAA to get a PG-13 rating, which unfortunately didn\u2019t pan out. It\u2019s actually a \u201cnice\u201d Michael Moore film, and the reasons why it got the R-rating are fairly silly. Where to Invade Next lacks the sharp wit found in the director\u2019s previous work, but the director certainly gets across his point about the state of the American Dream.\n\nHere\u2019s the TIFF description:\n\nMichael Moore understands the art of provocation. From Roger & Me to Bowling for Columbine to Fahrenheit 9/??11, he\u2019s been ahead of the cultural curve with films that galvanized audiences and escalated box-office records. Now, six years since his last film and with another US election around the corner, he delivers a fresh surprise that feels current yet perfectly timeless. Filming abroad without drawing attention from American media, Moore reunites his A-team, including producers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin (directors of the Oscar-nominated Trouble the Water), and brings us a funny and provocative work that\u2019s guaranteed to stir up conversation. The United States\u2019 long history of invading countries and pushing agendas has produced results that are, to say the least, mixed. What if the US could do a better job at invading? That\u2019s the premise for this film, which sends Moore on an epic journey. Americans may be known as talkers, but Moore actually listens and he\u2019s a magnet for memorable characters. Their dialogues are revelatory, poignant, and hilarious. The film builds momentum toward a culmination that resonates with hard-earned hope. In the break since his previous film, 2009\u2019s Capitalism: A Love Story, Moore has nurtured his cinematic passions as co-founder of the Traverse City Film Festival and a champion of other directors. Whatever else he\u2019s been doing in that time, it has had a restorative effect on his filmmaking. Where to Invade Next conveys a sense that he\u2019s been saving up his energies to create something really special. Rather than following the predictable motions of partisan politics, he reframes the conversation around hot-button issues in a highly entertaining and subversive way.\n\nWhere To Invade Next opens in New York and Los Angeles on December 23rd and expands nationwide on January 15, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "/Film", "description": "Will Where to Invade Next be director Michael Moore's next film to strike a real chord with the American public?
