In her new book, \u201cUnfinished Business: Women Men Work Family,\u201d Slaughter expands the conversation to look at gender roles, the work world generally, and how public policy might help us reframe the issue around care \u2013 for children, for the elderly, and for the larger community.\n\nI spoke with Slaughter by phone, asking up front for her understanding if the two 9-year-old boys playing Super Mario on Wii in the basement interrupted us. \u201cWell, if I don\u2019t understand that, you\u2019re sunk,\u201d she laughed.\n\nYour book begins when you decided to leave your position at Princeton and take this position on the staff of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. What were the challenges you faced when you took that job working far from home, and how did you make the decision to return home from Washington?\n\nWell, it took me about three minutes to decide to take the job! That was not really an issue. I had always wanted to be in government. I tell people now, when your party is in power and you\u2019re free, do it. Because when Bill Clinton won, I was getting tenure and when we won again I had a 2-month-old; in 2000 and 2004 my party didn\u2019t win. So it\u2019s like, if I\u2019m ever gonna go, I\u2019ve gotta go.\n\nWe decided, as I wrote in the book, that [my husband and sons] should stay [in Princeton]. They had no interest in moving. We had just come back from a year in Shanghai, so they\u2019d already been moved for a year. And both Andy and I thought that would be really bad for them, to put them in a strange town with him commuting back to Princeton and me trying to get used to a very high-pressure job.\n\nAnd so you made the decision that you would commute and go to Washington every week during the work week and come home on the weekends. Obviously, that\u2019s a grueling schedule for anybody, but it sounds like in the book you sort of anticipated it was going to be hard on you, and maybe didn\u2019t anticipate quite how hard it would be on your kids.\n\nI think that\u2019s true. Part of it was, my kids were then 10 and 12; we had not been through the teenage years. Maybe now I would have a different view, but also teenage-hood is different for everybody. Basically, my older son had hit middle school. He\u2019d been in middle school three months when I left. That was a big change. He\u2019d gone from a small elementary school to a much bigger middle school, and he was 12, and it\u2019s a difficult time.\n\nI was always traveling, even when I was a dean, so I though this wasn\u2019t going to be that different. I had been working, but I\u2019d been working down the street, so I could be pretty fully involved in their lives \u2013 I could go to teacher meetings and sports games and that sort of thing. Maybe I should have anticipated it, but I\u2019d always managed to make it work, and I just assumed we would make it work this time.\n\nAnd it was of that experience \u2013 of realizing how hard it was to make it work \u2013 you wrote an article that appeared in The Atlantic in 2012. Were you surprised at how much conversation and debate it sparked?\n\nAbsolutely. And I don\u2019t think I said anything that other people hadn\u2019t said before. It made an impact in part because I wasn\u2019t writing in a women\u2019s journal or a feminist journal, I was writing in The Atlantic, and I\u2019m a foreign policy person and I\u2019d had a successful career.\n\nBut I think mostly it was that I\u2019d caught a generational wave. Mothers and daughters have been debating exactly these issues. And a lot of young women were saying to their mothers, \u201chey, I don\u2019t want to have to do what you did.\u201d Or, \u201cit\u2019s just harder than it looks. And I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d And a lot of mothers were saying, as I said in the book, \u201cwell, of course you can do it. This is what we fought for.\u201d\n\nSo this is the interesting question \u2013 that generational issue within feminism. You write about growing up imbued with this feminist promise that women could and should have it all. Do you think that feminism needs to \u2013 not that feminism is some monolith \u2013\n\nI was going to say!\n\nBut how do you think that women, feminism, all of us, should reframe the conversation in order to get the next generation better prepared to face the challenge of trying to have a family, trying to have a career? Do we need to reset expectations?\n\nYes. That\u2019s really the heart of the book, the hope of the book. Which is that we are at a point, in the second wave feminist movement, 50 years on, where it is now time to make this a conversation between mothers and fathers and daughters and sons, in which both the parents and all the children say, look, to have the best of what life has to offer, to have a fulfilling, meaningful, purposeful life, there are two sides to that.\n\nThere\u2019s the striving to pursue your own goals and invest in yourself. And then there is the love and connection to others, and investing in them and watching them grow, or caring for those you love. A good life \u2013 let\u2019s not talk about having it all \u2013 a good life has both. But it is hard to combine them, and if one person has a really big job, the other person is going to have to be the anchor in any relationship. I\u2019m not saying nobody can do it \u2013 sure, there are people who can do everything for their kids and have a high-powered job. They have, typically, tons of help.\n\nMy husband says to our sons, \u201cLook, having you has been incredibly important, we think it\u2019s the greatest achievement of our lives, we would not have missed it; if you want this, then you\u2019re going to have to figure out, with your partner, how, over time, you make room for both.\u201d And only when men start thinking about that the same way that women think about it, are we going to get to any kind of equality.\n\nThere\u2019s a passage in the book where you\u2019re talking to a young women shortly after the Atlantic article came out. You\u2019re talking with her about equality in the home and being an equal partner, and she sort of wrinkles her nose at the idea of a house husband. Are we still too entrenched in gender roles to have equal partnerships on the home front?\n\nI\u2019d say we are entrenched in gender roles more on the male side than the female side. We have changed dramatically the choices open to women \u2013 dramatically. But we have not changed the choices open to men. So a man who is the lead parent is still looked at not all that differently than he was looked at in the \u201950s and \u201960s. Even though \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d came out in 1979, here\u2019s this hard-charging guy whose wife leaves, and he\u2019s totally incompetent as a parent, and he learns how to be competent, and he\u2019s actually a better father in many ways than she is a mother. And that\u2019s emasculating?
