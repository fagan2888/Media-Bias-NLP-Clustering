Republicans may have their biggest majority in the House since the Hoover administration. But at times, the unsteady machinations of the House GOP trying to advance its agenda resembles the adventures of Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Districts of Columbia\u2019s House member, trying to park her car.\n\nScalise unexpectedly rose to leadership last summer. And in particular, he has had little to brag about in his short time as the top Republican vote counter. Ushering bills to passage emerged as a major chore as the GOP brass struggled mightily to grapple with internecine squabbles between members.\n\nLast August, there was an immediate problem with a bill to deal with thousands of unaccompanied children and teens arriving at the U.S. border. There was a close call on a procedural vote for the so-called \u201cCRomnibus,\u201d the big spending package to fund most of the federal government.\n\nThere was an abortion bill that the GOP leadership yanked because of internal fighting. Then came the effort to trump the president\u2019s executive orders on immigration, yet fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAfter a bloody skirmish, the Republican brain trust reluctantly ceded ground, allowing the executive action to stand and funding the department.\n\nEven House Republican efforts to approve a budget grew dicey.\n\nDefense-minded Republicans balked at the austere Pentagon spending in a blueprint authored by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga. Led by Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, defense hawks told leaders they wouldn\u2019t support the budget unless Price poured additional defense dollars into his resolution. Meantime, fiscal conservatives protested. They preferred the more-parsimonious plan and wouldn\u2019t vote yes unless Price \u201cplussed-up\u201d the defense side of the equation.\n\nIt was a perfect storm that threatened passage of a budget.\n\nRepublicans were on the verge of failing their own, quintessential litmus test. After all, they had given no quarter to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, R-Nevada, when he abandoned efforts to move a budget through his chamber.\n\nBut not today.\n\nThe Republican leadership muscled through a budget, satisfying the desires of defense hawks. Republicans only lost 17 of their own.\n\nScalise was proud of the effort.\n\n\u201cWe were right where we thought we\u2019d be. In fact, we picked up one more than we thought,\u201d he boasted. \u201cBudgets are always tough. We worked hard to bring defense hawks and budget hawks together.\u201d\n\nUltra-right lawmakers may crow about the additional spending or some suggestions that the extra military money isn\u2019t subject to a series of \u201ccaps\u201d that impact much of the spending which Congress controls. But it was clear which side emerged victorious in this budget match.\n\n\u201cThere could not have been a budget had the whip team not intervened,\u201d Turner said after the vote, referring to the protests by defense backers.\n\nThey told GOP leaders they would tank the budget unless they fixed the Pentagon spending. They did. And the House sidestepped the potential for a massive embarrassment of not approving a budget.\n\nThis entire exercise is steeped in a series of events that date back nearly four years. Episodes that cut to the core of the spending battles defining Washington these days and represent the very marrow of how Congress repeatedly struggles to handle the most-basic of tasks.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, the country hurtled toward a rendezvous with the nation\u2019s debt ceiling. A failure to hike the debt limit could prompt untold economic and financial consequences. An economic meltdown. A calamitous market selloff. You name it.\n\nSo House and Senate leaders from both parties -- in consultation with the Obama administration -- engineered a bill called the Budget Control Act. The BCA would up the debt threshold, euthanizing the immediate concern about the credit worthiness of the federal government.\n\nBut remember, the summer of 2011 was just a few months after the Tea Party propelled Republicans into the House majority. The GOP was on notice to slash spending -- spending which it claimed was out of control due to ObamaCare, the $700 billion economic stimulus plan and an additional $700 billion as a result of the financial bailout plan of 2008.\n\nIf they were going to increase the debt limit, Republicans insisted on hefty spending cuts.\n\nA pound of flesh ...\n\nSo in addition to raising the debt ceiling, Congress voted to empanel a bipartisan, bicameral panel called the \u201csupercommittee.\u201d It would recommend around $1.2 trillion in spending reductions.\n\n\u201cRecommend\u201d is the key word here. The supercommittee wasn\u2019t required to cough up the spending reductions. Nor was Congress bound to act on the suggestions. But if it didn\u2019t, there was a cost. A big one. Something called \u201csequestration.\u201d\n\nSequestration was a threat to the supercommittee and the rest of Congress. Settle on cuts or else. The \u201cor else\u201d was a set of staggering, across-the-board reductions in all sectors of government.\n\nFailure to succeed? Well, then sequestration would set in. This is what\u2019s known as \u201cpaying the fiddler.\u201d\n\nFirst some background:\n\nThe entire federal government spends more than $3 trillion annually. That\u2019s split between two types of federal spending. The biggest part of spending is what\u2019s called \u201cmandatory.\u201d That means the federal government has to spend it. You might say, well, no one has to spend anything. But then there would be an awful lot of people reaping the benefits of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security who wouldn\u2019t be very happy. Those programs fall under mandatory spending. It\u2019s mandatory because Treasury must spend it -- and Congress never gets involved. And it accounts for two-thirds of that $3 trillion which flies out the door.\n\nNaturally, Congress set up all of this by creating entitlement programs years ago, then elected not to determine how much money it would allocate for those initiatives. Every entitlement recipient receives his or her benefit based on a formula: for what they qualify, how much they paid in, age, etc.\n\nCongress could reclaim all of that mandatory money and decide how to spend it. But there\u2019s no movement to do that.\n\nThat leaves us with the other one-third of federal spending. This is what\u2019s called \u201cdiscretionary spending because, well, Congress exercises discretion over which programs it deems necessary. Discretionary spending comes in at around $1 trillion annually.\n\nIn short, Congress only manages about a third of all money the federal government spends. The rest is on automatic pilot. If you\u2019re upset about how much Washington spends, look at the entitlement programs you receive.\n\nSo back to the Budget Control Act\u2026\n\nThe BCA\u2019s sequester wouldn\u2019t touch mandatory spending, the part of federal spending which if touched, could really make a dent in the national debt. Instead, they limited sequestration to only discretionary spending. The idea was that sequestration would compel lawmakers to reach an accord on cuts. Otherwise, bad things might happen.\n\nBut the BCA\u2019s authors were pretty sly. It would be one thing to hit all parts of federal spending equally via sequestration. But it\u2019s another enterprise to leave the military smarting. So the authors structured sequestration in such a way that it inordinately bludgeoned defense. To be fair, Congress directs about one-half of all discretionary spending toward the military. That means the Pentagon would have to shoulder most of the weight anyway. But the thought behind the sequester was to force the military to carry most of the water and lawmakers would ensure that Pentagon sequestration cuts never became too onerous.\n\nAt least that was the theory.\n\nOn a fateful afternoon not long before voting for the Budget Control Act in 2011, defense hawks huddled in the office of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Some felt duped. Others were wary of supporting the BCA because of its threatened impact on the military budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d then-House Armed Serviced Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-Calif., groused at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t want a deal-breaker. I want us to get this worked out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it happened it could cause a lot of heartburn,\u201d said then-Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich. \u201cThe purpose of the sequestration threat is not to have the trigger pulled. It\u2019s a motivator.\u201d\n\nYet lawmakers bit the bullet and passed the BCA, with the sequestration provisions attached.\n\nCurrent Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., wasn\u2019t pleased but went along.\n\n\u201cThe United States cannot default on our obligations and this bill prevents that from happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal is not perfect. It is not what I would have written and I have great concerns about the cuts to our nation\u2019s defense spending that may have to occur as a result of this bill\u2019s passage. We must do everything we can to avoid an exercise in blind sequestration of defense funds that could come into play if the joint committee cannot find a way to further avoid cuts of $1.2 trillion.\u201d\n\nSaid Turner last week: \u201cI am pleased to see that the House Republican leadership listened to the concerns raised by 70 of my colleagues in the (chamber) and the leaders of our military and took action to fully fund our Defense Department in this year\u2019s House Republican budget proposal. I have been given strong assurances that under this proposal, the Pentagon would have the ability to use the money they need.\u201d\n\nWhat is past is prologue. The supercommittee failed spectacularly. Congress is now nearly four years into sequestration -- with each succeeding year\u2019s cuts to the Pentagon more pernicious than the last.\n\nThere is an appetite in Washington to extinguish the sequester. But there\u2019s an unholy alliance afoot. Fiscal conservatives like preserving the defense cuts. They view sequestration as the only blunt tool they have to cut spending. And they feel that Congress has otherwise has made little progress at reducing spending. Some liberal Democrats also like the sequester -- mainly because of the cuts for the Pentagon. They\u2019ve long thought the military enjoyed the spoils at the hands of other programs. So some liberals are okay tolerating sequestration. And no one sees a way out of this cul-de-sac now.\n\nThat\u2019s what prompted the recent contretemps about the budget and extra defense spending, which by the way is in an account not subject to the sequestration caps required under the BCA.\n\n\u201cWe have a standing army that is atrophying and a world more dangerous than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Turner said.\n\nAnd more defense cuts and fights like this yet to come. Over the next budget. And the next budget. And the next budget.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how many GOP leaders are smiling after a few more rounds of this.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Budget",
