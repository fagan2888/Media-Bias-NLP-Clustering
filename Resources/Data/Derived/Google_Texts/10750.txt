For decades the Bay County Sheriff's Office has held a charity concert to raise money for the next generation of law enforcement.

Tonight was the 52nd annual Bay County Sheriff's Office Junior Deputy Gospel Sing at the Marina Civic Center.

Hundreds came out to the fun family event featuring various gospel groups like New Journey, The Bowling Family, and Grassroots.

Sheriff's Deputies say this is one of the largest turnouts they ever had.

Cpl. Larry Grainger, the Director of the Bay County Sheriff's Junior Deputy Program explained, "It means a lot to me that our community would come out to support these kids. These are our kids. All I can say is people are really showing their support for Sheriff McKeithen and for him making the stand that he has."

This was a free event but donations were accepted and more than $11,000 was raised for the Bay County Junior Deputies Program.
