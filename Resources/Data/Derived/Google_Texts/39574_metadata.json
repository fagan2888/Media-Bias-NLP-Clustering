But these days, investors and company observers don't seem to have to worry that Walgreen will make a similar move, given other issues affecting sales that are a distraction from any potential anti-tobacco strategy. Investors also don't seem to be pressuring Walgreen to follow suit.\n\nHere are five reasons Walgreen can't yet afford to stop selling tobacco:\n\nWalgreen added activist investor Barry Rosenstein , the founder of hedge fund Jana Partners , to its board. Jana is among investors pushing Walgreen to slash costs as the company moves to compete in the global marketplace, following the completion of its acquisition of European drugstore chain and retailer Alliance Boots. Walgreen decided against an \"inversion\" that would have relocated its headquarters overseas and therefore will keep its headquarters in the United States. An inversion would have reduced Walgreen's corporate taxes by several billion dollars. Walgreen's tax rate of 37.5% last year was almost twice what Alliance Boots paid last year. Walgreen is still regaining credibility among some investors following last month's departure of Wade Miquelon as chief financial officer, following reports he made a $1 billion forecasting error. Walgreen store traffic hasn't been impressive of late. In August, for example, the company said that \"customer traffic in comparable stores decreased 1.7%.\" Global cost-cutting is in the works and likely to continue aggressively now that Walgreen has completed its acquisition of Alliance Boots. Depending on how deeply executives reduce expenses, it could allow the company to stop selling tobacco, but recent statements don't indicate that tobacco sales are a top priority for executives at either Walgreen or Alliance Boots.\n\nThese are just among the major distractions Walgreen faces, and they point to why the company can't now afford a major loss of revenue to eliminate tobacco sales. That will offer investors at least some constant as the pharmacy chain becomes a global player in the prescription business, following the completion of its Alliance Boots transaction.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "12:44", "date": "2014-09-22T16:44:00Z", "description": "As Walgreen Co. consolidates its operations with European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, it's under pressure to cut costs, so investors shouldn't expect it to stop selling tobacco products anytime soon.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Bruce Japsen", "promo": "As Walgreen Co. consolidates its operations with European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, it's under pressure to cut costs, so investors shouldn't expect it to stop selling tobacco products anytime soon.", "twitter": {"description": "As Walgreen Co. consolidates its operations with European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, it's under pressure to cut costs, so investors shouldn't expect it to stop selling tobacco products anytime soon.", "site": "@themotleyfool", "title": "5 Reasons Why Walgreen Company Won't Kick the Habit  --  The Motley Fool"}, "headline": "5 Reasons Why Walgreen Company Won't Kick the Habit", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "As Walgreen Co. consolidates its operations with European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, it's under pressure to cut costs, so investors shouldn't expect it to stop selling tobacco products anytime soon.", "title": "5 Reasons Why Walgreen Company Won't Kick the Habit  --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/22/5-reasons-why-walgreen-company-wont-kick-the-habit.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffool%2Ftmf-logo.png&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "6b65e45c-41b2-11e4-ad28-0050569d4be0", "pitch": 823, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2014 09 22", "tickers": "CVS,WBA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc597\"", "article_summary": "Global cost-cutting is in the works and likely to continue aggressively now that Walgreen has completed its acquisition of Alliance Boots.\nWalgreen's tax rate of 37.5% last year was almost twice what Alliance Boots paid last year.\nThese are just among the major distractions Walgreen faces, and they point to why the company can't now afford a major loss of revenue to eliminate tobacco sales.\nIt's unclear whether Walgreen's annual sales of tobacco products would rival the estimated $2 billion in revenue CVS is losing.\nWalgreen is still regaining credibility among some investors following last month's departure of Wade Miquelon as chief financial officer, following reports he made a $1 billion forecasting error."}
