BHcare has 3,241 behavioral health clients in total, with 2,829 receiving outpatient care.\n\nAmong the towns most affected include Branford, as the agency said 440 patients there would lose service, followed by Ansonia with 285, with 170 patients affected in both Guilford and Shelton.\n\nThe reduction is part of Gov. Dannel Malloy\u2019s fiscal 2016-17 biennium budget. If the budget is approved later this year, BHcare\u2019s roughly $3.5 million in funds from DMHAS will be reduced by $2.3 million for its outpatient clinical budget, Cook said. BHcare\u2019s total outpatient clinical budget is $5.7 million; the agency has an overall annual operating budget of $18.3 million and serves more than 12,000 patients for behavioral health, domestic violence and prevention services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBHcare is DMHAS\u2019s designated local mental health authority for Ansonia, Branford, Derby, East Haven, Guilford, Madison, North Branford, North Haven, Oxford, Seymour and Shelton. The loss in grant funds would also mean BHcare will need to lay off about 40 employees, Cook said.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting to get it restored,\u201d Cook said.\n\nDMHAS spokeswoman Mary Kate Mason said the $25 million reduction is a continuation of a reduction implemented for the current fiscal year. However, for this fiscal year, the state was able to cover some of the reduction with $10 million from the Tobacco Trust Fund and $10 million covered by the department itself, Mason said. The remaining amount was left to providers to cover. DMHAS has a current fiscal year budget of $614.9 million, Cook said,\n\nThe reduction was completed in anticipation of an increase in health coverage in the state as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThey still received grant money, just received less grant money because of the assumption that they would have more insurance[-covered] people coming in for services,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAccording to a release from Malloy\u2019s office on Monday, more than 500,000 state residents have enrolled in health care coverage through the state\u2019s Access Health CT program. The release celebrated the fifth anniversary of the act\u2019s signing into law.\n\n\u201cPut simply, the Affordable Care Act is working,\u201d Malloy said in the release. \u201cConnecticut has emerged as a national leader in its implementation, and states around the country are modeling their exchanges on ours.\u201d\n\nMason wouldn\u2019t comment whether the agency is working on restoring the $25 million in cuts, though she added that there\u2019s \u201cinternal systems design work\u201d being completed that is examining the cut.\n\nIn the meantime, Cook said, the agency is bracing for the, \u201cworst-case scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are feeling the brunt of it right now,\u201d Cook said. The services provided to those patients are critical, Cook said, because they provide clients the ability to live in a community and in a safe environment. The behavioral health services provides assistance to people with mental illness including bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that they will end up in crisis,\u201d Cook said.\n\nWhen patients don\u2019t get the treatment they need, many of them end up using other, more high-cost services, some ending up in jail or in the hospital, Cook said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t save the state money by cutting our grants, because they will just end up paying the money for a hospital or ER visit,\u201d Cook said.\n\nReach Esteban L.
