The event was in support of Julie Dombo, who was shot multiple times in a Derby AT&T store about a month and a half ago.\n\nWhile Julie remains in the hospital with a long road ahead, her friends, family, and the community teamed up for her four-mile walking route wearing orange for gun violence awareness.\n\nDombo's family tells KAKE News the shooting has led to a very difficult 48 days that have come with a lot of challenges. She has overcome a prolonged coma, but remains on a ventilator to help her breathe. She was shot in the right lung and forearm and has suffered from massive blood loss. As a result, she has lost parts of all four limbs.\n\nDombo's husband hopes their strides today bring attention to gun violence at a local and national level.\n\n\"Please local, state, federal officials, please start doing something about it,\" said John Dombo. \"It has to be controlled. Things like this are totally unnecessary and it affects way too many lives and I don't want to see anyone else have to go through what we're going through right now.\"\n\nDombo is in the process of being fitted for prosthetic hands and legs and her husband says she will likely be off the ventilator in about a week.\n\nJohn Dombo says they have a long road ahead in this painful journey, but they believe Julie will be out of the hospital by December.\n\n\"It will be the best Christmas present I've ever had,\" said the victim's husband.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The event was in support of Julie Dombo, who was shot multiple times in a Derby AT&T store about a month and a half ago.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "The event was in support of Julie Dombo, who was shot multiple times in a Derby AT&T store about a month and a half ago.", "title": "Julie Dombo's supporters rally against gun violence", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Julie-Dombo-supporters-rally-against--329716271.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/348/D6B/348D6B70BD2C4F1588BD91AAEE1C2149", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AE4/57D/AE457DBC44BF4182955E810D489C0F86.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The event was in support of Julie Dombo, who was shot multiple times in a Derby AT&T store about a month and a half ago.", "title": "Julie Dombo's supporters rally against gun violence", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Julie-Dombo-supporters-rally-against--329716271.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/dombo.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Julie Dombo's supporters rally against gun violence", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Julie Dombos supporters rally against"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4746\"", "article_summary": "More Video...More than a hundred people in Derby laced up their running shoes on Sunday to rally against gun violence.\nDombo's husband hopes their strides today bring attention to gun violence at a local and national level.\nWhile Julie remains in the hospital with a long road ahead, her friends, family, and the community teamed up for her four-mile walking route wearing orange for gun violence awareness.\nThe event was in support of Julie Dombo, who was shot multiple times in a Derby AT&T store about a month and a half ago.\nJohn Dombo says they have a long road ahead in this painful journey, but they believe Julie will be out of the hospital by December."}
