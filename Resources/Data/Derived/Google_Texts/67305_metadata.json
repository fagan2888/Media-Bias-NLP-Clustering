Xerox won the bid after receiving the highest-score on a state criteria list ranging from financial stability to comparable contract experience.\n\nThe Nevada state government has since given the second-place company, Deloitte Consulting, a $1.5 million contract to fix the Nevada Health Link.\n\nAttorney Matthew Callister told the Review-Journal that about 40 people had called saying they had also paid their insurance premiums but have no coverage. As of last week, the Nevada Health Link had a \u201cpends\u201d list totaling more than 10,500 people still without coverage.\n\nLea Swartley, who also has received no coverage despite paying premiums, is the co-plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds, if not thousands, of Nevadans who have been paying premiums for 2, 3, 4 months, not receiving any coverage whatsoever,\u201d Callister told KTNV-TV. \u201cI talked to a mom an hour ago who has skin cancer and she can\u2019t go in to have her skin cancer treatment because her doctor says, \u2018Who is your carrier?'\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday, 40,500 consumers had selected qualified health plans through the exchange. Of those, 24,000 had paid for coverage, the Associated Press reports.\n\nCallister noted that the lawsuit is not an attack on the Affordable Care Act or the state\u2019s insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with the ACA. This is 100 percent about Xerox, who won the bid from the state of Nevada to create this exchange. And they\u2019ve failed. They absolutely failed,\u201d Callister told the Review-Journal.\n\n\u201cI just want to get people covered who paid for coverage,\u201d Callister said. \u201cState law said that\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just days after the deadline to enroll for insurance coverage through Nevada Health Link, the first class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of residents who say they signed up and paid their premiums \u2013 but were never given coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2014/04/02/first-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-nevada-obamacare-exchange/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbslasvegas.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/gavel1.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbslasvegas.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/gavel1.jpg?w=640", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Just days after the deadline to enroll for insurance coverage through Nevada Health Link, the first class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of residents who say they signed up and paid their premiums \u2013 but were never given coverage.", "title": "Lawsuit Filed Against Nevada Health Exchange"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbslasvegas.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/gavel1.jpg?w=640", "title": "Lawsuit Filed Against Nevada Health Exchange", "site": "/kxnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Just days after the deadline to enroll for insurance coverage through Nevada Health Link, the first class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of residents who say they signed up and paid their premiums \u2013 but were never given coverage."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News/Talk 840 AM KXNT", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Las Vegas", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, health, news, aca, affordable care act, ben fearnow, benjamin fearnow, callister & associates, class-action lawsuit, deloitte consulting, insurance companies, ktnv-tv, larry basich, las vegas review journal, lea swartley, matthew callister, nevada health link, obamacare, state insurance marketplace, u.s. district court of nevada, xerox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KXNT840AM/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KXNT840AM/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b47205dd55c79cc221b378c1fe41f772?s=16", "news_keywords": "aca, affordable care act, ben fearnow, benjamin fearnow, callister & associates, class-action lawsuit, deloitte consulting, insurance companies, ktnv-tv, larry basich, las vegas review journal, lea swartley, matthew callister, nevada health link, obamacare, state insurance marketplace, u.s. district court of nevada, xerox"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcece4\"", "article_summary": "The Nevada state government has since given the second-place company, Deloitte Consulting, a $1.5 million contract to fix the Nevada Health Link.\nThe lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court of Nevada on Tuesday alleges gross negligence and failure to do due diligence against the state of Nevada, the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (which runs Nevada Health Link), and the company that won the contract to build the exchange, Xerox.\nLas Vegas (CBS LAS VEGAS) \u2014 Just days after the deadline to enroll for insurance coverage through Nevada Health Link, the first class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of residents who say they signed up and paid their premiums \u2013 but were never given coverage.\nAs of last week, the Nevada Health Link had a \u201cpends\u201d list totaling more than 10,500 people still without coverage.\nCallister noted that the lawsuit is not an attack on the Affordable Care Act or the state\u2019s insurance exchange."}
