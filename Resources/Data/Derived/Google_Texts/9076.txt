Most Republicans in a new poll expressed dissatisfaction with their party's handling of illegal immigration and same-sex marriage.

A Pew Research poll released Tuesday found Republican respondents are less satisfied with their party than Democrats are with theirs on a number of prominent issues.

The GOP has been divided for years as some Republican leaders have called on conservative members to soften their tone on immigration and social issues so the party could be more competitive in presidential elections.

Fifty-six percent of Republicans say their party is not doing a good job on illegal immigration. That includes 33 percent who think Republicans are too willing to grant legal status to immigrants and 18 percent who think the GOP does not go far enough.

Thirty-seven percent of Republicans said the party is doing a good job on immigration.

Another 53 percent of Republicans believe the GOP is not representing their view on same-sex marriage. Of those, 28 percent said the Republican Party is not willing enough to accept gay marriage, while 22 percent said the party is too willing.

Thirty-four percent of Republicans said their party is doing a good job on gay marriage.

On both gay marriage and immigration reform, young Republicans are most likely to say their party is not willing to go far enough.

Democrats are far more likely to say their party is doing a good job representing their views on gay marriage. Sixty-two percent believe the party is doing a good job, and 28 percent believe the opposite.

Black Democrats are the most likely — 30 percent — to say the party is too willing to accept gay marriage.

On immigration, Democrats are divided. Forty-seven percent believe their party is representing their views, while 44 percent believe the opposite.

The poll surveyed 2,002 people and has a 2.5 percentage point margin of error.
