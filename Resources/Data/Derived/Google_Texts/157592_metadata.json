Employer-provided health insurance is tax-free for workers and tax-deductible for companies, a huge boost for workplace coverage.\n\nBut some economists say that the chief purpose of any tax system should be revenue collection, and using income taxes to advance social policy makes the code needlessly complicated, while also distorting incentives to work, save and invest.\n\nSome pros and cons of using the tax system to help people pay premiums for private health insurance, as the Affordable Care Act does:\n\nPRO: Could build support for the health overhaul because tax credits have greater political popularity than traditional government spending programs.\n\nCON: Complicates tax filing for many lower-to-middle income people, who may not be able to afford tax-preparation services.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nPRO: Avoids the social stigma of Medicaid, the safety-net health care program for low-income people.

care tax credits that help families.\n\nCON: It constitutes mission creep for the IRS, straining the agency when an estimated $385 billion a year in taxes owed, or more, goes uncollected.",
