He was warmer than expected Saturday and planned to shed a few layers for Sunday\u2019s game against the New York Rangers.\n\nEven though Cory Schneider has been on quite a roll, DeBoer is turning to Brodeur, the face of the franchise for the better part of two decades. No one was surprised by the choice, not even Schneider, who is 5-1-2 with a 0.96 goals-against average and .961 save percentage in eight starts dating to Dec. 28.\n\nStill, DeBoer turned to Brodeur.\n\n\u201cIt really is an easy decision from a right thing to do perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cHis career, 20 years with the Devils, what he\u2019s done, and he\u2019s played some excellent hockey for us this year.\u201d\n\nBrodeur was reluctant to talk about his legacy and what he has accomplished with the Devils.\n\n\u201cI want to deserve to play because of the way I play now, not what I did in the past,\u201d the 41-year-old Brodeur said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to play a game. It\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s been over a week.\u201d\n\nBrodeur understands the significance of taking part in an outdoor game, especially this one in such a historic place. Brodeur has played in only two of New Jersey\u2019s past eight games - winning one and losing one.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t make the decision. I would have accepted it one way or the other,\u201d Brodeur said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation that sometimes we get these games that mean a lot to different people for different reasons. I guess they felt it meant a lot to me, and they put me in.\u201d\n\nThe decision was even easier at the other end of Yankee Stadium where Rangers coach Alain Vigneault went with his unquestioned No. 1 goalie Henrik Lundqvist, instead of young backup Cam Talbot, who has had a fine season.\n\nLundqvist has experience with playing outside - having backstopped the Rangers\u2018 victory over the Flyers in Philadelphia two years ago. He also knows Yankee Stadium a bit, having attended ballgames there, but the big ballpark in the Bronx never looked like this in the summer.\n\n\u201cIt was very special to walk out there today, but I think tomorrow when you hear the crowd \u2026 you get goose bumps,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling you\u2019re looking for when you play the game. It gives you a lot of adrenaline.\n\n\u201cYou try to enjoy that moment, but at the same time you need to be focused on what we have to do. It\u2019s an important game for both teams, and that makes it even more special.\u201d\n\nLundqvist also said he felt warm on the ice. The high temperature Sunday is expected to be around 20, a bit chillier than Saturday, but under sunny skies. Game time is set for 12:30 p.m., so there is a good chance it will be played during the warmest part of the day.\n\nThat will be much different Wednesday when the Rangers take on the rival New York Islanders under the lights at night when the temperature could be single digits.\n\nThe Rangers, the second-place team in the Metropolitan Division, come in having lost two straight at home after a 9-2-1 surge. The Devils, 5-1-3 in their past nine, are tied for fifth but are only two points behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big event for everybody that\u2019s in the organization, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re just playing hockey,\u201d Brodeur said.\n\nSeveral Rangers tossed around a baseball near the perimeter of the rink that stretches from the first base line to the third base line and covers the majority of the infield.\n\nThe snow picked up in intensity as the day wore on. The Devils, as the designated home team, took to the ice first. Both teams had family members in tow, and the players were joined on the ice by their relatives once practice was over.\n\n\u201cThis was the day where you get to enjoy it, you get to take everything in,\u201d Rangers captain Ryan Callahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re all professionals in here and we know when we come to the rink tomorrow there\u2019s two points on the line.\u201d\n\nDevils star Jaromir Jagr, another 41-year-old player, doesn\u2019t have the best memories of playing outdoors. He was with the Rangers back in 2012 and didn\u2019t come out unscathed in the elements in Philadelphia.\n\nHe acknowledged even being a bit envious of the Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings, who were slated to play in the warmth of Southern California inside Dodger Stadium on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIf I had a choice to play here or in L.A., I would probably choose L.A. Nothing against the Yankees or New York,\u201d Jagr said. \u201cI had a bad experience two years ago. I got injured in the first period, and it was the same weather.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty cold, and I think it\u2019s a lot tougher for the muscles to get warmed up.\u201d\n\nThe Devils are using the Yankees clubhouse, and even though this is a new version of Yankee Stadium, the presence of those who made the original building famous can be felt.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked in the Yankees dressing room, I was in awe,\u201d DeBoer said.\n\nLundqvist also paid homage to the ballpark and the Yankees, ordering up a mask and pads featuring the iconic pinstripes of the home team.\n\n\u201cWe all feel very lucky to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, to pay some respect to the Yankees organization - pinstripe pads and mask and stuff like that - it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The biggest decision New Jersey Devils coach Pete DeBoer had to make heading into his club's game at Yankee Stadium was whether to go with his surefire Hall of Fame goalie or the guy who has been hot lately.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The biggest decision New Jersey Devils coach Pete DeBoer had to make heading into his club\u2019s game at Yankee Stadium was whether to go with his surefire Hall of Fame goalie or the guy who has been hot lately.", "title": "Rangers, Devils practice at Yankee Stadium", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/rangers-devils-practice-at-yankee-stadium/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/53e3f8fc89fbf603490f6a70670031cc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/53e3f8fc89fbf603490f6a70670031cc.jpg", "description": "The biggest decision New Jersey Devils coach Pete DeBoer had to make heading into his club's game at Yankee Stadium was whether to go with his surefire Hall of Fame goalie or the guy who has been hot", "card": "summary", "title": "Rangers, Devils practice at Yankee Stadium"}, "Author": "IRA PODELL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, New Jersey Devils, New York Rangers, Pete Deboer, Yankee Stadium"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd917a\"", "article_summary": "He also knows Yankee Stadium a bit, having attended ballgames there, but the big ballpark in the Bronx never looked like this in the summer.\nHe was warmer than expected Saturday and planned to shed a few layers for Sunday\u2019s game against the New York Rangers.\nI guess they felt it meant a lot to me, and they put me in.\u201dThe decision was even easier at the other end of Yankee Stadium where Rangers coach Alain Vigneault went with his unquestioned No.\nNEW YORK (AP) - The biggest decision New Jersey Devils coach Pete DeBoer had to make heading into his club\u2019s game at Yankee Stadium was whether to go with his surefire Hall of Fame goalie or the guy who has been hot lately.\nThe Rangers, the second-place team in the Metropolitan Division, come in having lost two straight at home after a 9-2-1 surge."}
