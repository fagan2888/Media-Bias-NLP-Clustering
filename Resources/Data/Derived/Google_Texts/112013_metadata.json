Participation in the program should not detract from its worthwhile purpose,\" the Georgia Transportation Department said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"Maintaining the safety of our roadways is this Department\u2019s foremost mission. Encountering signage and members of the KKK along a roadway would create a definite distraction to motorists,\" the statement continued. \"Further, promoting an organization with a history of inciting civil disturbance and social unrest would present a grave concern to the department.\"\n\nThe lower court sided with the ACLU and the KKK, setting up Thursday's showdown at the Georgia Appeals Court.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Georgia is appealing a lower court decision that the group can adopt a road.", "description": "Georgia is appealing a lower court decision that the group can adopt a road.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Georgia is appealing a lower court decision that the group can adopt a road.", "title": "Court to decide whether Klu Klux Klan can adopt a highway in Georgia", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247378-court-to-determine-whether-kkk-can-adopt-a-highway", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/kkk.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247378-court-to-determine-whether-kkk-can-adopt-a-highway", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-09T12:21-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "KKK, American Civil Liberties Union, Georgia Department of Transportation, Adopt-a-Highway,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-09T12:21:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247378-court-to-determine-whether-kkk-can-adopt-a-highway", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Georgia is appealing a lower court decision that the group can adopt a road.", "card": "summary", "title": "Court to decide whether Klu Klux Klan can adopt a highway in Georgia"}, "dcterms.title": "Court to decide whether Klu Klux Klan can adopt a highway in Georgia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2be0\"", "article_summary": "A Georgia court is scheduled to hear arguments Thursday about whether the Ku Klux Klan can adopt a highway in the state.\nThe lower court sided with the ACLU and the KKK, setting up Thursday's showdown at the Georgia Appeals Court.\nParticipation in the program should not detract from its worthwhile purpose,\" the Georgia Transportation Department said in a statement at the time.\nThe initial lawsuit was filed by American Civil Liberties Union Foundation on behalf of the International Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\nThe case is an appeal filed by the state of Georgia after a lower court ruled last year that its Department of Transportation could not reject a request from the KKK to adopt a Georgia highway."}
