The two clinics, both outposts of a network of abortion providers called Whole Woman\u2019s Health, stayed open with slimmed-down staffs while their owner, Amy Hagstrom Miller, struggled to comply with the first chunk of HB2\u2014the voluminous anti-choice law passed by the Texas legislature last summer\u2014which requires abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital. Today, after weeks of failed negotiations with nearby hospitals, Hagstrom Miller announced that both clinics are closing their doors.\n\nThe clinics in Beaumont, about an hour east of Houston, and McAllen, just north of the Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley, were the last rural abortion providers left in Texas. Between July, when HB2 passed, and November, when the admitting privileges requirement went into effect, nearly half of the state\u2019s 44 abortion clinics folded, unable to comply with the new rules. The health center in McAllen stopped offering abortions and pared down its staff, providing ultrasounds and counseling to the women who continued to walk in the door and helping them coordinate travel to the nearest clinic, two hours north in Corpus Christi. The Beaumont clinic survived this initial purge because one of its physicians had admitting privileges, but he\u2019s in his seventies and wants to retire. His colleagues couldn\u2019t get privileges in his stead, leaving the clinic in a precarious position.\n\n\u201cI had to come to terms with the fact that those clinics had no future,\u201d Hagstrom Miller says. She might have kept looking for a way to keep them open, if she wasn\u2019t facing a much bigger threat. In September, the rest of HB2 will go into effect, requiring all abortion providers to conform to the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), outpatient care units that offer more complicated procedures, usually involving high levels of anesthesia. Only one of Hagstrom Miller\u2019s remaining three clinics, the Whole Woman\u2019s Health in Fort Worth, qualifies as an ASC. Updating the other two clinics to comply with ASC regulations\u2014which include wider hallways and specialized heating and cooling systems\u2014could cost $6 million.\n\nThe Corpus Christi clinic (which isn\u2019t one of Hagstrom Miller\u2019s) also has until September to renovate. If that clinic closes, Rio Grande residents will have to embark on a five-hour trek to San Antonio. Women in Beaumont won\u2019t have as far to drive, but they will have to make multiple trips. Under Texas law, women seeking an abortion must obtain a sonogram from the doctor who will be performing the procedure at least 24 hours ahead of time. If you live more than 100 miles from the clinic, you\u2019re exempt from the law. Unfortunately for Beaumont women, their town is a mere 90 miles from the nearest abortion provider in Houston.\n\nFor many women, a long drive, an overnight stay, and a few days off work are a substantial burden, but not impossible. For the residents of the Rio Grande Valley, though, these new hurdles could make abortion as difficult to obtain as if it were illegal. McAllen is one of the poorest cities in the country, second only to Brownsville, another town nearby. Last fall, Sarah Posner documented some of the barriers that keep women in the Rio Grande from accessing basic reproductive healthcare like birth control. Unpaved roads, erratic electricity, and poor sanitation are common in the surrounding communities. Few of the Rio Grande\u2019s residents have jobs with sick leave. By Hagstrom Miller\u2019s estimate, around one-third of her patients are undocumented immigrants who can\u2019t drive beyond the border checkpoints north of McAllen without risking deportation.\n\nRather than waiting for months to scrape together the money for the procedure and the trip\u2014a Sisyphean task in itself, since the price for abortion skyrockets from as little as $300 in the first trimester to several thousand dollars by the end of the second\u2014more women may take matters into their own hands. The Rio Grande Valley already has one of the highest rates of self-induced abortion in the country. A 2012 survey found that 12 percent of women in clinics near the Mexico border said they had attempted to end their pregnancy on their own before seeking professional help. \u201cThey\u2019re getting drugs from Mexico, drinking teas, eating herbs, falling down the stairs on purpose or convincing their boyfriends to beat them up,\u201d Hagstrom Miller says. \u201cAny of those methods could be fatal.\u201d\n\nThe problem is compounded by the Texas legislature\u2019s decision, in 2011, to slash funding for family planning services. Dan Grossman, the vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health, a pro-choice think tank, has been investigating the effects of these cuts as co-principal investigator of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas-Austin. In a 2012 survey of women seeking abortions, nearly half of the respondents said they hadn\u2019t been able to obtain their preferred form of birth control in the past three months. \u201cThe cuts in family planning are leading to a rise in unintended pregnancy and an increased demand for abortion,\u201d Grossman says. \u201cMore clinic closures means that women will have to wait longer to get the procedure, which means a higher risk of complications.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, 38 percent of people living in the Rio Grande Valley were uninsured. When state-funded family planning clinics in the region folded, poor women lost their only source of affordable birth control. Now, some may be getting access to contraception once again, thanks to the rollout of Obamacare. But Texas\u2019s refusal to participate in Medicaid expansion means that many Rio Grande residents will fall into the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d\u2014earning too much to be covered under Medicaid but too little to qualify for insurance tax credits\u2014and won\u2019t be able to get the no-cost birth control promised by the Affordable Care Act. Others are undocumented and unable to buy insurance on the exchanges.\n\nLong wait times for appointments will undoubtedly become the norm. By next fall, when the ASC requirement kicks in, six clinics in major urban centers\u2014Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, and Fort Worth\u2014could be responsible for performing more than 70,000 abortions each year. Hagstrom Miller and others are fundraising to help poor women pay for transportation to these cities, but for many, a trip to Mexico to buy illegal abortion drugs might seem like a better bet.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "Since November, the last abortion clinics in East Texas and the Rio Grande Valley, some of the poorest and most remote parts of the state, have been hanging on by their fingernails.
