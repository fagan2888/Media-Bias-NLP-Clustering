COURTNEY FISCHER LIVE OUTSIDE THE JAIL WITH WHAT POLICE ARE NOW SAYING. Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. AND THE SUSPECT IS HERE AT JAIL. THIS IS A COPY OF THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT OUTLINING WHAT HAPPENED. TAKE A LOOK. THIS IS WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HIS NAME IS DEMIETRYIASS HOLYFIELD. HE'S FACING SEVERAL CHARGES FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROBBERIES THAT HAPPENED ON THURSDAY. POLICE SAY THAT THE 21-YEAR-OLD SLIPPED NOTES DEMANDING MONEY TO CLERKS AT TWO DIFFERENT STORES. HE GOT AWAY WITH ABOUT $700. BUT THEN INVESTIGATORS SAY HE TRIED ROBBING A THIRD STORE AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THEY CAUGHT ON TO HIM. HE DIDN'T GET ANY MONEY FROM THAT STORE. HE DID GET AWAY FROM THE MALL, BUT ON HIS WAY OUT, POLICE WERE ABLE TO ARREST HIM, SO HE DID NOT GET VERY FAR. HOLYFIELD TALKED TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT THE MONROEVILLE POLICE CHIEF SAYS THAT HE COULD BE CONNECTED TO OTHER ROBBERIES. WE THINK HE'S TIED IN TO AT LEAST THREE OTHERS. WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THERE WILL BE CHARGES FILED IN THOSE OTHER EVENTS. JUST HIS TIME TO COME TO MONROEVILLE AND DO IT, I GUESS. Reporter: HOLYFIELD COULD BE OBBERIES AT TWO DIFFERENT FAMILY DOLLARS. NO FORMAL CHARGES HAVE BEEN PRESSED FOR THOSE ROBBERIES.
