Henry Waxman, who will turn 75 in September, retires at the end of this year after 46 years in elected office, it will mark more than just the end of a storied career as one of the most prolific lawmakers in Congress.\n\nIt will also draw the curtain on a generation of Jewish politicians in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2012, Waxman\u2019s longtime friend and ally Rep. Howard Berman lost his reelection battle to fellow Rep. Brad Sherman after redistricting left them competing for the same seat. This is also the final year in office for L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who has been a dominant figure in local politics since 1975.\n\n\u201cIt is the end of an era,\u201d Yaroslavsky told JTA. \u201cWe\u2019re all parts of the same generation. We can all finish each others\u2019 sentences.\u201d\n\nWhen Waxman, who is a Democrat, announced his retirement from Congress in January, President Obama hailed him as \u201cone of the most accomplished legislators of his or any era.\u201d\n\nWaxman established a national reputation for shepherding landmark legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the 1990 revisions to the Clean Air Act and leading dramatic congressional hearings on such matters as tobacco and AIDS policy.\n\n\u201cHe became probably the greatest warrior in the last 50 years for federal social policy, and probably the most remarkable member of the House of Representatives to serve since the Johnson era,\u201d said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute at Cal State Los Angeles, a nonpartisan public policy institute.\n\nNeither Waxman\u2019s person nor his personality is outsized. His modest height \u2014 he stands 5 feet, 5 inches tall \u2014 and his soft, precise manner of speaking belie his giant political stature and the bulldog reputation he attained on Capitol Hill. Now he\u2019s winding down his career in relative quiet, collecting awards and sorting through the papers he has accumulated since he was elected to Congress in 1974.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about the things I wanted to do, so much of that has happened,\u201d Waxman told JTA in an interview in his office, ticking through a laundry list of policies for which he has pressed: health care reform, tobacco regulation, nutrition labels, the Clean Air Act.\n\nHis spare district office on Wilshire Boulevard sits a few miles west of the once-Jewish Boyle Heights neighborhood where he was born. It\u2019s also on the edge of West Los Angeles, where Waxman and much of the rest of the city\u2019s Jews moved as they prospered. The area has served as the base for his political career.\n\nWaxman was born to the children of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia. When he was relatively young, his family moved from Boyle Heights to South-Central Los Angeles, an increasingly African-American neighborhood where his father opened a grocery store.\n\n\u201cI always felt that living in an area that wasn\u2019t solid Jewish made me even more Jewish,\u201d Waxman said.\n\nPolitics ran in the family bloodlines. His uncle, Al Waxman, published a pair of local newspapers, including one that opposed Japanese internment during World War II, and was appointed to L.A.\u2019s first committee on air pollution \u2013 then promptly was kicked off when he fingered major local industries as culprits. Waxman\u2019s parents brought him up with liberal values and an allegiance to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cWe always talked about politics,\u201d Waxman said. \u201cMy parents imbued me with an attachment to the Democratic Party and to the fact that government is essential to the role nobody else would play to make this a more just society.\u201d\n\nWaxman and Berman met as members of the Young Democrats at UCLA and began their careers battling against the city\u2019s conservative establishment. They were part of the political reform coalition between blacks and white liberals (many of them Jews) led by future mayor Tom Bradley.\n\nThe two rising Jewish politicians also took on the state Democratic machine led by State Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, building their own political operation (along with Berman\u2019s younger brother, political consultant Michael Berman) that came to be known as the Waxman-Berman Machine. Using then-innovative political tactics such as targeted direct mail, slates of favored candidates, and tapping Waxman\u2019s affluent base in West Los Angeles for campaign funds, they helped elect an entire cohort of like-minded politicians to office in California. Many, though certainly not all, were Jews.\n\nThey initially opposed Yaroslavsky in favor of a Bradley ally, but Yaroslavsky subsequently became a close political partner.\n\n\u201cThey really represented the high water mark of Jewish political officeholding in Southern California, and then it spread their influence to Washington,\u201d Sonenshein said. \u201cFrom the city to state to county to the U.S. Congress, these guys were at the forefront.\u201d\n\nIn 1974, Waxman was elected to an open seat for Congress. For the next 40 years, Waxman used his secure perch in western Los Angeles \u2014 aided by friendly districts drawn by Michael Berman \u2014 to become one of the most influential domestic policy legislators in the country. The walls of his district office feature framed front pages from the Los Angeles Times commemorating the passage of the Affordable Care Act, one of Waxman\u2019s capstone achievements.\n\nHis secure perch wobbled in 2012 when an independent redistricting commission redrew his district, making it less Democratic and less Jewish. Waxman survived the closest race of his career against a self-funded independent, Bill Bloomfield, who spent millions of dollars of his own money in the race and came within eight points of Waxman.\n\nThough he\u2019s stepping down, Waxman says he is confident he could have kept winning. But he says he didn\u2019t want to spend a year raising money and campaigning only to return to the minority in the House of Representatives.\n\nBesides, he said, 40 years in Congress \u201cwas a good, round number.\u201d\n\nThe Republican candidate to replace Waxman, Elan Carr, is also Jewish, but Waxman has endorsed Democrat Ted Lieu, whom most political observers believe will win the seat.\n\nThe retirement of Waxman and his cohort by no means spells the end of liberal Jewish politicians in Los Angeles. The city\u2019s three citywide elected officials \u2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti, City Attorney Mike Feuer, and Controller Ron Galperin \u2014 are all Jewish. And though Jews are shrinking as a percentage of L.A.\u2019s population and other minority groups like Latinos are growing fast, Jews\u2019 reliability as voters makes them an important political bloc in low-turnout elections.\n\nStill, the departure of the older generation marks the demise of the concentrated clout that Waxman and his allies represented in state and local politics. Yaroslavsky notes that the Jewish population has dispersed, and the number of Jewish elected officials in Southern California has declined overall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a tragedy, but it\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said.\n\nAs our interview winds up, Waxman is quick to return to work: There are still more boxes of papers to sort, and less time than ever to sort them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legendary congressman Henry Waxman is winding down his congressional career, and with it a generation of Jewish clout in Los Angeles politics.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.6", "og": {"site_name": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency", "description": "Legendary congressman Henry Waxman is winding down his congressional career, and with it a generation of Jewish clout in Los Angeles politics.", "title": "Henry Waxman\u2019s retirement ends era in L.A.
