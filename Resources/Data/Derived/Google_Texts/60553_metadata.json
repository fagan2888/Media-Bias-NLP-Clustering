Fama, a fellow professor at the University of Chicago, and Robert J. Shiller, a professor at Yale.\n\nThe Nobel committee cited all of them for contributing to the study of asset prices. But each person\u2019s work is very different.\n\nProfessor Fama is known as the father of the \u201cefficient-markets hypothesis,\u201d while Professor Shiller, a frequent contributor to the Economic View column in Sunday Business, is a founder of the field of behavioral finance and is a critic of aspects of Professor Fama\u2019s theory. I interviewed both of them last month, and Professor Shiller has also expressed his views in a column.\n\nProfessor Hansen, on the other hand, has received less attention from the news media, and he has stayed clear of the debate over efficient markets and irrational behavior. He has been recognized for creating advanced techniques in econometrics, enabling researchers in many fields of social science to create better mathematical models.\n\nI spoke with him this month. The following is an edited, condensed version of that conversation.\n\nQ.\n\nCongratulations, Lars.\n\nA.\n\nThank you, Jeff.\n\nQ.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t your focus, but Bob Shiller and Gene Fama have had a public exchange of views about whether markets are efficient or irrational or, maybe, both. You haven\u2019t spoken much about it. What\u2019s your position?\n\nA.\n\nAre markets efficient or irrational? I\u2019m not sure how to answer that. I think Shiller and Fama can speak for themselves.\n\nQ.\n\nO.K., let\u2019s move off that for a while. Tell me about yourself, your background. How did you get into economics?\n\nA.\n\nIt took me a while. I was a troublemaker in high school.\n\nQ.\n\nReally?\n\nA.\n\nYes, my father was an itinerant academic and my parents moved me from Michigan to Utah at age 16, and in my last years of high school, I was a very erratic performer. I would bring home double check marks for \u201cdoes not respect authority,\u201d and so my option for college was basically to go to college where I was living. That was Utah State University. My dad, a biochemist, was provost there at the time.\n\nOnce I got to college, I had to shift into a higher gear. First I tried chemistry except I found I didn\u2019t like lab work. I got into mathematics quite early. And I was a political science major. My junior year I finally decided to explore economics.\n\nQ.\n\nYou went to the University of Minnesota for graduate school. And you studied with two men who became Nobel laureates in 2011: Thomas F. Sargent, now at New York University, and Christopher A. Sims, now at Princeton. Did you go to Minnesota to work with them?\n\nA.\n\nNo, I was very, very lucky. I went there because I knew I could combine mathematics and economics. But I didn\u2019t know about Sims and Sargent before I started the program.\n\nQ.\n\nYou could easily have shared the Nobel with them two years ago. And if you had, many of the questions from reporters would have been very different. But now, in the history books, you\u2019re always going to be associated to some degree, with Shiller and Fama. And you\u2019re not a household name yourself \u2014 not yet.\n\nA.\n\nHah. No, I\u2019m not.\n\nQ.\n\nSo please, for a general audience, let\u2019s do two things: situate your own work appropriately within economics, and, forgive me, but please, tell me, are markets efficient, or are they irrational?\n\nA.\n\nMaybe I should talk about my own work, first, and then I\u2019ll visit how it\u2019s connected to the work of Fama and Shiller.\n\nQ.\n\nOf course. Please.\n\nA.\n\nWell, I have a strong interest in understanding how to use statistical methods to assess dynamic economic models \u2014 and, in particular, models that involve how financial markets are linked to the macroeconomy and what the connections are between macroeconomics and financial markets. So it\u2019s critical in my work to have mathematical models.\n\nThe thing to remember about models is they\u2019re always approximations and they will always turn out to be wrong at some point. When someone says all the models that economists use are wrong, well, in a sense that\u2019s true. But you need to ask, are the models wrong in ways that are central to the questions, or are they wrong in ways that aren\u2019t so central?\n\nAnd so part of the task of statistical analysis is to look at models and try to figure out what the gaps are so that people will build better models in the future.\n\nYou could imagine that in order to study the linkages between financial markets and the macroeconomy you\u2019d have to build full-fledged models, with all the intricate interaction. We can\u2019t really do all of that very well yet. So I was particularly interested in methods that allow you to do something without having to do everything.\n\nQ.\n\nSome of your early work overlapped with Gene Fama\u2019s and Bob Shiller\u2019s, didn\u2019t it?\n\nA.\n\nYes, we have all influenced one another. I think a common theme in all of our work is that we\u2019ve all characterized the puzzling implications that emerge from financial market data. But we take different approaches.\n\nQ.\n\nSo one more time: Where do you stand on the question of whether markets are rational or irrational, efficient or inefficient?\n\nA.\n\nWell, let me try. We can think about rationality in a few ways, like, are markets efficient, do we accept the efficient-markets hypothesis? For me the interesting question is the consequences of efficiency \u2014 the real efficiency issue is how we allocate resources in society and whether we are doing it well or not. Are markets efficient that way? Sometimes they are, sometimes they\u2019re not.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at efficiency in another sense. If we have a model using rational agents in a financial market, it\u2019s just a model and at some level it\u2019s going to fail. But the question is, does it give bad predictions and does it identify places where there are well-defined policy alternatives? I\u2019ve often used so-called rational models and efficient-market-type models in some broad sense of those terms. They always fail at some level.\n\nWhen you relax rationality, here\u2019s the challenge: If you announce things are irrational then that alone doesn\u2019t get you very far.\n\nYou have to replace that with some very concrete notion of what it means to be irrational. Some of my students have done it, and as long as they\u2019re doing this in formal and rigorous ways I\u2019m all in favor of it.\n\nQ.\n\nWith Tom Sargent you\u2019ve talked about uncertainty and decision-making, rather than irrationality.\n\nA.\n\nYes, people struggle with how to cope with uncertainty; it\u2019s not so easy for them to build probability models about the future in very complicated environments. That\u2019s not realistic. We\u2019re very much interested in rational agents who are coping with uncertainty.\n\nWhat do you want to call behavior under those conditions? Well, you can call that irrational. I\u2019m not sure that I want to do that; maybe it\u2019s a useful term, maybe it\u2019s not, I\u2019m not quite sure.\n\nHow to cope with the uncertainties under complexity is a very important question that we\u2019ve just scratched the surface of.\n\nI didn\u2019t fully answer your question of Fama vs. Shiller but you can see that I\u2019m struggling a bit with it.\n\nQ.\n\nO.K., another area: Have you provided advice to governments or politicians? Do you have strong political views?\n\nA.\n\nNo, I haven\u2019t, and, no, I don\u2019t like to identify strongly with a political party. I\u2019d say I\u2019m fiscally conservative but the truth is I have a hard time figuring out these days which political party that\u2019s attached to. And I\u2019m certainly socially liberal.\n\nQ.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked with Sargent on \u201crational expectations\u201d theory, providing some of the mathematical underpinnings of that theory \u2014 and then raising a lot of questions about that very theory. How did that come about?\n\nA.\n\nYes, the key thing there, too, is we were driven by empirical evidence, about how people behave. We were driven partly by that and partly by other insights coming out of decision theory \u2014 broadly conceived in terms of how people might cope with uncertainty. One thing I loved about rational expectations was that it said, to what extent is public policy grounded on being able to fool people systematically?\n\nQ.\n\nYou mean something like this: the government announces a one-time tax cut, which policy makers expect everybody to spend, but people don\u2019t all spend all of it, because they know taxes are going to rise the next year?\n\nA.\n\nYes, it\u2019s important to ask what happens if people actually think and have expectations about policy. Once you say, you can\u2019t just fool and trick people, you kind of ask, what\u2019s left of that policy? So I thought that was a tremendous insight.\n\nQ.\n\nBut then you began to question the theory. Why?\n\nA.\n\nWe were concerned that it implied way too much precision on the part of investors that we just didn\u2019t think was very plausible and we wanted to explore ways to relax it that would simultaneously give us useful models.\n\nQ.\n\nAre you applying your ideas and your model-building to any of the big problems we\u2019re facing in the financial system and in the economy?\n\nA.\n\nYes, the financial crisis exposed gaps in the existing models that were about the financial-macro linkages. And so this brought together a leading set of scholars, and we regularly meet on how can we build the best models going forward.\n\nQ.\n\nWhy is this critical?\n\nA.\n\nRight now all these government departments are rushing together to put together quick fixes because that\u2019s their charge; they\u2019ve got to figure out how to do financial oversight in sensible ways. But the models we had leading up to the financial crisis were not particularly well suited to it. And so what they\u2019re doing is to put a bunch of Band-Aids on existing models to try to repair them in order to get quick insight. And we thought it was very useful to take a longer-term perspective here.\n\nSo-called systemic risk had of course been the buzzword for financial regulation and financial oversight . People were talking about measurements without even having yet really commonly agreed upon models of what the term was.\n\nI\u2019m very concerned. Because if you really have knowledge gaps and you really try to do a lot of fine-tuning on things like this based on incomplete knowledge, you can do more damage than good. I really think in many of these cases, simplicity is far more important than trying to devise complicated solutions to things.\n\nQ.\n\nWould you be concrete, in terms of what you would prefer?\n\nA.\n\nI would rather have simple capital requirements for banks, for example. Given that we are going to be in this position of bailing out financial institutions, there has to be some form of financial oversight.\n\nBut for me, the point is, I need actual models and I want to assess what they\u2019re good and bad at. I\u2019m not going to dismiss models a priori until I\u2019ve taken them out for a spin.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131116152259, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Fama, Eugene F;Hansen, Lars Peter;Shiller, Robert J", "org": "University of Chicago", "keywords": "Fama Eugene F,Hansen Lars Peter,Shiller Robert J,Economics (Theory and Philosophy),Nobel Prizes,University of Chicago,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/A Talk With Lars Peter Hansen, Nobel Laureate ( 20131116 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jeff Sommer", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jeff Sommer", "byl": "Jeff Sommer", "twitter": {"description": "One of three Nobel recipients this year, the University of Chicago professor has been recognized for creating advanced techniques in econometrics, enabling researchers to create better mathematical models.", "title": "A Talk With Lars Peter Hansen, Nobel Laureate", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/a-talk-with-lars-peter-hansen-nobel-laureate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/16/business/economy/16economix-hansen/16economix-hansen-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002556138, "description": "One of three Nobel recipients this year, the University of Chicago professor has been recognized for creating advanced techniques in econometrics, enabling researchers to create better mathematical models.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 16, 2013", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1384633379, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-11-16T20:40:25-05:00"}, "utime": 20131116204025, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131116, "pdate": 20131116, "des": "Economics (Theory and Philosophy);Nobel Prizes", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/16/business/economy/16economix-hansen/16economix-hansen-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "One of three Nobel recipients this year, the University of Chicago professor has been recognized for creating advanced techniques in econometrics, enabling researchers to create better mathematical models.", "title": "A Talk With Lars Peter Hansen, Nobel Laureate", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/a-talk-with-lars-peter-hansen-nobel-laureate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/16/business/economy/16economix-hansen/16economix-hansen-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/a-talk-with-lars-peter-hansen-nobel-laureate/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "A Talk With Lars Peter Hansen, Nobel Laureate", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/16/business/economy/16economix-hansen/16economix-hansen-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 16, 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4e9\"", "article_summary": "Professor Hansen, on the other hand, has received less attention from the news media, and he has stayed clear of the debate over efficient markets and irrational behavior.\nSome of my students have done it, and as long as they\u2019re doing this in formal and rigorous ways I\u2019m all in favor of it.\nAre markets efficient or irrational?\nWe can think about rationality in a few ways, like, are markets efficient, do we accept the efficient-markets hypothesis?\nSo one more time: Where do you stand on the question of whether markets are rational or irrational, efficient or inefficient?"}
