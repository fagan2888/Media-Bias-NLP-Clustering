Rick Perry called the nation\u2019s implementation of Obamacare \u201ca criminal act\u201d as he ended his trip across New Jersey today with a rally for U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan outside a Bergen County diner.\n\n\u201cIf this heath care law is forced upon this country, the young men and women in this audience are the ones who are really going to pay the price,\u201d Perry, a former Republican candidate for president, told the crowd outside the Bendix Diner. \u201cAnd that, I suggest to you, reaches the point of being a felony toward them and their future.\n\n\u201cThat is a criminal act, from my perspective, to put that type of burden on them \u2014 to mortgage their future like that,\u201d he continued. \u201cAmerica cannot stand that.\u201d\n\nPerry \u2014 who ran an unsuccessful campaign last year for the Republican presidential nomination \u2014 visited New Jersey to stump for Lonegan, the conservative activist and former Bogota mayor running in the state\u2019s special U.S. Senate election Oct. 16. He joined Lonegan at rallies in the Shore towns of Smithville and Bayville before trekking up to north Jersey to cap the day at the diner, a landmark on Route 17 in Hasbrouck Heights.\n\nThe appearances came on the same day enrollment began in Obamacare, President Obama\u2019s controversial health care overhaul officially known as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nToday also marked the first day of a federal government shutdown that took affect after Republicans in the House of Representatives and Democrats in the U.S. failed to reach a budget agreement over Obama\u2019s law. Republicans sought to defund Obamacare, and Democrats wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nBoth Perry \u2014 a possible 2016 presidential candidate \u2014 and Lonegan praised Republicans in Congress for fighting the law. Lonegan said he was proud they had \u201cthe guts to hold the line against Obamacare.\u201d\n\nA proponent of small government, Lonegan said he barely noticed the effects of the shutdown \u2014 which closes services like national parks but doesn\u2019t stop Social Security payments, the military from working or the delivery of U.S. mail.\n\n\u201cOn the federal level, it\u2019s a little inconvenient,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not so much so. \u2026 We\u2019re shutting down unnecessary parts of government? Good.\u201d\n\nPerry praised Lonegan as someone who would fight for similar causes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in this state today because I believe in this man,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI believe in his vision for America.\u201d\n\nLonegan\u2019s opponent, Democratic Newark Mayor Cory Booker, supports Obamacare and blamed Republicans for the shutdown during an appearance at Farleigh Dickinson University in Madison this afternoon.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but get a little upset about what's going on in America today,\u201d Booker said.\n\nThe Newark mayor is a heavy favorite against Lonegan. But recent polls show Lonegan closing the gap: He was down by more than 30 points in polls released a few weeks ago, while polls released in the last week reveal him to be trailing Booker by only 12 or 13 points.\n\n\u201cThat is called momentum,\u201d Lonegan, who has mounted a fierce campaign criticizing Booker, said.\n\nLonegan today also praised the job Perry has done in three terms as Texas\u2019 governor, noting how that state\u2019s economy is much more robust than New Jersey\u2019s. Unemployment last month in Texas was 6.5 percent \u2014 lower than the U.S. rate of 7.3 and a full 2 percentage points lower than New Jersey\u2019s 8.5 rate.\n\n\u201cTexas is a model of economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cNo state even comes close.\u201d\n\nLonegan said the key reason is \u201cliberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexas is a free state,\u201d he said. \u201cYou walk up to a restaurant there, and it says, \u2018Leave your firearms outside.\u2019 That is so cool.\u201d\n\nPerry could end up facing Republican Gov. Chris Christie in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. A campaign spokeswoman for Perry said he is not meeting with Christie during today\u2019s trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Senate candidate Cory Booker hits opponent Lonegan, Republicans at FDU speech\n\n\u2022 While campaigning with Lonegan, Texas Gov.
