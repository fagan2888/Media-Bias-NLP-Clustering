The massive Highway 53 project on the Iron Range appears to be costing more than Virginia officials estimated.

The Star Tribune reports the project is already expected to exceed its $160 million allotment from the state. This comes less than a year after officials secured the funds.

Leaders are now asking for more money. State Representative Jason Metsa wants another $3.4 million to help the city move utility lines.

The deadline to have the new road in place is November of 2017.

Governor Mark Dayton visited Iron Range Friday to tour the project. MnDOT Commissioner Charles Zelle said he was glad Dayton took time out of his schedule to see the progress of construction.

"(Dayton) wanted to stop and see every view because it's just daunting," Zelle said. "We know the importance of the project, but at this phase, he really got a sense of enormity of what we're accomplishing."
