Major League Baseball's Giants would be the first team to ever be banned from chewing a 100-year-old tradition and addiction.\n\nOn Tuesday, the city supervisors\u2019 votes came in unanimously to ban smokeless tobacco from all playing fields throughout the city. The law was initially pushed by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which targeted baseball because of its long legacy with chewing tobacco. If the ordinance passes one more vote and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee signs, the ban will be enforced on Jan 1. 2016, just in time for spring training.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious health issue,\u201d Jess Montejano, a legislative aide for the ban\u2019s chief sponsor, told Time, adding that \u201ckids are seeing their athletic heroes chewing tobacco on the baseball diamond.\u201d\n\nThe MLB responded to the ban with open arms, stating that they\u2019ve been supporters of a smokeless tobacco ban and had been seeking discussions with the Major League Baseball Players Association. It will be the end of an era for spitballs in American baseball if the law passes. But it may show promise for a healthier future, considering chewing tobacco is directly linked to mouth cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA Brief History of Baseball\u2019s Love For Chewing Tobacco\n\nThe tobacco plant finds its roots in North and South America in 6000 B.C., where it was grown for religious and medicinal practices, according to Boston University Medical Center. It was a trusted cure-all, used as a painkiller for everything from wounds to tooth aches.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 1492 when Christopher Columbus was given dried tobacco leaves as a gift from the American Indians that it\u2019s popularity spread like wildfire across Europe. After experimenting with smoking tobacco through the nose, then mouth, chewing tobacco products finally hit America in 1875, when R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company became the first major producer.\n\nBetween the late 19th and early 20th century, chewing tobacco was by far the most popular form of tobacco consumption in the United States, according to Discovery. Baseball players were wary of cigarettes because they believed it caused fatigue and even bad luck. So as the rest of the country moved onto cigarette smoking, baseball players stuck with chewing.\n\nBeyond the addiction, there was actually a practicality to chewing tobacco. Infielders would use it to keep their mouth moist from the dusty base paths, while the spit was used to keep their gloves sticky, yet soften them over time. Fans and marketers quickly caught on and created Big Tobacco Chewing Gum, which baseball game-goers and especially kids know and love to this day.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "san, francisco, giants, chewing, tobacco, ban, could, end, over, 100, years, baseball, history", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "San Francisco's chewing tobacco ban proposal may end baseball's long history with the smokeless habit.", "title": "No More Chewing Tobacco In Baseball?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/san-francisco-giants-chewing-tobacco-ban-could-end-over-100-years-baseball-history-330366", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/chewing-tobacco-ban.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "San Francisco's chewing tobacco ban proposal may end baseball's long history with the smokeless habit.", "title": "No More Chewing Tobacco In Baseball?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/san-francisco-giants-chewing-tobacco-ban-could-end-over-100-years-baseball-history-330366", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/chewing-tobacco-ban.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/chewing-tobacco-ban.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-22T15:10:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T15:10:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "San Francisco's chewing tobacco ban proposal may end baseball's long history with the smokeless habit."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb63b\"", "article_summary": "Bad news for baseball players in the bullpen: A San Francisco city ordinance may lead to banning chewing tobacco on the field.\nAfter experimenting with smoking tobacco through the nose, then mouth, chewing tobacco products finally hit America in 1875, when R.J.
