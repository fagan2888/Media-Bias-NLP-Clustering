Tribe is one of the liberal lions of the legal academy. He argued Bush v. Gore on behalf of former Vice President Al Gore. And he mentored President Obama while the president was a student at Harvard Law School. So if Tribe believed that this lawsuit had merit, that would be a big deal indeed. Indeed, that explains why one of the masterminds behind this lawsuit touted Tribe\u2019s comments earlier this morning.\n\nBut Tribe does not think that this lawsuit should win. Indeed, he explicitly told ThinkProgress that, if he were hearing this case, he would reject this attempt to undermine Obamacare.\n\nTo provide a little background, sometime after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, two of the law\u2019s opponents discovered a drafting error in the statute which, if taken out of context, suggests that millions of people who are eligible for subsidies to buy health insurance should lose those subsidies. This sparked a bevy of lawsuits seeking to take these subsidies away from these individuals, including a case brought by a Republican consultant and a former Bush Administration official that is now pending before a federal appeals court in D.C.\n\nUnder Obamacare, states have the choice to either run their own health exchange or to allow the federal government to run a health insurance marketplace for them. The theory of these lawsuits is that residents of the 34 states that took the second option should lose their subsidies because of language in the Affordable Care Act that ties the subsidies to \u201can Exchange established by the State,\u201d as opposed to one established by the federal government. Yet, the Supreme Court has long held that \u201ca reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation\u201d as the \u201cmeaning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d As ThinkProgress has previously explained, it is clear from the language of the Affordable Care Act taken as a whole that these lawsuits lack merit.\n\nIn his interview with the Fiscal Times, Tribe acknowledges the risk that the conservative Roberts Court could use this case as a \u201csecond bite of the apple\u201d enabling them to grievously wound Obamacare, though he also expressed skepticism of the idea that Chief Justice John Roberts, who rescued the law from the last attempt to repeal it through litigation, will switch his vote this time around. According to Tribe, Roberts would ask himself whether \u201cit [is] so clear under existing law that it has to be construed in this literal and somewhat bizarre way . . . that subsidies or tax credits cannot be provided on the federal exchanges, or is it sufficiently ambiguous that it gives me the necessary legal wiggle room.\u201d\n\nIn an email to ThinkProgress, Tribe added that he personally believes that these lawsuits should fail. Referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron Doctrine, which provides that courts should defer to a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of a law so long as \u201cthe agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,\u201d Tribe wrote that \u201cI do think Chevron deference would be entirely appropriate, and if I were on the Court, I would reject the literal interpretation and argue that HHS and IRS are entitled to interpret the law the way the Obama administration is construing it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Obamacare's opponents may think they've found an ally in their never-ending quest to kill the Affordable Care Act, but they are wrong.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Obamacare's opponents may think they've found an ally in their never-ending quest to kill the Affordable Care Act, but they are wrong.", "title": "No, Obama\u2019s Mentor Does Not Think The Courts Should Gut Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/07/11/3459310/tribe-halbig/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Larry-Tribe-e1405099384526.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare's opponents may think they've found an ally in their never-ending quest to kill the Affordable Care Act, but they are wrong.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Larry-Tribe-e1405099384526-321x214.jpg", "title": "No, Obama\u2019s Mentor Does Not Think The Courts Should Gut Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Larry-Tribe-e1405099384526.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Larry-Tribe-e1405099384526.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-11T14:51:56+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33d8\"", "article_summary": "Justice No, Obama\u2019s Mentor Does Not Think The Courts Should Gut Obamacare CREDIT: AP Photo/Kamenko Pajic, File Harvard Professor Laurence TribeEarlier this week, the Fiscal Times published several quotes from Harvard University Professor Laurence Tribe which suggested that a last ditch lawsuit seeking to blow up the Affordable Care Act could succeed.\nIndeed, he explicitly told ThinkProgress that, if he were hearing this case, he would reject this attempt to undermine Obamacare.\nBut Tribe does not think that this lawsuit should win.\nSo if Tribe believed that this lawsuit had merit, that would be a big deal indeed.\nIndeed, that explains why one of the masterminds behind this lawsuit touted Tribe\u2019s comments earlier this morning."}
