Story highlights Joe Biden praised Bernie Sanders for aiming high even if it doesn't work out

"I like the idea of saying, 'We can do much more,' because we can," Biden says of Sanders

Washington (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden has not endorsed a candidate in the 2016 race, but he recently praised Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for thinking big when it comes to how to lead the country.

"I like the idea of saying, 'We can do much more,' because we can," Biden told The New York Times in an interview published Thursday.

Sanders' critics -- most notably surrogates for his primary opponent Hillary Clinton and the candidate, herself -- often question how realistic his proposals are, but Biden dismissed that concern.

"I don't think any Democrat's ever won saying, 'We can't think that big â€” we ought to really downsize here because it's not realistic,'" Biden said. "C'mon man, this is the Democratic Party! I'm not part of the party that says, 'Well, we can't do it.'"

Biden, who considered entering the race himself, praised Sanders for aiming high even if it doesn't work out.
