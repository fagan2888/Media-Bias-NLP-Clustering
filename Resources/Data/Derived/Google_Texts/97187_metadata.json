Right before his suicide in July 2013, Alexander \u201cAJ\u201d Betts decided to become an organ donor because \u201che spent his entire life trying to make people feel good,\u201d Moore told the Des Moines Register. The grieving mother would later find out that while some of his organs were donated, his eyes, which are considered tissue, were rejected simply because he was gay.\n\nBetts came out as a gay teen around a year and a half before his untimely death, which drew cruelty and torment at the hands of his fellow classmates. When the weight of constant bullying perpetrated by people who were supposed to be his friends became too much to bear, he decided to take his own life, but not before ensuring he would be able to help others even after death. Betts' heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver were all approved for donation, but his eyes, however, were rejected due to the distinction between organ and tissue.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration classifies eyes as tissue rather than organs, meaning they have a different set of standards for donation. While Betts' organs were approved for donation, his eyes were denied because, according to the FDA, tissue from gay men carries an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The same rules that restrict gay men from donating tissue also restricts them from donating blood.\n\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks states that tissue donor screening is a more meticulous process compared to organ donor screening in order to prevent the transmission of viral, bacterial, malignant, or prion-associated disease. Whereas organs are a collection of tissue that work together for a common purpose, tissue is a collection of cells tasked with a common goal. In order to donate tissue, donors must undergo a thorough review of all \u201crelevant medical records\u201d to ensure the safety of both tissue recipients and medical personnel handling the tissue donation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gay, tissue, organ, donation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although the FDA approved an Iowa teen's heart, liver, kidney, and lung donation after his suicide, it rejected his eye donation over fear his tissue may carry an increased risk of an STD.", "title": "FDA Rejects Teen Organ Donor's Eyes Because He Was Gay [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-refused-use-teen-organ-donors-eyes-because-he-was-gay-how-organs-and-tissue-differ-298460", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/alexander-betts-jr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although the FDA approved an Iowa teen's heart, liver, kidney, and lung donation after his suicide, it rejected his eye donation over fear his tissue may carry an increased risk of an STD.", "title": "FDA Rejects Teen Organ Donor's Eyes Because He Was Gay [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-refused-use-teen-organ-donors-eyes-because-he-was-gay-how-organs-and-tissue-differ-298460", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/alexander-betts-jr.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/alexander-betts-jr.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-18T10:53:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T10:53:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although the FDA approved an Iowa teen's heart, liver, kidney, and lung donation after his suicide, it rejected his eye donation over fear his tissue may carry an increased risk of an STD."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc49e\"", "article_summary": "The American Association of Tissue Banks states that tissue donor screening is a more meticulous process compared to organ donor screening in order to prevent the transmission of viral, bacterial, malignant, or prion-associated disease.\nIn order to donate tissue, donors must undergo a thorough review of all \u201crelevant medical records\u201d to ensure the safety of both tissue recipients and medical personnel handling the tissue donation.\nWhile Betts' organs were approved for donation, his eyes were denied because, according to the FDA, tissue from gay men carries an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.\nBetts' heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver were all approved for donation, but his eyes, however, were rejected due to the distinction between organ and tissue.\nThe Food and Drug Administration classifies eyes as tissue rather than organs, meaning they have a different set of standards for donation."}
