The authoritarian nation claims to have a single \u201cdrug\u201d that cures and prevents MERS, Ebola, SARS, and AIDS.\n\n\u201cMalicious virus infections like SARS, Ebola, and MERS are diseases that are related to immune systems, so they can be easily treated by Kumdang-2 injection drug, which is a strong immune reviver,\u201d the official Korean Central News Agency said, according to the Associated Press. The KCNA announced that Kumdang-2 was made from ginseng mixed with \u201crare-earth elements.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s claims come during a time when its rival neighbor, South Korea, is battling a MERS outbreak that has infected some 166 people and killed 24 \u2014 the largest outside of Saudi Arabia. This week, the first MERS case in Thailand was reported. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is believed to have been transmitted to humans from camels, and there is currently no cure or treatment for the virus.\n\nA website touting the Kumdang-2 injection manual states: \u201cThis manual is based on comprehensive analyses of: The opinions of millions of patients, all of which have been collected over the last 23 years since May 1989 at the moment, as well as clinical records submitted [to] hundreds of hospitals, medical groups, institutions and epidemiological institutions [in] Korea and from 30 different countries, and [a] review of millions of patients.\u201d\n\nIt also claims the injection causes no pain, has no adverse side effects, and \u201coptimizes the systems of autonomic nerve and self-curing by stimulating [the] hypothalamus, the center of the autonomic nervous system, functions anti-inflammatory, anti-bacteria, and anti-virus.\u201d Of course, there is no scientific backing that the rest of the world is currently aware of that makes any of this sound true or reasonable. One drug to cure several complex diseases doesn\u2019t seem too plausible.\n\nAccording to the AP, North Korea also boasted about this drug during bird flu outbreaks in 2006 and 2013.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "north korea, mers, ebola, aids", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This isn\u2019t the first time the hermit kingdom has claimed it has a cure for some of the worst viruses of this century.", "title": "North Korea Claims It Can Cure MERS, Ebola, And AIDS", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/north-korea-claims-it-can-cure-mers-ebola-and-aids-strong-immune-reviver-drug-339098", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/north-korea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This isn\u2019t the first time the hermit kingdom has claimed it has a cure for some of the worst viruses of this century.", "title": "North Korea Claims It Can Cure MERS, Ebola, And AIDS", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/north-korea-claims-it-can-cure-mers-ebola-and-aids-strong-immune-reviver-drug-339098", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/north-korea.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/north-korea.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-19T12:43:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T12:43:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This isn\u2019t the first time the hermit kingdom has claimed it has a cure for some of the worst viruses of this century."}, "article_summary": "The hermit kingdom of North Korea claims it has one single injection that can prevent and cure a variety of viruses.\nOn Friday, North Korea announced that it has the answer to some of the most pressing health issues of our century.\nThe authoritarian nation claims to have a single \u201cdrug\u201d that cures and prevents MERS, Ebola, SARS, and AIDS.\nAccording to the AP, North Korea also boasted about this drug during bird flu outbreaks in 2006 and 2013.\n\u201cMalicious virus infections like SARS, Ebola, and MERS are diseases that are related to immune systems, so they can be easily treated by Kumdang-2 injection drug, which is a strong immune reviver,\u201d the official Korean Central News Agency said, according to the Associated Press."}
