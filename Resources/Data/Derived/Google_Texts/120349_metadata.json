Donovan joined his colleagues in voting for high-profile bills to restrict the collection of telephone metadata, require congressional approval of a nuclear deal, and authorize the Defense Department budget.\n\nBut Donovan has already signaled that he will split with the more conservative wing, when the time comes.\n\n\u201cI might end up being in the minority of the majority,\u201d Donovan said, in an interview during the campaign.\n\nLast Tuesday, Donovan officially replaced Michael Grimm, who resigned the seat in January after pleading guilty to federal tax fraud, as New York City's lone Republican in Congress.\n\nThe job requires reconciling the needs of a moderate swing district, covering Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, with the increasingly conservative demands of the Republican majority in the House.\n\nGrimm won the seat as a Tea Party outsider in 2010, cultivating a brash ex-Marine persona, and loudly railing against President Obama and the Democratic incumbent.\n\nDonovan, genial and mild-mannered, played down his party affiliation during the campaign.\n\n\u201cI never conducted business as a Republican D.A.,\u201d he told Capital over lunch at Karl's Klipper, near the Staten Island ferry terminal.\n\nThat centrism has served him well on the island, where he moved up the ranks of the county party to run for district attorney, and twice won re-election by overwhelming margins, before declaring for the open congressional seat.\n\nDespite concerns from the national party, Donovan's stewardship of the Eric Garner case\u2014which ended without charges against a white police officer\u2014did little to damage his standing on the island. A January poll, conducted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, scared away the Democrats' most credible challengers, and Donovan coasted to victory with 60 percent of the vote.\n\nThe challenge for Donovan now is to maintain that standing in the district, and resist being stained by an unpopular Republican majority that has drifted increasingly to the right.\n\nDONOVAN WILL HAVE A MENTOR AND, PERHAPS, a model in the dean of the New York delegation.\n\nRep. Peter King introduced Donovan on the House floor after he was sworn in last Tuesday, calling him not only a \"true public servant, universally respected,\" but also a \"friend for many years.\" (King enjoyed a less friendly relationship with Grimm.) King and Donovan\u2014sons of a cop and a longshoreman, respectively\u2014both share an Irish background and working-class roots.\n\nKing has avoided serious challenges, from both parties, by positioning himself as an anti-Obama, fiscally conservative security hawk, who is also relatively pro-labor, mostly avoids divisive social issues, and occasionally encourages his party to compromise with Democrats.\n\nDonovan, so far, seems to be following that script.\n\nAt his victory party earlier this month, Donovan told a roomful of 200 cheering Republicans that his win was \"a message to President Obama, to Nancy Pelosi\u2014and yes, even to Bill de Blasio\u2014that their policies are wrong for our nation, they\u2019re wrong for our city, and they\u2019re they're wrong for the people of the 11th Congressional District.\"\n\nEarly in his campaign, Donovan suggested he supported some provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but grew more strident in his opposition in the closing week, telling WNYC's Brian Lehrer, \"I think we need to repeal the whole thing.\"\n\nFor most of the campaign, Donovan offered himself as something less of a firebrand.\n\n\"When you read a report that [says] \u2018the president\u2019s opposition in Congress\u2019\u2014I didn\u2019t realize we were supposed to be opponents,\u201d Donovan told Capital.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game we\u2019re playing,\u201d he said, later calling the unbending resistance of Washington Republicans to Obama \u201cridiculous.\"\n\n(The ambivalence tracks with the district, where voters went for John McCain in 2008, but backed Obama in 2012. King's district also went for Obama in 2012.)\n\nDonovan did his best to avoid social issues during the campaign, particularly abortion, which he opposes, after the issue plagued his 2010 run for attorney general.\n\nDemocrats are prepared to seize on the issue. After sitting out the campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made clear it will target Donovan in 2016, when the party expects to have Hillary Clinton leading the ballot.\n\nOn election night, the chairman of the DCCC, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, called Donovan a \"seat warmer,\" and the group promptly attacked Donovan after one of his first votes was in favor of a Republican bill to impose a new ban on abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nDonovan, for his part, has preferred to focus on less partisan issues like hurricane relief and national security.\n\nDonovan repeatedly promised during his campaign to fight for federal funding for Hurricane Sandy victims, despite what he said was \"an anti-New York sentiment in parts of our country.\u201d\n\nHis two press releases as a congressman have touted, respectively, his vote for congressional oversight of an Iranian nuclear deal, and a congratulatory message to Obama and U.S. Special Forces for killing an Islamic State leader in Syria.\n\nDonovan has yet to confront any of the intra-party differences that have divided the Republican conference in recent years. But he has already pledged to stand with King, who derides the \"crazies\" in his party and considers himself the keeper of its \"common-sense wing.\"\n\nAt a meeting in Washington in February, Donovan urged party leaders to help his campaign by passing a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, over objections from some Republicans who wanted to provoke a standoff with the president over his executive order on immigration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only 75 Republicans out of 246 that voted in favor of that,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nThe House leadership should be happy to have Donovan, who has signaled that he will back Speaker John Boehner in his intra-party struggle with more conservative members.\n\nEven before he was sworn in, Donovan said party leaders had been \u201chelpful, supportive, generous,\u201d and said \"everybody is really welcoming.\"\n\nBoehner may need his vote as the party stares down another potential increase in the debt ceiling, which conservative members have routinely refused to suport, despite the urging of Democrats and the broader business community.\n\nDonovan said he doesn\u2019t \u201cadvocate for increasing any spending,\u201d but that he also is not \u201can advocate for shutting down the government.\u201d\n\n\"People get Washington-ized a lot of times being down there for awhile, and forget that we\u2019re called members of the House of Representatives because we\u2019re meant to represent people,\" Donovan told Capital. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone that sends us down there to shut down government. Maybe to run it more efficiently but not to shut it down.\u201d\n\nAsked about joining King's crusade for a more sane party, Donovan said, \u201cI think Pete\u2019s been taking some blows. I think he just wants me to come down there to take some shots for him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/05/8567488/dan-donovans-dc-path-goes-right-down-middle", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20DanDonovan_26.png", "type": "article", "title": "Dan Donovan's D.C. path goes right down the middle"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Congressman emulates Pete King"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a4a\"", "article_summary": "\"When you read a report that [says] \u2018the president\u2019s opposition in Congress\u2019\u2014I didn\u2019t realize we were supposed to be opponents,\u201d Donovan told Capital.\nFor most of the campaign, Donovan offered himself as something less of a firebrand.\nDuring his first week in Congress, Dan Donovan was a reliable new member of the House Republican caucus.\nA January poll, conducted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, scared away the Democrats' most credible challengers, and Donovan coasted to victory with 60 percent of the vote.\nMaybe to run it more efficiently but not to shut it down.\u201dAsked about joining King's crusade for a more sane party, Donovan said, \u201cI think Pete\u2019s been taking some blows."}
