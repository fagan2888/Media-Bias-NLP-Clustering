The risk adjustment model under the Affordable Care Act is working to compensate insurers for covering higher-cost enrollees, at least in part, a report from the American Academy of Actuaries says.

“Insurers receiving risk adjustment payments generally tended to have higher loss ratios than insurers making risk adjustment payments,” the report reads. “This is consistent with the program operating as intended, by shifting funds from insurers with low-cost enrollees to insurers with high-cost enrollees.”

The law’s risk adjustment policy transfers funds from plans with low-risk enrollees to plans with higher-risk enrollees. The policy has been in place for the past year.

Insurers can have different experiences with risk adjustment, the actuaries say. “More research is needed to better understand the extent to which different financial outcomes among insurers are due to different premium levels, risk adjustment, or other factors such as the types of plans offered and relative administrative expenses.”
