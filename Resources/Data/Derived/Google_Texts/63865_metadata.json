In remarks to the Sitka Chamber of Commerce last week, Jeff Comer said he\u2019s developing a strategy to expand Sitka Community Hospital into a regional health care provider.\n\nDownloadable audio.\n\nListening to Jeff Comer makes you think of the old palindrome \u201cA man, a plan, a canal, Panama!\u201d\n\nSitka Community Hospital\u2019s CEO has been on the job since September. He recently described his vision to the Sitka Chamber of Commerce (11-26-14).\n\nHe\u2019s a man with a plan, and a hospital.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the dominant health care provider in Southeast Alaska, and I\u2019ve just mapped out a plan for how I think we can get to that. It\u2019s going to take a few years. It\u2019s not going to happen immediately, but we are starting to move in that direction. We have recruitment in place, we have the walk-in clinic across the street that we\u2019ll put into place. We\u2019ve got telemedicine coming on line in a May-June timeline. So we\u2019re heading in that direction.\u201d\n\nComer comes from Phoenix, Arizona. He\u2019s managed 12 major hospitals over his career \u2014 and he\u2019s the child of a professional hospital administrator. He told the chamber of commerce that Sitka represented a particular challenge. Although he considers the hospital to be \u201ca gem,\u201d he also believes it\u2019s one of a dying breed.\n\n\u201cIt is getting very difficult to survive as a standalone hospital. Very few standalone hospitals are standalone anymore. They\u2019re part of bigger systems. That\u2019s not what our board wants; that\u2019s not what our city wants; it\u2019s not what I want for this hospital. I want this hospital to stay standalone. We do not want to merge it or expand it.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t want to expand the hospital\u2019s capacity. He calls it \u201cexternal expansion.\u201d It includes recruiting more providers, setting up a walk-in urgent-care clinic in Sitka, and opening clinics staffed by physicians\u2019 assistants, nurse practitioners, and physical therapists \u2014 in places like the local pharmacy, or even the Hames Center.\n\nComer appeared on KCAW\u2019s Morning Interview the day after his chamber presentation and elaborated on this idea.\n\n\u201cPart of the model, where I see us going in the future, is focused more on the mid-level providers. They can provide 90-percent of the health care that people need, and we can do it in a community-oriented setting. So to add to that, we\u2019re looking at several clinics downtown \u2014 one facility we\u2019re looking at right across the street from the Westmark, where we\u2019ll have a physician assistant located. People on lunch, morning breaks, can go right down and see that person, get that primary care, get their lab work done, and then get back to work without waiting a couple of hours to see a doctor.\u201d\n\nBesides adding face-to-face providers, Comer says Sitka\u2019s hospital is expanding its virtual care. He says telemedicine will be online by early summer.\n\n\u201cWe will have full specialty coverage for our ER physicians, so if they need a consult with cardiology or endocrinology, it will be a live feed, where that patient will actually see that physician in Providence in Anchorage, and that physician will be looking at the patient, reviewing all the vitals, all of the clinical information, and working with our local providers to provide the best possible care.\u201d\n\nTelemedicine is key component of Comer\u2019s regional strategy. Sitka, he says, needs a dermatologist, but can\u2019t afford to keep one. But Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Juneau \u2014 for example \u2014 could easily keep a dermatologist busy, and thanks to telemedicine, that specialist could live anywhere in the region. The same is true of other specialties \u2014 even surgical specialties like orthopedics \u2014 where significant follow-up care is needed.\n\nComer\u2019s vision is definitely a new direction for Sitka\u2019s local hospital. It was only a few years ago that Sitkans contemplated the idea of absorbing the 12-bed facility into the neighboring Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital, which is run by the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium.\n\nHe was asked about this by a member of the chamber audience: Can Sitka continue to support two hospitals?\n\n\u201cIn the long term I don\u2019t think we really can. It is very expensive to duplicate OB-GYN services. It\u2019s very expensive to have two operating rooms. SEARHC taking all patients now has had an impact on us. So long-term, I don\u2019t think we can \u2014 where we are today. That\u2019s why I\u2019m putting all this together to expand outside of Sitka.\u201d\n\nComer said that \u201con the department level\u201d Sitka Community Hospital and SEARHC remain close allies, but at the strategic level \u2014 not so much. Although he didn\u2019t rule out partnership in the future, Comer told the chamber, \u201cI am not interested \u2014 and the board is not interested \u2014 in a joint venture right now.\u201d\n\nRachel Waldholz and Melissa Marconi Wentzel contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "MasterSlider 2.12.2 - Responsive Touch Image Slider", "og": {"site_name": "KCAW", "description": "Sitka\u2019s new hospital CEO is thinking big -- really big.
