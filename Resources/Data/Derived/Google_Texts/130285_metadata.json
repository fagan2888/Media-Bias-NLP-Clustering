The two announced the strategic partnership today, saying that it would increase local access and quality of care.\n\nLike Ochsner\u2019s other partnerships, no money is exchanging hands and the organizations will retain their independent identities.\n\nThe CHRISTUS network has clinics and hospitals in Shreveport-Bossier, Alexandria, Natchitoches, Coushatta, Mamou and Lake Charles.\n\nAccording to the two organizations, they will build a telemedicine program with services like TeleStroke and TeleNICU in order to increase access to services across CHRISTUS\u2019s service regions in northern and central Louisiana.\n\nThey also plan to launch patient-focused initiatives to improve and treat chronic diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes, partly through developing employer-based health care services.\n\nCHRISTUS spokesperson Julie Hollingsworth said the organizations are still working out the details. She said the partnership would allow them to better gather data on the populations they serve, allowing them to come up with creative solutions to chronic disease.\n\n\u201cThis is the future of health care,\u201d Hollingsworth said. \u201cThis gives us a larger expanse of knowledge, rather than working in our own silos.\u201d\n\nThe partnership follows a national trend of health care consolidation spurred in part by the Affordable Care Act, which demands leaner hospital systems that provide better services at a lower cost.\n\nOchsner has over the past year announced partnerships with St. Tammany Parish Hospital, Terrebonne General Medical Center, St. James Parish Hospital and Lafayette General.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CHRISTUS Health Louisiana is the latest hospital network to partner with Ochsner Health System.
