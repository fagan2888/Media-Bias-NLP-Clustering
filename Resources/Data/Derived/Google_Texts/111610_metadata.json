Justice Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to published reports in Argentina, the country\u2019s executive branch also must approve the extradition. Sonnenfeld has a pending request for political asylum in Argentina.\n\nSonnenfeld called 911 dispatchers in the early morning of Jan. 1, 2002, a few months after the terror attacks, claiming that his wife had shot herself in the head.\n\nDenver police, believing the scene was staged, arrested Sonnenfeld that morning. But prosecutors in the office of former Denver District Attorney Bill Ritter, who later became governor, dismissed the charges several months later because of insufficient evidence at the time.\n\nThe following year, murder charges were refiled against Sonnenfeld after Denver homicide detectives developed new evidence against him.\n\nBy then, Sonnenfeld had moved to Argentina and married an Argentine translator and college student.\n\nSonnenfeld was held for seven months in Villa Devoto, an infamous Buenos Aires prison until a federal judge rejected the U.S. extradition request.\n\nSonnenfeld was released and subsequently wrote a book, \u201cEl Perseguido,\u201d or \u201cThe Hunted,\u201d in which he chronicled what he called ongoing efforts by the U.S. government to silence him because of his video. The book is in its second printing.\n\nIn prior e-mails with The Denver Post, Sonnenfeld said he publicized his story to protect his family after a botched attempted kidnapping of his second wife, Paula Sonnenfeld.\n\nThe couple has twin daughters.\n\nHe has appeared on international news programs. Despite the murder charge, he has won the support of numerous Argentine and international human rights organizations as well as Adolfo Esquivel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980. Sonnenfeld has been compared to James Bond in articles, including a 10-page spread in the popular magazine Gente.\n\nIn extensive e-mails to The Post, Sonnenfeld denied having anything to do with the death of his first wife, a Denver advertising executive. He claims that she shot herself shortly after the couple returned home from a New Year\u2019s Eve soiree.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Argentine court OKs extradition of man facing Denver murder charge", "title": "Argentine court OKs extradition of man facing Denver murder charge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/argentine-court-oks-extradition-of-man-facing-denver-murder-charge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__7284446p1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__7284446p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T11:16:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:05:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0119\"", "article_summary": "The following year, murder charges were refiled against Sonnenfeld after Denver homicide detectives developed new evidence against him.\nIn extensive e-mails to The Post, Sonnenfeld denied having anything to do with the death of his first wife, a Denver advertising executive.\nArgentina\u2019s highest court has approved the extradition of a former Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman who claims the U.S. government helped frame him for murder.\nKurt Sonnenfeld says video he took of ground zero after the 2001 terrorist attacks proves U.S. complicity.\nIn prior e-mails with The Denver Post, Sonnenfeld said he publicized his story to protect his family after a botched attempted kidnapping of his second wife, Paula Sonnenfeld."}
