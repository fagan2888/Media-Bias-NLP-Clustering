It features banjo music, a rhyming cowboy and bright colors, a local paper describes.\n\nBut not all are impressed with the new approach.\n\nCully Stimson, manager of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s National Security Law Program, calls the effort \u201ca complete waste of taxpayer money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no safe way to smoke marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cAs more and more data becomes available from Colorado, it is becoming increasingly clear this radical experiment in legalization has been a complete disaster.\u201d\n\nIn October, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, told a local paper the state\u2019s legalization was \u201creckless,\u201d saying marijuana use harms long-term memory and the state shouldn\u2019t encourage unhealthy practices.\n\nState Rep. Jonathan Singer, the sponsor of the bill that implemented the weed tax, said the new campaign balances education with safe use.\n\n\u201cWe need to start treating marijuana like the drug it is, not the drug some fear it to be,\u201d he told USA Today.\n\nThe campaign is funded through the sales tax on marijuana purchases. It follows a state survey finding only 27 percent of residents knew it is illegal to smoke weed in public, and 23 percent knew the legal age of purchase is 21.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cJust say no\u201d is a thing of the past for Colorado\u2019s marijuana users.
