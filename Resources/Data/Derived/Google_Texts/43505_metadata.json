For Kristol, this is as much an exercise in personal-brand maintenance as it is a policy argument.\n\nOne of Kristol\u2019s earliest claims to fame as a Republican operative was his 1993 memo to Republican leaders urging them to kill \u201cHillarycare.\u201d It was as much a political argument as anything else, describing the plan as a \u201cserious political threat to the Republican Party\u201d to which the rightful response was \u201cunqualified political defeat.\u201d The Kristol memo has gone down in memory as one of the documents, along with Betsy McCaughey\u2019s \u201cNo Exit\u201d piece in The New Republic, that took down the Clinton health care reform bill. (The real history is a little more complicated than that. Passing comprehensive health care reform is hard!)\n\nLike a successful Beltway #brand, Kristol recognizes the 1993 memo as central to his biography and self-consciously reboots the \u201cKill the ____\u201d framework whenever new opportunities arise. In June 2009, nine months before the Democratic Congress was able to push through a health care reform plan, Kristol wrote an editorial calling on Congress to kill the bill. \u201cResist the temptation,\u201d he urged Republicans. \u201cThis is no time to pull punches. Go for the kill.\u201d In July 2013, Kristol, this time sharing a byline with National Review editor Rich Lowry, again implored House Republicans to \u201ckill the bill,\u201d meaning the Senate\u2019s bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n\nAny time there\u2019s the possibility of a major achievement under a Democratic president, Bill Kristol dusts off the old \u201cKill\u201d template and plugs in some new proper nouns. His record of success is mixed. He helped, to whatever extent, get the 1993 health care reform bill scrapped, but Republicans couldn\u2019t block passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. House Republicans never took up the Senate\u2019s bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, though it\u2019s not like they needed a shove from Kristol to arrive at obstinacy there.\n\nWhether he\u2019s fanning latent opposition to a proposal or just riding the opposition that already exists, Kristol does usually get his way in terms of uniting Republican opposition \u2014 and hardening Democratic support. The ACA only passed because Democrats held a supermajority in the Senate; the final version of that bill won zero Republican votes in either house of Congress.\n\nThe problem for Kristol\u2019s \u201ckill the Iran deal\u201d effort, though, is that polarization is the opposite of what he needs in order to get his way. Perhaps it\u2019s escaped him, but in order to \u201ckill\u201d this particular deal, Congress first has to pass a bill \u2014 the Corker-Menendez congressional review bill, specifically \u2014 and that\u2019s going to require a veto-proof majority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The trigger-happy neocon has found yet another achievement he wants to torpedo.
