Options are limited, but available Here at Land Line we rely on Jon Osburn, the skipper of the Spirit of the American Trucker tour truck, to help keep us apprised of what our members are talking about on the road. Jon says lately he\u2019s had a ton of members asking questions about health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 specifically, how can they avoid the tax penalty for next year, and what can they do if they still need some kind of insurance this year.\n\n\n\nWhile the open enrollment deadline ended on Jan. 31, there are still some options for getting health insurance coverage for medical needs, according to Rick Welsh, president of Welsh and Associates, a Kansas City-based health care and insurance consulting business that works with OOIDA\u2019s Medical Benefits Group.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are really two issues here \u2013 getting the insurance coverage to protect yourself from financial catastrophe, and then there\u2019s also the issue of what you need to have this for tax reasons to avoid a penalty,\u201d Welsh said in a recent interview with \u201cLand Line Now.\u201d\n\n\n\nWelsh says that insurance providers are offering short-term medical policies to address the first issue, but notes that the short term plans do not satisfy the requirements necessary to avoid a tax penalty.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat it does do is it gives you insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something goes wrong, you can go to the hospital and present your card. All the major insurance carriers have short-term medical policies.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. While the ACA policies are guaranteed-issue (meaning you can\u2019t be turned down), the short-term medical policies do ask some medical questions about catastrophic medical coverage.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just not wanting to pick up folks that have consciously blown off buying insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have anything major wrong with you, they\u2019re not going to accept you. The answer will be no.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to avoiding having to pay the tax penalty for not having health insurance, or for buying a plan that\u2019s not ACA-compliant, the only way to avoid such a penalty is to have a qualifying event occur, which will allow you to purchase a qualified marketplace plan.\n\n\n\nFor those folks that have just made the decision or just fell asleep during the open enrollment and did not get signed up, there isn\u2019t anything they can do right now to obtain coverage that will get them out of a tax penalty.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose who did not enroll in a qualifying plan during the open enrollment period will be unable to purchase health insurance in 2016 unless they have a qualifying event such as loss of job, marriage, divorce, birth of a child or moving to another state.\n\n\n\nWelsh says that in a situation of loss of coverage due to separation of employment, a person will get a Certificate of Credible Coverage from their prior carrier, which must be provided at the time of enrollment. If they did not have insurance through that employer, they will not qualify for a special enrollment.\n\n\n\nIn the case of moving from one state to another, insurance companies will ask for a utility bill from their prior residence and a new utility bill for their new residence.\n\n\n\nA recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that the average individual penalty for not having insurance will rise to $969, an increase of 47 percent over the previous year.\n\n\n\nThe ACA mandates enrollment in a qualified health insurance plan for most Americans. For those not exempt by law, failure to do so will result in a penalty assessed on your federal income taxes. The tax penalty is increasing to 2.5 percent of your yearly household income for not enrolling in a qualified plan during 2016. The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a Bronze insurance plan. Fees are paid as a part of the filing process for federal income tax returns.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be paying $3,000 to $4,000 in penalties, so you might as well be buying the insurance,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly the point (of the penalty).\n\n\n\nEven if you have a qualifying event and are able to sign up for an ACA-compliant plan outside the open enrollment date, it\u2019s still possible to have to pay a penalty for the months you weren\u2019t covered. The amount would be one-twelfth of the total penalty for each month you didn\u2019t have coverage.\n\n\n\nThe Medical Benefits Group is available to offer advice and guidance to members about the ACA and health insurance in general.\n\n\n\nConsumers with questions are encouraged to contact the HHS call center at 800-318-2596 or visit the HealthCare.gov website where they can find local help.
