Officials have no public explanation on how the fraudsters obtained that information for this scam, which started last fall.\n\nHang up on these taxmen tricksters, and you can expect a follow-up email with similar threats \u2013 or another phone call in which the same or another imposter uses a different name, this time posing as local law enforcement and threatening impending arrest for failure to pay the supposedly owed money.\n\nThat\u2019s what recently happened to Tim Leslie of Minnesota, who received a call from alleged IRS agent Sean White. The caller claimed that Leslie improperly filed his taxes and that unless he settled the debt, \u201cone copy of this case will be sent to your local sheriff department and one copy will be sent to your employer where you work right now to inform them of your fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Leslie is currently chief deputy of a sheriff\u2019s department and seeking election to be county sheriff. He called a friend who works as an IRS agent, and an agency investigator told him that some 60,000 Americans have been contacted in this fast-moving scam, \u201cand some folks lost over $10,000 to these people,\u201d Leslie told Minnesota TV station KARE.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nThat\u2019s a threefold increase in reported contacts since March, when Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) Russell George issued a renewed warning about this calling scam. At that time, frightened taxpayers had already paid at least $1 million to scammers.\n\nWhat to do if you contacted by tax imposters?\n\nDespite possible frightening but fraudulent follow-up contact, hang up on phone calls and report the incident to the TIGTA (phone: 800-366-4484) and Federal Trade Commission, which also issued a recent warning about this scam.\n\nIf you receive an email purporting to be from the IRS or Treasury Department, forward it to phishing@irs.gov without clicking on any links or attachments, which may unleash malware. Neither agency ever sends unsolicited emails to taxpayers.\n\nIf you really owe taxes or there\u2019s been a problem with filing your returns, the IRS will notify you by U.S. mail \u2013 not telephone. If you get a letter, call the IRS at 800-829-1040. Do not respond to callback numbers provided in robocalls.\n\nKnow that the IRS doesn\u2019t seek payment by prepaid debit card or wire transfer. But scammers prefer those methods because they are hard to trace and can be redeemed anywhere in the world.\n\nOccasionally, scammers in this ruse may ask for credit card payment, but don\u2019t be fooled: The IRS doesn\u2019t request plastic payments by telephone.\n\nIf scammers recite a portion of your SSN, consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file with the three major credit reporting bureaus to reduce risk of identity theft.\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network. You\u2019ll receive email alerts with tips and resources to help you spot and avoid identity theft and fraud, and gain access to a network of experts, law enforcement and people in your community who will keep you up to date on the latest scams in your area.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "In the four months since it made history as \u201cthe largest scam of its kind,\u201d a now infamous IRS imposter telephone scam has escalated with a recent new spin.
