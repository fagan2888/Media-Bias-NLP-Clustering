So much for that.\n\nMatt Lewis has already written the article I\u2019d planned to write for the new year about how the Left and Right have now devolved into identity-politics tribalism. In so doing, they\u2019ve left me a man without a party.\n\nI\u2019d resigned myself to the tribalism of the Left: The Starbucks voters (\u201cOf course I\u2019m a Democrat\u2014I\u2019ve got the radio in my Prius pre-set to nothing but NPR!\u201d); The \u201cSex Uber Alles\u201d gender and/or orientation crowd; Black Americans who for historic\u2014and completely understandable\u2014reasons give 95 percent of their votes to Democrats without any serious consideration of the governance that results; etc.\n\nFor me, conservatism has always been a rejection of identity in favor of ideas: Free speech, free markets, small government, individual opportunity and responsibility, and so forth. I\u2019m a MLK conservative\u2014all \u201ccontent of character,\u201d no interest in \u201ccolor of skin.\u201d\n\nWhen Republicans whine every other November about the fact that our voters can\u2019t be rounded up on buses and sent to the polls the same way Democrats can, I beam with pride. Reason, logic, and facts aren\u2019t related to race or sex. Conservatives aren\u2019t just right\u2014we\u2019re better people for thinking our way into what is right.\n\nThe Left Has Tribalized Us, Too Or used to be, anyway. Lewis fears\u2014and I agree\u2014that these principles are being abandoned as a new political tribe arises on the Right: Tribe Trump.\n\nI fear we may be entering a new stage where there are essentially two distinct political tribes: One tribe consists of minorities and educated elites, while the other tribe increasingly consists of working-class whites\u2026 Disagreements about ideological principles, or even policy preferences, seem to be taking a back seat to identity politics. It doesn\u2019t matter what you believe in so much as what grouping you belong to, and how willing you are to fight for the sliver of America you represent. 2015 was the year of tribalism\u2026\n\nConservatives once hated identity politics and victimhood\u2014but then again, we once supported free trade, too. Perhaps our disdain for tribalism was always a high-minded, yet doomed, effort to suppress the natural, carnal state of a fallen humanity. You and I may view politics as being about ideas and human flourishing, but a lot of people believe it\u2019s really about power\u2014about making sure scarce resources are allocated to \u201cour\u201d people.\n\nBut what about people like me who don\u2019t have a \u201cpeople?\u201d Where does that leave us?\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to join the liars on the Left who smear all Trump supporters as racists and xenophobes. But I\u2019m also not going to deny there\u2019s a \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us white people?\u201d element among his support. It\u2019s one thing to support enforcing America\u2019s immigration laws (I do) and deporting people for being here illegally (we should). It\u2019s another to oppose immigration because you think there\u2019s something wrong with Mexicans.\n\nAmerica Is About Ideas, Not Race or Class Unlike many of the Trump fans I hear from, I don\u2019t care that America will become a minority-white country. I care about whether the next generation believes in the American ideas of liberty, opportunity, and equality under the law.\n\nUnlike many of the Trump fans I hear from, I don\u2019t care that America will become a minority-white country. I want a tax policy that promotes the most wealth and most jobs for the most people. I don\u2019t care if those jobs go to white guys or Hispanic transgenders. I want to replace the government-run school system, not because it failed a white redneck kid like me (it did), but because every motivated student who escapes an academic cesspool for education success will become a happy, productive, low-crime, taxpaying citizen.\n\nI want to fight Islamists, not because they\u2019re Muslims, but because they\u2019re anti-rational, murderous loonies who are, alas, inspired by a major world religion that still refuses to reform itself.\n\nThese are the ideas I \u201cidentify\u201d with. I honestly believe that if those of us who share these ideas will reach out in smart ways to our fellow Americans of all races/genders/incomes/etc., we can persuade a majority to join us.\n\nWe Really Can Persuade People Many people on the talk-radio Right don\u2019t agree. Some never really believed in small government to begin with and always wanted a government that used its power to help \u201cUs\u201d over \u201cThem.\u201d\n\nTune in the typical radio talk show on any given weekday\u2026and imagine the opposite of what you\u2019re hearing. Other Republicans have simply surrendered to what they believe is the inevitability of tribalism. Persuasion, they believe, is futile because there\u2019s nobody\u2019s left to persuade, nobody outside the Tribe who\u2019s willing to listen. \u201cIdentity Politics Thunderdome\u201d is going down right now, and the only thing to do is fight like Trump to be the one man who leaves.\n\nThese doomsday anti-democrats may be right. But I don\u2019t think so. I believe my fellow citizens are persuadable\u2014if you\u2019re willing to talk to them in a way designed to persuade. If you want to know what that conversation sounds like, tune in the typical radio talk show on any given weekday\u2026and imagine the opposite of what you\u2019re hearing.\n\nImagine a conversation about women and Obamacare that doesn\u2019t involve calling college girls \u201csluts.\u201d Imagine a conversation about policing and government power that doesn\u2019t dismiss the deaths of young black men with \u201cthey were asking for it.\u201d Imagine talking about illegal immigration from a \u201cfairness for American workers\u201d standpoint and not the \u201cthey\u2019re rapists, they\u2019re killers\u201d angle.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 05 Jan 2016 07:49:13 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "For me, conservatism has always been a rejection of identity in favor of ideas.
