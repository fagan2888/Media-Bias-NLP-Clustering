The Agenda How small-business issues are shaping politics and policy.

Our recent interview with Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel about his provocative prediction that most employers will abandon health coverage by 2025 struck a nerve with You’re The Boss readers.

It came as no surprise that Dr. Emanuel’s claim, first made in his new book, “Reinventing American Health Care,” would be swept up in the broader political and ideological debate about the Affordable Care Act. But in their many comments, readers raised interesting questions, and we took some of them back to Dr. Emanuel in another conversation that appears, edited and condensed, below.

It’s worth noting that among those readers who identified themselves as small-business owners, there was little disagreement: Most expressed a strong desire to get out of the health insurance business. “I have provided health insurance for 30 years and am dropping it in 60 days,” wrote J of New York. To his employees, he continued, health care costs are an abstraction, “and my contributions to it are not clearly recognized. Now they will be.”

Q.

Your prediction provoked a good bit of anger directed both at employers and the Affordable Care Act. But it seems to me that the argument you’re making is that if this happens, it’s going to be because employees aren’t looking to employers to offer insurance.

A.

Right. It’s not because of anything in the law. It’s about the dynamic between employers and employees. Employers react to the market. Actually, after the interview appeared a colleague of mine wrote me and said, “You know, my sister would love to be able to go into the exchange, because she can get a better deal for herself, but her employer’s not going that direction, at least not now.”

Q.

There’s a lot of skepticism that the policies on the exchanges are as good as the policies that are available to groups, particularly to large groups.



A.

Yeah. The predicate, the assumption, behind my claim is that the exchanges are going to get better, that they’re going to be desirable shopping places, the options are going to be highly desirable, there’s going to be more choice for people. If the products available on the exchange are not equivalent to what responsible large private employers are doing, they’re not going to send their workers there. It’s just that simple.

Q.

What has to happen for exchange plans to be able to compete with group plans?

A.

I do think the exchanges can offer better products. The exchange is not just the website – it includes things like product development, working with the insurance company to get better product out there. But insurers aren’t going to develop these plans unless they perceive there’s a market there for them. And they’re not going to perceive there’s a market unless they can be sure that it’s a nice shopping experience and that people really want those products on the exchange. So I think this is a chicken-and-egg problem.

Q.

Do 7.1 million enrollees help?

A.

Yeah. Especially since it was so unexpected. It says there’s this huge pent-up demand out there for affordable health insurance. Despite not having two months at the start, getting it screwed up, people predicting the demise of health care reform, Americans signed up in droves.

Q.

One reader came back to us with a hypothetical: a $4,000 insurance benefit that an employer converts to a cash raise — but when you account for the taxes for the employee and the penalty for not offering insurance, that $4,000 now costs the company $7,800. What do you say to that math?

A.

Yeah, I think he’s got another good point against me, and Mark Pauly, my colleague, has pointed out that there’s a lot of value in employers providing the insurance, in just this way, that it’s going to be hard to replace.

Q.

On top of that, a lot of people are skeptical that employers who drop coverage will actually compensate their employees with a raise.

A.

Yeah, I know, the American public is extremely skeptical of that. But every economic analysis that’s been done of health insurance with employers and wages shows that it is replaced almost dollar for dollar. It’s not replaced on Day One necessarily, but over a very short period of time, a few years, people get the money, in terms of higher wages. And similarly, one should say that when employers give you a richer health insurance package, that usually corresponds over time to a slower increase in wages.

Q.

Do you worry that this could become a mechanism for employers to offload the rising cost of health insurance?

A.

Yes, exactly, I worry about that. From what I can tell — and here I’m getting out of my comfort zone — what employers are worried about more than the actual increase (although they keep claiming it’s the increase) is the unpredictability. Organizing their planning is harder when the costs each year are so unpredictable.

Q.

The other day, Robert Gibbs, a former Obama administration adviser, told an audience that the employer mandate would never be implemented — it would be killed off. What do you think of that?

A.

No way. He’s wrong. Period.

Q.

If employers drop health insurance and send people to the exchanges, do you see that in any way as a step toward a single-payer system?

A.

No! There are some Americans that want single-payer. All I can say is the majority don’t. Americans aren’t into the single-payer game. It ain’t happening. We barely got the Affordable Care Act through. We certainly would not have gotten a single-payer proposal through. Every responsible liberal group in 2009, 2010 said, look, the worst option is to do nothing. People understood very clearly that between doing nothing and reforming the system, it was important to reform the system.

Q.

The last time we spoke, you said that nobody in the administration thought through how the Affordable Care Act might affect businesses. Looking back now, should there have been someone in the White House who was really focused on this from the perspective of business owners?

A.

Look, we talked to a lot of business owners. We talked to lots of consultants who deal with businesses. I think I had like 70-some odd meetings with various groups. I took so many meetings, people thought I was crazy. The fact of the matter is that no one can have perfect clarity as to how things are going to unfold. Just take a simple example: If I had told you three months ago we’re going to pass 7 million people signing up on the exchange, you would have taken that bet, and I would’ve looked like an idiot at that point. That’s just three months ago. I’m making a prediction for 11 years from now, and almost 15 years after the passage of the Affordable Care. O.K.? Let’s be humble, and let’s be a little more reasonable about the accuracy of predictions.

Q.

How big a problem will it be if Hobby Lobby wins its Supreme Court case, and employers are able to carve out exemptions from the health law based on religious views?

A.

I think this opens a huge can of worms as to what anyone’s religion is or what the religious dictates are, and how those connect with health services. There are lots of religions that don’t believe in circumcision — we’re not paying for circumcision. Or, we don’t believe in premarital sex, so we’re not going to cover the cervical cancer treatment, because the only way you get it is through premarital sex. My religion doesn’t like smoking – all right, we’re not paying for emphysema care or lung cancer care. Where is the end of this?
