(C-SPAN)\n\n\u201cWe are not allowed to negotiate drug prices. Can you believe it? We pay about $300 billion more than we are supposed to, than if we negotiated the price. So there\u2019s $300 billion on day one we solve.\u201d\n\n\u2013Donald Trump, remarks at Plymouth State University, Holderness, N.H., Feb. 7, 2016\n\n\u201cSo I said to myself wow, let me do some numbers. If we competitively bid drugs in the United States, we can save as much as $300 billion a year.\u201d\n\n\u2013Trump, remarks in Manchester, N.H., Feb. 8\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the largest drug buyer in the world. We don\u2019t negotiate. We don\u2019t negotiate. You pay practically the same for the country as if you go into a drug store and buy the drugs. If we negotiated the price of drugs, Joe, we\u2019d save $300 billion a year.\u201d\n\n\u2013Trump, interview on MSNBC, Feb. 17\n\nReining in the cost of prescription drugs has become a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBoth former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) have proposed detailed plans to control prescription-drug prices, with both calling for Medicare to negotiate directly with prescription-drug companies to get lower prices \u2014 something currently prohibited by law. Republican candidates have also decried high prescription-drug costs, though generally their policy proposals have been thinner.\n\nDeveloper Donald Trump may be the Republican front-runner but, like the Democrats, he also says he wants to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies. In fact, he makes the bold claim that he would save $300 billion a year. Is this even remotely possible?\n\nThe Facts\n\nTo put Trump\u2019s $300-billion-a-year claim in perspective, let\u2019s first note that Sanders cites a 2013 estimate from the Center for Economic and Policy Research that negotiated drug prices would result in savings to Medicare of between $230 billion to $541 billion over 10 years.\n\nSo for virtually the same policy, Sanders is claiming savings averaging $38 billion a year \u2014 and Trump is promising a figure eight times larger. (Clinton offers no estimated savings.)\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? It\u2019s unclear, because as usual the Trump campaign refuses to respond to any queries about Trump\u2019s numbers.\n\nCEPR based its estimates by comparing the per capita cost of drugs in the United States with the costs in Canada (which pays about 70 cents for each dollar spent in the United States) and Denmark (35 cents). CEPR then applied the difference to the anticipated costs of Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program between 2013 to 2021. Thus Canada represents the low range of the estimated saving ($230 billion over 10 years) and Denmark the high end ($541 billion over 10 years).\n\nWhy would these numbers be so much lower than Trump\u2019s estimate? Well, for one thing, total spending in Medicare Part D (prescription drugs) in 2014 was $78 billion. So Trump, in effect, is claiming to save $300 billion a year on a $78 billion program. That\u2019s like turning water into wine.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump is being sloppy and when he discusses Medicare, he really means to say he would force government-led pricing on all prescription drugs. But the numbers don\u2019t add up that way either.\n\nIn fact, depending on the source you consult, total annual spending on prescription drugs in the United States is between $298 billion a year to $423 billion. So that would mean Trump is claiming that he can eliminate virtually any cost to prescription drugs. It would suddenly be free!\n\nWe should note that Sanders says that his single-payer plan would result in annual drug savings of $241 billion a year, a figure that was reduced after Vox pointed out that his original estimate would result in negative drug costs. At least Sanders responded to criticism.\n\nSanders\u2019s broader plan is for overhauling the entire health-care system to a government-run model. Warren Gunnels, his senior policy adviser, says Sanders also would eventually set up a system under which the government buys patents from drug companies as soon as new drugs are produced, so generic brands can be immediately produced.\n\nAs far as we know, Trump has not said he would impose such radical changes on the health-care system. He just pledges to replace the Affordable Care Act with \u201csomething terrific.\u201d\n\nWhether the government bargaining for Medicare drugs would even yield savings of $38 billion a year is certainly debatable. The Obama administration, in its 2017 budget plan, includes a proposal that would allow the Secretary for Health and Human Services to negotiate with manufacturers for high\u2010cost drugs and biologics covered under Part D, but says there would be no budget impact. A 2015 study, by researchers at Carleton University and Public Citizen, estimated annual savings of $15-16 billion if negotiations resulted in the same prices for drugs paid by Medicaid or the Veterans Health Administration, which currently get rebates.\n\nThere could also be unintended consequences. Kenneth Thorpe, chairman of health policy at Emory University\u2019s School of Public Health, says that the United States currently subsidizes the world\u2019s drug research, since European and Canadian price controls have discouraged investment and research. He worries a similar system would lead to less innovation.\n\nDean Baker, who wrote CEPR\u2019s report, disputes that analysis. \u201cMuch of the research now being undertaken goes to developing copycat drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf drug prices were structured so that a breakthrough drug carried a high price and copycats were priced much lower, we would see far less research of copy cat drugs, but possibly the same or more of breakthrough drugs. \u2026. As an economist, I find it utterly absurd that we are paying thousands of dollars for drugs that might sell for $10 or $20 a prescription in a free market.\u201d\n\nBaker agreed, however: \u201cClearly the Trump numbers do not make much sense.\u201d\n\nUpdate, March 4: In the March 3 debate, Trump for the first time said that his statement that he would save $300 billion on prescription drugs in Medicare actually was supposed to mean negotiating for a range of products in the Medicare system. But the $300 billion pledge doesn\u2019t make much sense either. Projected Medicare spending in 2016 is $560 billion, so Trump unrealistically is claiming he will cut spending nearly 55 percent.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nOnce again, we are confronted with a nonsense figure from the mouth of Donald Trump. He is either claiming to save four times the entire cost of the Medicare prescription drug system \u2013 or he is claiming to make prescription drugs free for every American. Neither is possible, so he once again earns Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you believe The Donald's math, he will virtually eliminate the cost of prescription drugs in the United States", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "If you believe The Donald's math, he will virtually eliminate the cost of prescription drugs in the United States", "title": "Trump\u2019s truly absurd claim he would save $300 billion a year on prescription drugs", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/18/trumps-truly-absurd-claim-he-would-save-300-billion-a-year-on-prescription-drugs/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/17/National-Politics/Images/Botsford_TRUMP_SC_16_02_17_07081455726910.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/18/trumps-truly-absurd-claim-he-would-save-300-billion-a-year-on-prescription-drugs/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "donald trump; trump 2016; trump for president; trump prescription drugs; sanders drugs; sanders single payer; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump; trump 2016; trump for president; trump prescription drugs; sanders drugs; sanders single payer; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker"}, "article_summary": "In fact, he makes the bold claim that he would save $300 billion a year.\nSo Trump, in effect, is claiming to save $300 billion a year on a $78 billion program.\nIf we negotiated the price of drugs, Joe, we\u2019d save $300 billion a year.\u201d\u2013Trump, interview on MSNBC, Feb. 17Reining in the cost of prescription drugs has become a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nWe pay about $300 billion more than we are supposed to, than if we negotiated the price.\nHe is either claiming to save four times the entire cost of the Medicare prescription drug system \u2013 or he is claiming to make prescription drugs free for every American."}
