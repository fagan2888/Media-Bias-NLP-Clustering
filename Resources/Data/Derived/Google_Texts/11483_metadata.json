A fitting end to an 18-year career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely (feeling) a whole lot of emotions. The biggest emotion is happiness. It\u2019s been an incredible career,\u201d said the 34-year-old from Massachusetts who finished 11th in the 2010 Winter Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s been so many ups and downs, and honestly, it\u2019s been no stone left unturned. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else I could have done and I\u2019m proud of my career and happy to move on to a new adventure.\u201d\n\nCook did not appear distraught or even sad. The ex-gymnast has jumped in aerials since 1995, earning eight World Cup podiums and five National Championship wins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been an adventure, these last 20 years,\u201d she said.\n\nCook advanced through qualifiers and the first round of the three-round finals Friday night. She laid back on the landing of her back full double full \u2014 two backflips, the first with a single twist and the second with two twists \u2014 and did not advance to the four-skier super final.\n\n\u201cI did absolutely everything I could to be my best and sometimes people just jump better than you,\u201d Cook said.\n\nMaybe it was a stoic face she was putting on for reporters, but Cook did pause when asked about her good friend Jeret \u201cSpeedy\u201d Peterson, the three-time Olympian and silver medalist in the 2010 Winter Olympics who took his life in a remote canyon in Utah in July 2011.\n\n\u201cHe would have been bummed I didn\u2019t hit the second jump,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe\u2019s with me. He\u2019s here. I\u2019m positive of that. My mission is to carry on what he started. To continue on with his legacy. To continue to have conversations about mental health \u2026 conversations about depression. To get people the help they need.\u201d\n\nCook said she would remain in aerials in part because of the influence of Peterson.\n\n\u201cHe taught us how to be a team and I\u2019m going to teach the younger athletes how to do that, too,\u201d she said. \u201cMan, our future is so good in our sport. These kids are so good at 16, 17 years old and Speedy was too and look at what he did.\u201d\n\nCook has lessons she can impart. She was poised to compete in the 2002 Winter Games but broke her ankle weeks before the contest. She\u2019s matured a lot since then, steadily improving throughout her career. In a rare Winter Olympic sport where athletes tend to improve as they age, Cook hopes to enable the younger athletes coming up the ranks to become the best American aerialists ever.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to stay involved with the sport. I\u2019m so excited to watch these kids grow up and start jumping at World Cups and going to their first Olympics,\u201d she said. \u201cI fully intend on being at the next Olympics. I don\u2019t know \u2026 where I\u2019ll be. But I\u2019m not walking away from this sport by any means.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news for Ashley Caldwell, the 20-year-old Virginian whose huge trick in Friday night\u2019s qualifiers scored the highest of the night, revealing her potential to push U.S. aerials to new heights. Caldwell crashed in the first round of finals but quickly started forming plans for the next four years of training as she eyes the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nShe said having Cook around in some capacity will help her and the U.S. team grow.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to disappear. She loves aerials and she\u2019s going to fight for us and support our sport and make sure we get what we need,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emily Cook wraps up Olympic career as aerial artist", "title": "Emily Cook wraps up Olympic career as aerial artist", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/14/emily-cook-wraps-up-olympic-career-as-aerial-artist/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140214__emily-cook-oly-021414ecp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140214__emily-cook-oly-021414ecp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-14T14:37:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:03:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d39\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s been an incredible career,\u201d said the 34-year-old from Massachusetts who finished 11th in the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\u201cHe would have been bummed I didn\u2019t hit the second jump,\u201d Cook said.\n\u201cHe taught us how to be a team and I\u2019m going to teach the younger athletes how to do that, too,\u201d she said.\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2014 The backslapped landing on her double backflip with three twists was the last Olympic jump for American Emily Cook.\nCaldwell crashed in the first round of finals but quickly started forming plans for the next four years of training as she eyes the 2018 Winter Olympics."}
