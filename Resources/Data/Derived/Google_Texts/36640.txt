Yoweri Museveni, President of Uganda, speaks at the Global African Investment Summit in London on October 20, 2014. The Global African Investment Summit

Uganda’s president surprised investors at a conference in London by saying he would prefer they don’t build power plants in his country, where Blackstone Group built a hydroelectric dam, unless they can lower their electricity fees.

President Yoweri Museveni said he welcomed global investors in food processing, oil and gas production and exploration for minerals such as nickel and iron ore. In electricity, he said government-funded hydroelectric dams were cheaper and that foreign aid money could be used to subsidize producers.

Blackstone, the New York-based private-equity firm, built Uganda’s Bujagali dam in partnership with the Aga Khan Development Network. President Museveni inaugurated the 250-megawatt dam in 2012. Blackstone said at the time that the $900 million project was one of the largest privately funded power-sector investments in sub-Saharan Africa and that it set a precedent for partnerships between governments and companies.

“The only problem I’ve seen with energy is that when the private companies come in they use borrowed money, and that borrowed money has got high interest, and once they produce electricity they try to recover money through high electricity prices,” President Museveni said. “I want cheap electricity for my factories to be competitive.”
