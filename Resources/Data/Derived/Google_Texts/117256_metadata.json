They had strongly attacked it because the legislation used a war-fighting account to raise defense spending next year.\n\n\n\nThe measure gives President Barack Obama all the money he requested for defense, but did so by hiking the war-fighting account that is not subject to sequestration by nearly $40 billion.\n\n\n\nObama has said he would veto spending bills that do not address the spending limits and treat defense and non-defense expenditures equally.\n\n\n\nThe companion Senate version of the bill easily advanced through the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday, but it faces a filibuster next week as Democrats seek to force Republicans to negotiate increasing domestic spending.\n\n\n\nBoehner noted after the vote that 120 Democrats backed a $4 billion House bill that would fund congressional offices for the next fiscal year. The debate had included some Democrats calling for a pay raise for legislators.\n\n\n\n\"I'm pleased that a bipartisan majority of the House agrees with our plan to fund national defense,\" the speaker said. \"That said, the American people should know that far more Democrats voted to fund Congress than our troops.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is part of Democrats\u2019 scheme to oppose anything and everything \u2014 even a pay raise for our troops \u2014 in order to extract more money for the IRS and the EPA,\" Boehner added. \"And if Democrats don\u2019t get more money from taxpayers, they are planning to shut down the federal government.\n\n\n\n\"Democrats are playing a dangerous and selfish game with our national security.\"\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Newsmax.
