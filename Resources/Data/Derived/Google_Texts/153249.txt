NORTH LITTLE ROCK, AR - Dozens of fast food workers protested this morning at McDonald's restaurants in Little Rock and North Little Rock.





They were asking for higher wages and the right to join a union.





"Fight for 15" protestors marched inside the North Little Rock location, waving signs and shouting chants.





The workers also marched outside the McDonald's in downtown Little Rock.





One worker there even walked off her job after spotting the protestors outside.





The protests were part of a nationwide demonstration where workers were expected to protest in 160 cities.





"We deserve 15 dollars an hour. $7.80 is not enough to feed your family, to pay your rent. You might have to go to agencies to help pay lights, water, gas but that's not enough money to feed our families," said worker Theresa Boyd.





Hours after the protests, a local McDonald's owner-operator sent the following statement:

At McDonald’s we respect everyone’s right to peacefully protest. The topic of minimum wage goes well beyond McDonald’s - it affects our country’s entire workforce. McDonald’s and our independent franchisees support paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace.





In my restaurants wages are set according to local and federal laws, the competitive marketplace and job level. We believe that any minimum wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses is manageable and feasible. Additionally, we believe that any increase needs to be considered in a broad context, one that considers, for example, the impact of the Affordable Care Act and its definition of “full time” employment, as well as the treatment, from a tax perspective, of investments made by businesses owners.
