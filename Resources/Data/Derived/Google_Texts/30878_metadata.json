Because of breastfeeding\u2019s proven health benefits to infants, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains several provisions to help increase the number of nursing mothers, with specific target goals by 2020.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics supports exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby\u2019s life; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 2011 only 19 percent of new mothers were exclusively breastfeeding after six months. With nearly half of new mothers working outside the home in the year after giving birth, employment is a frequently mentioned barrier to breastfeeding, along with other cultural and institutional impediments.\n\nThe brief details how the ACA requires health insurance plans to provide coverage of certain services for women at no out-of-pocket expense. It also explains the amendments made to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to provide women time and space to pump breastmilk while at work. However, as the brief explains, the FLSA applies only to certain employers and employees. The brief offers an overview of state laws about aspects of breastfeeding, such as allowing breastfeeding in public, or in the workplace.\n\nAbout Health Policy Briefs\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policymakers, congressional staffers, and others needing short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics. The briefs, which are reviewed by experts in the field, include competing arguments on policy proposals and the relevant research supporting each perspective.\n\nSign Up For Health Policy Briefs\n\nSign up for an email alert about upcoming briefs.
