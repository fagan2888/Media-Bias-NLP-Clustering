Nissan is recalling nearly 34,000 of its Rogue 2015 models to fix a defect that could cause the sport utility vehicle to unexpectedly shift out of the park position.

The auto manufacturer says the problem is caused by a faulty shift selector knob that allows the Rogue to move out of park even when the brake pedal isn't depressed. The defect affects Rogue vehicles manufactured from February 10, 2015 through May 13, 2015.

Nissan will start notifying owners of the affected vehicles of the danger this month so they can take their Rogues into dealers to have the defect fixed at no charge.

Rogue owners with questions may contact Nissan at 1-800-647-7261 or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at 1-888-327-4236.
