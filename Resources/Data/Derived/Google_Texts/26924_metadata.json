As the Chicago commercial real estate strategy firm of Jones Lang LaSalle once commented, medical offices are \u201cthe investment darlings.\u201d\n\nAlthough uncertainty over the ramifications of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) did temporarily curb the appetite for more of these \u201cinvestment darlings,\u201d after the dust began to settle with the ACA, the reality is that healthcare will need to accommodate many more patients \u2013 about 32 million more \u2013 and that the aging of the Baby Boomer population will also result in significantly greater need for medical facilities.\n\nThus, the building boom is back on with this segment of the real estate market.\n\n\u201cMany health care systems as well as individual physicians have deferred capital plans due to uncertainty surrounding the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, but it is picking up again, now that there is more clarity on the direction of healthcare,\u201d said Michael Williams, Sr., president of MH Williams Construction, the largest commercial builder in Brevard County.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing strong growth opportunities in the medical industry and are continually working to ensure low-cost delivery that meets the present and future needs of this fast-changing market. Stay tuned, as we have a few exciting projects coming up in the next several weeks that we will be excited to announce.\u201d\n\nUPSCALE DEVELOPMENT\n\nRunning out of room is a fact of life in busy medical and dental practices. When primary care physician and founder of Suntree Internal Medicine Dr. Abe Hardoon ran out of office space for a third time in less than 10 years, he decided to take matters into his own hands and create a setting that would allow him plenty of expansion opportunities and also promote healing through its environment.\n\nThe result is Brevard Medical City, where the new building for Suntree Internal Medicine is Phase One of five and the keystone of a 29-acre complex on Wickham Road Hardoon and his staff moved into the new 31,000-square-foot, two-story building this June.\n\nThe second part of Phase One, currently under construction, is a 15,000-square-foot diagnostic center that will include MRI.\n\nThe upscale development will feature 35-foot royal palms lining the main boulevard, fiber optics throughout the property, a six-plus acre lake, fountains, benches, paver walkways, a lighted one-mile jogging/walking trail open for community use, a sophisticated security system and even charging stations for electric cars.\n\nAlso under construction is Phase Two, a 46,000-square-foot complex of medical/profession/retail office condominium space.\n\nSubsequent phases include Chateau Madeleine, a 90-bed adult assisted living facility.\n\nCurrently also being considered as part of Brevard Medical City is a retirement community of independent living residences.\n\nWith Brevard Medical City, Hardoon has tapped into a vision of medical facility construction that encompasses much more than just bricks and mortars. It transforms health services by integrating them within the community and shaping the experience into one that is appealing, efficient and convenient.\n\nMH WILLIAMS FOCUSED ON BREVARD COUNTY\n\nIn business since 1987, MH Williams is headquartered and focused in Brevard County, although the full-service commercial construction firm builds throughout the Southeast.\n\nMH Williams has built the gamut of medical projects, including major hospitals, cosmetic surgery centers, data centers, surgical centers, pharmacies, assisted living facilities, dental facilities, laboratories and pediatrics and orthopedics offices, among others.\n\nAmong MH Williams\u2019 vast list of past projects are several for Health First at corporate and service delivery facilities in Viera, Palm Bay and Rockledge, the Wuesthoff Medical Arts Center, the Lawler Medical Building, Osler Medical Pavilion, the Medi-Share Corporate Office, Melbourne Kidney Center, Regency Medical Park II, Sheridan Medical Building, ENT Ambulatory & Surgical Center, Pediatrics of Brevard and Central OB-GYN, Wickham Dental Care, Schumacher Orthodontics, Sedaros Oral Surgery, Vevera Family Dental, Alzheimer\u2019s Care Facility of Viera, Buena Vida Estates, Cedar Creek Life Center, Century Oaks and Crane Creek ACLF Apartments.\n\nMH Williams also worked with Brevard Zoo to build its veterinary clinic, as well as its meerkat exhibit and expansion of the boardwalk and the Africa section of the park.\n\nThe company is also working with the Brevard Neighborhood Development Coalition, or BNDC, to develop Palm Bay\u2019s Evans Center, a community center that will provide healthy food options, job training opportunities and a clinic run by the Brevard Health Alliance.\n\nIt is not the first time MH Williams has worked with both organizations. With BNDC, the company constructed in the Booker T. Washington Neighborhood, Melbourne\u2019s poorest community, both a learning center for the children of the community (the DOCK) and Greater Heights, an affordable apartment community for the working poor and the elderly.\n\n\u201cWe also have a great working relationship with Brevard Health Alliance,\u201d said vice president Randy Trent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together on interior renovations for three of their locations and are excited to partner with them for the Evans Center.\u201d\n\nMH Williams\u2019 Medi-Share office expansion for Christian Care Ministry in Melbourne reflects the fast pace at which the medical construction industry moves because of the explosive growth of healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe built Medi-Share\u2019s 41,000-square-foot office building in 2014 and now they are ready to expand by 13,000 more square feet and we will be working with them again,\u201d said Williams.\n\n\u201cWe break ground on their new expansion in August and are thrilled to be working with them.\u201d\n\nMORE EFFICIENT SPACES\n\nFor Dr. Sadesh Kumar\u2019s Wickham Dental Care in Melbourne, MH Williams recently completed a 5,000-square-feet state-of-the-art dental facility that allocated plenty of opportunity for growth.\n\n\u201cOne of the trends in the medical industry right now is building more efficient spaces, with plans and room to expand,\u201d said project manager Marcus Ingeldsen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we did with Wickham Dental Care. They have a brand new dental facility with room to build out an additional 1,200-square-feet of office space.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "abe hardoon,eric hardoon,homepage,michael williams,scott hardoon,slider,suntree internal medicine", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SUNTREE-INTERNAL-MEDICINE-580-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Healthcare construction has always been a favorite with the building and lending industries.
