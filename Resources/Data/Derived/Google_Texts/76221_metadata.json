Many taxpayers will end up having to repay part or potentially all of their subsidies. Conversely, others may qualify for bigger refunds. It all depends on how well they estimated their 2014 incomes.\n\n\"As many as 1 in 5 of the people in the top half of the tax credit range might actually end up having income that puts them out of the tax credit range, which means whopping bills at tax time,\" Brandes said. \"We're talking about millions of people here.\"\n\nEveryone who applied for a tax credit on the federal health insurance exchange had to estimate 2014 income \u2014 an unusual scenario because most tax credits, such as those for college tuition or the adoption of a child, are typically given retroactively.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's subsidies for buying health coverage on the federal exchange are actually tax credits given in advance, with the final accounting due by April 15 when people file their returns.

The authors concluded that people with incomes just over 400 percent of poverty are at greatest risk for unexpected tax problems. Using 2012 numbers, they gave the example of a family of four with a household income above $92,200 having to repay as much as $11,200.\n\nThat's a worst-case scenario. Most taxpayers will be given some level of protection through repayment caps.\n\nBrandes said his comments are based on the Health Affairs study, which analyzed income data from California.\n\n\"They came up with some pretty shocking conclusions,\" he said. \"They estimated that about 3 out of 4 subsidy recipients will be families with income changes greater than 10 percent\" from the families' original projections. \"Some people will have underestimated, and some people will have overestimated.\"\n\nLarry Lyons worries about subsidy repayments if his earnings exceed what he expects to make. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nLyons said it's hard to be accurate when estimating income based on unknown sales.\n\n\"If I have a great end of the year and I make more than I expected to, what kind of fines or charges or repayment am I going to have to make on the amount that I estimated?\" he asked.\n\nPeople can protect themselves from unpleasant surprises by reconciling their estimated income sooner rather than later, Brandes said. Waiting until later could also delay refunds.\n\nPeople are supposed to report changes in income by logging into their healthcare.gov accounts or calling the health insurance marketplace at 1-800-318-2596.\n\n\"We estimate the reconciliation process could affect as many as 10 million or more taxpayers \u2014 those enrolled at the end of the open enrollment period plus enrollments from special enrollment events,\" Brandes said.\n\nOne way to lessen the risk of being hit with a repayment is to reduce gross income by putting more money into a pretax retirement account, he said.\n\nReach Tom Wilemon at 615-726-5961 and on Twitter @TomWilemon.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepayment limits Some people who make more than their estimated income and obtained tax credits to buy coverage on healthcare.gov will get a degree of protection through repayment caps. The caps are based on the federal poverty level, currently $11,670 for an individual and $23,850 for a family of four. The level changes according to the number of people in a family. Individual Family Less than 200 percent of federal poverty level $300 $600 Between 200 percent and 300 percent $750 $1,500 Between 300 percent and 400 percent $1,250 $2,500 More than 400 percent Repay in full Repay in full Source: Jackson Hewitt\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/07/20/health-care-tax-credits-become-tax-woes/12924839/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Many who got subsidies to buy health coverage will have to repay the IRS.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Many who got subsidies to buy health coverage will have to repay the IRS.", "title": "Health care tax credits become tax woes", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/07/20/health-care-tax-credits-become-tax-woes/12924839/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many who got subsidies to buy health coverage will have to repay the IRS.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b5c7f03afe91516d0e47c3a9cf3111cc4131342/c=52-0-765-713&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg", "title": "Health care tax credits become tax woes", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Internal Revenue Service", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Internal Revenue Service", "title": "Health care tax credits become tax woes", "author": "Tom Wilemon", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a59cd4e2e2b16d129201a9018c0e15dc8bfc2031/c=33-0-567-713/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae59d8361015160cf46caf33ad9dee8de8591b7f/c=52-0-765-713/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca5b15ac3a6d96554665b5fc2e26228c475efce4/c=35-0-983-713/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d28a5bf74ac5b2e1cb6f23d7a591f02ee133277/c=0-13-1087-626&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-20T23:47:12.543000-05:00", "shorthed": "Health care tax credits become tax woes", "articleid": 12924839, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d73b45a879a6629953c7a2c9e324bed324cf6fd/c=0-13-1087-626/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/628c975cd9d0e715b7ce4ea29a5b7a39f45c9b49/c=93-0-493-713/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/07/20/1405905366000-irsgov-homepage.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tom-WilemonThe-Tennessean/120277341389247?ref=hl"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe220d\"", "article_summary": "People can protect themselves from unpleasant surprises by reconciling their estimated income sooner rather than later, Brandes said.\nPeople are supposed to report changes in income by logging into their healthcare.gov accounts or calling the health insurance marketplace at 1-800-318-2596.\nRepayment limits Some people who make more than their estimated income and obtained tax credits to buy coverage on healthcare.gov will get a degree of protection through repayment caps.\nEveryone who applied for a tax credit on the federal health insurance exchange had to estimate 2014 income \u2014 an unusual scenario because most tax credits, such as those for college tuition or the adoption of a child, are typically given retroactively.\n(Photo: Getty Images / iStockphoto)Brandes pointed to an analysis by labor and health policy experts published in Health Affairs."}
