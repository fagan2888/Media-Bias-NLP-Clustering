The Timberwolves are in a bind eerily similar to that of the Nuggets in 2010, when Carmelo Anthony made it clear he would not sign a contract extension to stay in Denver. He wanted a trade out of town, and it took until the trading deadline in February 2011 to get it done.\n\nLike Anthony, Love is the star and primary scorer on his team, boasting career averages of 19.2 points and 12.2 rebounds per game while shooting 45.1 percent from the field. Last season, he averaged 26.1 points and 12.5 rebounds.\n\nThere\u2019s a heavy price to be paid to get a talent such as Love. Minnesota is unhappy with the initial offers coming its way. Franchises are wary of mortgaging their futures for a player who may walk at the end of the season.\n\nThe Anthony trade was precedent-setting. It will take a similar deal, asset-wise, to land Love, who might not even be signed when he is traded. He can\u2019t be signed until at least July, when contracts can be extended.\n\nThe Timberwolves need leverage. They need more teams in the mix, or at least appearing to be in the mix. The fact the Nuggets were mentioned in a Boston Herald report concerning talks with Minnesota, but with no players or draft picks linked to them, is a clear sign of leverage. The Nuggets used the Nets\u2019 interest in Anthony to leverage a better deal with the Knicks.\n\nWith the tables turned, do the Nuggets want to mortgage their future to get Love, who plays with \u2026 who? And risk having Love depart after next season?\n\nIn the last three years, the Nuggets lost Anthony, whom they drafted, and Andre Iguodala, whom they thought they could persuade to stay long-term in Denver after trading for him in the final year of his contract. Iguodala left after one season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets inquire about Kevin Love, but cost could be prohibitive", "title": "Nuggets inquire about Kevin Love, but cost could be prohibitive", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/18/nuggets-inquire-about-kevin-love-but-cost-could-be-prohibitive/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__kevin-love-2p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__kevin-love-2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-18T17:46:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:22:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Like Anthony, Love is the star and primary scorer on his team, boasting career averages of 19.2 points and 12.2 rebounds per game while shooting 45.1 percent from the field.\nIt is tantalizing, the prospect of Kevin Love donning a Nuggets uniform.\nThe Anthony trade was precedent-setting.\nThe Nuggets are known to be kicking the tires on Love, the disgruntled Minnesota star forward, but there is nothing close to happening \u2014 not with Love or any other player.\nWith the tables turned, do the Nuggets want to mortgage their future to get Love, who plays with \u2026 who?"}
