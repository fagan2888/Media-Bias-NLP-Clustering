CMS aims to make drug spending trends more transparent for healthcare providers. CMS said this list of medications will hopefully promote more industry chatter about drug spending and rising drug costs.\n\nCMS examined Medicare prescription drugs for both Part B and Part D. CMS also analyzed various categories, including drugs with a high per user spending rate, and increasingly high unit costs.\n\n\u201cThe data can be used to spur research and public discussion of how these drug products are being used in Medicare and how they are affecting beneficiary costs,\u201d CMS stated.\n\nCMS used last year\u2019s data to identify 80 drugs meeting a specific list of criteria. This included 40 drugs provided by the Medicare Prescription Drug Program under Part D and 40 drugs administered by physicians and other professionals in the Medicare fee-for-service program under Part B.\n\nPrescription drug spending up, up, and away?\n\nPrescription drug spending is on the rise, asserted CMS. Prescription drug spending allegedly increased by 12 percent last year. This is the highest reported annual increase since 2002.\n\n\"Prescription drugs are a major contributor to improving patient health as well as a major driver of health care spending,\u201d said CMS.\n\nLast year, prescription drug spending increased by over 5 percent. 2013 saw growth of nearly 3 percent \u2013 an amount that topped $3 trillion, or over $9,500 per person.\n\n\u201cThe faster growth experienced in 2014 was primarily due to the major coverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act, particularly for Medicaid and private health insurance,\u201d CMS explained.\n\n\u201cThe share of the economy devoted to health care spending was 17.5 percent, up from 17.3 percent in 2013.\u201d\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket spending on the up and up\n\nMedicare spending increased last year by a reported 5.5 percent to top $618 billion. This spike represents an alleged 3 percent increase from 2013. Medicare reportedly accounted for 20 percent of total healthcare spending.\n\n\u201cThis increase was primarily attributable to faster growth in spending for prescription drugs, physician and clinical services, and government administration and the net cost of insurance,\u201d CMS said.\n\nTotal Medicaid spending represents 16 percent of total national health expenditures, stated CMS.\n\nThis is a reported 11 increase from 2014. There was a smaller confirmed 0.9 percent increase for state and local Medicaid expenditures. Federal Medicaid expenditures, however, increased by over 18 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe increased spending by the federal government was largely driven by the newly eligible enrollees under the ACA, which were fully financed by the federal government,\u201d CMS explained.\n\nOut-of-pocket spending grew as well at a rate of 1.3 percent in 2014 to nearly $330 billion. This increase was reportedly a tad less than 2013\u2019s annual growth spike of around 2 percent.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in 2014 was influenced by the expansion of insurance coverage and the corresponding drop in the number of individuals without health insurance,\u201d asserted CMS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CMS released a Medicare Drug Spending dashboard to address prescription drugs\u2019 affordability and make drug spending trends transparent for providers.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cmss-medicare-drug-spending-dashboard-notes-spending-spike", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2016-01-14-CMS-red.png", "type": "article", "title": "CMS\u2019s Medicare Drug Spending Dashboard Notes Spending Spike"}, "twitter": {"description": "CMS released a Medicare Drug Spending dashboard to address prescription drugs\u2019 affordability and make drug spending trends transparent for providers.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2016-01-14-CMS-red.png"}, "title": "CMS\u2019s Medicare Drug Spending Dashboard Notes Spending Spike", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has released a Medicare Drug Spending dashboard to address prescription drugs\u2019 affordability.\nCMS said this list of medications will hopefully promote more industry chatter about drug spending and rising drug costs.\nLast year, prescription drug spending increased by over 5 percent.\nPrescription drug spending up, up, and away?\nPrescription drug spending allegedly increased by 12 percent last year."}
