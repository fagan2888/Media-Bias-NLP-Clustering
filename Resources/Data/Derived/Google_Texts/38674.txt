Oh, the places Bill Maher just went.

The host of HBO’s “Real Time” took on the border crisis and Tea Party Republicans with an epic Dr. Seuss parody on Friday night.

During his “New Rules” segment, Maher gave the author’s classic story, “Oh, The Places You’ll Go!” a satirical twist to create “Oh, The Places You’ll Go...and Get Kicked Out Of.” The new story tackles the current border crisis.

Since the beginning of the year, more than 57,000 children have arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border in hopes of escaping gang violence in Central America. The influx in migrants has overwhelmed local resources as the Department of Homeland Security must process the minors, many whom could be eligible for refugees status.

Maher starts his story with the following stanza:

Howdy there, partner,

Today is your day.

You made it to Brownsville!

Now please go away.

The “Real Time” host also points out Republican’s hypocrisy and racism in the parody:

And just cuz you're here,

Don't think that you beat us.

Cuz we don't love kids

Unless they're a fetus. So cut us some slack,

Turn that frown upside-down,

It's not our fault

You're a little too brown.

Maher isn’t the only late-night comedian to take a shot at Republicans’ attitude towards child refugees. Jon Stewart asked conservatives “What the fuck is wrong with you?” in his "Immigration Reform Crisis: Kids Edition" segment earlier this month.

"We have always been a nation of immigrants who hate the newer immigrants," Stewart added, "because Lady Liberty may be a beacon of those yearning to breathe free but the truth is, she's actually a bouncer."
