The supreme irony is that the only elected woman whose voice remotely counts in the state is arguably the worst governor in the nation, and that\u2019s saying something.\n\nNikki Haley is seeking her second term after a disastrous first term of ethics questions, purported affairs, a history of very late tax payments as bookkeeper for her family business, a questionable influence-peddling hiring by a local hospital, refusal of major education and stimulus money, refusal to expand Medicaid to a certain class of low wage earners (predicted to kill hundreds a year), the relentless trashing and misinformation campaign of the Affordable Care Act, pushing for vouchers and school choice, a net net loss of funding for public schools in her term and a total indifference to major polluters, (Lord know how many will die as a consequence), exceeded only by her disdain for the black community and, incredibly, women.\n\nSouth Carolina probably ranks in the bottom five in more categories of quality of life than all but a state or two, nationally. And they are hanging on to number one in men killing women in greater numbers than anywhere else. What a nightmare record to run on. If you\u2019re not a South Carolinian, that is. It\u2019s red meat for the typical Palmetto state voter.\n\nYes, on November 4th, she\u2019s going to kick her opponent\u2019s hindquarters by a larger margin than the 2010 four percent, when she faced the same State Senator, Vincent Sheheen.\n\nSheheen was making a run of it until he joined the \u201copen mouth, insert foot\u201d crowd of inappropriate political mouthings. We\u2019re not talking the verbal tripe involving rape and other women\u2019s issues that certain Republicans engaged in last time around. We\u2019re talking \u201cstupid.\u201d Sheheen\u2019s dunce-cap verbiage was preceded by a similar vote-destroying flare-up from the mouth of Shelia Gallagher, a delightful, usually articulate, wonderfully CV\u2019d Democratic candidate for State Superintendent of Education. She didn\u2019t even bother to wait for the general election, when in her primary run, which she should have won handily, she decided that legalizing Marijuana was a wonderful issue to add to her platform, she gave up any chance of advancing to the general.\n\nAs for Sheheen, who was rolling along, trailing slightly in most polls, but with a puncher\u2019s chance, he brought up the ultra-sensitive issue I call the \u201cFlag-Flap.\u201d Yes, the earnest State Senator, was apparently advised to throw the Confederate flag into the campaign mix. Sheheen wants the flag removed from the State House grounds.\n\nA little background. The Confederate flag was, indeed, removed from the capital dome over 14 years ago. It now stands by a confederate monument on the same grounds. No word from Sheheen about the monument. In case you\u2019re from the deep north woods and don\u2019t know what the confederate flag looks like, you\u2019ve seen it under the moniker of rebel flag. There are variations that are parts of many Southern state flags, so, as of 2014, it\u2019s not an issue that will change many minds, one way or the other.\n\nThere\u2019s also a guy named Tom Ervin running for governor as a petition candidate. Ervin is getting some ink as a \u2018spoiler\u2019 who could possibly divide the vote and end up governor. When pigs fly! The born-again attorney is getting some attention for being snarky toward both parties, having been a Democrat at one time in the state legislature and later opportunistically turning Republican when he saw the political power shift. He\u2019s most recently been banging on Haley for supposedly forcing big businesses to contribute to her campaign to gain her political affections. And?????\n\nI received an email today from the Sheheen camp, titled \u201ctied race.\u201d That poll must have come from Mrs. Doe\u2019s eight-grade civics class because no legitimate poll gives Sheheen any hope of victory with Haley\u2019s lead spanning 9 \u2013 15 points. Vincent\u2019s toast.\n\nFor the Democrats, there are no races that qualify as even \u201chopeful.\u201d Tim Scott has his Senate seat locked up over the extremely likable Joyce Dickerson, as does Lindsey Graham, who will bury dedicated and trustworthy, State Senator, Brad Hutto. Both Republican Senate candidates have millions upon millions more dollars than their Democratic opponents. Democrat Tom Thompson will get slaughtered in the Superintendent of Education race by Molly Spearman.\n\nAlan Wilson is a lock for Attorney General. Wilson is the step-son of \u201cyou lie\u201d Wilson. His natural father was killed in a military accident. His opponent should be creating more buzz and potential votes. He\u2019s Parnell Diggs, who serves as an inspiration for all of us. He\u2019s blind and a successful attorney who serves as head of the South Carolina Commission for the Blind. Like most of the statewide candidates, I\u2019ve met Mr. Diggs and heard him speak on several occasions. He makes sense, not necessarily a prerequisite for election in South Carolina.\n\nThe most charismatic and effective Democratic retail politician is an interesting young black politician, Bakari Sellers. Elected to the South Carolina House at 22, tall and telegenic, bright and energetic, Sellers should be doing better than he is in the Lt. Governor\u2019s race against government lifer, Henry McMaster. Henry is a former U.S. Attorney and South Carolina Attorney General. McMaster can be beat. He lost his last race for the Lt. Governor and was unsuccessful as a primary candidate for governor in 2010. But, he\u2019ll win this one.\n\nDemocrat, Ginny Deerin, about whom a peep is rarely heard, will lose by a large margin to 12-year incumbent, Mark Hammond, even though Hammond has but 413 likes on his Facebook page to Derrin\u2019s 1,098. Deerin is 63 and has been a political consultant most of her working life. She pledges not to accept more than $100 in a single contribution. I\u2019ve got a feeling that\u2019s not been a problem. Nice lady, but a weak candidate to take on a guy who has already served a dozen years in the office.\n\nComptroller General and Commissioner of Agriculture are contested races that nobody cares about. Republicans will add them to the victory total. Democrats didn\u2019t even bother putting up candidates for State Treasurer, Adjutant General and Auditor.\n\n\u201cWiping the floor\u201d might be the best appellation to apply to Republican prospects for statewide office. It\u2019s not going to be a pretty picture. But enough melancholia for one submission.\n\nI\u2019ll talk more South Carolina races in upcoming posts and also spell out why 2016 will see a complete reversal in the South Carolina Democratic Party political fortunes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Carolina has the lowest percentage of women in its legislature of any state in the union.
