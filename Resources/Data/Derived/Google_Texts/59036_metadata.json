Bob McDermott, R-Aiea, said Obamacare\u2019s implementation in Hawaii has been an unmitigated disaster.\n\n\u201cOur prepaid health plan worked because we are an island, so companies could not move jobs to another state,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cIf they did business here they had to eat it, so to speak. But it worked, and it was the price of paradise. No real competition, good care at a high price. The uninsured got (Med Quest) \u2026 so basically everyone had a health plan, if they wanted it,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nThere was always a small group transitioning jobs, fired, or laid off, but that was only temporary and not a long term issue, McDermott noted.\n\nObamacare has added another layer of cost to the basic plan Hawaii had in place without adding value, McDermott said.\n\nA May study by Kaiser Health showed Hawaii\u2019s exchange costs the nation\u2019s taxpayers about $23,899 per person, the most per enrollee.\n\nLawmakers estimate it will take 150,000 people to make the program self-sustainable.\n\nLawmakers set aside another $15 million a year of state taxpayer funds to sustain the exchange operations after the federal money runs out in 2014.\n\nMcDermott is one of several Hawaii lawmakers who say they are in favor of Hawaii seeking an exemption from the federal government for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI am no expert on it, but I asked some of my legislative colleagues in the majority why didn\u2019t we opt out? Their response is they don\u2019t know. Privately, they say Gov. Neil Abercrombie dropped the ball. I am not so sure. I think the governor wanted the influx of the $200 million-plus dollars in federal funds to flood the economy during an election season \u2026 that is what I think. The poor judgment of accepting such a flawed program that added zero value to our citizens and does not make sense otherwise,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii, and state Senate President Donna Mercado Kim, D-Moanalua, also have suggested Hawaii seek an exemption.\n\nHanabusa said during an April 2014 congressional hearing that Hawaii residents are \u201cfrustrated and embarrassed\u201d because of the low enrollment in the Obamacare exchange, and \u201cvery concerned\u201d about how the $204 million federal ACA grant has been allocated and spent. Hanabusa noted she wasn\u2019t in Congress when the ACA was passed, and said Hawaii has an exemption to the law because of the Hawaii Prepaid Healthcare Act, and said Hawaii should use it.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Charles Djou, R-Hawaii, the only candidate running for Hawaii\u2019s First Congressional District, is calling for a complete overhaul of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cGovernment must work to better the lives of our citizens, but Obamacare clearly fails this promised standard. Obamacare\u2019s punitive costs and punishing demands hurt, not help, working people,\u201d Djou said. \u201cHawaii should be exempt from Obamacare. We should enact sensible medical malpractice tort reform, permit the interstate sale of health insurance and expand the use of health savings accounts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "$204 million Obamacare grant reduces Hawaii's uninsured population by 2.75 percent", "title": "$204 million Obamacare grant reduces Hawaii's uninsured", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-09-at-8.38.35-AM.png", "updated_time": "2014-07-15T17:56:41+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/159664/204-million-obamacare-grant/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Hawaii", "tag": "2014 Health Insurance Coverage Report,Hawaii,ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-07-16T04:00:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-15T17:56:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "$204 million Obamacare grant reduces Hawaii's uninsured population by 2.75 percent", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-09-at-8.38.35-AM.png"}, "title": "$204 million Obamacare grant reduces Hawaii's uninsured", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "$204 million Obamacare grant reduces Hawaii's uninsured population by 2.75 percent"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2b8\"", "article_summary": "By Malia Zimmerman | Watchdog.orgHONOLULU \u2014 After getting $204 million from a federal grant to establish its own Affordable Care Act exchange, Hawaii\u2019s uninsured population has been reduced by less than 3 percent.\nIn its 2014 Health Insurance Coverage Report, WalletHub noted 6.35 percent of Hawaii\u2019s population lacks insurance coverage.\nIn total, 28.01 percent of Hawaii\u2019s population under 64 is on Medicaid.\nWe should enact sensible medical malpractice tort reform, permit the interstate sale of health insurance and expand the use of health savings accounts.\u201d\nSome 8,592 individuals enrolled in private health insurance plans under Obamacare."}
