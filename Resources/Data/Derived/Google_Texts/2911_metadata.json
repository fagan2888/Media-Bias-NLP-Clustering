Ted Cruz \u2014 are simply not prepared for the demands of the Oval Office, GOP presidential hopeful and Cruz rival Rick Santorum told more than 300 Tea Party faithful Monday.\n\n\u201cCommander in chief is not an entry-level position,\u201d Santorum, with two terms each in the U.S. House and Senate under his belt, told a gathering sponsored the influential NE Tarrant Tea Party. \u201cThe White House is not the job for on-the-job training.\u201d\n\nThroughout a day in Texas, Santorum criticized candidates he said are better suited to \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d \u2014 such as Cruz and Republican frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you want to put someone in there who can scream and holler that \u2018it\u2019s going to be huge,\u2019 great. Feel good about it. But you\u2019re not going to change Washington,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to work with those egos. I have a track record of winning battles.\u201d\n\nWayne Wylie, a regular attendee at Tea Party events in North Texas, said he believes depth of experience separates Santorum from Cruz.\n\n\u201cYou know, I like Ted Cruz, I voted for him,\u201d Wylie said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a first-term senator, and he really doesn\u2019t have the records yet. It\u2019s an interesting dynamic right now, because you have so many people in the race who really don\u2019t have much of a record of anything \u2014 and they\u2019re leading the polls.\u201d\n\nWylie said he was optimistic Santorum could surge in the polls, citing Santorum's surprise win in Iowa during the 2012 primaries. He echoed Santorum's skepticism that polls can effectively predict the outcome of elections.\n\n\"It's hard to track people like me, people with cell phones,\" Wylie said. \"The polls don't always tell the full story.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Santorum told a crowd of roughly 100 at the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth that the Republican party is failing to connect with poor and working-class voters.\n\nThe Democratic Party has done a better job than Republicans connecting with low-income voters frustrated by a persistent \u201cwealth gap,\u201d Santorum said.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to Republicans, they never talk about workers. They\u2019re always talking about businesses. They\u2019re always talking about economic growth,\" Santorum said. \"They\u2019re not talking about, 'What are we going to do to help individual workers?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have one party that goes out and talks about these issues all the time, talks about the problems we\u2019re facing, goes out and shows compassion,\u201d the former Pennsylvania senator added. \u201cThen they go out and make it worse. These programs that are intended to help actually make things worse.\"\n\nSantorum spent most of his speech unveiling his new tax proposal, the \"20/20 Flat Tax,\u201d which he said is intended to help working-class and middle-class Americans. Santorum said he would establish a 20 percent individual tax rate across the board for all income streams. All itemized deductions would be eliminated, he said, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest of up to $25,000 a year.\n\nSantorum said he would make up for the decrease in tax revenue by repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSantorum has been a regular visitor to Texas in the years since his 2012 presidential run. Before embarking on his current campaign, Santorum spent a few days a week in Texas in his capacity as CEO of EchoLight Studios, a Christian movie distributor, according to spokesman Matt Beynon.\n\nAnd Patriot Voices \u2014 a PAC Santorum founded with his wife, Karen, in 2012 \u2014 has also been active in Texas politics. The PAC issued endorsements for Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton last year.\n\nSantorum also visited the Dallas-Fort Worth area in early July for a series of fundraisers and meet-the-voter events.\n\nAfter Monday's speech, Richard Ellis, a pastor at Reunion Church in Dallas who describes himself as a Santorum campaign supporter, said the candidate's consistent record makes him stand out.\n\n\"His stance on families, abortion, marriage \u2014 he's one of the most consistent guys in the race,\" Ellis said. \"I know Texans will appreciate that.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic Party has done a better job than the Republican Party connecting with low-income voters frustrated by a persistent &ldquo;wealth gap,&rdquo; GOP presidential contender Rick Santorum said in North Texas Monday.&nbsp; &nbsp;", "parsely-title": "Santorum Says GOP Fails to Connect with Workers", "twitter": {"description": "The Democratic Party has done a better job than the Republican Party connecting with low-income voters frustrated by a persistent &ldquo;wealth gap,&rdquo; GOP presidential contender Rick Santorum ...", "title": "Santorum Says GOP Fails to Connect with Workers", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/12/santorum-gop-fails-connect-working-class/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/10/12/EDIT_10-12-15-RickSantorum_0691_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "creator": "@jrud", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "The Democratic Party has done a better job than the Republican Party connecting with low-income voters frustrated by a persistent &ldquo;wealth gap,&rdquo; GOP presidential contender Rick Santorum said in North Texas Monday.&nbsp; &nbsp;", "title": "Santorum Says GOP Fails to Connect with Workers", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/12/santorum-gop-fails-connect-working-class/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/10/12/EDIT_10-12-15-RickSantorum_0691_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "2016 Presidential Election", "parsely-author": "Jordan  Rudner", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "Oct. 12, 2015, 1:51 p.m.", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/10/12/EDIT_10-12-15-RickSantorum_0691_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/12/santorum-gop-fails-connect-working-class/"}, "article_summary": "Rick Santorum speaks at a campaign luncheon in Fort Worth, Texas on October 12, 2015.\nEarlier in the day, Santorum told a crowd of roughly 100 at the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth that the Republican party is failing to connect with poor and working-class voters.\nSantorum also visited the Dallas-Fort Worth area in early July for a series of fundraisers and meet-the-voter events.\nI have a track record of winning battles.\u201dWayne Wylie, a regular attendee at Tea Party events in North Texas, said he believes depth of experience separates Santorum from Cruz.\nAnd Patriot Voices \u2014 a PAC Santorum founded with his wife, Karen, in 2012 \u2014 has also been active in Texas politics."}
