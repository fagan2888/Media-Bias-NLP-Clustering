Two Birmingham pharmacy management companies have merged in response to market forces and government mandates.

Proxsys Rx and MedWorks Rx are joining forces under the Proxsys name, according to a news release.

Proxsys Rx can assume all pharmacy operating and management costs from hospitals and health care systems providing "an instant financial benefit," according a news release.

In the face of mandates from the Affordable Care Act, the Birmingham company believes its newly combined forces will fill a market need to manage these new rules.

Proxsys Rx CEO George B. Salem said hospitals and physicians are being held financially accountable for what happens to patients after they leave the hospital. ACA imposes penalties based on readmission rates and other metrics.

"Proxsys Rx is a direct response to these market forces," Salem said in a release. "For hospitals, the stakes are higher than ever- their performance/reimbursement measures are directly impacted by outpatient pharmacy initiatives."
