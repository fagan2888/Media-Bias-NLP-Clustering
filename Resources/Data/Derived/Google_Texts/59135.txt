North Charleston officials have released a dashcam video which details the moments before Officer Michael Slager shot and killed Walter Scott. Missing from that footage: the struggle between Scott and Slager — as well as the actual shooting that followed.

Fox’s Geraldo Rivera joined the Fox & Friends team this morning and said that he was glad that the video was released because it provided much-needed context for the murder. However, not even those conducting the Fox & Friends round-table seemed prepared for Rivera’s take-away: “It started as a righteous traffic stop,” he said, before then explaining that Scott was “acting very hinky” and “very edgy.”

“[Officer Slager] has done everything professional and now he’s had this, this civilian has dared to physically have this altercation with the officer,” he continued. “Put that in the officer’s head now. I think it saves him from the murder rap.”
