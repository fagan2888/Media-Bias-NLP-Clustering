Better service.\n\nThat's what they're saying at the Vassar Brothers Medical Center emergency department, where a new annex is opening this week.\n\nA new wing has been quickly added that puts 15 new bays to work at the City of Poughkeepsie hospital. They expect to start using it for patients Wednesday. The expansion comes amid increasing emergency services locally and state and federal pressure to reduce emergency visits, when possible.\n\nThe previous emergency department was designed for about 55,000 visits annually. Laura Bazarnick, vice president of the emergency department, said the department takes in an average of 175 patients per day and expects to treat about 68,000 visitors during this year.\n\n\"This is a big deal for us because we are busy, busy, busy,\" said Bazarnick.\n\nThe facility, which treats everything from breathing difficulties to broken bones, will now have 57 beds.\n\nThe $2 million expansion is a modular unit that sits on what was formerly parking space right next to the existing ER. Vassar plans to renovate the old space next.\n\nSarah Curran, RN, tells reporters about some of the equipment in the newly expanded emergency department at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie Monday. The new annex will likely be opening for patients Wednesday.

It is housed in the Charles E. and Mabel E. Conklin Center for Emergency Care.\n\nBuy Photo The new $2 million, 7,000 square-foot, 15 bay north annex to the Charles E. and Mabel E.

The federal Affordable Care Act is part of that movement in that it has gotten many people into health insurance.\n\nBazarnick said that it's possible that usage of emergency facilities could back down, but she said expansion is needed for what's going on now at Vassar. \"It's always better to do that than not have enough,\" she said.\n\nEven as hospitals expand emergency care, changes in health care policy are designed to reduce visits. A review by the state Department of Health examined trends in potentially preventable emergency visits. It found that statewide, about 23.5 percent of ER visits in 2012 were avoidable. Dutchess came in at 22.8 percent, a slight improvement from 2011. That data was not broken out by hospital.\n\nWell over 50 percent of people admitted to the hospital come to the emergency room first, and about one in five people who come to the ER are admitted, Vassar Brothers President Robert Friedberg said in June when the expansion was announced.\n\nOnce the new wing is fully up and running, the staff will make space in the older emergency room spaces to allow for renovations. This will include new equipment, mounted computers, new flooring, ceilings, counters and repainting. All services will remain operational during the renovations.\n\nVassar is also opening a new cafeteria this week, part of its overall capital projects, and has introduced valet parking.\n\nEmergency help in Dutchess County is on an upgrade curve. Vassar's expansion follows by three months the enlargement of emergency facilities at MidHudson Regional Hospital of Westchester Medical Center. That hospital, in the Town of Poughkeepsie, opened an expanded and renovated Brinn Center, which is the psychiatric part of its Emergency Department. That $1 million overhaul allowed overall expanded capacity in the entire department, better flow and reduced wait times, its officials said in June.\n\nSpokesman David Billig said the project added 10 rooms to the MidHudson Regional department.\n\nCraig Wolf: 845-437-4815; cwolf@poughkeepsiejournal.com; Twitter: @craigwolfPJ\n\nEMERGENCY ROOM NUMBERS\n\n15\n\nNew bays\n\n57\n\nTotal ER beds\n\n$2 million\n\nExpansion cost\n\n7,000\n\nSquare feet of space added\n\n68,000\n\nER visitors expected this year\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/2014/09/15/vassar-expands-emergency-facilities/15678803/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Vassar Brothers Medical Center expands its 'busy, busy' emergency department", "og": {"site_name": "The Poughkeepsie Journal", "description": "Vassar Brothers Medical Center expands its 'busy, busy' emergency department", "title": "Vassar Brothers expands emergency facilities", "url": "http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/2014/09/15/vassar-expands-emergency-facilities/15678803/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/poughkeepsiejournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vassar Brothers Medical Center expands its 'busy, busy' emergency department", "title": "Vassar Brothers expands emergency facilities", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/87f6095b64054d101ed3d3bdf2fac24a660620c4/c=248-0-1744-1496&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Poughkeepsie/2014/09/15/dominantphotosavbmcer01.jpg", "creator": "@pokjournal", "site": "@pokjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=820459961", "fb": {"app_id": 179935365368749}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "That's what they're saying at the Vassar Brothers Medical Center emergency department, where a new annex is opening this week.\nThe expansion comes amid increasing emergency services locally and state and federal pressure to reduce emergency visits, when possible.\nSarah Curran, RN, tells reporters about some of the equipment in the newly expanded emergency department at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie Monday.\nVassar's Emergency Department has 126 workers, from nurses and technicians to clerical and support staff, plus seven doctors.\nLaura Bazarnick, vice president of the emergency department, said the department takes in an average of 175 patients per day and expects to treat about 68,000 visitors during this year."}
