The number of vets who sought PTSD treatment from the VA more than doubled between 2003 and 2012, from 190,000 to more than half a million vets, the report found.\n\n\u201cGiven that the DOD and VA are responsible for serving millions of service members, families and veterans, we found it surprising that no PTSD outcome measures are used consistently to know if these treatments are working or not,\" the report\u2019s author, Sandro Galea, professor and chair of the department of epidemiology at Columbia University in New York City, told NextGov. \u201cThey could be highly effective, but we won't know unless outcomes are tracked and evaluated.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bipartisan Deal Reached on Better Care for Veterans\n\nThe Institute of Medicine not only questioned the effectiveness of the treatment programs, but also raised questions about how well both departments\u2019 programs are structured.\n\nDOD\u2019s program is local and crisis driven \u2013 but it has very little \u201cplanning devoted to the development of a long-range approach to obtaining desired outcomes,\u201d the report said, adding that leaders within DOD aren\u2019t held accountable for \u201cfailing to implement programs meant to effectively manage PTSD in troops.\u201d\n\nThe report also raised questions about whether VA hospital administrations follow the agency\u2019s minimum-care requirements for veterans with PTSD. For its part, the VA is in the process of modernizing its electronic health record system, which will include the psychotherapy treatment plans of each patient \u2013 making cases easier to evaluate.\n\nThe report recommended that both departments develop an integrated PTSD management strategy to track patients\u2019 PTSD treatments and progress \u2013 which will ultimately help determine whether their programs are working.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every year, the federal government spends about $3 billion to treat veterans and soldi", "title": "$3B on PTSD Therapy for Soldiers That May Not Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/25/3B-PTSD-Therapy-Soldiers-May-Not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03072013_Veterans_Healthcare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/25/3B-PTSD-Therapy-Soldiers-May-Not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03072013_Veterans_Healthcare_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Every year, the federal government spends about $3 billion to treat veterans and soldi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca43\"", "article_summary": "The problem is \u2013 no one knows if the treatment programs are actually working.\nBetween 2010 and 2012, DOD spent $789.1 million on PTSD treatments \u2013 while the VA spent $8.5 billion in that same period.\nEvery year, the federal government spends about $3 billion to treat veterans and soldiers suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\nThe report recommended that both departments develop an integrated PTSD management strategy to track patients\u2019 PTSD treatments and progress \u2013 which will ultimately help determine whether their programs are working.\nThe number of vets who sought PTSD treatment from the VA more than doubled between 2003 and 2012, from 190,000 to more than half a million vets, the report found."}
