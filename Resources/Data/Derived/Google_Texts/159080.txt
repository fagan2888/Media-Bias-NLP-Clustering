President Obama might be warming up for his next career as on-air talent during Science Channel’s weeknight DNews segments all this week.

Having survived his first interview as POTUS on Fox News’ Chris Wallace-hosted Sunday Beltway show, Obama will guest present five segments for the network’s nightly science news coverage, Science Presents DNews, which airs weeknights at 9PM. His updates will cover a wide range of innovations in public health, space, and technology. Move coincides with the 2016 White House Science Fair on April 13, and the USA Science & Engineering Festival later in the week. During his two terms in the White House, Obama has touted advances in science, technology, engineering and math, calling them key to tackling some of the greatest challenges of our time.

“The science initiatives the Obama administration promote continue to make bold breakthroughs and breaking news,” channel GM Marc Etkind said in this morning’s announcement that he is “thrilled to have President Obama, a champion of science, present DNews updates to the Science Channel audience.”

DNews on Science Channel offers nightly updates about top news stories in science – from space happenings to the science behind other trending stories of the day. DNews, the web-native series that has racked up over 750 million views since launching in December 2012, is dedicated to bringing audiences online – and now on Science Channel – “entertaining doses” of science, the network said.

The segment is produced for Science Channel by Discovery Digital Networks; Wyatt Channell serves as executive producer.
