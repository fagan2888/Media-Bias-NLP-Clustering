The Atlantic Wire reported Oct. 24 that Palin took to her Facebook page to add to the growing number of conspiracy theories -- not a few of which concern the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, itself -- surrounding the Obama presidency.\n\n\"With the Obama White House\u2019s total lack of transparency,\" she wrote, \"it\u2019s no wonder that some will ask whether they staged even a fainting lady in the Rose Garden. What was once a major leap in logic has become a single step because President Obama has lied so often and so blatantly (\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep your plan\" comes to mind!).\"\n\nOf course, Palin's leap into fantasyland was derivative, pulling her new pet conspiracy theory about Obamacare from a more imaginative extremist -- a so-called \"truther\" -- whose theory of the fainting woman was relayed by conservative website The Drudge Report. Like the good journalist she never was, she at least attributed the theory with a link.\n\nBut this is what we've come to expect from the half-term governor of Alaska: Conspiracy theories (remember: Obamacare \"death panels,\" the 2009 Politifact \"Lie of the Year\"?), ridiculously incoherent statements, and mindless political rhetoric. And who can forget that she was also a birth certificate truther supporter of the Donald Trump \"investigation\" fiasco, a call for President Obama to release his actual birth documents to prove he wasn't born in Kenya.\n\nBut Sarah Palin stepped into the usually male-dominated realm of insensitivity to females when she penned: \"Whether accurate or not, for some reason I found this hilarious! Am I out of bounds for cracking up when I saw this take on a nauseated Obama fan, her absentminded pal, and our President's heroics this week? If so, penance paying I'll accept.\"\n\nLaughing at a pregnant woman nearly brought down by a bout of dehydration and a glaring sun? And she finds it \"hilarious?\"\n\nOffering to do penance if she's wrong comes off as a talking-behind-the-hand kind of duplicitousness, but if Palin is serious, perhaps a neverending vow of silence would be in order...\n\nBesides Michele Bachmann, Louie Gohmert, or Ted Cruz, there's only one other prominent politician (or ex-polititician) that has no problem turning themselves into some jingoistic exhibitionist without thought to reason or logic -- or simple human compassion. That person, of course, is failed 2008 vice presidential candidate and 2012 presidential run teaser Sarah Palin. No, simply because something is perceived as opposing, it is suspect and anything around it just might be orchestrated by a script to further the ends of the wily opponent.\n\nTo people like Sarah Palin, Obama's fainting woman, Karmel Allison, couldn't have simply been a pregnant woman from San Diego, a woman who wrote a blog that praised the existence of Obamacare and was invited to Washington to attend the health care speech. No, she was a plant, a staged prop, someone to be used as a metaphor: Of Obama as Obamacare stepping in to save those in need of health care insurance, as played by the nearly swooning Allison.\n\nBut Allison simply praised Obamacare. She still had not decided on signing on to another health care provider. It would seem that if she had been a prop for the president's signature piece of legislation that they would have chosen someone fully in the Obamacare sphere of influence.\n\nRegardless, conspiracy theories need the gullible and the easily led in order to prosper. They are facilitated by prominent names and celebrities who pass them along by lending credence through simple association. (Take, for instance, the \"death panels,\" another conspiracy theory only passed along by Palin. The idea was first concocted by Betsy McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York.) Being the seasoned politician she is (or was), Sarah Palin understands this and is all too willing to pass along the staged fainting woman conspiracy theory to her 3.8 million Facebook followers, a good number of which assuredly fit the gullible and easily led cookie-cutter psychological profile (as is noted in the 3.8 million number of likes to said insensitive Facebook post).\n\nNow, about that neverending vow of silence penance for making fun of a fainting pregnant woman...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin thinks that Karmel Allison took a dive -- that is, the Obama fainting woman episode at this week's Rose Garden health care speech was staged.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "The most memorable moment from President Obama&#039;s long speech on the problems with Healthcare.gov happened when a pregnant woman in a red dress nearly fainted in front of the entire country.", "title": "Sarah Palin finds conspiracy theory to explain Obama's fainting woman", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/10/dc/10dcc30a21dbdd63c7d3f7c2ff70a66f.jpg?itok=kWo9QkGa", "video": {"width": 480, "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 401}, "type": "movie"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah Palin thinks that Karmel Allison took a dive -- that is, the Obama fainting woman episode at this week's Rose Garden health care speech was staged.
