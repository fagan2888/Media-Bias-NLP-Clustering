Streaming services like Netflix and Amazon gave the traditional broadcast and cable networks a run, smaller networks joined in the production of serious dramas and offbeat comedies, and the options for time-shifting multiplied as the shows got better.\n\nHere\u2019s my personal 2014 top 10:\n\n1. \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d (CBS) Smart, consistently well-plotted and paced, this engaging drama has never gotten its due. Maybe it\u2019s the confining title. Great to see David Hyde Pierce in a key role opposite Julianna Margulies this season. We worried when Will Gardner (Josh Charles) was written out, but the series has reinvented itself beautifully.\n\nE 2. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (HBO) Visually dazzling, epic in scale with a phenomenal cast, the ever-shifting storylines about epochal, political and generational change in a mythic land keep ratcheting up the tension. Fire, ice, blood, mud, grit and glory\u2026. Whether you\u2019re in it for the romance or the gore, the mythology or the cinematography, the hours are suspenseful and rewarding.\n\n3. \u201cHomeland\u201d (Showtime) Welcome back! The show that stumbled badly last season regained its power, thankfully venturing into topical conundrums like drone warfare and Middle Eastern diplomacy and steering away from the home lives of its characters.\n\n4. \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon) Jeffrey Tambor delivers an Emmy-worthy performance as the patriarch of a modern L.A. family who is transitioning from male to female. Poignant, funny and surprisingly relatable, touching on universal themes of family dysfunction, the 10 binge-worthy episodes were perhaps the boldest surprise of the year.\n\n5. \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d (Netflix) The tragic, hilarious, moving ensemble dramedy about a woman\u2019s prison continued to hit a high mark in its second season, going even deeper into certain characters\u2019 backstories. (Lorraine Toussaint, amazing.) Creator Jenji Kohan proved quality television could turn up far from actual television, bringing a unique voice to the prison stories.\n\n6. Olive Kitteridge (HBO) Frances McDormand in the title role is a wonder. The pace of this adaptation of Elizabeth Strout\u2019s novel is remarkable for TV. The portrait of a long marriage is by turns tragic and funny. All in all, an achingly beautiful study of fragile human relationships directed by Lisa Cholodenko (\u201cThe Kids Are All Right\u201d).\n\n7. \u201cTrue Detective\u201d (HBO) Pushing the boundaries of TV\u2019s narrative style, with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson bringing their \u201cA\u201d games to the lead roles, this eight-hour serial jumped around in time exploring an old Louisiana murder case involving occult human sacrifice. Bizarre, yet with a surprisingly simple, uplifting conclusion.\n\n8. \u201cThe Affair\u201d (Showtime) Moody, complex, a murder mystery inside a romance, this medley of shifting male/female viewpoints tried our patience at times but proved worthy of close attention. Dominic West and Ruth Wilson exquisitely convey the problems of unreliable memories.\n\n9. \u201cThe Americans\u201d (FX) A period espionage story about KGB agents in Washington, D.C., in the early 1980s,is a triumph of taut storytelling. The multifaceted characters kept us guessing; clever casting including Margo Martindale as a KGB operative kept us enchanted. Keri Russell, Matthew Rhys and an array of wigs keep us wanting more.\n\n10. \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d (PBS) A treasure trove of never-before-seen archival photographs capped this terrific Ken Burns documentary, offering personal insights into the family and the personalities of FDR, Eleanor and Teddy.\n\nNow, then, regarding the absence of AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d on this list: A repetitive though wildly popular commentary on the human condition told through zombies, it\u2019s simply not a personal favorite.\n\n\u201cBut 15 million people watched the midseason finale!\u201d\n\nI know. I know. That\u2019s why people love/hate year-end lists.\n\nTen more series I wish I could have included here: FX\u2019s \u201cLouie,\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On\u201d and \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver,\u201d WGN\u2019s \u201cManhattan,\u201d Showtime\u2019s \u201cMasters of Sex,\u201d Fox\u2019s \u201cGotham,\u201d FX\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d CW\u2019s \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d Sundance TV\u2019s \u201cThe Honorable Woman.\u201d\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ostrow\u2019s list: the Top 10 TV shows of 2014", "title": "Ostrow\u2019s list: the Top 10 TV shows of 2014", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/03/ostrows-list-the-top-10-tv-shows-of-2014/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141203__20141205_C1_AE05TVOSTROWp1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141203__20141205_C1_AE05TVOSTROWp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T17:34:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T11:40:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfea7\"", "article_summary": "So much good TV, so little time.\nThe pace of this adaptation of Elizabeth Strout\u2019s novel is remarkable for TV.\n\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d (CBS) Smart, consistently well-plotted and paced, this engaging drama has never gotten its due.\nCreator Jenji Kohan proved quality television could turn up far from actual television, bringing a unique voice to the prison stories.\nAll in all, an achingly beautiful study of fragile human relationships directed by Lisa Cholodenko (\u201cThe Kids Are All Right\u201d)."}
