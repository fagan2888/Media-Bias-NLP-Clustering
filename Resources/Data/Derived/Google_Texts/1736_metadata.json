Here is a start:\n\nWhatever good Dr. Kent Brantly did in Liberia has now been overwhelmed by the more than $2 million already paid by the Christian charities Samaritan\u2019s Purse and SIM USA just to fly him and his nurse home in separate Gulfstream jets, specially equipped with medical tents, and to care for them at one of America\u2019s premier hospitals. (This trip may be the first real-world demonstration of the economics of Obamacare.) There\u2019s little danger of an Ebola plague breaking loose from the treatment of these two Americans at the Emory University Hospital. But why do we have to deal with this at all? Why did Dr. Brantly have to go to Africa? The very first \u201crisk factor\u201d listed by the Mayo Clinic for Ebola \u2014 an incurable disease with a 90 percent fatality rate \u2014 is: \u201cTravel to Africa.\u201d Can\u2019t anyone serve Christ in America anymore?\n\nIt\u2019s really something, this column. It has lit up my Facebook feed, and so far, all those hating on it are Christian conservatives. Well, count me among them. Still, underneath all the callousness, I think she has something of a point. Look:\n\nRight there in Texas, near where Dr. Brantly left his wife and children to fly to Liberia and get Ebola, is one of the poorest counties in the nation, Zavala County \u2014 where he wouldn\u2019t have risked making his wife a widow and his children fatherless. But serving the needy in some deadbeat town in Texas wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cheroic.\u201d We wouldn\u2019t hear all the superlatives about Dr. Brantly\u2019s \u201cunusual drive to help the less fortunate\u201d or his membership in the \u201cGold Humanism Honor Society.\u201d Leaving his family behind in Texas to help the poor 6,000 miles away \u2014 that\u2019s the ticket.\n\nWell, she\u2019s wrong about that: he took his family with them. They are a missionary family. They knew what they were getting into. It\u2019s revolting that Coulter accuses this man who, with his family, risked their lives to serve poor Africans, of doing so for the personal glory. Something is deeply wrong with that woman.\n\nThat said, I sometimes wonder about the priorities we American Christians have (and I count myself in this number too). I think there\u2019s nothing wrong, and everything right, about going overseas to serve the poorest of the poor. Do not misunderstand me here. The problem is, how often do we think about the suffering of the poorest people in our own country? Unlike Ann Coulter, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s an either-or question, nor do I question the motives of people who do what I have never done: go overseas to help the poor.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely easy to hate Coulter\u2019s column (you just have to have a heart, or a soul), but to be honest, I think it\u2019s fair to ask ourselves, as Christians, if at least some of us have a Mrs. Jellyby thing going on regarding foreign missionary work. Mrs. Jellyby is the \u201ctelescopic philanthropist\u201d in Dickens\u2019s Bleak House who was so caught up in causes to help the African poor that she neglected her own children, and those suffering in her neighborhood. In my case, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in recent weeks thinking about the plight of Christian refugees in Mosul. That is as it should be. But Coulter\u2019s nasty column made me face the fact that I almost never spend any time thinking about or doing anything as a Christian for the poorest people in my own country. Why is that? My Christian philanthropy is fairly telescopic too.\n\nUPDATE: Gang, I thought I was clear in the first posting: I think Coulter is almost entirely wrong. I say \u201calmost\u201d not because I believe that Dr. Brantly shouldn\u2019t have gone overseas as a medical missionary, or because I believe that American Christians should not go overseas \u2014 I don\u2019t believe either of those things, and I have written here before that Dr. Brantly is, in my view, a hero. And so are all those men and women like him. I say \u201calmost\u201d because her column, as vicious and as ugly as it is, touches on an important truth about what some of you call \u201cvolontourism.\u201d In a different context, it\u2019s the kind of thing William Deresiewicz spoke of in his recent essay on the kind of students who get into the Ivy Leagues, and the service projects they list on their college applications:\n\nI\u2019ve noticed something similar when it comes to service. Why is it that people feel the need to go to places like Guatemala to do their projects of rescue or documentation, instead of Milwaukee or Arkansas? When students do stay in the States, why is it that so many head for New Orleans? Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise, when kids are trained to think of service as something they are ultimately doing for themselves\u2014that is, for their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. \u201cDo well by doing good,\u201d goes the slogan. How about just doing good?\n\nHere\u2019s a great response to the Coulter column by TimG, who is a regular reader and a missionary:\n\nWhew, writing as a missionary in Mexico, this is pushing all sorts of buttons for me! I should just go to bed and write in the morning! Just a few observations about missions and the Body of Christ:\n\n1. \u201cCalling\u201d, \u201cvocation\u201d (about which Rod writes sometimes), and \u201cdiversity of gifts\u201d are all concepts that run throughout Christianity\u2019s various branches. We\u2019re all gifted and called to different places and different needs\u2013whether full time \u201cprofessionally\u201d or in \u201clay\u201d capacity. And the Body of Christ is certainly big enough to allow for some to go to Africa and others to go to Zavala County and others to stay in\u2026Starhill, LA, Tacoma, WA, or wherever. Calidali and others of you have already made this point. 2. You go where you are called, gifted, and enabled. It\u2019s called obedience. The history of Christian missions is long and complicated and, sadly, messy. But Christians have always gone and served and died for their faith. Africa, in question here, is full of the graves of missionaries. If Brantly was called there (with his family) then he was in the right place. When my oldest son was a week old, I had a co-worker\u2019s wife tell me \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly take your baby to Mexico! It\u2019s so dangerous there!\u201d And that was before the worst of the drug violence. Well, we\u2019re supposed to be here, so there\u2019s no safer place to be. That would bring me to the next point: 3. People in the US aren\u2019t generally qualified to comment on \u201crisk.\u201d Here we live in a place where drug addiction is so widespread the state police made our neighborhood the focal point for a major cleanup operation 2 years ago. There\u2019s plenty of crime, the schools are bad, teenage pregnancy is high. And yet we walk all over the neighborhood, including after dark. You have to live somewhere to know what the risks really are. And then you live with them. 4. Of course the question is, $2 million to evac them? And of course Cosimanian Orthodoxy would leave them to die rather than pay that! Heck, I\u2019d probably die before I racked up that kind of bill. I\u2019ll admit to not even reading Coulter, but giving her the benefit of the doubt on the numbers, I would suspect they had medical evacuation insurance. That\u2019s totally just a guess and I\u2019m not taking the time to look it up, but that\u2019s pretty par for the course. 5. I\u2019m really shocked at how little credit people give to actual ministries in the US. Just a quick Google of Zavala Country reveals 10 churches in the county, of all branches. I would find it hard to believe that there are Christians ministering there right now. Could they use more help? Probably. Are they doing everything perfectly? No, probably not. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019re there. And churches DO make trips within the US to serve. A big trend is \u201cIncarnational Ministry\u201d, for believers to move back into the city, into hurting neighborhoods and to be the Body of Christ there. That\u2019s been trendy (mostly in a good way) since I was in college. We\u2019ve had a couple of youth groups come down to work with us this summer and they also take kids to Chicago and West Virginia to serve in needy areas. This is a classic case of the \u201cExcluded Middle\u201d. Having believers serve in Africa does not exclude (or exempt) others from serving in a different place. I\u2019ve loved Rod\u2019s focus on \u201clocality.\u201d It\u2019s fun to read about the joys of life in the small-town South, which is a world very far removed from the NW, where I grew up. But I\u2019ve also appreciated his balance in recognizing that a) you can\u2019t always go back home\u2013sometimes because of calling and b) you can create that community where you are. It\u2019s our (my family\u2019s, and our team\u2019s) calling and privilege and joy to be doing that here. Could we do it in the US? Yes. Would we like to be in the US? We aren\u2019t 3500 miles from family because we want to get away from them. Rather, we\u2019re where we\u2019ve been called to go, for as long as we\u2019re called to be here and we wouldn\u2019t be anywhere else. Last Sunday a friend asked me, \u201cWhere would you live of all the places you\u2019ve been?\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019ve already chosen. I\u2019m here.\u201d I would guess that Brantly and his family would say the same.\n\nUPDATE.2: Reader Mark makes a strong point about the effects of Jellybyism in his own family:\n\nThis touched a nerve for me. My great grandfather was a Baptist missionary to China. He and his wife were captured and killed in the Boxer rebellion in 1900. They left 4 orphaned kids back in England, and the effects of his unfortunate death reverberated down through the generations, in particular a strong and perhaps understandable surge of atheism among his children (my grandparents). I\u2019ve often wondered why he did what he did, why he didn\u2019t stay home and help the inner city poor of England \u2013 plenty of work to do there, still is. Some combination of strong faith, desire to evangelize and a wandering spirit I suppose. Probably more a taste for adventure than a desire for recognition. I\u2019ve read some of his letters to his kids back in England, in which he speaks of his duty to help the downtrodden of China, and describes in detail his building of a church, homes and gardens for his flock. I wonder how his children, back in an English boarding school, felt reading that?\n\nUPDATE.3: Icarus writes:\n\nMy first cousin once removed spent twenty years as a missionary in Chad. Her husband and daughter left half-way through the mission because of the civil war there, but she persevered. Finally, her parents got her out by a ruse (\u201cfather had a heart attack; not expected to survive\u201d). Back in civilisation and comforts of a war-free urban life, she was hit by a motorcyclist two weeks later and died. Why did she do it? We thought she was crazy. Then I met a man who had spent time with her in Chad. There are entire villages where women work in weaving workshops that she set up; the looms are named after her. She could have helped poor people in her home country, but she could never been able to bring so much good to so many people for so long if she had been elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE.4: Charles H.
