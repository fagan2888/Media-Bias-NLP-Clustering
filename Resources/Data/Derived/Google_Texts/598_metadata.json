Ben Cardin (D-MD)\u2014is now definitely in the cards (pun intended) and will pose the next major obstacle to the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Program of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and the P5+1. Those who are focusing on what the Republicans are planning, such as the ludicrous idea of suing the president for allegedly failing to submit to Congress an agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran, are missing the point. The game now is to presume unanimous Republican support for any bill that the White House opposes and to get a sufficient number of Democrats who are nervous about their vote on Thursday to sign on to something approximating Cardin\u2019s bill, including at least a couple of its numerous \u201cpoison pills,\u201d to ensure a veto-proof majority.\n\nNote, for example, AIPAC\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d statement to its membership after Thursday\u2019s vote (a good example of trying hard to squeeze lemonade out of lemons) in which it looks forward to what it calls:\n\nFuture Legislation: By achieving the largest possible bipartisan rejection of this deal, and by ensuring that even those who supported the deal were aware of its weaknesses, we established the strongest possible foundation for future congressional action. Iran\u2019s past and current behavior shows the continued danger of the threat. We will now work with Congress on a broad agenda to respond to the dangers posed by this agreement: (1) to establish congressional oversight and monitoring of the agreement; (2) to take steps to clarify our commitments to our allies and strengthen our ability to enforce the agreement; (3) to develop a new strategy working with Israel and our Arab allies to counter Iranian aggression in the region; and (4) to enhance Israel\u2019s security and deepen the vital U.S.-Israel strategic partnership.\n\nThis statement is entirely consistent with Cardin\u2019s bill despite AIPAC\u2019s insistence all last week to inquiring reporters that it had nothing to do with that \u201cIran Policy Oversight Act of 2015\u201d draft summary that we published on September 3.\n\nNow comes The Washington Post\u2018s lead editorial in its Sunday print edition, \u201cNext Steps On Iran.\u201d Although the Post supported the JCPOA as the least bad of the alternatives, its hyper-interventionist, often neocon/liberal-hawk editorial board is now speaking favorably about Cardin\u2019s legislation, including such \u201cpoison polls\u201d as imposing new sanctions for Iran\u2019s support for Hezbollah or \u201csponsorship of a terrorist attack on a U.S. target,\u201d not to mention delivery of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) to the Israelis so they can presumably attack Iran\u2019s Fordow facility. Here are some of the Post\u2019s less-than-helpful ideas:\n\nThe measures that could be included in a post-deal package start with a clarification of U.S.?intent regarding Iran\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Congress can make clear that Mr. Obama or his successor will have support for immediate U.S. military action if an Iranian attempt to build a bomb is detected. One trigger could be verification that Tehran is producing highly enriched uranium; another would be the resumption of work on warhead designs and materials. Such a statement by Congress could not be binding, but it would tell Iran and U.S. allies in the region that the nuclear deal has not taken the U.S. military option off the table. Other steps could be aimed at deterring Iran from using the billions it will gain from the lifting of sanctions to step up its support for Hezbollah, the Assad regime in Syria and other proxies. Tehran is claiming that the accord prevents the United States from reimposing sanctions in the future. But Congress can make clear that new sanctions can and will be adopted for non-nuclear offenses, such as weapons deliveries to Hezbollah or sponsorship of a terrorist attack on a U.S. target. Legislation can also mandate new U.S. support for Israel. A 10-year security agreement, due to expire within three years, could be renewed and expanded; Congress could support the delivery to Israel of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb developed to destroy an Iranian nuclear facility buried under a mountain. The greatest risks of the nuclear accord are that Iran will seek a bomb in spite of the constraints it accepted and that it will escalate its attempt to establish hegemony over the Middle East by force. While Congress can\u2019t now overturn the deal, it can pragmatically address both of these threats.\n\nAmid all the talk about how Bibi and AIPAC and the Israel lobby (and the Saudis) were decisively defeated in the Senate on Thursday, this is a very useful reminder that it was one battle\u2014albeit a very important one\u2014in a long war being waged by the above-mentioned three against any possible d\u00e9tente, let alone rapprochement\u2014or, God forbid, any actual cooperation\u2014between Washington and Tehran. And they still have an influential ally in the editorial board of the U.S. capital\u2019s major newspaper.\n\nFollow LobeLog on Twitter and like us on Facebook\n\nAbout the Author Jim Lobe served for some 30 years as the Washington DC bureau chief for Inter Press Service and is best known for his coverage of U.S. foreign policy and the influence of the neoconservative movement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critical Perspectives on U.S. Foreign Policy", "og": {"site_name": "LobeLog", "description": "by Jim Lobe AIPAC\u2019s Plan B\u2014codified in the\u00a0\u201cIran Policy Oversight Act of 2015\u2033 of Sen.
