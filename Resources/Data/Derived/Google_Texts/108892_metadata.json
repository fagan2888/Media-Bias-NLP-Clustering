The audit takes the agency to task for not doing more.\n\nA California Department of Public Health spokesman said no one was available for comment on Friday.\n\nBecause of declines in federal funding, California in 2012 shuttered nine regional centers devoted to reducing gestational diabetes. Now it has just a website with information on the condition, which can affect nearly 10 percent of pregnancies.\n\nBut the state is not alone in underfunding prevention efforts, according to advocates.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re on the bottom of the pile on this, but what money is out there for diabetes is just a pittance across the country, when you look at the size of the problem of diabetes,\u201d said Michael Chae, executive director of the American Diabetes Association\u2019s regional office in Oakland. \u201cI\u2019d say you could take this report for most large states and it would read similarly.\u201d\n\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body either cannot make enough insulin to control blood sugar (Type 1) or cannot process insulin normally (Type 2). Although diabetes can be controlled with medications and lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, the yearly health care and related costs of the disease have been estimated at $27.5 billion in California alone, according to the American Diabetes Association.\n\nThe state auditor\u2019s report acknowledged that the state public health agency appropriately spends its federal dollars. It also recently received new federal grants for diabetes prevention efforts in four counties. But the report faulted the agency for not doing more to identify additional funding and for not expanding programs to other counties with high diabetes rates. Auditors were able to identify two additional federal grants totaling $1 million that the state could have applied for but did not.\n\nThe auditor described the public health agency\u2019s stated goal of preventing diabetes in 380,000 people by 2022 as \u201clofty.\u201d It concluded, however, that the agency \u201cwill need to do more than it has been able to in the past with its limited funding.\u201d\n\nNationwide, nearly 30 million Americans live with diabetes and about 1.7 million people are newly diagnosed each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 2.3 million California adults report they have been diagnosed with diabetes and many others are considered to have the disease but do not know it. Still others are considered to be at high risk, or \u201cprediabetic,\u201d based on their blood sugar levels.\n\nChae and other diabetes advocates said they have tried repeatedly over the years to persuade lawmakers to devote state money to diabetes prevention, to little avail.\n\nIt\u2019s challenging to convince lawmakers and the public to devote more money to diabetes prevention, Chae said, because the disease is often unfairly characterized as a lifestyle problem caused by poor choices such as unhealthful eating and inadequate exercise. In addition, it progresses slowly, and symptoms are often invisible for years.\n\nHowever, years of state reliance on federal grants alone has resulted in uncoordinated programs and staffers who come and go as the grants do, said Joan Werblun, a retired nurse and longtime advocate who helped found the Diabetes Coalition of California.\n\n\u201cWhen you get these grants, you\u2019re so tied into the specifics of the grants, and most of the time, it\u2019s about data collection on how the grant is going,\u201d Werblun said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the money\u2019s going. The state\u2019s very happy to point at their projects, but they\u2019re very small and there\u2019s no continuation when the money\u2019s gone. What we need are more people in the communities doing the work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state spent just 3 cents per person on diabetes prevention in 2012-2013.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Ranks Dead Last in Spending on Diabetes Prevention\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/02\\/02\\/california-ranks-dead-last-in-spending-on-diabetes-prevention\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-02 13:59:02\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-02 17:16:36\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23778,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Diabetes\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/02\\/iStock_000015895198_Large-e1422914274182.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The state spent just 3 cents per person on diabetes prevention in 2012-2013.", "title": "California Ranks Dead Last in Spending on Diabetes Prevention", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/02/02/california-ranks-dead-last-in-spending-on-diabetes-prevention/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/02/iStock_000015895198_Large-640x428.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "diabetes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe100b\"", "article_summary": "It also recently received new federal grants for diabetes prevention efforts in four counties.\nChae and other diabetes advocates said they have tried repeatedly over the years to persuade lawmakers to devote state money to diabetes prevention, to little avail.\nNo state funding is available for diabetes prevention in California, although the Department of Public Health has solicited the federal grants for programs in some counties, according to the report.\nA California Department of Public Health spokesman said no one was available for comment on Friday.\nBecause of declines in federal funding, California in 2012 shuttered nine regional centers devoted to reducing gestational diabetes."}
