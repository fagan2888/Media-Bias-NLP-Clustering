Earlier in the week, a right-wing anti-immigration party in Sweden claimed its largest-ever share of parliamentary votes. And in the United States, new census data released this week showed that middle-income American families made 8 percent less last year, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 2007.\n\nWhat these stories have in common is this: They lay bare a crisis of faith in the global elite.\n\nThere has been an implicit agreement in modern democracies: It is fine for the wealthy and powerful to enjoy private jets and outlandishly expensive homes so long as the mass of people also see steadily rising standards of living. Only the first part of that bargain has been met, and voters are expressing their frustration in ways that vary depending on the country but that have in common a sense that the established order isn\u2019t serving them.\n\nIt was evident not just in last week\u2019s votes in Scotland and Sweden, but also in a wave of votes for parties of the far left and the far right in European parliamentary elections earlier this year, in the rise of the Tea Party in the United States and in instability in Japanese politics that led to six prime ministers since 2007.\n\nThe details of Scotland\u2019s grievances with the English ruling class are almost the diametrical opposite of those, say, of the Tea Party or Swedish right-wingers. The Scots want more social welfare spending rather than less, and they have a strong antinuclear environmental streak. (Scotland\u2019s threatened secession was less the equivalent of Texas pulling out of the United States than of Massachusetts or Oregon doing the same.)\n\nBut there are always people who have disagreements with the direction of policy in their nation; the whole point of a state is to have an apparatus that channels disparate preferences into one sound set of policy choices. What distinguishes the current moment is that discontent with the way things are going is so high as to test many people\u2019s tolerance for governing institutions as they now exist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is simple economic math behind it. Consider the United States, which has had stronger growth than Britain, Japan or Continental Europe since the financial crisis and the deep recession it spawned. The United States economy is now 6.7 percent bigger than it was at the end of 2007.\n\nBut that masks what has been a miserable last several years for most working Americans. The Census Bureau said last week that the inflation-adjusted median household income \u2014 pay for people at the exact midpoint of the income distribution \u2014 was $51,939 in 2013, up just $180 from 2012 and still 8 percent below 2007 levels.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140920152005, "twitter": {"description": "The independence movement in Scotland was another sign of
