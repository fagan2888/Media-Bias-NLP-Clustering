The candidates for the Republican nomination for president gathered in New Hampshire Saturday for a debate in advance of Tuesday's primary.

After a bungled introduction – Ben Carson looked like he got lost in a hallway on the way to the stage – the debate quickly turned contentious when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie went after Florida Sen. Marco Rubio complaining that Rubio could do nothing but give the canned response that “his advisers gave him.”

As the night went on, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he stood by a call for "carpet bombing" areas controlled by the ISIS; Ohio Gov. John Kasich and businessman Donald Trump said they are conservatives and can prove it; Carson, Cruz and Trump slammed the Affordable Care Act, and everyone asked said they had no fear of taking on Hillary Clinton should she win the Democratic nomination. Ben Carson missed his cue.

Here are a few outtakes from Saturday’s debate

An apology from Cruz

Cruz apologized to Carson for announcing on the night of the Iowa caucuses that he was leaving the race, but according to a story from CNN, Cruz “knowingly misstated CNN's reporting during Saturday night's Republican primary debate in an effort to evade responsibility for misleading statements his campaign made about Ben Carson.”
