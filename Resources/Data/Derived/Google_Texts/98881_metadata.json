Kennedy was in office.\n\nA key US healthcare inflation gauge updated earlier this week shows medical care inflation rising 0.55% in January, compared to January 2014. This is the slowest rate since 1961, when healthcare inflation fell sharply amid a broad anti-inflation push launched by Kennedy. (The anti-inflation push came to a famous head when Kennedy all but declared war on US Steel for backing out of a wage and price deal the White House had brokered.)\n\nWhile healthcare prices started to decline in 2008 as the US economy soured, they\u2019ve taken a sharp leg lower after the passage and implementation of the US Affordable Care Act, widely known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d in 2010. Some would argue that this merely reflects lessened utilization of healthcare in the aftermath of a recession. That was true for a while. But real spending on medical care\u2014as well as medical hiring\u2014have both turned up sharply over the last year, suggesting rising demand.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how important this. Galloping healthcare inflation was one of the prime reasons the US fiscal future has looked so bleak. Roughly one out of every four dollars spent by the government in the US has gone toward medical care in recent years, mostly through the giant federal programs Medicare and Medicaid. In 2014, lower-than-expected medical costs was one of the main reasons the US budget deficit amounted to a smaller-than-expected 2.8% of GDP.\n\nThe mechanism by which Obamacare has corralled healthcare costs remains kind of murky. But it\u2019s important to recognize that a big part of the new law\u2014including caps on Medicare payments and penalties for costly readmissions\u2014was intended to do just that. And it\u2019s working.", "article_metadata": {"bitly-verification": "3cc1017cee1d", "description": "The\u00a0cost of healthcare is rising at\u00a0the slowest rate since President John F.
