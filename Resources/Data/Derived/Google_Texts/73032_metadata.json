France awarded Johnson and Roberts the Croix de Guerre with palm for their actions, but Johnson went unrecognized by the United States.\n\nObama said Johnson was denied a Purple Heart medal despite being wounded 21 times and was so disabled he could not go back to his pre-war job as a railway porter. Johnson died in 1929.\n\nShemin received the Distinguished Service Cross, one step below the Medal of Honor, but little explanation was offered for why the higher award for which he was nominated was not approved.\n\nAfter Army service, Shemin ran a landscaping business in New York and had three children. He died in 1973.\n\n(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Doina Chiacu)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "By Ian Simpson    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama awarded posthumous Medals of Honor, the highest U.S. award for bravery, on Tuesday to two soldiers for gallantry during World War One, c", "title": "Obama Awards Posthumous Medals of Honor to World War One Soldiers", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/culture/obama-awards-posthumous-medals-of-honor-to-world-war-one-soldiers/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/medal-of-honor-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/medal-of-honor-150x150.jpg", "description": "By Ian Simpson    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama awarded posthumous Medals of Honor,", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Awards Posthumous Medals of Honor to World War One Soldiers"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf330\"", "article_summary": "BY:By Ian SimpsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2013 President Barack Obama awarded posthumous Medals of Honor, the highest U.S. award for bravery, on Tuesday to two soldiers for gallantry during World War One, cases that were dogged by concerns over discrimination.\nWorries about racism have tinged the delay in awarding the medals to Johnson and Shemin.\n\u201cThey both risked their own lives to save the lives of others,\u201d Obama said in the White House ceremony.\nObama awarded the medals to Sergeant William Shemin of Bayonne, New Jersey, and Private Henry Johnson, of Albany, New York, 97 years after they saved comrades on French battlefields.\nTwo of Shemin\u2019s daughters, Elsie Shemin-Roth of Webster Grove, Missouri, and Ina Bass, accepted the Medal of Honor on behalf of their father."}
