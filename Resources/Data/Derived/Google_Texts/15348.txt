Cooling temperatures, gusty winds and a slight chance of rain or snow are making their way to Denver on Saturday, forecasters said.

With a high of 44 degrees and a 10 percent chance of precipitation, forecasters with the National Weather Service in Boulder are expecting a chilly start to the weekend.

A weather disturbance moving across Colorado on Saturday is likely to produce around one to two inches of snow in the mountains with isolated rain or snow showers possible along the Front Range.

Wind gusts could reach 17 mph and are expected to usher in cooler air.

By nightfall, the weather is supposed to clear up as high pressure and dry air make their way over the state from the West.

On Sunday, temperatures are expected to warm up to a high of 52 degrees with mostly sunny skies.

Temperatures are shaping up to be above normal through Thursday, the weather service said.
