When Seattle Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson spied a U.S. soldier huffing his bag to a seat in coach on a recent flight to Seattle, the nice guy QB immediately upgraded the solder to a seat in first class.

Wilson has a business relationship with Alaska Airlines so when he saw the soldier headed down the aisle he instantly thought that he could give the soldier a happier, more comfortable flight.

The soldier was flabbergasted and jumped on Twitter to tell the world of the kindness Wilson extended.

Russell Wilson was on my flight back to seattle and he brought me up to first class. Mad respect! #clutch â€” Kane Bernas (@co_kane144) April 30, 2015

Wilson responded that it was his pleasure and took the time to have a few photos taken with the flight crew.

Don't ever undervalue the importance of consistency. #IFlyAlaska @AlaskaAir A photo posted by Russell Wilson (@dangerusswilson) on Apr 29, 2015 at 11:28pm PDT

The Seahawks star has made quite a name for himself as one of the nicest guys in the NFL, and with moves like this he can only burnish that reputation all the brighter.
