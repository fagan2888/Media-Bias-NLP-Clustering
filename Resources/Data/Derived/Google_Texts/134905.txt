The Weld County Sheriff’s Office is investigating after finding two people dead in a burning car on Saturday.

A vehicle fire was reported near the intersection of Weld County roads 96 and 57 near Nunn at about 10:07 p.m., according to a press release.

The Nunn Fire Department put out the fire, and the two in the vehicle were declared dead at the scene.

“Due to the excessive damage to the vehicle, this will most likely be a prolonged investigation as we attempt to identify the individuals involved and investigate the cause of the accident,” the release said.

The Weld County coroner was also on the scene, and is conducting a full investigation.
