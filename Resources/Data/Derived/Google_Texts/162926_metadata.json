Dads on the other hand are offered $6,000 more.\"\n\nIn Washington state, mothers make less than 69 cents for every dollar fathers make. Annually, the gap amounts to $19,000 less for Washington mothers.\n\nRowe-Finkbeiner says U.S. lawmakers should update the Paycheck Fairness Act so that wages in companies are more transparent and patterns of inequality can be identified.\n\n\"When we're talking about discrimination against moms, we're talking about a lot about subconscious, implicit bias,\" Rowe-Finkbeiner states. \"There isn't a committee of people saying, 'Let's pay moms less.' It's a lot of subconscious, small decisions that significantly add up over time in a really big way.\"\n\nRowe-Finkbeiner says paid family leave, affordable child care, and easy access to health care can also help lower the wage gap.\n\nAs head of Moms Rising, Rowe-Finkbeiner hears many stories from working mothers. In one case, a woman came to a sad realization when she looked around and found most of her co-workers were women.\n\n\"She walked up and she asked the director, 'Why are there so many women here?'\" Rowe-Finkbeiner relates. \"And he said, 'Because I can pay them less.' And then she wrote in and said the part that's heartbreaking, which is 'I hadn't yet learned I was less valuable than a man.'\"", "article_metadata": {"rights": "Copyright 1999-2016.
