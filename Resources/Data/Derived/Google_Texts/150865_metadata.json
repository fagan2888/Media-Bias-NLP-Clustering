In other words, there is a relationship between the removal of citizenship and the way that a society relates to its expelled members. For Senator Cruz, \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is not merely a criminal \u2013 \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is subhuman, a demon to be exorcised. That this legislation could even be debated in Congress is marks our deep entrenchment in a racialized culture of fear.\n\nThen there is the fact that Senator Cruz believes that he stands to gain politically by introducing this legislation \u2013 by advocating for stripping the most basic and fundamental of rights from fellow Americans (when we already have means to prosecute offenders under criminal law). What is obscured when we erase the humanity of \u201cthe terrorist\u201d? To openly and genuinely consider what might drive a young American to join the Islamic State requires us to see \u201cthe terrorist\u201d as rational, thinking, feeling being. If \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is constituted as nothing more than wickedness, then the logic of the War on Terror remains intact \u2013 as the struggle of good over evil, lightness against dark. It is the dehumanization of the \u201cterrorist,\u201d the Muslim Other, that drives and enables the immensity of our own bruality. According to a report recently released by Physicians for Social Responsibility, about 1.3 million people have died as a result of the US War on Terror \u2013 and that is a conservative estimate.\n\nCitizenship stripping for political gain is part of our American history. Emma Goldman was deported in 1919 after having her citizenship revoked. \u201cNot alone foreigners, but the naturalized citizen and the native-born are to be mentally fumigated, made politically \u2018reliable\u2019 and governmentally kosher, by eliminating the social critics and industrial protestants, by denaturalization and banishment, [and] by exile\u2026\u201d she wrote in a pamphlet authored from Ellis Island. Her words may seem far removed from today\u2019s political realities \u2013 but they remind us that political motivations drive citizenship stripping, whether in the context of the Red Scare or the War on Terror.\n\nNot surprisingly, the proposed legislation has been vocally opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sent a letter to all senators soon after the bill was introduced, saying that \u201cThe bill turns the whole notion of due process on its head\u201d and that \u201cGovernment officials do not have the power to strip citizenship from American citizens who never renounced their citizenship and were never convicted of a crime.\u201d\n\nThe sponsors of the Expatriate Terrorist Act, which compels us to believe that our survival depends on the dehumanization of someone else, would like us to think that the real existential threat to our country is the misled young men and women who have joined ISIS. It is not. The existential threat to our country is posed by Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz, and all those who believe that government is entitled to run roughshod over human rights to score political points. Our very humanity depends on recognizing the humanity of others \u2013 yes, even \u201cterrorists.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "For Senator Cruz, \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is not merely a criminal \u2013 \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is subhuman, a demon to be exorcised.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "For Senator Cruz, \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is not merely a criminal \u2013 \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is subhuman, a demon to be exorcised.", "title": "The Expatriate Terrorist Act: An American Culture of Fear", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/112900/the-expatriate-terrorist-act-an-american-culture-of-fear/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150402-expatriate-terrorist-1.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Citizenship stripping for political gain is part of our American history.", "title": "The Expatriate Terrorist Act: An American culture of fear", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/112900/the-expatriate-terrorist-act-an-american-culture-of-fear/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150402-expatriate-terrorist-1.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Terrorism,Politics"}, "article_summary": "For Senator Cruz, \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is not merely a criminal \u2013 \u201cthe terrorist\u201d is subhuman, a demon to be exorcised.\nTo openly and genuinely consider what might drive a young American to join the Islamic State requires us to see \u201cthe terrorist\u201d as rational, thinking, feeling being.\nThat this legislation could even be debated in Congress is marks our deep entrenchment in a racialized culture of fear.\nCitizenship stripping for political gain is part of our American history.\nIt is the dehumanization of the \u201cterrorist,\u201d the Muslim Other, that drives and enables the immensity of our own bruality."}
