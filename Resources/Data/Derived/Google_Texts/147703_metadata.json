But Haug added that law enforcement agencies tend to focus on large-scale drug busts rather than possible cannabis oil use.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved cannabis oil for medical use, meaning vape shops are selling an unregulated product that could end up harming a customer, said Rusty Payne, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nGov. C. L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have decriminalized cannabis extract oil without loosening Idaho\u2019s marijuana laws.\n\nThe veto was a blow to advocates pushing legalization, particularly for families who argue the oil can be used to reduce the amount and duration of seizures in children with epilepsy.\n\nAfter vetoing the bill, Otter issued an executive order directing the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to study and possibly implement an expanded access program that would help children with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\nTwelve states have legalized the oil while they still ban medical marijuana.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the governor did issue an executive order regarding a possible expanded access program for treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Coeur d\u2019Alene Press, http://www.cdapress.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Law enforcement officials in northern Idaho are worried local vape shops may be violating the state's strict anti-marijuana laws by selling oil derived from cannabis plants.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/7/northern-idaho-police-concerned-over-marijuana-oil/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Law enforcement officials in northern Idaho are worried local vape shops may be violating the state\u2019s strict anti-marijuana laws by selling oil derived from cannabis plants.", "title": "Northern Idaho police concerned over marijuana oil sales"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Law enforcement officials in northern Idaho are worried local vape shops may be violating the state's strict anti-marijuana laws by selling oil derived from cannabis plants.", "card": "summary", "title": "Northern Idaho police concerned over marijuana oil sales"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "COEUR D\u2019ALENE, Idaho (AP) - Law enforcement officials in northern Idaho are worried local vape shops may be violating the state\u2019s strict anti-marijuana laws by selling oil derived from cannabis plants.\nBut Haug added that law enforcement agencies tend to focus on large-scale drug busts rather than possible cannabis oil use.\nThe oil is a non-psychotropic extract, meaning users are unable to get high using the product, the Coeur d\u2019Alene Press reported (http://bit.ly/1gQk4BT ).\n\u201cThrough word of mouth,\u201d he said, \u201cit has caught on pretty quickly.\u201dPost Falls Police Chief Scott Haug said the oil is illegal under Idaho law, however, because it comes from a marijuana plant.\nC.
