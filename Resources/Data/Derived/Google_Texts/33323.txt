Ohio State University football coach Urban Meyer endorsed home-state Gov. John Kasich for president on Thursday, encouraging him to “go win this darn thing” four days before Ohio’s winner-take-all primary.

“The leadership you’ve shown in the state of Ohio since we’ve been back — and even before, your friendship, as a friend and true supporter now that I really know what you stand for — we’d like to tell you to do your best and go win this darn thing,” Meyer told Kasich in a video the campaign posted online.

Meyer is an Ohio native who coached the University of Florida football team to two national championships before returning home to guide the Buckeyes to a title in 2014.

Kasich’s presidential campaign faces judgment day in Ohio's winner-take-all contest on Tuesday. The Ohio governor, who has yet to win any state, has said if he doesn’t win on his home turf on Tuesday he’ll drop out of the race.

Kasich is popular at home — a Fox News survey released Wednesday found he has a 79 percent approval rating.

But polls show a tight race, with Donald Trump holding a 2.5-point advantage in the RealClearPolitics average.

Kasich on Thursday also rolled out endorsements from editorial boards at The Cleveland Plain Dealer and Akron Beacon Journal.
