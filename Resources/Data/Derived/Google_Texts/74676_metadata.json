Comments were originally due February 2.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association asked for more time to review documents provided by the commission. The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute said it needed more time to review the reproducibility and repeatability of the tests the commission has proposed.\n\nThe rules would impose safety standards including lateral stability measures, a minimum level of rollover resistance and speed controls. The commission is trying to keep ATVs from being able to flip over and crush their drivers and/or passengers.\n\nManufacturers would be required to limit the maximum speed of these vehicles to no more than 15 miles per hour when seat belts for both the driver and front passenger are not fastened.\n\n\u201cThe commission believes that when rollovers do occur, improving occupant protection performance by increasing seat belt use will mitigate injury severity,\u201d the proposed rulemaking said.\n\n\u201cCPSC\u2019s analysis of ROV [recreational off-highway vehicles] incidents indicates that 91 percent of fatally ejected victims were not wearing a seat belt at the time of the incident.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The federal rules would limit off-road vehicle speeds to 15 mph when seat belts are not used.", "description": "The federal rules would limit off-road vehicle speeds to 15 mph when seat belts are not used.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The federal rules would limit off-road vehicle speeds to 15 mph when seat belts are not used.", "title": "Safety commission delays ATV rules", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237968-consumer-product-safety-commission-delays-rules-for-off-road-vehicles", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/atv_122414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237968-consumer-product-safety-commission-delays-rules-for-off-road-vehicles", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-06T10:56-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Land transport, ATVs, All-terrain vehicle, Seat belt, Rollover, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Rulemaking, Transport,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-06T10:56:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237968-consumer-product-safety-commission-delays-rules-for-off-road-vehicles", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The federal rules would limit off-road vehicle speeds to 15 mph when seat belts are not used.", "card": "summary", "title": "Safety commission delays ATV rules"}, "dcterms.title": "Safety commission delays ATV rules"}, "article_summary": "The Consumer Product Safety Commission is delaying new safety rules for recreational off-road vehicles.\nThis is the second time the rules for all-terrain vehicles (ATV), first proposed on Nov. 19, have been delayed.\nThe rules would impose safety standards including lateral stability measures, a minimum level of rollover resistance and speed controls.\nADVERTISEMENTThe Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association asked for more time to review documents provided by the commission.\n\u201cCPSC\u2019s analysis of ROV [recreational off-highway vehicles] incidents indicates that 91 percent of fatally ejected victims were not wearing a seat belt at the time of the incident.\u201d"}
