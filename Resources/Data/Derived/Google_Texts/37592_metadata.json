This startlingly pink old male breaching off the starboard bow is an Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, native to the waters surrounding Hong Kong.\n\nCalves are born slate-gray, but as they grow, the gray fades to mottled pink. Adults are a pure white color that often flushes to rose. Standing next to me in the bow, Samuel Hung, director of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, smiles as he recognizes the scar pattern on the dolphin to the right of us. This battered creature is an old friend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s EL01,\u201d Hung tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s been here since the early 1990s. From those marks, I can tell that he must be a warrior.\u201d\n\nLittle is known about the private life of south China\u2019s Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, which is known here as the Chinese white dolphin. But Hung, who has been studying this population since he was a graduate student and EL01 was young, guesses that the male earned his scars battling for mates.\n\nAlthough these dolphins are beloved local icons\u2014they were Hong Kong\u2019s official mascot in 1997 when the British ceded power to China, and that year their image adorned flags all over the city\u2014massive construction projects around the busy harbor are threatening the region\u2019s population. EL01 might be a warrior, but unless Hong Kong\u2019s government moves to protect the local dolphin population, this could be one fight that he and his fellows can\u2019t win.\n\nIndo-Pacific white dolphins thrive in the shallow, murky waters of coastal estuaries in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Small populations exist at river mouths scattered from South Africa to southeastern China. New genetic evidence suggests that these dolphins comprise four distinct species separated by geography and differences in behavior. No one knows how many exist in the world, and many populations have never been studied, but each population faces threats in their corners of the sea.\n\nMore than a century ago, the fishermen who plied Hong Kong\u2019s waters in small boats revered these animals. As the city grew from a fishing village to an international economic powerhouse\u2014with the busiest harbor on the planet\u2014the dolphins have paid the price. The Hong Kong population had already plummeted to 158 animals in the early 2000s; by last year, Hung\u2019s census found just 60 left.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government only began to fund studies of the local dolphins when construction of Chek Lap Kok airport started in the 1990s. Built on landfill stretching into the harbor, the airport obliterated prime dolphin habitat. Machines drove pilings deep into the harbor floor with a deafening din. The noise overlapped with the same frequencies that dolphins use to communicate and locate prey. Sound is vital to all dolphins, Hung notes, but because Chinese white dolphins live in turbid water, they\u2019re even more dependent on their ears.\n\nAs the city grew from a fishing village to an international economic powerhouse\u2014with the busiest harbor on the planet\u2014the dolphins have paid the price.\n\nDuring airport construction, dolphins fled the area, though some returned after things settled down\u2014only to encounter new threats. Dolphin \u201ceco-tours\u201d sprang up in Hong Kong; Hung says they often harass the animals, getting too close and moving too fast. High-speed, hydrofoil ferries that shuttle passengers between central Hong Kong and outlying islands added to the danger. Dolphins that wash up dead in the area have often been seriously wounded\u2014slashed by propellers, their bodies beaten against hulls. Last May, tourists on a dolphin-watch boat were stunned to see a mother dolphin and several other adults struggling to keep a dead calf afloat. The incident made headlines in the South China Morning Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activists say development will add to already intense air pollution and could endanger the city's favorite mascot", "title": "Booming Hong Kong puts pink dolphins in peril", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Activists say development will add to already intense air pollution and could endanger the city's favorite mascot", "title": "Booming Hong Kong puts pink dolphins in peril", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/15/rapid_development_in_hong_kong_threatens_the_future_of_the_pink_dolphin_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_164233874.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Activists say development will add to already intense air pollution and could endanger the city's favorite mascot", "title": "Booming Hong Kong puts pink dolphins in peril", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_164233874.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sharon Levy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, China, Chinese Economy, development, Environment, Environmentalism, Hong Kong, OnEarth.org, pink dolphin, sustainability", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3514\"", "article_summary": "Topics: China, Chinese Economy, development, Environment, Environmentalism, Hong Kong, OnEarth.org, pink dolphin, sustainability, Sustainability NewsThis article originally appeared on OnEarth.org.\nThe Hong Kong population had already plummeted to 158 animals in the early 2000s; by last year, Hung\u2019s census found just 60 left.\nSound is vital to all dolphins, Hung notes, but because Chinese white dolphins live in turbid water, they\u2019re even more dependent on their ears.\nHigh-speed, hydrofoil ferries that shuttle passengers between central Hong Kong and outlying islands added to the danger.\nMore than a century ago, the fishermen who plied Hong Kong\u2019s waters in small boats revered these animals."}
