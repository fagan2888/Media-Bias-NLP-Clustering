In short, the pool of potential customers has been enlarged by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 People who were uninsured probably didn\u2019t have an existing relationship with a doctor. That diminishes reluctance on their part to be treated by an unfamiliar face.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for medical treatment, period,\u201d Yates said. \u201cThey\u2019re not basing it on a relationship.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Having relied on emergency rooms during health crises, they\u2019ve grown accustomed to getting treatment right away, without waiting for an appointment, Yates said.\n\n\u201cTheir past exposure to health care has been the ER,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir model of health care is, \u2018I need to go see someone right now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen Keena White\u2019s 10-year-old son broke his thumb in a baseball game this week, the Bloomfield woman bypassed several hospital emergency rooms to take him to PM Pediatrics, an urgent care facility in Livingston that is open until midnight.\n\n\u201cHospitals usually have a lot of people waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, they stick with their motto: They\u2019re truly urgent.\u201d\n\nAnd, an emergency room visit would cost \u201cway more,\u201d she said.\n\nPM Pediatrics co-owner, physician Jeffrey Schor, said his chain probably won\u2019t see a huge bump from the ACA, simply because previous government programs have already insured children.\n\nOther economic forces are also fueling urgent care success, said Katherine Hempstead, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation expert in insurance, health care price transparency and value.\n\nThe main one is a simple pocketbook concern: Health insurers have gradually been getting stingier about reimbursing visits to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s an appropriate use of the emergency room, you\u2019re going to have a big cost share,\u201d she said.\n\nMost of the plans available through HealthCare.gov come with a big deductible that has to be met before anything is covered. If someone seeks treatment for a sprained ankle, they\u2019re probably going to have to pay for it out-of-pocket.\n\nPeople are going to learn \u2014 perhaps the hard way \u2014 that going to the emergency room for a non-life-threatening issue is going to hit them hard in the wallet.\n\na long wait could be in store at er\n\nA 2013 study reported the median charge for outpatient conditions in the emergency department was $1,233. By contrast, the insurer Aetna puts the average cost of an urgent care visit at $110 to $150. (Cost aside, call 911 or go to an ER if you experience chest pain, uncontrolled bleeding, sudden or severe pain, coughing or vomiting blood, severe allergic reaction, difficulty breathing, sudden dizziness, weakness, or changes in vision, severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea, or changes in mental status, such as confusion, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians.)\n\nBesides costing more, ERs also take a long time if you haven\u2019t been shot, in a car accident, or in the throes of a heart attack, said William Gluckman, an emergency room physician who founded FastER Urgent Care in Morris Plains. Having worked in busy urban ERs, he knew that patients whose illnesses weren\u2019t life-threatening usually waited a long time.\n\nThe newly insured may not realize that very few policies cover everything from the moment the ID card arrives, Gluckman said. Such patients often seem surprised their insurance doesn\u2019t cover their visit because they\u2019re still meeting their deductibles.\n\nThe popularity of doc-in-a-box establishments also reflects the industry\u2019s belated acceptance of other ways to deliver health care besides the classic face-to-face appointment with a doctor, said Hempstead.\n\nThat time-honored model often means a bit of waiting on the part of the patient: waiting for an appointment, then waiting again at the appointment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not particularly imaginative,\u201d Hempstead said. \u201cIt\u2019s one solution to every problem: a face-to-face meeting with a medical doctor.\u201d That\u2019s the gold standard of clinical care, but it has its drawbacks.\n\nUrgent care offers timeliness \u2014 an important factor when it\u2019s nearly bedtime and a parent suspects a child has an earache. In those situations, she said, \u201cpatients don\u2019t want to call some office that\u2019s only open 9 to 5 and get an appointment for three weeks from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople want a little more choice now. They want care when they need it, and urgent care fits that model,\u201d said Schor. \u201cPeople are aware now there are more alternatives to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nUrgent care appointments usually cost more than routine appointments at a doctor\u2019s office, but Hempstead said the convenience of a quick resolution has to be factored into their value.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that much more, if you\u2019re looking at having to skip work or miss school otherwise,\u201d Hempstead said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@health','@river','obamacare'", "title": "Obamacare expected to be boon to urgent care facilities", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare expected to be boon to urgent care facilities\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/05/obamacare_expected_to_be_boon_to_urgent_care.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/05/15007078-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12986375\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-22T11:05:52Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@health\",\"@river\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/05/15007078-small.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The newly insured have policies with high deductibles, giving them a reason to avoid the emergency room."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, May 23, 2014, 12:52 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/05/15007078-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The newly insured have policies with high deductibles, giving them a reason to avoid the emergency room.", "title": "Obamacare expected to be boon to urgent care facilities", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/05/obamacare_expected_to_be_boon_to_urgent_care.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, May 22, 2014,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "The newly insured have policies with high deductibles, giving them a reason to avoid the emergency room."}, "article_summary": "Urgent care offices \u2014 dubbed a \u201cdoc-in-a-box\u201d when the medical facilities debuted two decades ago \u2014 are expected to thrive under Obamacare.\nNew Jersey is seeing an 18- to 20-percent annual growth rate in urgent care facilities, according to Sam Yates of the Urgent Care Association of New Jersey.\nThey want care when they need it, and urgent care fits that model,\u201d said Schor.\nOther economic forces are also fueling urgent care success, said Katherine Hempstead, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation expert in insurance, health care price transparency and value.\nUrgent care offers timeliness \u2014 an important factor when it\u2019s nearly bedtime and a parent suspects a child has an earache."}
