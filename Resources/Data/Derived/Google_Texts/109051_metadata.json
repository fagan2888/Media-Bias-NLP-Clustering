What\u2019d you play?\u201d\n\nCillizza: \u201cLeft out.\u201d\n\nKucinich: \u201cOHHH! That just happened!\u201d\n\nCillizza: \u201cWalked right into it!\u201d\n\nCillizza is the poster boy of PostTV. He drops phrases like \u201cwilly nilly.\u201d He owns an unreasonable number of plaid shirts. \u201cIt\u2019s tiiiime for the highlight reel!\u201d he declares in a recent bit, as he and Kucinich proceed to list the most fascinating recent events in Washington. \u201cOne hundred seconds on the clock!\u201d he calls out, as a timer ticks down to zero, past such bombshells as \u201cDefunding Obamacare in August\u2019s Kaiser tracking poll\u201d and \u201cA bill to expand Medicaid narrowly passed Michigan legislature.\u201d This is what happens when a newspaper decides to look around its newsroom for camera-ready characters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to find out who had the worst week in Washington, sent to us via the Twitters!\u201d he announces one Friday afternoon (shirt: blue plaid) as a brightly colored wheel plastered with the faces of Anthony Weiner, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell, among others, starts spinning. Cory Booker wins, with a carnival-game ding ding ding. \u201cHere are our five memorable DC political moments of the summer!\u201d Cillizza says in another segment, during a countdown that includes such curveballs as DOMA being stuck down and Obama\u2019s remarks on Trayvon Martin.\n\n\u201cOn Background,\u201d the PostTV interview show that launched this summer, is more serious-minded by comparison. Which does not always translate into edifying television. \u201cHip hop is now so mainstream that first lady Michelle Obama is using it to sing the praises of vegetables\u2014yes, vegetables,\u201d the anchor, political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson, says one afternoon, apparently targeting that remaining sliver of the American public that is unaware of the first lady\u2019s pro-vegetable stance. For a segment about the intern economy, one guest gets the moniker \u201cDC INTERN.\u201d The first prompt lobbed in her direction is \u201cSo, you\u2019ve been an intern.\u201d\n\nBut you can\u2019t dismiss PostTV as an amateur-hour investment. The Post directory cites 42 full-time employees working in the newspaper\u2019s video division. The PostTV app is available on mobile devices and can be streamed on Google TV, and has promised to expand to more platforms in the near future. It currently totals over thirty hours of airtime per month. And it has stirred up some confusion within the newsroom. \u201cI have zero clue why it exists or what the point is, and would honestly love to know,\u201d one employee, who asked not to be identified so as to avoid offending the Post powers-that-be, told me. \u201cFrom our end,\u201d said another, \u201cwe\u2019re a little mystified as to what the plan is.\u201d\n\nIt should be said that plenty of PostTV is clear-cut newsroom segments featuring reporters and columnists commenting on the news, i.e. Post journalists weighing in usefully on the administration\u2019s handling of Syria. But the birth of PostTV is the story of every old-school newspaper scrambling to diversify, locked in a kind of multimedia arms race. PostTV is up against video powerhouses at other major publications. USA Today has a news analysis show called USA NOW that produces reports like \u201cHow hip is hula hooping?\u201d alongside interviews with USA TODAY editors about foreign affairs. The New York Times\u2019 online edition features documentary-like reporting along with tete a tetes among its critics, such as David Carr and A.O. Scott on arts and culture. The Wall Street Journal was an early adopter in the video game, and its programming, available on various platforms including Yahoo! and Samsung, is an instructive deep dive into current events\u2014for instance, a media reporter unpacking the CBS Time Warner deal or the health and science editor explaining the new math of healthcare. It also makes no attempt to jazz up its basic knowledgeableness. \u201cLacking big hair and big personalities, the video operation is consciously unlike television,\u201d wrote the Times of WSJ Live in 2011.\n\nThe main lesson of PostTV may be that making television is harder than it looks. It\u2019s the sort of thing true-blue ink-stained newspaper types hate to acknowledge: Putting on a television show involves a specific skillset\u2014you can't conjure that TV intangible called personality out of thin air. In other words, you can\u2019t just drag a reporter out of a newsroom and turn him into a \u201cpersonality.\u201d That\u2019s as true for Pulitzer-laden veterans as it is for staff writers with less serious demeanors. Like, say, Cillizza, the ambassador of PostTV\u2019s brand of wonky uncool.\n\nConsider one recent segment, where Cillizza (shirt: pink plaid) takes to the anchor desk to report that former Nevada senator John Ensign, felled by a sex scandal in 2011, is currently opening up his own animal hospital. The camera cuts to a photo of Ensign brandishing a dog beside a posse of female veterinary assistants. A tale of cute animals and personal redemption: It's pretty familiar fare to anyone who's ever watched local TV news in a midmarket American metropolis. But is the \"Live at Five\" schtick off-brand for an organization whose great skill involves decoding the most powerful city on Earth? If so, Cillizza doesn't betray it. This, Cillizza declares happily, is \u201cthe best thing we\u2019ve seen all day!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It\u2019s 2:06 pm on a Tuesday and Capitol Hill reporter Paul Kane is reporting from the Capitol building atrium for The Washington Post\u2019s PostTV.
