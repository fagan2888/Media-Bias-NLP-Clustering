Stop bullying the poor.\n\nStewart took aim at Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback in a recent segment, arguing that the Sunflower State\u2019s treatment of the poor was essentially bullying. A new state law introduced back in April restricted those in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program from spending any of their benefits on things like \u201clingerie, cruises, tattoos, piercings, and movie tickets.\u201d Stewart mocked Brownback saying, best case scenario, it would motivate people to escape the culture of federal dependency.\n\n2. Hold tight to your political convictions, but don\u2019t be a hypocrite.\n\nUp until very recently, Stewart had made a point of ignoring former Vice President Dick Cheney. He finally caved in an April segment, in which he threw on his sleuth cap and got to the bottom of Cheney\u2019s lies in an investigation piece called \u201cThe Jon Stewart Mysteries.\u201d The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host singled out one quote from an interview with Hugh Hewitt, in which he said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more terrible burden to leave the next president than what Obama\u2019s creating here.\u201d No? Not even the Bush administration? Stewart suggested.\n\n3. Always read the things you are signing off on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The Daily Show\" has given us a wealth of tips on how to make our great nation even greater.
