I believe, if the promises made to by proponents of SB21 turn out to be true (that ACES and MAPA are relatively revenue neutral), we have about the right balance on oil taxation. However, our failure to develop a natural gas pipeline has meant one of our largest economic resources has remained stranded and thus untapped revenues to Alaska. I intend to correct that. Additionally, we need to work diligently with Congress to ensure revenue sharing of federal royalties for offshore production (although not a tax, it will be a key source of revenue in the coming decades).
