Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, won final passage in the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nState Sen. Steve Thompson, the Democrat from Marietta, notes that the legislation takes 11,000 minority voters out of District 2 (South Cobb), represented by Republican Bob Ott, and places them in District 4 (Southwest Cobb), represented by Democrat Lisa Cupid.\n\nThe shift will have the effect of limiting African-American voting influence to a single district in the county for the foreseeable future, Thompson said.\n\nSome powerful paragraphs from Jon Gillooly of the Marietta Daily Journal:\n\nThompson said he was surprised Cupid, the lone Democrat on the Board of Commissioners, didn\u2019t object to the map. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to be safe, but you\u2019re going to be part of this new segregation,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like these new cities they\u2019re introducing all over north Atlanta. What they\u2019re doing, we\u2019re going to have lily white districts and black districts. And whether we debate the lunch counter again 20 years from now, I don\u2019t know. It may not be racial on some people\u2019s part, but the net effect is.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAn InsiderAdvantage survey of 486 voters in Georgia, conducted for WAGA-TV, has Gov. Nathan Deal (38 percent) trailing Democrat Jason Carter (41 percent) in the race for governor, with Carter at 41% and Deal at 38%. The survey\u2019s +/- 4.3 percent margin of error puts the contest at a statistical tie.\n\nSome health skepticism is required here. A January poll by Insider Advantage showed Deal at 44 percent and Carter at 22 percent. An AJC statewide poll at about the same time gave Deal 47 percent to Carter\u2019s 38 percent. IA pollster Matt Towery points to Deal\u2019s problems with a late January snowstorm, the first of two, for the Republican incumbent\u2019s dip in popularity.\n\n***\n\nHouse Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, D-Atlanta, on Thursday endorsed former state Rep. Elena Parent for State Senate District 42, the seat being vacated at the end of the year by Jason Carter. That\u2019s on top of support from several other House members. Parent faces Decatur attorney Kyle Williams in the Democratic primary. The Williams campaign points out that it\u2019s toting endorsements from Atlanta City Council members Kwanza Hall and Alex Wan, and Jim Baskett, the mayor of Decatur.\n\n***\n\nGov. Nathan Deal signed the second bill of the 2014 legislative session on Thursday. Senate Bill 318, sponsored by state Sen. Lester Jackson, D-Savannah, authorizes the sale of adult beverages in bars on Sundays during the celebration of St. Patrick\u2019s Day in Savannah, Ga. The first bill, signed weeks ago, moved the state\u2019s primary to May 20.\n\n***\n\nThe State Bar of Georgia\u2019s three-day Constitutional Symposium concludes today at the Westin Buckhead with a whopper of a keynote.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will give an address on the U.S. Constitution. We\u2019re told he\u2019s in favor of it.\n\n***\n\nEager to show that he can consolidate tea party forces ahead of the GOP Senate primary, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun on Wednesday rolled out endorsements from tea party leaders and groups in Carroll County, Walton County, Hart County, Golden Isle and Northeast Georgia. On Thursday, Georgia Conservatives in Action \u2013 run by longtime activists Pat Tippett and Kay Godwin \u2013 chimed in with its backing, calling Broun \u201ca tried, true, and trusted friend for the values that Georgians treasure.\u201d\n\nRep. Phil Gingrey, considered a rival for the arch-conservative corner of the electorate, was apparently unfazed. On Thursday, the National Journal caught him on wandering over to the Senate side of the Capitol and chatting with Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb. What was Gingrey doing in the upper chamber?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just measuring the drapes,\u201d he quipped. But seriously, he was busy meeting a few folks he intends to be working with next year.\n\n***\n\nThe U.S. Senate, in a spasm of actual legislation, sent a flood insurance reform bill to the president on Thursday. One of the chief sponsors was Georgia Republican Johnny Isakson, who said he had plenty of constituents hurting from big spikes in premiums under the federal flood insurance program.\n\nOne Iraq war veteran came up to him in Brunswick, Isakson said, and said he bought a house two years ago for $89,000. The man showed Isakson last year\u2019s flood insurance premium bill for $2,300, then this year\u2019s for $23,200.\n\n\u201cIt was an extreme case,\u201d Isakson said, \u201cbut not an isolated case.\u201d\n\nThe bill drew flak from conservative groups for bringing a heavy federal hand back into a program it was wriggling out of. Isakson said the previous Biggert-Waters bill in 2012 had the right idea but was too abrupt. The new bill caps most premium hikes at 18 percent.\n\n***\n\nA bipartisan group of senators also struck a deal on restoring expired federal long-term unemployment benefits for five months, including retroactive payments for those who were booted off the rolls in December. The cost is offset through a variety of measures, detailed here. .\n\nThe Senate won\u2019t vote on the plan until the end of the month, as it\u2019s taking a week off. Isakson said he had not seen the details so couldn\u2019t say which way he\u2019d vote, but that any unemployment extension must be paid for.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/03/14/new-cobb-county-commission-map-segregates-voters-senator-charges/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/032012legcharter02.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "A bill that will redraw district lines for the Cobb County Commission is an attempt to maintain GOP influence by segregating black and white voters, a white state senator from Marietta is charging.\r\n\r\nHB 1028, sponsored by state Rep.
