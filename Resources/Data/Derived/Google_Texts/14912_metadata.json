Keeping costs under control will require pressure on providers, not on consumers, John McConnell, PhD, a health economist at Oregon Health & Science University, told an audience of health professionals attending Oregon Health Forum\u2019s breakfast meeting on Thursday.\n\nHe said that while copayments and deductibles do work to hold down the cost, they work primarily by patients avoiding care but not avoiding higher cost providers. Getting the price information in advance is very difficult for patients, but even with greater price transparency, patients are unlikely to use such information because as many as two-thirds of healthcare costs stem from emergencies. \u201cConsumers are not very good at shopping,\u201d he said.\n\nLynn Quincy of the national Consumers Union told the crowd that $1 trillion of the $3 trillion spent on healthcare is unnecessary since costs vary from hospital to hospital, often irrespective of quality. \u201cHigh prices do not purport to good outcomes,\u201d she said.\n\nOnly about 10 percent of that waste is administrative, Quincy said, and McConnell argued that administrative costs in the traditional Medicare plan -- which hover around 3 percent -- are too low and that weak oversight of Medicare leads to tremendous fraud.\n\nThe obstacle to removing the waste may be political more than anything.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people invested in that $1 trillion in activity,\u201d said Tom Culhane, medical director of Atrio Health Plans. .\n\nMcConnell said states like Michigan and Massachusetts, where BlueCross BlueShield plans predominate, the insurer had success stemming costs through its market power and an investment and reform of the primary care spending model. But, Oregon\u2019s healthcare system is more complicated since the commercial market is divided among so many players, giving the hospitals the upper hand on price negotiations.\n\nInstead, the Oregon Health Authority has set aside anti-trust laws to convene a collaborative of the major health insurance players and will try to imitate what BlueCross had been able to do by itself with primary care.\n\n\u201cWhen we invest more in primary care, we get better results and lower costs,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, D-Portland, the lone state legislator to speak at the forum.\n\nCulhane said the system had seen incremental success in reducing cost drivers in the past, such as when the federal government delineated diagnostic-related group hospitals and made long hospital stays a source of expense for the hospitals after it had been a source of revenue.\n\nCharity Care\n\nAlmost all Oregon hospitals avoid paying taxes on their business profits since they are non-profit entities. That status requires them to spend an indefinite amount of their windfall on charitable services such as offering free care to the uninsured. But the Affordable Care Act has significantly reduced that number, leaving hospitals able to come up with their own definition of charity care. .\n\nMcConnell said the IRS requires the hospitals to file annual reports outlining their charity plans, but since that requires only a written narrative, there\u2019s no way to quantify it.\n\nTo diffuse pressure, the hospitals have been orchestrating a public relations campaign to get policymakers and regulators to consider the difference between their list price and the amount Medicare and Medicaid are willing to spend as a \u201closs for community benefit,\u201d which would free them from having to spend as much on real charity.\n\nAs an example, despite reporting an uptick in profits of 7.3 percent in 2015, Legacy CEO Dr. George Brown has claimed that his health system \u201clost\u201d $172 million from low Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nBut as Rep. Mitch Greenlick, D-Portland, told the Willamette Week, that kind of math would be like a Subaru dealer claiming a loss because he knocked $10,000 off the bloated sticker price.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "Keeping costs under control will require pressure on providers, not on consumers, John McConnell, PhD, a health economist at Oregon Health & Science University, told an audience of health professionals attending Oregon Health Forum\u2019s breakfast meeting on Thursday.\nCharity CareAlmost all Oregon hospitals avoid paying taxes on their business profits since they are non-profit entities.\nAs an example, despite reporting an uptick in profits of 7.3 percent in 2015, Legacy CEO Dr. George Brown has claimed that his health system \u201clost\u201d $172 million from low Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\nMost waste in the healthcare system is caused by huge over charges by hospital providers.\nBut, Oregon\u2019s healthcare system is more complicated since the commercial market is divided among so many players, giving the hospitals the upper hand on price negotiations."}
