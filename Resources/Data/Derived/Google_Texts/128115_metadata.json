The guides wanted the anglers to use a crawdad imitation, but Kirk strayed. \u201cI always want to try something different,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough a guide told him smallmouth in the river seldom if ever took a surface fly, he tried it anyway. \u201cIn one hole I hooked three bass that were more than five pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell in love with that fly right there.\u201d\n\nOn the Upper Illinois Kirk said he most often casts the fly to the edge of the bank, gives it one good twitch to pull it about a foot off the bank, and then lets it sit. \u201cUsually if they\u2019re going to hit it they get it real quick,\u201d he said.
