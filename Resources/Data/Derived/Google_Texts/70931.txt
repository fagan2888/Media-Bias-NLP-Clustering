A man sentenced to 60 years in prison after he caused an accident that killed three people at an Aurora ice cream shop lost his appeal Thursday.

The Colorado Court of Appeals reaffirmed the 19 convictions against Francis Hernandez, who was found guilty in 2010 of killing Marten Kudlis, 3, Patricia Guntharp, 49, and Debra Serecky, 51.

In 2008, Hernandez was traveling more than 80 mph on South Havana Street when he hit a small pickup driven by Guntharp, who was turning into a strip mall. Her pickup plowed into a Baskin-Robbins, killing Guntharp and Serecky, as well as the boy, who was inside the shop with his mother.

The mother survived, but several others were injured.

“The defendant committed a horrible, vile crime that involved the death of three people, including a child whose life barely started,” Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said in a news release Friday. “Prison is the only suitable place for Mr. Hernandez.”

The case received media attention because, among other things, Hernandez was living in this country illegally and had been cited or arrested several times by law enforcement agencies but was not turned over to federal authorities for potential deportation.

Hernandez won’t be eligible for parole until May 2038.
