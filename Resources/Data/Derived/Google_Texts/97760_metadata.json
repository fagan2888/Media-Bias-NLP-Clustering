Over the past year alone, doctors have successfully separated conjoined twins, given a cancer patient a titanium rib cage, and created muscle, bone, and ears from 3D-printing materials. This list continues to grow; in December 2015, a man in his 60s received the first 3D-printed vertebrae. Without it, he would have become fully paralyzed.\n\nThe patient, Drage Josevski, suffers from a condition known as Chordoma cancer, a type of malignant tumor that \u201ccan occur in the bones of the spine and base of the skull,\u201d according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. It\u2019s so rare, in fact, that it occurs in only 1 percent of all malignant bone tumors, which make up about 0.2 percent of all cancers. One case per million are diagnosed each year, and about one in 125,000 people currently live with the disease.\n\nBecause of Chordoma\u2019s proximity to so many vital structures in the head and spine, it\u2019s very difficult to treat. In Josevski\u2019s case, the tumor had formed on the top two vertebrae in his neck \u2014 the ones that play roles in swiveling and tilting the head. The more the tumor grew, the more of a chance Josevski had of it severing his spine, turning him into a quadriplegic.\n\nDr. Ralph Mobbs, an Australian neurosurgeon, took charge of treating the tumor, and relied on 3D printers and Australian medical device manufacturer Anatomics. In a combined effort, they were able to create exact replicas of the two vertebrae made out of titanium, according to Mashable. Anatomics even created entire replicas of Josevski\u2019s spinal anatomy for doctors to conduct practice runs before the surgery.\n\n\u201c3D printing of body parts is the next phase of individualized health care,\u201d Mobbs told The ABC Australia. \u201cTo restore bones, joints, [and] organs with this type of technology really is super exciting. [H]ere is our opportunity to really take it out there and to keep pushing the boundaries on the whole 3D-printed body part business.\u201d\n\nMobbs described the surgery as \u201cparticularly complicated and long and difficult.\u201d It lasted 15 hours, and involved \u201cexposure at the top of the neck where the neck and the head meets. It's essentially disattaching the patient's head from his neck and taking the tumour out and reattaching his head back onto his neck.\"\n\nThough it was considered an overall success, there was one complication. The surgery was completed through Josevski\u2019s mouth, which stayed open the entire time. Two months afterward, Josevski\u2019s daughter said he is still struggling to speak and eat properly \u2014 Mobbs expects the complication will fix itself over the next few months. On the bright side, Josevski has full motion in his head and neck, which is tumor-free.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "3d-printed vertebrae, quadriplegic, chordoma cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Australian surgeons made medical history in 2015 by surgically inserting two 3D-printed vertebrae into the spine of a man with Chordoma cancer, keeping the man from becoming a quadriplegic.", "title": "3D-Printed Vertebrae Saves Man From Becoming Quadriplegic", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-vertebrae-quadriplegic-chordoma-cancer-375378", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/26/3d-printed-vertebrae.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Australian surgeons made medical history in 2015 by surgically inserting two 3D-printed vertebrae into the spine of a man with Chordoma cancer, keeping the man from becoming a quadriplegic.", "title": "3D-Printed Vertebrae Saves Man From Becoming Quadriplegic", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-vertebrae-quadriplegic-chordoma-cancer-375378", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/26/3d-printed-vertebrae.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/26/3d-printed-vertebrae.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2016-02-26T13:42:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-26T13:42:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Australian surgeons made medical history in 2015 by surgically inserting two 3D-printed vertebrae into the spine of a man with Chordoma cancer, keeping the man from becoming a quadriplegic."}, "article_summary": "This list continues to grow; in December 2015, a man in his 60s received the first 3D-printed vertebrae.\nBecause of Chordoma\u2019s proximity to so many vital structures in the head and spine, it\u2019s very difficult to treat.\nThe more the tumor grew, the more of a chance Josevski had of it severing his spine, turning him into a quadriplegic.\nIt's essentially disattaching the patient's head from his neck and taking the tumour out and reattaching his head back onto his neck.\"\nOn the bright side, Josevski has full motion in his head and neck, which is tumor-free."}
