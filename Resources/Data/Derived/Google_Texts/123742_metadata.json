Pat Quinn bragged Tuesday about the more than 100,000 people he said have enrolled through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Quinn left out two very important facts. Almost all of those people were early enrollees last year, and every single one of them enrolled in Medicaid.\n\n\u201cOne-hundred-thousand people in Cook County have signed up for County Care, the early enrollment (Medicaid) program,\u201d said Mike Claffey, a spokesman for the state Department of Insurance. \u201cAll those people will be transitioned into the Medicaid portion of the ACA come Jan. 1.\u201d\n\nCounty Care is a special Obamacare trial program only for those people who reside in Cook County.\n\nSo what about the rest of Illinois, and the people going to Illinois\u2019 Obamacare marketplace?\n\n\u201cMore than 14,000 have submitted applications for the state\u2019s expanded Medicare program,\u201d a news release from Claffey\u2019s office boasts.\n\nThe state, however, has no idea how many people may have signed up for private insurance through the marketplace. Claffey said those numbers will have to come from Washington, D.C.\n\nState Rep. Patti Bellock, R-Hinsdale, said she is not surprised Quinn is bragging about adding more than 100,000 people to Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe presumed that at least 350,000 would come on to Medicaid under the expansion,\u201d Bellock said. \u201cAnd my expectation is that the number will be somewhere between 500,000 to 700,000 people.\u201d\n\nBellock is the GOP point person on Medicaid in the Illinois House of Representatives. She has been trying to tell Quinn and his fellow Democrats that\n\nIllinois is taking a huge risk by opening Medicaid to that many people.\n\n\u201cWe want to provide care for the most vulnerable population in Illinois. But the expansion is going to cost us a lot more money, even if it is federally matched,\u201d Bellock said.\n\nThe federal government promised Illinois \u2014 and other states that have expanded their Medicaid eligibility \u2014 that Washington will pay 100 percent of the cost for newly eligible Medicaid patients for three years, and 90 percent of the costs after that.\n\nUnless Congress changes its mind.\n\n\u201cIf in these debt ceiling talks, Congress pares (the extra match) back to 65 percent, which is what President Obama has suggested the last two years, you would be looking at a $6.5 billion cost to the state of Illinois,\u201d Bellock said.\n\n\n\nIllinois already spends $12 billion on Medicaid each year. The federal match bumps that up to about $17 billion.\n\nBellock said even with the extra federal money, Illinois still will see its Medicaid costs rise about $1 billion a year.\n\nThe state also has a huge problem of providing Medicaid to those who should not receive it. A private review of the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls found that about a third on Medicaid are ineligible.\n\nBellock expects that number to grow with the Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cBecause they are so backed up and so hurried, (the federal Healthcare and Human Services office) said they were just going to let people use the honor system,\u201d Bellock said.\n\nThat means no income verification or residency check for those enrolling in Medicaid in Illinois.\n\nBellock has asked for monthly reports to check up on Medicaid enrollment, and said she hopes the private review of the state\u2019s health care program can act as some kind of check to the expansion of Obamacare.\n\nContact Benjamin Yount at BYount@Watchdog.org and find him on Twitter @BenYount", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois state Gov.
