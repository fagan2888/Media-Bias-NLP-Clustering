JUNEAU, Alaska, July 18 (UPI) -- The pilot of a small plane died and four passengers aboard were injured after the aircraft slammed into an Alaskan hillside Friday.

The Wings of Alaska Cessna 207 was headed from Juneau, Alaska to Hoonah, Alaska when it went down some 18-miles from the airport near Point Couverden.

About 1:30 p.m. Friday, the Juneau Police Department said it got a 911 call from a passenger on the aircraft. The Coast Guard launched a Jayhawk helicopter out of Air Station Sitka and the Coast Guard Cutter Liberty was diverted from patrol to the area. Alaska State Troopers and Juneau Mountain Rescue were also involved in the search.

The four survivors were taken to area hospitals with "significant injuries." Alaska State Troopers identified the pilot as 45-year-old Fariah Patterson of Birmingham, Ala. The passengers were Humberto Herrera, 57, and his wife, Sandra, 60, both of Juneau; Jose Vasquez, 15, of Puerto Rico; and Ernestine Hanlon-Able, 64 of Hoonah.

Two were listed in stable condition, one in serious and the fourth in critical condition.

The crash put Hoonah residents on edge because they depend on air travel to the area.

"We rely on air travel so much being from an island out here that it concerns us whenever we hear of plane crashes anywhere. This is very close to home and the whole town is curious and anxious to know more," Hoonah mayor Ken Skaflestad said.
