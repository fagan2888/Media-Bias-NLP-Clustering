You\u2019ve said that you\u2019d rather have no deal, than sign the one that\u2019s on the table,\u201d Baker said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible deal,\u201d Trump interjected.\n\n\u201cMost economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents,\u201d Baker continued. \u201cWhy would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TPP is horrible deal,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cIt is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It\u2019s a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. It\u2019s 5,600 pages long, so complex that nobody\u2019s read it. It\u2019s like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed.\u201d\n\nTrump continued to speak on his opposition to the deal, noting that he still loves trade. \u201cI\u2019m a free trader, 100 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need smart people making the deals, and we don\u2019t have smart people making the deals.\u201d\n\nBaker responded, and said that Trump was correct about the fact that 5,000 pages of the deal were published. \u201cAre there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated,\u201d Baker asked.\n\n\u201cWell, the currency manipulation they don\u2019t discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cIf you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States \u2013 China in particular, because they\u2019re so good.\u201d\n\nTrump listed China as the \u201cnumber-one abuser of this country,\u201d ad said that the biggest way it takes advantage of the U.S. is through currency manipulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even discussed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRand Paul interjected, and noted that despite Trump\u2019s opposition to China, the country actually is not a part of the trade deal.\n\n\u201cHey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal,\u201d Paul said\n\nBaker questioned how, if the deal is not ratified by the U.S. Senate, it might \u201cactually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it\u2019s been seeking to do and if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an argument that China doesn\u2019t like the deal, because in us doing the deal we will be trading with competitors,\u201d Paul replied. \u201cYou\u2019re exactly right.\u201d\n\n[Cast Your Vote: Who do You think Won the Fox Business Main Stage Debate?]", "article_metadata": {"description": "During the fourth GOP debate of the 2016 election, Donald Trump talked at length about how China could take advantage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Rachel Blevins", "og": {"site_name": "Ben Swann's Truth In Media", "description": "During the fourth GOP debate of the 2016 election, Donald Trump talked at length about how China could take advantage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP", "title": "GOP Debate: Rand Paul Fact Checks Donald Trump On TPP", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 614, "identifier": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gop-debate-paul-trump.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2015-11-11T13:11:23-04:00", "url": "http://truthinmedia.com/gop-debate-rand-paul-fact-checks-tpp/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During the fourth GOP debate of the 2016 election, Donald Trump talked at length about how China could take advantage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP", "creator": "@RachBlevins", "image": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gop-debate-paul-trump.jpg", "title": "GOP Debate: Rand Paul Fact Checks Donald Trump On TPP", "site": "@BenSwann_", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 801708913249498, "pages": 124075334324092}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BenSwannRealityCheck", "published_time": "2015-11-11T12:30:51-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachelblevinsofficial", "section": "Election", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T13:11:23-04:00", "tag": "Rand Paul"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhy would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?\u201d\u201cThe TPP is horrible deal,\u201d Trump replied.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible deal,\u201d Trump interjected.\nGerard Baker, the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, and a moderator during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, asked Trump about his opposition to the TPP.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even discussed.\u201dAdvertisementRand Paul interjected, and noted that despite Trump\u2019s opposition to China, the country actually is not a part of the trade deal.\nDuring the fourth GOP debate of the 2016 election, Donald Trump talked at length about how China could take advantage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and in response, Rand Paul pointed out that China is not part of the deal."}
