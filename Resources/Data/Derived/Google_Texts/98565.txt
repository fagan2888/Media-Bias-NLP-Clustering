Andrew Litton, the Colorado Symphony Orchestra’s star conductor, has added another job to his busy resume, music director of the New York City Ballet.

Litton will lead the ballet’s orchestra starting with its 2015-16 season, bringing his music directorships to four. In addition to Denver, he holds the post with the Minnesota Orchestra’s Sommerfest and Norway’s Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, though his Bergen job ends next year.

Like many contemporary conductors who forego the tradition of linking their reputations to a single orchestra, Litton has developed his career through smaller jobs. He guest conducts around the world, seemingly non-stop, and records regularly with the Swedish label BIS.

Though his music director positions put him in charge of the overall playing and hiring of musicians, his actual podium time in each place is limited. Currently, he is conducting eight of the Colorado Symphony Orchestra’s weekend-long Masterworks programs each season.

He is popular with both musicians and management in Denver, where his contract was extended two more years this week and now runs through 2018.

CSO executive director Jerry Kern said Wednesday that Litton’s New York City Ballet appointment is a plus for Denver because it means Litton likely will do less traveling abroad and have more time for conducting and fundraising here.

“I think it’s great we have somebody who will be in the states more and doesn’t have a second orchestra in Timbuktu,” he said.

Litton grew up in Manhattan near the New York City Ballet’s home at Lincoln Center and attended its annual performances of “The Nutcracker” as a child. He now lives on Long Island and the ballet work will allow him to spend more time with his family

Litton will have plenty of back up on his new gig, as well. The ballet also has an associate music director and two resident conductors on staff.
