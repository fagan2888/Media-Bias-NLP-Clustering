LAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) — Some IU Health Arnett patients who received financial assistance in the past, may not be in 2016. This comes after some financial policy changes within the company.

An IU Health spokesperson said patients without insurance will no longer qualify as being eligible for financial assistance. This change took effect with the new year on Jan. 1.

But Chief Medical Director Donald Clayton, MD said there is a program to help uninsured people find possible coverage.

“There is a program to aid patients that don’t have insurance, and we have not stopped that at all,” said Clayton. “It’s changed a little bit.”

Clayton said they updated the policy issue because of requirements in the Affordable Care Act.
