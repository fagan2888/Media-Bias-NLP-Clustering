Congress can\u2019t command States to legislate into existence regulatory regimes (New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992)) and the President can\u2019t commandeer state officials (Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997)).\n\nInstead, the Clean Air Act gives EPA two options to achieve its regulatory ends when faced with an uncooperative State: (1) direct federal implementation; and (2) conditioning state receipt of federal highway funds upon regulatory compliance.\n\nFirst, the agency may execute the regulation on its own. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association, 452 U.S. 264 (1981). There are almost 20,000 EPA employees scattered about 10 regional offices across the country. These bureaucrats can and do directly implement federal regulatory regimes. When they do so, it\u2019s known as a \u201cfederal implementation plan.\u201d\n\nFor example, a number of States balked at EPA\u2019s 2010 rule imposing a Clean Air Act permitting regime for greenhouse gas emissions. Because they refused to play ball, federal bureaucrats implemented and operated the program, independent of the recalcitrant States. (75 FR 82246, 75 FR 82429)\n\nUnder the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to implement a federal plan if a State refuses to comply with an agency rule. (42 U.S.C. \u00a77410(c)). Nonetheless, the agency cannot always fulfil this responsibility due to EPA\u2019s finite resources. That is, there are some regulatory tasks that would require too much effort for the federal government to perform; their implementation would monopolize the agency\u2019s time.\n\nConsider, for example, an automobile inspection and maintenance program that is necessary to control tailpipe emissions, and thereby achieve the Clean Air Act\u2019s purposes. The EPA simply doesn\u2019t have the resources to inspect and maintain millions of cars.\n\nIn fact, this was an actual problem for the agency during the 1970s. Goaded by environmental special interest lawsuits (NRDC v. EPA, 475 F. 2d 968 (D.C. Cir. 1973)), the agency required States to implement inspection and maintenance programs. Yet the agency conceded that the task exceeded its limited resources (37 FR 10842, 10844), and therefore sought to compel State compliance. The agency\u2019s awkward (and legally dubious) mechanism for doing so was to subject state officials to Clean Air Act civil penalties, pursuant to the following reasoning: (1) automobiles emit pollution by driving on roads; (2) states maintain roads; (3) consequently, State officials are liable for automobile pollution. (see, e.g., Maryland v. EPA, 530 F. 2d 215 (4th Cir. 1975) at 224)\n\nAs a direct result of this circumstance, Congress in 1977 empowered EPA to withhold highway funding from a non-compliant State whose ambient air quality violates national standards. In 1990, Congress greatly expanded this authorization, such that the highway funding sanctions became wholly discretionary. (42 U.S.C. \u00a77410(m)).\n\nAbove I\u2019ve described the two Clean Air Act mechanisms by which EPA can achieve its ends when a State won\u2019t act: (1) a federal implementation plan; and (2) sanctions. This subject is topical because EPA in July will issue a Clean Air Act regulation known as the Clean Power Plan. It\u2019s the Obama administration\u2019s marquee climate policy, but it is staunchly opposed by many States. And some of these States have indicated that they won\u2019t expend any resources in complying.\n\nThis raises the question: What will the EPA do?\n\nMany (myself included) had presumed that EPA would be limited to sanctions in trying to compel compliance from those States disinclined to participate. I had thought that the unprecedented scope of the Clean Power Plan\u2014as I explain here, the rule would completely overhaul the electricity industry\u2014would effectively prohibit a federal implementation plan. Such an undertaking, I had assumed, would take far too much time and effort for an agency that already fails to achieve the overwhelming preponderance of its responsibilities.\n\nI was wrong. In a teleconference this week with reporters, EPA\u2019s Janet McCabe, head of the Office of Air and Radiation, announced that the agency would start work on a model federal implementation plan for the Clean Power Plan. The model FIP will be proposed contemporaneously with the promulgation of the final Clean Power Plan. Thus, EPA intends to avail itself of both the means provided by the Clean Air Act to force a non-compliant state\u2019s hand.\n\nThis is a huge deal, one that we\u2019ll unpack in detail here at globalwarming.org over the next couple days. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll explain why EPA felt it had to take this action (hint: it pertains to Obamacare). And on Monday, I\u2019ll explain how the operational realities of the electric industry will constrain what EPA can do (hint: get ready for an EPA-imposed cap and trade!).", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "blog", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "description": "Formerly at NRDC It is well established that the Clean Air Act doesn\u2019t empower EPA to order States to comply with federal regulations.
