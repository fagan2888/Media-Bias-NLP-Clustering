Eastbound lanes remain open. The detour for westbound traffic is south on 411 to north on 431 to north on I-59 to Exit 205 at Alabama 68. A timetable for repairs has not been established.\n\nFlash flooding subsided in many areas of North Alabama in the overnight hours Saturday, however swollen rivers and streams continue to be the primary concern.\n\nOfficials in Athens and Limestone County declared a state of emergency following ongoing flooding.\n\nResidential flooding was widespread Friday, according to Madison County EMA officials. In Gurley, a man helped carry his 86-year-old neighbor out of him home as the water rose.\n\nA family we spoke with Friday night contended with nearly a foot of water entering their home.\n\nSaturday, the focus continued on the task of surveying, repairing and reopening damaged roadways.\n\nFlooded and eroded roads continue to be reported by emergency management agencies as crews monitor conditions throughout the day. Officials in Madison County said many storm drains along Highway 431 are backed up, causing standing water to spill over onto roadways.\n\nGovernor Robert Bentley issued a State of Emergency for all Alabama counties as a result of the excessive rain that has fallen over the past couple of days and continues to fall.\n\n\u201cMany parts of Alabama have experienced excessive rainfall and flooding is a major concern,\u201d Governor Robert Bentley said in a statement issued Friday. \u201cBy issuing a State of Emergency, I have directed all state agencies to take necessary actions to be prepared to respond to the anticipated flooding across Alabama. We will actively monitor the flooding, and are prepared to respond to any requests for assistance,\u201d said Gov. Bentley.\n\nBy issuing a SOE, I've directed state agencies to take necessary actions to be prepared to respond to the anticipated flooding across AL. \u2014 Gov. Robert Bentley (@GovernorBentley) December 25, 2015\n\nEMAs in multiple counties hope you will continue to advise the Turn Around, Don't Drown rule. If you encounter water over the road, you should turn around immediately - even a small amount of running water can sweep a vehicle off the road.\n\nIf you encounter a road barricaded by closure signs - even if it appears there is no water visible on the road, it is against the law to ignore the warning and drive around. You may not be aware of further dangers ahead and could put yourself in a potentially life-threatening situation.\n\nHigh waters left two women and a young child stranded Friday. Crews responded to Rock Creek Boulevard off Old Railroad Bed Road in Harvest to rescue the three. Rescuers waded through the water with rafts to reach them and bring them to safety. Once on higher ground, they were greeted with a hug by a worried family member.\n\nIn Marshall County, officials have dealt with road erosion and mudslides. Near the state park, a mudslide Friday prompted road crews to send a backhoe to clear portions of Highway 227.\n\nClick here to see more photos of 2015 Christmas Flooding in the Tennessee Valley\n\n@waff48 nasty flooding just north of Arab pic.twitter.com/U4lX9ipeZ6 \u2014 That one kid Aaron (@aaron_hollaway) December 25, 2015\n\nAlabama Emergency Management Agency (AEMA) personnel are in contact with the impacted counties and will be assessing the damage over the next several days. Roads and bridges in many places have washed out and are impassable. Motorists are advised to stop and turn around if they encounter flooded roads. It is dangerous to drive through flood waters.\n\n\u201cAEMA encourages residents to continue to monitor rains and be prepared to take action from fast rising water in flood prone areas. We will work with local officials to make sure the needs of our citizens are being met and assess the affected areas for damage,\u201d Alabama EMA Director Art Faulkner said.\n\nEven after rains subside, rivers and streams will likely continue to rise. EMA officials urge you to stay weather aware into the overnight and early morning hours.\n\nContact your local EMA office with any local safety concerns you may have.\n\nSevere weather has affected other parts of Alabama; officials in Birmingham are examining potential tornado damage. In Coffee County, a man and a 5-year-old child were swept away and drowned when their vehicle was overtaken by floodwaters.\n\nCopyright 2015 WAFF.
