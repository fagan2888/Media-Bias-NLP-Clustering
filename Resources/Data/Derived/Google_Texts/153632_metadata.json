Trump is a result of what Republicans have been peddling for years through \u201cdog whistle\u201d politics.\n\nThe \u201c74 year-old angry socialist\u201d Bernie Sanders has voiced more logical reasoning in one debate than all Republicans combined. He says the economy is against the working man and the electoral system is corrupted by money. A third-grader could prove both.\n\nChumbley said Hillary \u201cpromises to build on Obama\u2019s successes,\u201d and that he has done irreparable damage to the country. I would love to see this list submitted to a group of non-political professionals and get their evaluation. The only place I have heard that is from a highly-\n\npartisan, biased and conservative source.\n\nChumbley writes about the mess Hillary has made during her political career.\n\nI want to address a few things for which Republicans have been responsible. The Affordable Care Act has given millions of Americans insurance, which saves thousands of lives each year.\n\nSeveral Republican-\n\ncontrolled states refuse to go along. They will have hundreds of unnecessary deaths as a result. The deaths could be called human sacrifices to the god of ideology.\n\nTalk about swallowing an elephant and choking on a gnat.\n\nRepublican economic plans hugely increase the deficit, and Trump\u2019s is not the worst of the bunch. Their tax cuts benefit the rich and punish the poor \u2014 surprise. Republican states have put up road blocks to voting and want to eviscerate Planned Parenthood. The reasons for both would not pass an investigation by the aforementioned three year-old.\n\nThe clincher for not voting Republican is the anti-science state of Republican politicians, not the private citizen. If elected,\n\nRepublicans will eliminate or neutralize everything having to do with protecting the environment and addressing global warming. This will be catastrophic.\n\nRepublican candidates share radical ideas and ideology, not facts. The Republicans of old would turn over in their graves.\n\nLeon Logan\n\nTucumcari, N.M.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Letters to the Editor, Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "Regarding the Amarillo Globe-News letter to the editor (Letter: What proof is needed not to vote for Hillary Clinton?, March 20, amarillo.", "title": "Letter: Give a solid reason not to vote Republican", "url": "http://amarillo.com/opinion/letters-editor/2016-04-23/letter-give-solid-reason-not-vote-republican", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/15295446.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Regarding the Amarillo Globe-News letter to the editor (Letter: What proof is needed not to vote for Hillary Clinton?, March 20, amarillo.com), letter writer Mary Chumbley starts with this joke, \u201cRepublicans, other than the snake oil salesman Donald Trump, (who cannot be trusted), finally have a reasonable group of candidates.\u201dFirst time I have heard that.
