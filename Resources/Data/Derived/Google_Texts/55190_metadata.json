It got so wild emergency services deemed the park too dangerous to enter.\n\nIt left a $30,000 clean-up bill and the park littered with thousands of bottles and, according to the council, \"hundreds of tell-tale acrylic ampoules, indicating use of GHB or other drugs\".\n\nAmbulance Victoria wants alcohol bans in place this year, as does Victoria Police, which estimated up to 120 officers would be needed to control the area if there was another huge party.\n\nYarra mayor Jackie Fristacky said the council needed to \"break the cycle and view of Edinburgh Gardens as a party place\".\n\nBut Socialist Party councillor Stephen Jolly said a better-arranged party should instead be organised. \"We\u2019re going from irresponsible, free-range non-management to dictatorial over-management,\" he said.\n\nCr Jolly said previous parties had been badly managed, with not enough lighting, bins or toilets. And trying to stop the party was futile.\n\n\"They are talking about the young people in our area like they are al-Qaeda. These are people like my kids they are talking about,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victoria", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "In a bid to avoid New Year&rsquo;s Eve spiralling out of control again at a popular inner-city park, a Melbourne council is set to ban public drinking ahead of this year&rsquo;s celebrations.", "title": "New Year's booze ban set to stop out-of-control party", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/new-years-booze-ban-set-to-stop-outofcontrol-party-20140817-1053mm.html", "image": "http://images.theage.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.theage.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "title": "New Year's booze ban set to stop out-of-control party", "description": "In a bid to avoid New Year\u2019s Eve spiralling out of control again at a popular inner-city park, a Melbourne council is set to ban public drinking ahead of this year\u2019s celebrations.", "card": "summary", "site": "@theage"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "In a bid to avoid New Year\u2019s Eve spiralling out of control again at a popular inner-city park, a Melbourne council is set to ban public drinking ahead of ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd18\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementLast year\u2019s Edinburgh Gardens party flew out of control after social media and word-of-mouth attracted 15,000 revellers.\nYarra mayor Jackie Fristacky said the council needed to \"break the cycle and view of Edinburgh Gardens as a party place\".\nBut Socialist Party councillor Stephen Jolly said a better-arranged party should instead be organised.\nAnd trying to stop the party was futile.\nA Melbourne council is set to ban public drinking in a bid to avoid New Year\u2019s Eve spiralling out of control again at a popular inner-city park."}
