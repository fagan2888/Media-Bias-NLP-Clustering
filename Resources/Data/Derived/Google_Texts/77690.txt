Following his February 10 use of a concealed carry handgun to stop a stabbing at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, Didarul Sarder is scheduled to receive “an honor for heroism from Warren Mayor Jim Fouts.”

Breitbart News previously reported that Sarder, a valet supervisor, said he was fired for having the gun with him, although using it allowed him to save the life of 52-year-old stabbing victim Stephanie Kerr.

Fox 2 that Sarder intervened after seeing one woman repeatedly stabbing Kerr in the neck and abdomen outside the tech center. The suspect in the stabbing is “a 32-year-old woman,” and police say the suspect and Kerr “argued in the lobby, then went outside where the suspect pulled a knife, stabbing [Kerr] multiple times in the neck, back and abdomen.” Sarder pulled his gun and ordered the attacker to stop.

He said, “[Kerr] kept saying ‘I’m dying, someone help’ and it was just natural reaction. I just see this lady getting stabbed. I only had like half a second to think, and I un-holstered my firearm and pointed it at her to drop the knife.”

So MLive reports that Sarder was indeed fired for “using a legally concealed firearm in violation of company policy” but “later rehired.” He is now in line for an award. Mayor Fouts said he believes Sarder “should have been rewarded” instead of fired to begin with, and he plans to show the video of Sarder intervening to save Kerr’s life as part of the heroism award presentation.
