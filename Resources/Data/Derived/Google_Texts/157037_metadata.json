For the first time in a major election, citizens will be required to show approved forms of identification in order to vote. The law mandates that the state run a public-service campaign \u201cin conjunction with the first regularly scheduled primary and election\u201d to educate voters on what forms of ID are acceptable.\n\nBut Wisconsin has failed to appropriate funds for the public education campaign. The result is that thousands of citizens may be turned away from the polls simply because they did not understand what form of identification they needed to vote.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s failure to fund these public-service ads comes after a clash between the Government Accountability Board, the nonpartisan agency responsible for producing voter education materials, and the Republican-controlled legislature. In October, the agency met with Republican State Senator Mary Lazich, who was a primary sponsor of the voter ID bill in 2011, to inquire after funding and received a tepid response.\n\nThe board told Lazich that it would need $300,000 to $500,000 from the state legislature to broadcast advertisements. The legislature had twice appropriated money for public information campaigns during the 2012 and 2014 election cycles, but the ads barely hit the airwaves before court injunctions delayed the law from going into effect.\n\nAccording to Kevin Kennedy, the board\u2019s director and general counsel, Lazich thanked the board for the information, but didn\u2019t make any promises. Lazich did not respond to requests for comment from ProPublica.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Government Accountability Board decided against making a formal funding request to the legislature, which had already introduced a bill to dismantle the agency.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure we would have a receptive audience,\u201d Kennedy told ProPublica.\n\nTwo days after the meeting, the Wisconsin Assembly voted to replace the nonpartisan board with two partisan agencies by the end of June 2016. Since 2012, Republicans have attacked the board after it investigated, among other things, whether Governor Walker coordinated with outside political groups during the recount battle that gripped the state. Judicial orders stalled the investigation, and the board eventually took itself out of the probe. Walker, cleared of wrongdoing, survived the scandal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Friday will mark the first major election voters are required to present pre-approved identification.
