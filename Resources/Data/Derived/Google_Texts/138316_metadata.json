The second, slated for a vote next week, would require the administration to provide Congress with weekly updates of Obamacare\u2019s implementation, according to The Hill.\n\nThe House approved the first, H.R. 3811, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act, by a 291-122 vote, including 67 Democrats. In its written policy statement, dated Thursday, the White House claimed that the legislation would impose \u201ccostly paperwork requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, the indiscriminate reporting requirement in H.R. 3811 may seriously impede the law enforcement investigation of a breach,\u201d the White House said in its statement. \u201cUnlike existing requirements, H.R. 3811 requires expensive and unnecessary notification for the compromise of publicly-available information, even if there is no reasonable risk that information could be used to cause harm.\u201d\n\nBanks inform their customers as a matter of course whenever they believe there\u2019s even the possibility that an account has been compromised, and they don\u2019t complain that it\u2019s \u201cunnecessary notification.\u201d It\u2019s all the cost of doing business in an electronic information age.\n\nThe administration published a similar policy statement for the bill scheduled for next week.\n\nThe White House complained that the reporting requirements of H.R. 3362, the Exchange Information Disclosure Act, would place an undue burden on the administration.\n\n\u201cIt would require the reporting of data on a weekly basis that is generally being provided on a monthly basis. Few major indicators \u2014 from job growth to Medicare Advantage enrollment to private shareholder reports \u2014 are provided more frequently than monthly; this bill would hold the Marketplaces and State Medicaid programs to unprecedented standards,\u201d the White House said in its policy statement.\n\n\u201cTo implement this new reporting system, contracts may need to be modified and new staff would need to be hired on an expedited basis, adding millions of dollars in costs to States and the Federal Government,\u201d the White House added.\n\nIf it\u2019s not already present, a counter can be easily added to the software. It would keep a running tally of the number of visits to the site, number of individuals who created an account, number of those who selected a plan and the number who have actually paid for their plan.\n\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t require a new reporting system, additional staff or millions of dollars in implementation costs. It would only require a desire to make good on its promise \u2014 to be the most transparent presidential administration in history.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The Obama administration, which describes itself as the most transparent in history, announced its opposition to two House bills calling for transparency in the administration of the Affordable Care Act.
