All or most of their staff members also must give up their policies from the Federal Employees Health Benefit program and go shopping for new coverage on the locally operated Washington, D.C., health insurance exchange website.\n\nOnly Rep. Pete King of Seaford, who voted against Obamacare as Long Island's lone Republican congressman, will avoid the exchange. But that's only because he said he's covered by his retired wife's policy, not a federal insurance plan.\n\nThe requirement that members of Congress and their personal staff use the exchanges was added to the health care law by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) before the law was enacted in 2010.\n\nThe federal government, as their employer, will continue to contribute 72 percent of their premiums, according to the Office of Personnel Management's guidance on the shift.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Reps. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton), Steve Israel (D-Huntington) and Carolyn McCarthy (D-Mineola), who is battling lung cancer, will sign up on the exchange, their aides said.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nSen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) hasn't made a final decision about his health insurance for next year, said spokesman Max Young.\n\n\"Because the ACA mandates that senators lose access to their current insurance plans, Sen. Schumer and his family will review their health care options during the exchange open season,\" Young said.\n\nAll staff members of King, Bishop, Israel and McCarthy will make the switch to the exchange, aides said.\n\nBut Gillibrand and Schumer have exempted some of their staff, which federal rules allow them to do, aides said.\n\n\"The vast majority of our staff will enter the exchange, but a small number of employees who do committee work will stay in their current plans,\" said Bethany Lesser, spokeswoman for Gillibrand.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "sailthru.author": "TOM BRUNE", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Democrats representing Long Island in Congress are getting a taste of their own medicine: The Affordable Care Act they passed requires them to", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.6368544.1392933073!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Democrats representing Long Island in Congress are getting a taste of their own medicine: The Affordable Care Act they passed requires them to", "title": "LI Reps. sign up for health exchanges", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/congress-staff-required-to-use-d-c-health-exchange-1.6368280", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.6368544.1392933073!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Democrats representing Long Island in Congress are getting a taste of their own medicine: The Affordable Care Act they passed requires them to", "title": "LI Reps. sign up for health exchanges", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.6368544.1392933073!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "Sat, 02 Nov 2013 22:47:42 -0400", "sailthru.title": "LI Reps. sign up for health exchanges", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "nation politics local politics long island  article newsday live", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "nation politics local politics long island  article newsday live", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3040\"", "article_summary": "All or most of their staff members also must give up their policies from the Federal Employees Health Benefit program and go shopping for new coverage on the locally operated Washington, D.C., health insurance exchange website.\nAll staff members of King, Bishop, Israel and McCarthy will make the switch to the exchange, aides said.\nBut that's only because he said he's covered by his retired wife's policy, not a federal insurance plan.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsdaySen.
