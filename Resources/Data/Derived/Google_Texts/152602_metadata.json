Lamar Alexander (R - Tenn.) accepts an award from The Boy Scouts in Knoxville on March 4, 2016.\n\n(KNOXVILLE) U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., stopped in Knoxville on Friday night to be honored by the Boy Scouts of America. He received the first ever \u201cAlumnus of the Year\u201d award.\n\nAfter the ceremony, he spoke to the media about the race for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nHe has previously thrown his support behind Marco Rubio, and spoke Friday in thinly veiled comments about Donald Trump\u2019s early lead.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is a conservative who can win us the election in November,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t do us any good to nominate someone\u2026someone who can\u2019t win in November.\u201d\n\nHe explained his fears that if the GOP nominee doesn\u2019t win this fall, Hillary Clinton would not only win the election, but her nominations would control the Supreme Court and the Affordable Care Act would stay in place.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just a third of the way through the political season, and you don\u2019t have the Super Bowl at the beginning of the season, you have it at the end,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about the infighting within the party, he said he didn\u2019t like the \u201cmud-wrestling\u201d that has been happening.\n\n\u201cI tuned in to the Republican debate, and I thought I tuned in to the mud wrestling channel,\u201d said Alexander \u201cI don\u2019t like that. I think we want a president who acts like the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe expressed his support again for Sen. Rubio, though he did mention he thought Gov. John Kasich was doing a good job, and reiterated that he thought the GOP should wait until every state has voted, then make a decision about a nominee.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t stop the football season a third of the way through, you shouldn\u2019t stop the presidential race a third of the way through,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "(KNOXVILLE) U.S. Sen.
