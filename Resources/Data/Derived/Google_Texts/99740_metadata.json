Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc.\n\nAddressing the meaning of the term \u201cofficer\u201d in a company\u2019s bylaws, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated a district court\u2019s summary judgment that a computer programmer (who was also a vice president) was an \u201cofficer\u201d entitled to indemnification because the term was ambiguous and remanded the case for trial. Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc., Case No. 13-4237 (3d Cir., Sept. 3 2014) (Fisher, J.) (Fuentes, J., dissenting in part).\n\nThe computer programmer worked for a non-corporate subsidiary, the officers of which are entitled to indemnification under the parent corporation\u2019s bylaws, which define \u201cofficer\u201d to include actual officers and \u201cany person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of such entity.\u201d The non-corporate subsidiary used the term \u201cvice president\u201d to communicate that an individual was more senior than an \u201canalyst\u201d or \u201cassociate\u201d but less senior than a \u201cmanaging director.\u201d Approximately one-third of the non-corporate subsidiary\u2019s employees were \u201cvice presidents,\u201d including the computer programmer.\n\nOn his last day of employment with the non-corporate subsidiary, the programmer stole his employer\u2019s source code. He has since faced both federal- and state-level prosecutions for his conduct. He also sued his former employer\u2019s parent for indemnity under the parent\u2019s bylaws. On summary judgment, the district court found the bylaws unambiguous and that the programmer was entitled to indemnification because he was a vice president. Goldman Sachs appealed.\n\nThe 3d Circuit vacated, finding the term \u201cofficer\u201d in the bylaws ambiguous. The court was not convinced by the district court\u2019s facile analysis, which hinged on the meaning of a term \u201cvice president,\u201d which was not part of the bylaws. It was more interested in the meaning of \u201cofficer.\u201d After consulting several dictionaries (and lamenting the absence of any evidence of an \u201cindustry-specific common meaning\u201d of the term), the court settled on a plain meaning of \u201cofficer\u201d as \u201csomeone holding a position of trust, authority, or command,\u201d which created a tautology when applied to the bylaws, which would consider an officer to be that and anyone serving in a similar capacity or as a manager of an entity. In effect, the term was \u201ccircuitous, repetitive, and most importantly, fairly or reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d That left the court in a world of extrinsic evidence, which \u201craise[d] genuine issues of material fact,\u201d which would have to be resolved by a jury. (Dissenting in part, Judge Fuentes would have resolved the ambiguity against the parent corporation.)\n\nAs the 3d Circuit noted, the bylaws \u201care a unilaterally-drafted agreement,\u201d leaving the parent corporation in complete control over its contents. More careful drafting by the parent corporation may have avoided the ambiguity result (and upcoming trial).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated a district court\u2019s summary judgment that a computer programmer (who was also a vice president) was an \u201cofficer\u201d entitled to indemnification.
