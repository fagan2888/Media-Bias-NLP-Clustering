Why?\u201d the narrator asks. \u201cBecause Bob Dole has been crisscrossing Kansas in support of his friend Senator Pat Roberts. And Greg Orman doesn\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nOrman\u2019s unforced slip occurred Friday as he was discussing the laundry list of Republicans who have stumped for Roberts in Kansas \u2013 a list that includes Dole, U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul, as well as New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cIt sort of seems like a Washington establishment clown car to me,\u201d Orman said.\n\n\u201cYou know, every day a new person comes out of that car. You know, ultimately we have gone out and we have brought our case to the voters of Kansas, and everywhere I go, I hear the same things. Kansans think Washington is broken.\u201d\n\nWhile some of the out-of-state politicians may have been fair game, Dole is nearly untouchable in the plain state.\n\nThe 91-year-old former presidential contender and World War II veteran served Kansas in the U.S. Senate for 27 years and is currently in the midst of a \u201cfarewell tour\u201d which will take him to all 105 counties.\n\nWith the statewide phone call, Roberts hopes to convince voters that if Orman will disrespect Dole then he is not in line with their values.\n\n\u201cGreg Orman is finally showing Kansans his true colors,\u201d the robo call continues. \u201cHe is pro-abortion, pro-amnesty, pro-Obamacare and he doesn\u2019t respect American heroes like Bob Dole.\u201d\n\nAfter Orman made the comment on Friday, the Roberts campaign responded, calling it \u201cslimy.\u201d Dole was not pleased either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been called a \u2018clown\u2019 before,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed by Mr. Orman\u2019s statement.\u201d\n\nOrman defended his remarks on Saturday, saying Roberts \u201cdistorted his words,\u201d according to the Kansas City Star. Orman also called Dole \u201ca great example of bipartisanship.\u201d\n\nThe latest Fox News poll has Orman leading the incumbent by one point.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "'I don't think I've ever been called a 'clown' before'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Kansas Republican Pat Roberts is jumping on a political fumble committed by his challenger, Independent Greg Orman, who included Kansas political luminary Bob Dole in his criticism of the \"clown car\"", "title": "Pat Roberts Campaign Calling 1 Million Voters Over Greg Orman \u2018Clown Car\u2019 Comments [AUDIO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/01/pat-roberts-campaign-calling-1-million-voters-over-greg-orman-clown-car-comments-audio/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/doleroberts-e1414865812731.jpg", "height": 227}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'I don't think I've ever been called a 'clown' before'", "title": "Pat Roberts Campaign Calling 1 Million Voters Over Greg Orman \u2018Clown Car\u2019 Comments [AUDIO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/01/pat-roberts-campaign-calling-1-million-voters-over-greg-orman-clown-car-comments-audio/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/doleroberts-e1414865812731.jpg"}, "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-01 15:30:02", "sailthru.title": "Pat Roberts Campaign Calling 1 Million Voters Over Greg Orman 'Clown Car' Comments [AUDIO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "chuck-ross", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "bob dole,greg orman,kansas,pat roberts", "sailthru.description": "Kansas Republican Pat Roberts is jumping on a political fumble committed by his challenger, Independent Greg Orman, who included Kansas political luminary Bob Dole in his criticism of the \"clown car\"", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/doleroberts-e1414865812731.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c02\"", "article_summary": "Orman also called Dole \u201ca great example of bipartisanship.\u201dThe latest Fox News poll has Orman leading the incumbent by one point.\n\u201cBut yesterday Greg Orman attacked Bob Dole and called him a clown.\n\u201cIt sort of seems like a Washington establishment clown car to me,\u201d Orman said.\n4367462Kansas Republican Pat Roberts is jumping on a political fumble committed by his challenger, Independent Greg Orman, who included Kansas political luminary Bob Dole in his criticism of the \u201cclown car\u201d of politicians who are backing Roberts in the state.\n\u201cGreg Orman is finally showing Kansans his true colors,\u201d the robo call continues."}
