Wallace ordered administrators from John Peter Smith Hospital to remove Marlise Munoz, 33, from ventilators and respirators by 5 p.m. Monday. Erick Munoz, her husband, had sued the hospital over its interpretation of a Texas law forbidding the removal of life support for any pregnant woman in a coma. Munoz and other family members argued the law was never meant to apply to the rare instance in which a pregnant woman in a coma might be declared brain dead.\n\nHowever, both sides came closer to agreement in court Friday on the essential fact listed in a court document: Munoz has \u201cmet the clinical criteria for brain death since Nov. 28\u201d and that \u201cthe fetus gestating inside Mrs. Munoz is not viable.\u201d The young woman had been found slumped on the kitchen floor at 2 a.m. on Nov. 26, after which time she was taken to a north-central Texas hospital where a clinician advised her husband she was effectively \u201cbrain dead,\" as reported by CNN. Erick Munoz also says doctors said his wife \u201chad lost all activity in her brain stem,\u201d while a note on an accompanying chart read \u201cbrain dead.\u201d\n\nThe married couple, both paramedics, had left no living will to guide legal decisions in such an eventuality. Yet, the grieving husband \u2014 a widower by Monday, at least \u2014 says he and his wife discussed exactly such a scenario, with his wife choosing to be removed from artificial life support. In an affidavit filed in the court, Erick Munoz said little of his wife now reminds him of her former vitality \u2014 her scent replaced by the \u201csmell of death\u201d and her once lively eyes dimmed and \u201csoulless.\u201d\n\nJessica King, the Munoz family\u2019s lawyer, put the medical event into broader perspective, The Chicago Times-Tribune reported. \u201cPregnant women die every day,\u201d she said after the hearing. \u201cThey die in car accidents, of heart attacks, and other injuries. And when they die, their fetus dies with them. It\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been and the way it should be.\u201d Hospital administrators on Friday released a statement expressing appreciation for the order\u2019s potential impact but advising they\u2019d first consult with the Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s office there.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marlise munoz, texas right to die law, texas right to live law, texas brain dead patient, brain dead pregnant, viable fetus", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Texas judge ordered a Fort Worth hospital to release a brain-dead pregnant woman from life support, possibly ending a stand-off over the young woman, and her baby's, fate.", "title": "Brain-Dead Pregnant Woman Ordered Off Life Support", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/judge-orders-brain-dead-pregnant-marlise-munoz-life-support-upon-familys-wishes-267906", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/texas-judge-orders-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-released-life-support.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas judge ordered a Fort Worth hospital to release a brain-dead pregnant woman from life support, possibly ending a stand-off over the young woman, and her baby's, fate.", "title": "Brain-Dead Pregnant Woman Ordered Off Life Support", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/judge-orders-brain-dead-pregnant-marlise-munoz-life-support-upon-familys-wishes-267906", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/texas-judge-orders-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-released-life-support.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/texas-judge-orders-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-released-life-support.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-25T18:35:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T18:35:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Texas judge ordered a Fort Worth hospital to release a brain-dead pregnant woman from life support, possibly ending a stand-off over the young woman, and her baby's, fate."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e74\"", "article_summary": "A Texas judge ended the latest right-to-life controversy on Friday by ordering a Fort Worth hospital to remove a brain-dead pregnant woman from life support.\nErick Munoz, her husband, had sued the hospital over its interpretation of a Texas law forbidding the removal of life support for any pregnant woman in a coma.\nA Texas judge ordered Marlise Munoz released from life support as requested by her husband and other family members, in a decision Friday that may end the latest right-to-life debate in America.\nJudge R.H.
