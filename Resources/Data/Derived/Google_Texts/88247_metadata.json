In 2014, she joined with the Santa Clara Institute of Sports Law and Ethics and the Concussion Legacy Foundation to launch the Safer Soccer campaign to reduce the use of headers in youth soccer.\n\nShe announced her donation to the Massachusetts-based Concussion Legacy Foundation. Researchers there are focused on studying chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative condition caused by repeated blows to the head. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed by examining the brain after a person\u2019s death.\n\nIn an interview with USA Today, Chastain said, \u201cHopefully, what can be learned is, can doctors and scientists and neuroscientists look at the brain of someone like me, who has been playing soccer a majority of my life, and really dissect the brain and say, \u2018Here\u2019s where we see it beginning?\u2019 Could we then use that information to help say that before the age of 14, it\u2019s not a good idea to head the ball?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe concussion foundation\u2019s research team last month announced that it had found signs of CTE in the brain of former Oakland Raiders quarterback and NFL MVP Ken Stabler. But of the 307 brains in the bank, just seven are from women and none has been found to have CTE.\n\n\u201cA question I have is, do men\u2019s and women\u2019s brains look and respond differently?\u201d Chastain said. \u201cI\u2019m a recovering two-time ACL reconstruction athlete. Why are ACL injuries more common in girls and women than boys and men? Could that also be true with concussions? And if true, what can we do differently?\u201d\n\nWhile football is responsible for the most concussions, girls soccer is second, according to one major analysis. Concussions have become a major issue for elite women\u2019s soccer players. One of Chastain\u2019s teammates on the 1999 World Cup championship team, Cindy Parlow Cone, was forced to retire from soccer in 2006. She had suffered numerous concussions during her career and finally a mini-stroke contributed to ending her career..\n\nChastain spoke at a press conference in San Jose yesterday. The New York Times reported Chastain\u2019s concerns for youth soccer. Only one percent of soccer players will become elite players, Chastain said. The Times summarized Chastain\u2019s comments further:\n\nThe rest of them will go on to have lives doing something else. You don\u2019t ever want to look back on a kid and say that their life was adversely changed by playing sports \u2014 and soccer specifically. I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want that for them; I don\u2019t want that for soccer. I love playing sports. Injuries and accidents are somewhat inherent in sports. But if you can protect your kids, you should. That\u2019s your responsibility as a coach.\n\nThe NCAA estimates the probability of high school athletes going on to play Division I, II, or III college sports. With the exception of ice hockey and lacrosse, the odds are less than 10 percent. For women\u2019s soccer, the odds are seven percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "San Jose native Chastain has been focused on making soccer a safer sport for children.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Bay Area Soccer Superstar Brandi Chastain to Donate Brain for Concussion Research\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/03\\/soccer-brandi-chastain-brain-for-concussion-research\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-03 10:37:03\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-03 13:58:28\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":156210,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Concussion\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/GettyImages-165821286-2-1-e1457030198735.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "San Jose native Chastain has been focused on making soccer a safer sport for children.", "title": "Bay Area Soccer Superstar Brandi Chastain to Donate Brain for Concussion Research", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/03/soccer-brandi-chastain-brain-for-concussion-research/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/GettyImages-165821286-2-1-1440x1218.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "concussion,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Only one percent of soccer players will become elite players, Chastain said.\nChastain, 47, a former Santa Clara University soccer star, who now lives in San Jose, has made concussion research a mission.\nFor women\u2019s soccer, the odds are seven percent.\nConcussions have become a major issue for elite women\u2019s soccer players.\nRetired soccer player Brandi Chastain, who became a legend when she scored the winning goal in the 1999 World Cup final and famously ripped off her jersey in celebration, says she will donate her brain for concussion research."}
