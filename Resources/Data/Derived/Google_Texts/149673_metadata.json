The tool, contrary to standard predictive tools that typically see accuracy rates around 60 percent, has an 82 percent accuracy in forecasting 30-day readmissions.\n\nNext, MultiCare and UW Tacoma researchers wanted to put the tool into the hands of the patient so they could see what risk level they had for readmissions. The tool uses the patient's information and then compares it to the troves of data from other medical records. The patient then gets back a percentage that explains their readmission risk.\n\nHaving seen such success with the Risk-O-Meter, UW officials hope to ultimately commercialize the tool.\n\n[Also: Predictive analytics can help solve hospital problems, CFOs say]\n\nIn 2011, the federal government estimated that 30-day Medicare readmissions cost $26 billion annually, with $17 billion being attributed to avoidable events. More recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services will penalize more than half of U.S. hospitals in 2016 for having readmission rates higher than allowed under the federal guidelines.\n\nCMS expects to have levied $428 million in penalties by the end of 2015.\n\nThis first appeared on Healthcare IT News.
