Consumers can walk in and buy a health plan, directly from Blue Cross or through the state\u2019s new online exchange. They can also buy Medicare plans, or just get their questions answered. He says it\u2019s not the first retail store in the country, but it\u2019s among the first. And that\u2019s a sign of what the Affordable Care Act is bringing: millions of new customers, shopping for an insurance plan they\u2019ll need to have come January first.\n\n\u201cThe health insurance business is becoming a retail business,\" said Andruszkiewicz. \"For the 75 years that Blue Cross Blue Shield has been in existence, and for the 30 years that I\u2019ve been in the health insurance business, we\u2019ve always sold through employers. We\u2019ve sold through employers, through third parties, brokers and consultants. And that system has worked reasonably well, but the world is changing.\u201d\n\nAndruszkiewicz says the insurer will likely open more retail outlets in Rhode Island. He says the health plans available for sale on the health exchange and in the store are the same. But people who may qualify for a subsidy to buy one of those plans must go through the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island has opened its first retail location in Warwick, another sign of the shifting health insurance business landscape.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ripr.org/post/blue-cross-and-blue-shield-ri-opens-retail-store", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wrni/files/styles/medium/public/201310/BCBSRI_store.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island has opened its first retail location in Warwick, another sign of the shifting health insurance business landscape.", "title": "Blue Cross and Blue Shield of RI Opens Retail Store"}, "story_id": 236280863, "twitter": {"site": "@RINPR", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kristingourlay"}, "author": "Kristin Gourlay", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Blue Cross and Blue Shield of RI Opens Retail Store"}, "nid": 23365, "datePublished": "2013-10-17", "keywords": "blue cross and blue shield of rhode island, bcbsri, peter andruszkiewicz, Insurance, health insurance, health insurance exchange, Warwick, HealthSource RI, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 275, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2d8\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island has opened its first retail location in Warwick, another sign of the shifting health insurance business landscape.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island head Peter Andruszkiewicz snipped the blue ribbon with a giant pair of scissors, officially opening the insurer\u2019s new store in a strip mall in Warwick.\n\"For the 75 years that Blue Cross Blue Shield has been in existence, and for the 30 years that I\u2019ve been in the health insurance business, we\u2019ve always sold through employers.\n\u201cThe health insurance business is becoming a retail business,\" said Andruszkiewicz.\nHe says it\u2019s not the first retail store in the country, but it\u2019s among the first."}
