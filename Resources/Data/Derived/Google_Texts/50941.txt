MADISON, Maine (AP) — Police in Maine say a man with a realistic-looking tattoo of a gun on his stomach had the real thing tucked into his waistband when he was arrested.

Police tell the Morning Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1p2LHWq ) that 41-year-old Michael Smith, of Norridgewock, showed up at a sheriff’s deputy’s home Thursday night. Police say he was crying and had been drinking.

Authorities say Smith told police he had a fight with his ex-girlfriend and had stolen prescription narcotics from her.

He was charged with stealing drugs, and the gun was confiscated. He was released from jail on $1,000 bail. His phone has been disconnected.

Smith made headlines in March when members of a tree removal crew reported that he had a gun. But the gun turned out to be his tattoo.
