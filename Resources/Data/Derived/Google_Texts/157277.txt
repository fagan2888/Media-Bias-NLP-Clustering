Terre Haute, Ind. (WTHI)- A business in Terre Haute has shut down. It was just announced yesterday and it’s effective immediately.

It’s not a good week for the employees at Custom Blenders in Terre Haute. Yesterday they were told the company was sold.

Employees were to collect their last paycheck and not return to work.

Custom Blenders is a food and bakery waste recycling company. Plants in Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas are all closing.

A spouse of an employee from the plant here in Terre Haute tells us the employees had zero warning. She says they came to work yesterday and were told they we’re terminated effective immediately.

And that the way it was all done “was just wrong.”

“I do think they should have been forewarned and they just weren’t. They were all just kind of shocked. I’m sure it’s, I can speak for my husband, it’s shock and kinds anger then kinda depressed,” she said.

The employees did get their last check and they will be paid vacation.

The plant was sold to competitor Darling Industries.

There has been no confirmed word on the plans for the plant but some say the entire lot will be leveled.
