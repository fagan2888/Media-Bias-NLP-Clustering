[W]e must “shoot the messenger” where he lives or he will shoot us where we live. However, we should not, in most of these situations, plan to keep forces on the ground to “settle” the postcombat environment. There will prove little to be gained by such ventures; in fact, it may be to our security advantage to allow the post-conflict situation in certain regions to remain in chaos for a time. Let them dissipate their anger and resources by killing each other in the struggle for power; this is more like a gang war than anything else, and we should both encourage and contain it in certain regions.

If what emerges is again a threat to us, we should again take the leadership down and be prepared to repeat this whenever necessary — in other words, we should have a very low threshold for going back in and removing dangerous successor regimes.

On the other hand, if there is real promise for rational and reasonably responsible leadership, we should support it in more traditional ways, but only so long as it is prepared to behave responsibly.
