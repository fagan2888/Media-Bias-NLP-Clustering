(WNCN) \u2013 North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory took his campaign for re-election on the road Wednesday, hosting his first 2016 campaign event at a Kernersville printing company.\n\nMcCrory, speaking to the crowd, said state government has become more efficient and has grown jobs.\n\nThe event was held at Salem One, a North Carolina-based company.\n\nMcCrory emphasized the positives from his three-year tenure so far and said his administration has done what it said it would do.\n\n\u201cWe became more efficient, we prioritized, we solved problems,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the state has paid down debts to the federal government and has spent wisely.\n\n\u201cWe started taking fiscal responsibility seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said he has emphasized helping military members in North Carolina who have completed their service.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help them get jobs and show them respect,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, he said, his efforts have been successful.\n\n\u201cI came to Raleigh as an outsider,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at that point in time, North Carolina had lost much of its competitive edge. Businesses were closing their doors. Businesses just like this were either barely holding on or closing their doors and our taxes just kept going up and up and up.\u201d\n\nMcCrory praised the work of his team overall.\n\n\u201cThe results show this \u2013 nobody has ever done it better than this administration and has the success rate in the history of North Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the results speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nMcCrory said he planned to win re-election despite going up against what he called \u201cshadowy left-wing groups\u201d from outside North Carolina who had a \u201cradical agenda.\u201d\n\nHe also said he had faced resistance to his agenda from the media. Media outlets have complained that the McCrory administration has been slow to respond to information requests, and administration officials have groaned about a blizzard of public information requests. On Twitter Wednesday, McCrory specificed the Raleigh News & Observer when he said anyone donating $5 to his campaign would get a bumper sticker opposing the newspaper.\n\nDonate $5 to my campaign & get your own \u201cI don\u2019t believe the @newsobserver\u201d bumper sticker! https://t.co/dBBiKHr1YN pic.twitter.com/7mQqbgWHh1 \u2014 Pat McCrory (@PatMcCroryNC) December 2, 2015\n\nSalem One CEO Phil Kelley Jr. said the company has grown from 12 employees to 130 and he praised McCrory for being business-friendly.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled Gov. McCrory has chosen our facility to announce his campaign for governor in 2016,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, his campaign committee rolled out a video highlighting themes he wants to emphasize from his first three years in office.\n\nRELATED: McCrory announces reelection bid on Twitter\n\nMcCrory, in the video, said there\u2019s still more work to do to improve North Carolina\u2019s economy and state government. McCrory was Charlotte\u2019s mayor for 14 years until 2009. He first ran for governor in 2008, losing to Democrat Beverly Perdue. He won four years later, defeating Walter Dalton.\n\nTwo Democrats \u2013 Attorney General Roy Cooper and Durham lawyer Ken Spaulding \u2013 want to unseat McCrory and already have announced their candidacies.\n\nMcCrory spoke to a friendly crowd. Lynette Rinkler, a Cornelius resident, said, \u201cThe strides he\u2019s made with the economy are phenomenal.\n\n\u201cThe Dems need to focus on what they\u2019re going to do for the people of North Carolina as opposed to something that may or may not have happened with Pat.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina Gov.
