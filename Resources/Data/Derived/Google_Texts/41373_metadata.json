Naturally, being the jokesters that they are, Rogen and Franco decided to give the people what they want: their recreation of the cover photo.\n\nIt had to be done: pic.twitter.com/EXH2NJI3m9 \u2014 Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 22, 2014\n\nTwitter definitely loves the Rogen-Franco duo. And they seemed to love the duo\u2019s parody much more than they loved the original cover shot.\n\nRogen and Franco have parodied Kimye before, with raging success. Just last year, the two made a parody to West\u2019s racy music video for \u201cBound 2.\u201d The music video featured West riding a motorcycle while Kardashian \u2014 topless \u2014 draped herself all over him. In their shot-for-shot recreation, Rogen \u2014 also topless \u2014 played Kardashian and Franco played West, with hilarious results.\n\nThank you, Seth Rogen and James Franco. http://t.co/obZwSMsKjT \u2014 Kevin Kennie (@headstartrock) March 23, 2014\n\njames franco and seth rogen are hilarious \u2014 Trippy Q (@Goochi_Quintana) March 23, 2014\n\nthis cover is better .@RealSMG http://t.co/7Opjlpu3YN -> Spoofed again: James Franco and Seth Rogen do Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's Vogue \u2014 Diane Abela (@JDianeAbela) March 23, 2014", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "It didn\u2019t take long for comedian Seth Rogen and actor James Franco to make fun of Kimye again, this time, for their April Vogue cover.", "title": "James Franco and Seth Rogen mock Kimye 'Vogue' cover - Red Alert...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/03/Kimye-Vogue-Spoof-600x300.jpg", "height": 300}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/23/james-franco-and-seth-rogen-mock-kimye-vogue-cover/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "seth-rogen", "published_time": "2014-03-23T12:24:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-01T16:49:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95ec\"", "article_summary": "It didn\u2019t take long for comedian Seth Rogen and actor James Franco to make fun of Kimye again, this time, for their April Vogue cover.\n@RealSMG http://t.co/7Opjlpu3YN -> Spoofed again: James Franco and Seth Rogen do Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's Vogue \u2014 Diane Abela (@JDianeAbela) March 23, 2014\nThank you, Seth Rogen and James Franco.\nhttp://t.co/obZwSMsKjT \u2014 Kevin Kennie (@headstartrock) March 23, 2014james franco and seth rogen are hilarious \u2014 Trippy Q (@Goochi_Quintana) March 23, 2014this cover is better .\nIt had to be done: pic.twitter.com/EXH2NJI3m9 \u2014 Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 22, 2014Twitter definitely loves the Rogen-Franco duo."}
