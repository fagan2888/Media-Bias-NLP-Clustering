Vanilla Graham and Berry Blend

Available at Wal-Mart and other stores that sell groceries; price for a 12.5-ounce box varies by store

The pitch: “Great Grains Digestive Blend cereal blends whole grain, fiber and active cultures — three key ingredients to help support a healthy digestive system.

The skinny: Cold cereal is so easy — quick to fix, eat and clean up — it’s no wonder most Americans eat it for breakfast. But the experts keep reminding us that it’s important to think beyond convenience for the most important meal of the day.

Given my choice, I’d still be gobbling down kids’ cereals — Cocoa Krispies, Lucky Charms and the like. But I’m beyond grown up — I’m growing old. So it’s time to think a bit before I buy.

I have to give Post credit for trying to cram most of my daily health needs into my morning meal. Great Grains has 7 grams of fiber to keep me full until lunch, active cultures to help with digestion, whole grains and lots of vitamins. And the taste, miraculously, isn’t bad. It isn’t magically delicious, but it isn’t cardboard, either. The Berry Blend is better than the Vanilla Graham, but both are flavorful enough.

My one complaint is that some of the flakes are so small, they remind me of what’s usually in the bottom of the box when you throw it away. Those tend to get soggy — and who wants soggy cold cereal?

Other than that, though, this is a good choice for a grown-up breakfast. What is magical about Great Grains is that even on the first day, all that fiber and good bacteria didn’t cause any stomach drama.
