Most of the 17 states that chose to set up and operate their own Obamacare exchanges are deep-blue states, where Democratic governors and legislators see few serious challenges to their power. Yet, the level of corruption and incompetence \u2014 not to mention the cost to taxpayers \u2014 is so outrageous that, even in these Democratic bastions, it might give voters pause.\n\nAmong the most egregious examples:\n\nColorado\n\nIn Colorado, one of the five directors of the state exchange, Christa Ann McClure, was placed on administrative leave after news leaked out that she had been indicted for stealing while serving as executive director of the federally funded Housing Montana. (She resigned immediately after being put on leave.) At that agency, she paid herself \u201csignificant sums\u201d for consulting services even though she was already on the payroll as a full-time employee. The indictment also alleged that she \u201cmade payments to her family and used federal money for personal travel, to pay family bills and to buy consulting services.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Colorado\u2019s exchange struggled to meet minimum enrollment goals. Undeterred by mediocre performance and prior mismanagement, the exchange board voted to give exchange CEO Patty Fontneau a $14,000 bonus last year along with a 2.5 percent cost-of-living raise, making her the third most highly paid manager of a state health exchange in the country, behind only California and Connecticut.\n\nAt the same time they\u2019re getting bonuses and raises, exchange officials are trying to figure out how to squeeze enough revenue from state taxpayers to finance the exchange when initial federal grants run dry. The Colorado exchange currently charges customers a 1.4 percent user fee, and it will likely have to be increased. Some officials want to charge everyone with health insurance in the state, not just exchange enrollees, to the tune of $13 million in fees in both 2015 and 2016.\n\nIncumbent governor John Hickenlooper has managed to dodge the fallout so far. But even a weak Republican \u2014 former congressman Tom Tancredo \u2014 is still within striking distance.\n\nHawaii\n\nDespite a two-week delay in opening, the state\u2019s exchange operated so poorly that it managed to enroll just 9,217 individuals, after being awarded $205 million for construction costs. That\u2019s roughly $22,278 per enrollee, by far the highest in the nation. Things will get a little better: The state continues to try to process a backlog of nearly 11,000 people who were unable to sign up by the March 31 deadline. Unfortunately, they\u2019re being forced to rely on call centers to address the backlog because the computer system is still not functioning properly.\n\nIt may not be a coincidence that former Republican lieutenant governor James Aiona seems to be leading the incumbent governor Neil Abercrombie in the polls.\n\nMaryland\n\nFew states made as big a mess of their exchange as the Old Line State. It spent roughly $120 million to set up its own exchange and then managed to sign up fewer than 68,000 people for private plans \u2014 less than two-thirds of its goal. More than 80 percent of total exchange enrollment was in Medicaid.\n\nThings got so bad that the state eventually junked its entire exchange infrastructure. It plans to rebuild an exchange based on Connecticut\u2019s more successful design, at an additional cost of about $50 million. And now there are concerns that this new setup won\u2019t be ready on time. The Obama administration is thus threatening to withhold additional funds and suggest that Maryland move to the federal exchange.\n\nSignificantly, the man in charge of the Maryland exchange program was Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is now the front-runner for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Despite the state\u2019s overwhelming Democratic registration advantage, Maryland did have a Republican governor as recently as 2007 \u2014 expect Obamacare to be a big issue in the fall.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nIf any state could get its exchange right, one might think, it would be the home of Romneycare.\n\nBut despite spending more than $134 million, when the law\u2019s exchanges debuted on October 1, the state was only able to deploy part of its website. As of mid March, Massachusetts had about 84,000 residents on temporary health-insurance plans while work continues on the website. The state still hasn\u2019t been able to transfer another 100,000 people on a state-subsidized health plan into federally approved plans. Now, the legislature is debating whether to try to adapt software used by Colorado and Kentucky or to scrap its exchange altogether and let the federal government step in.\n\nObamacare remains popular in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, but the Republican candidate for governor, former insurance executive Charlie Baker, is running a surprisingly competitive race, within seven points of Martha Coakley according to recent polls.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe state\u2019s exchange, MNSure, cost taxpayers more than $141 million, but has been in crisis mode almost since the moment it began. State officials had expected MNSure to enroll up to 1.3 million people for insurance by 2016, but so far barely 117,000 people have signed up. The exchange is also facing a significant budget shortfall for next year that could force the state to raise taxes.\n\nGovernor Mark Dayton remains popular in the state, but it\u2019s worth noting that his lead over Republican challenger Jeff Johnson is down to just six points in recent polling.\n\nOregon\n\nThe state\u2019s $248 million exchange was so broken from the beginning that it was forced to rely on manual processing for nearly all of their sign-ups. Partly as a result, just 68,000 people signed up for coverage. The state is now planning to switch to the federal exchange, at an additional cost of $18 to $53 million.\n\nIncumbent governor John Kitzhaber has maintained a solid lead against his Republican opponent, Dennis Richardson, but Kitzhaber remains under 50 percent.\n\nNot every state is this bad, of course. A few state exchanges, such as Kentucky, New York, and Connecticut have functioned relatively well. Then again, considering the nationwide wreckage just described, \u201crelatively\u201d is a pretty low bar.\n\nIt\u2019s way too early to get carried away \u2014 Democrats will probably still win most of these races discussed. We are talking blue states after all, and Democrats do still lead in every race except Hawaii\u2019s. But given the states in question, the Democratic candidates really should be up by 20 or more points, not scraping by with single-digit leads.\n\nThere are plenty of factors in play, but it\u2019s become increasingly apparent that for Republicans on the state and federal level, Obamacare is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n\u2014 Michael Tanner is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and the author of Leviathan on the Right: How Big-Government Conservatism Brought Down the Republican Revolution.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The original version of this piece identified Christa Ann McClure as \u201cthe director\u201d of Colorado\u2019s exchange.

She is one of five directors of the exchange, which is overseen by a CEO, and resigned immediately after she was placed on administrative leave by the exchange.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare: State Dems\u2019 Worst Nightmare, by Michael Tanner, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Wed, 2014-06-18 00:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare: State Dems\u2019 Worst Nightmare", "keywords": "Michael Tanner", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Obamacare: State Dems\u2019 Worst Nightmare, Michael Tanner, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Michael Tanner, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce576\"", "article_summary": "The big question will be whether the failures will hurt Democratic state politicians as much as Obamacare appears likely to drag down national Democrats.\nThe Obama administration is thus threatening to withhold additional funds and suggest that Maryland move to the federal exchange.\nMinnesotaThe state\u2019s exchange, MNSure, cost taxpayers more than $141 million, but has been in crisis mode almost since the moment it began.\nThe state is now planning to switch to the federal exchange, at an additional cost of $18 to $53 million.\nOregonThe state\u2019s $248 million exchange was so broken from the beginning that it was forced to rely on manual processing for nearly all of their sign-ups."}
