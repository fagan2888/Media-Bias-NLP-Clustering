Shares of Centene (CNC) moved higher Tuesday after the managed care firm topped quarterly earnings views, helped by a strong rise in managed care membership.

The Q3 results followed news that Centene is a step closer to finalizing its $6.8 billion buyout of Health Net (HNT).

On Friday, Health Net shareholders overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the merger agreement. Also Friday, Centene shareholders voted to approve the issuance of Centene common stock to Health Net stockholders in connection with the deal, which was originally announced in July.

Meanwhile, Centene logged Q3 earnings of 84 cents a share before the open Tuesday. That was up from 67 cents the prior year and well ahead of consensus estimates of 78 cents. Revenue climbed 31% to $5.8 billion, roughly in line with views.

Managed care membership grew 24% to 4.8 million. The company posted a Health Benefits Ratio of 89% for the quarter vs. 89.7% the prior year.

“The quarter reaffirms our strong fundamentals and momentum that positions us well for the balance of this year and 2016, including the combination with Health Net,” CEO Michael Neidorff said in a statement.

Centene upped its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $2.84 to $2.90, up from prior guidance of $2.74 to $2.82. Before the Q3 earnings report, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected full-year EPS of $2.81.

Centene shares closed up 4.8% to 60.84 on the stock market today. Shares are still well down from the high of 83 set in early July.

Health Net’s stock price rose 2.8% to 65.17.

Centene’s Health Net buyout is one of a few big deals to hit the managed care sector this year.

In July alone, UnitedHealth (UNH) closed its $12.8 billion buyout of Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager; Aetna (AET) announced plans to buy Humana (HUM) in a $37 billion cash and stock deal; and Anthem (ANTM) said that it would acquire Cigna (CI) for $54.2 billion.
