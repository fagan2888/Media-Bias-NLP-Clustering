They are simply unusually shaped deposit boxes where several million dollars (or pesos, or rubles) can be left in security and secrecy. Economists and elected officials hold that the \u201csafe haven effect\u201d can secure a city\u2019s financial future; critics say it contributes to the irreversible erosion of a city\u2019s character and drives up the cost of housing. Either way, in an era of worldwide turmoil, the phenomenon is on the rise.\n\nThe mind-boggling home prices of global finance capitals have so far hogged the headlines. But to really see the power that foreign direct investment can exert on a city\u2019s skyline, you need to go to Miami.\n\nOver the past quarter-century, the Miami skyline has grown at a cornfield pace, fueled largely, realtors say, by buyers from South America. This trend is more natural here than in cities like Vancouver, where mainland Chinese are big condo buyers, or Paris, where Americans, among others, trade chic pied-\u00e0-terres. After all, most Miami residents speak Spanish at home, and the metro area has the highest share of immigrant business ownership in the country, at 45 percent. This is why the city is sometimes called the \u201cCapital of Latin America.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Miami deserves that moniker, it certainly attracts another kind of capital from Latin America.\n\nA study released last month by the Miami Downtown Development Authority found that 90 percent of demand for new condos in Brickell, Downtown and Edgewater \u2014 a 4.5 mile swath of waterfront neighborhoods across the bay from Miami Beach \u2014 is from foreign buyers. More than six in 10 pre-sale buyers come from Latin America.\n\nMost remarkably, for a major American downtown: Only one in 10 new apartments is purchased as a primary residence.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of an appropriate parallel to another world city, let alone one in the United States. The area in question is not small: Imagine Manhattan\u2019s West Side from 110th Street to 23rd Street, with 4,500 units under construction. (For comparison\u2019s sake, Manhattan in toto, with a population four times that of Miami, authorized barely 5,000 new units in 2013.)\n\nMiami has succeeded, in other words, in doing what Rust Belt towns like Detroit and Toledo are dreaming of: regenerating downtown through foreign investment. And this with an obvious threat to property values \u2014 in the form of sea-level rise and storm surges \u2014 looming on the horizon.\n\nWhat distinguishes the current boom from the more gradual Latin American settlement of Miami, which has been underway for decades, is the amount of cash involved. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the deposit structure,\u201d says Barbara Salk, a principal at the firm Sakor Development. \u201cWe\u2019ve got very vested people buying into the real estate here.\u201d\n\nIn response, developers have begun to adopt a model of real estate finance more commonly found in credit-tight South America, in which a buyer pays half the cost of a unit before the building is even finished. This favors developers, who need less equity to start a project, and gives confidence to lenders, who feel that buyers are committed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida's biggest city is undergoing a real-estate boom stemming from an unexpected\u00a0source.
