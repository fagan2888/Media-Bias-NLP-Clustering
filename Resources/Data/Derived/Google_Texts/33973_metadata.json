There are many leading hospitals already collaborating with Apple on Health related apps, but Reuters reports that \u201cGoogle and Samsung had started discussions with just a few of these hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters report also states that \u201cApple\u2019s move into mobile health tech comes as the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform efforts aim to provide incentives for doctors to keep patients healthy. The aim is to move away from the \u2018fee for service\u2019 model, which has tended to reward doctors for pricey procedures rather than for outcomes.\u201d\n\nIt also notes that Apple has an \u201cincredible team of experts in health and fitness\u201d and said it \u201cwas talking to medical institutions, healthcare and industry experts on ways to deliver its services\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Apple, health tech, healthcare, HealthKit", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "author": "streetwisejournal.com", "og": {"site_name": "StreetWise Journal", "description": "A report by Reuters claims that the 14 of the top 23 hospitals in the U.S. are using or testing Apple's Health app and HealthKit framework with patients.", "title": "Majority of top U.S. hospitals using Apple's HealthKit", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 702, "identifier": "http://d3dql2kihuy2db.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Apple-HealthKit.jpg", "height": 395}, "url": "http://www.streetwisejournal.com/top-us-hospitals-testing-apple-healthkit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A report by Reuters claims that the 14 of the top 23 hospitals in the U.S. are using or testing Apple's Health app and HealthKit framework with patients.", "creator": "@Streetwisejnl", "image": "http://d3dql2kihuy2db.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Apple-HealthKit.jpg", "title": "Majority of top U.S. hospitals using Apple's HealthKit", "site": "@Streetwisejnl", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1062662321", "google-play-app": "app-id=uk.co.totalwebsystems.streetwisejournal", "bitly-verification": "f2870703a2c8", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Streetwise-Journal/", "section": "Companies & Industries", "tag": "HealthKit", "published_time": "2015-02-07T05:00:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A report by Reuters claims that the 14 of the top 23 hospitals in the U.S. are using or testing Apple's Health app and HealthKit framework with patients."}, "article_summary": "In an exclusive report by news agency Reuters, it was revealed that 14 of the top 23 U.S. hospitals are working on a pilot program using Apple\u2019s iOS 8 Health App, or are in talks to do so.\nApple Health app and HealthKit used by top U.S. hospitalsIt was reported by Christina Farr that most of the country\u2019s top hospitals have in fact already used Apple\u2019s new Health app to assist doctors in remotely monitoring their patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\nSince Apple released Health, Google jumped on the bandwagon with its own version for Android called Google Fit, and Samsung told Reuters that it was also working with hospitals to develop a range of mobile health technology.\nThis includes data such as fitness, nutrition, sleep, vital signs data and much more.\nApple released Health in September 2014 as part of iOS 8.0.2, which works alongside with the HealthKit framework which allows developers to add support for a range of devices and apps, so they can pool and secure their health data into a single app."}
