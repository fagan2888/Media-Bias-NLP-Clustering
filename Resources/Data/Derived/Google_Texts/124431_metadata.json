John Kasich, said through a spokesman that if Trump wouldn\u2019t be there Kasich wasn\u2019t going to bother to show up either. Within hours, Fox News announced that the debate had been cancelled.\n\nAlso on Wednesday morning, in another phoned-in appearance on CNN, Trump warned the party that it should expect violence if he is denied the nomination despite winning a plurality of delegates to the nominating convention in July. Trump needs to collect 1,237 delegates to win the nomination on a first ballot vote.\n\nRight now, the main focus of his two remaining competitors, Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, is not so much winning outright as denying Trump a first ballot majority. After that, when delegates are no longer bound to a certain candidate, they feel they might be able to engineer victory over Trump in a floor fight.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Breaks the Back of the Sanders Revolution\n\n\u201cI think we'll win before getting to the convention,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you, if we didn't and if we're 20 votes short or if we're 100 short and we're at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400? Because we're way ahead of everybody, I don't think you can say that we don't get it automatically.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think you'd have riots. I think you'd have riots. I'm representing \u2026 many, many millions of people.\u201d\n\nRNC spokesman Sean Spicer told Politico later Wednesday morning, \u201cWell first of all, I assume he\u2019s speaking figuratively. I think if we go into a convention, whoever gets 1,237 delegates becomes the nominee. It\u2019s plain and simple.\u201d\n\nOf course, as Spicer well knows, there\u2019s good reason to believe that Trump might not be speaking figuratively at all. He has called for violence from the stage during his rallies, and promised to pay the legal fees of anyone who commits it. Over the weekend, he used Twitter to threaten Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, suggesting that he would send his supporters to break up a Sanders rally.\n\nRelated: It Took Trump to Bring Obama and GOP Leaders Together\n\nIf a political party is no longer in charge of the process by which candidates seeking to lead it make their case to voters and has to ignore, not condemn, threats of violence by its leading candidate, it\u2019s not clear that there is much of a party left.\n\nThe absurdity of the situation was clear Wednesday from the reaction of Cruz to the news that Trump would not debate on Monday. Getting Trump to himself \u2013 or close to it \u2013 on a debate stage has long been a major goal for Cruz, an accomplished debater who no doubt thinks he could humiliate Trump given the opportunity.\n\nBut instead of doing the humiliating, Cruz was the one disrespected on Wednesday. Trump implied that he wasn\u2019t worth debating, and Kasich essentially agreed.\n\nCruz was reduced to resurrecting \u201c#DuckingDonald,\u201d the Twitter hashtag he used the last time Trump bailed on a Fox News debate, which had about as much effect then as it is likely to have now: none.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If a political party is no longer in charge of the process by which candidates seeking to lead it make their case to voters, and has to ignore, not condemn, threats of violence by its leading candidate, it\u2019s not clear that there is much of a party left.", "title": "Trump to GOP: I\u2019m Calling the Shots Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/16/Trump-GOP-I-m-Calling-Shots-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/us-usa-election-trump-foreign_5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/16/Trump-GOP-I-m-Calling-Shots-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/us-usa-election-trump-foreign_5.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If a political party is no longer in charge of the process by which candidates seeking to lead it make their case to voters, and has to ignore, not condemn, threats of violence by its leading candidate, it\u2019s not clear that there is much of a party left.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "John Kasich, said through a spokesman that if Trump wouldn\u2019t be there Kasich wasn\u2019t going to bother to show up either.\nThe absurdity of the situation was clear Wednesday from the reaction of Cruz to the news that Trump would not debate on Monday.\nTrump needs to collect 1,237 delegates to win the nomination on a first ballot vote.\nIt\u2019s plain and simple.\u201dOf course, as Spicer well knows, there\u2019s good reason to believe that Trump might not be speaking figuratively at all.\nTrump implied that he wasn\u2019t worth debating, and Kasich essentially agreed."}
