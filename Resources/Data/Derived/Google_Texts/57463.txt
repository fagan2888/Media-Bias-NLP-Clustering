The 2013-14 Junior Olympic Girls Gymnastics team is hosting a casual 5k walk/run Oct. 12 on the Arkansas Riverwalk.

The event is geared for all ages of participants, sponsored by the team's booster club, comprised of parents of the gymnasts. The community is invited to help these local young athletes achieve their goals and ambitions.

"What we are trying to accomplish with the walk is the fundraising part and to get people out and moving," said Beth Kimmick, booster club member. "We also will have water and light refreshments."

Registration will begin at 8 a.m. the day of the event on the Sell Avenue trailhead, off of South Ninth Street. The fee is $25 to participate, and there is no charge for children up through fifth grade. Proceeds will be used to pay for competition fees, camp fees, scholarships, equipment and more.

Kimmick said there are no winners or official times, and it is for all levels of walkers, runners and professional athletes.

The 2013-14 Junior Olympic Girls Gymnastics team is comprised of elementary-aged gymnasts in Fremont County and Westcliffe.

"They are beginners, but you can tell they have so much potential to be great," Kimmick said.

The team has three more competitions this year, one in Littleton, one in Colorado Springs and the state competition in November in Denver. Students practice throughout the year.

In case of inclement weather, the 5k run/walk event will be postponed until further notice.
