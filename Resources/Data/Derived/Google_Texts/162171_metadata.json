By Ernie Smith / Mar 2, 2015 (iStock/Thinkstock) (iStock/Thinkstock)\n\nAdvaMed says its plan is designed to reinvigorate an industry that\u2019s been facing tough times of late. FDA red tape and the medical device tax are chief among the things the trade group would like to eliminate.\n\nMembers of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) have been smarting in the nearly five years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, but the group is now ready to push for policy changes to strengthen the industry.\n\nAdvaMed has launched a new Innovation Agenda, meant to address the weaknesses facing the industry. AdvaMed President and CEO Stephen Ubl argues that overcoming the obstacles would help to create jobs and bring medical innovations to market more efficiently.\n\n\u201cThe medical technology sector has the potential to drive the new innovation economy, developing the next generation of cures and treatments and creating well-paying jobs\u2014the types of middle-class jobs the president and Congress want,\u201d Ubl said in a news release last month.\n\nThe five-step agenda includes:\n\nA push to improve the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regulatory processes to shorten approval times for medical devices and diagnostics. Suggestions for improving the coverage and payment processes for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The association hopes to encourage processes that support new technology development and \u201cprovide prompt patient access to these technologies.\u201d A repeal of the medical-device excise tax, which the association says is \u201cdraining resources from American manufacturing jobs and research.\u201d Boosting fair trade access to open up international markets to medical device makers. Improving the industry\u2019s infrastructure for research and development.\n\nIndustry officials say the excise tax is especially harmful to research and development. In comments to NewsWorks, Paul Touhey, a consultant for and former president of Fujirebio Diagnostics, said the tax negatively affected the company\u2019s innovation pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe have not laid anyone off, or cut jobs, but we had a vision and a mission to create more cancer tests, and the way to do that is to hire more research and development employees. We haven\u2019t been able to do that,\u201d Touhey told the publication.\n\nAdvaMed\u2019s Ubl says that red tape is nearly as bad for the industry.\n\n\u201cNothing could do more to stimulate investment in technologies that make a big leap forward in clinical effectiveness than the prospect of prompt FDA approval and insurance coverage,\u201d he said at a news conference last month.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "AdvaMed says its plan is designed to reinvigorate medical devices, an industry that's been facing tough times of late.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "AdvaMed says its plan is designed to reinvigorate medical devices, an industry that's been facing tough times of late.", "title": "Medical Device Group Lays Out Innovation Agenda", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/0302_devicetax.jpg", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/03/medical-device-group-lays-innovation-agenda/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "AdvaMed says its plan is designed to reinvigorate medical devices, an industry that's been facing tough times of late.", "creator": "@associationsnow", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/0302_devicetax.jpg", "title": "Medical Device Group Lays Out Innovation Agenda", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-03-02T17:36:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Leadership, Money & Business, medical device"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe51d6\"", "article_summary": "Medical Device Group Lays Out Innovation Agenda AND What's this?\nFDA red tape and the medical device tax are chief among the things the trade group would like to eliminate.\nThe five-step agenda includes:A push to improve the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regulatory processes to shorten approval times for medical devices and diagnostics.\nAdvaMed has launched a new Innovation Agenda, meant to address the weaknesses facing the industry.\nAdvaMed President and CEO Stephen Ubl argues that overcoming the obstacles would help to create jobs and bring medical innovations to market more efficiently."}
