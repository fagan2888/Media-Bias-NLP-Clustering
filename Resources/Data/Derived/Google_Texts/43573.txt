Red Beans Bayou Grill is going out of business.

Our news partners at the Wichita Business Journal report that employees were informed Sunday that the restaurant would close its doors for good on Thursday. Owner Bill Rowe, also owns Blue Moon Caterers, catering and event planning firm at 8406 W. Central.

Rowe tells the Journal that catering is a highly competitive and right now his business is "on fire" and requiring more and more of his time.

The restaurant's lease was up in the fall, and the property owner has a new tenant that wants to move into the space by the start of the holiday season.

The Business Journal reports that the restaurantâ€™s equipment will be auctioned on July 14, with a decor auction following two days later.
