Non-taxpayer dollars would also be used to help pay for the commission, which wouldn't get its funding until President Obama signed an executive order to create the group.\n\nOutside organizations have been trying for years to get a museum created. The Coalition for the National Museum of the American People sent a letter to Obama earlier this month calling on him to establish the commission.\n\n\"The National Museum of the American People will showcase how, when, why and from where we arrived in this land, our movements across the plains and mountains of the country, what each group encountered and how each helped to transform our nation,\" they wrote in the letter.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"The story of America is a story about immigration,\" Sen.
