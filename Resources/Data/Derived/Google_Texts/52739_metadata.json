I was in my second year in the Nuggets beat after five seasons covering the NHL\u2019s Colorado Rockies. This rarely happens today, but Detroit coach Chuck Daly was passing some of the pre-game time sitting in the press room, communing with the lowly members of the Fourth Estate and others.\n\nNuggets coach Doug Moe, as he often did, just poked his head through the doorway and smiled mischievously, checking out who was \u2014 and wasn\u2019t \u2014 there. It was his way of saying hello.\n\nDaly spotted him and called out, \u201cFirst one to 140 wins.\u201d\n\nMoe laughed and responded, \u201cWe won\u2019t even make it through the third quarter.\u201d\n\nClose enough.\n\nThe game lasted through three overtimes. I started and junked about twenty \u201cledes,\u201d or the first few paragraphs of a story, before finally writing about the Pistons pulling out a 186\u2013184 victory. Kiki Vandeweghe had a game-high 51 points, and Denver\u2019s Alex English and the Pistons\u2019 Isiah Thomas both had 47. The 370 points shattered the league record of 337, set in another triple-overtime game (San Antonio beat Milwaukee 171\u2013166) in 1982.\n\nThis often is forgotten, but it was the last Nuggets game worked by strikebreaker referees before the regulars, who finally had settled with the league, went back to work. If the regular referees had worked it, regardless of what had happened, Moe might not have said what he said when it was over, mostly referring to a missed call near the end of the first overtime: \u201cIt was a great game, but we got (a bad deal).\u201d\n\nThe funny thing was that one of the strikebreakers, Joe Borgia, ended up becoming a longtime NBA referee and later the league\u2019s vice president for referee operations.\n\nemail: tfrei@denverpost.com\n\nMeet the Blogger", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alex English,Chuck Daly,Doug Moe,Isiah Thomas,Kelly Trpucka,Kiki Vandeweghe", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2013/12/13/30-years/9794/", "site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Denver Nuggets-Detroit Pistons wild game was 30 years ago tonight"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "30 years ago tonight, Pistons beat Nuggets 186-184", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2013/12/13/30-years/9794/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver Nuggets-Detroit Pistons wild game, then the highest-scoring in NBA history, was 30 years ago tonight"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd22e\"", "article_summary": "Thirty years ago tonight, before the Detroit Pistons faced the Nuggets at McNichols Sports Arena, I was eating dinner in the press room.\nThis often is forgotten, but it was the last Nuggets game worked by strikebreaker referees before the regulars, who finally had settled with the league, went back to work.\nThis rarely happens today, but Detroit coach Chuck Daly was passing some of the pre-game time sitting in the press room, communing with the lowly members of the Fourth Estate and others.\nKiki Vandeweghe had a game-high 51 points, and Denver\u2019s Alex English and the Pistons\u2019 Isiah Thomas both had 47.\nThe 370 points shattered the league record of 337, set in another triple-overtime game (San Antonio beat Milwaukee 171\u2013166) in 1982."}
