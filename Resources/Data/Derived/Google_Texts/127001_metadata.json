(There was \u201climited\u201d evidence of a small reduction in lung, breast and prostate cancers.)\n\nTo put it another way, researchers calculated that if everyone between 50 and 65 took aspirin daily for 10 years, 122,000 deaths might be prevented over a period of two decades, thanks to aspirin\u2019s continued benefits even after people stop taking it.\n\n\u201cMost people between the ages of 50 and 65 would benefit from a daily [low-dose] aspirin. There would be less cancer, and that would far outweigh any side effects,\u201d lead researcher Jack Cuzick, head of the Center for Cancer Prevention at Queen Mary, University of London, told HealthDay.\n\nResearchers did find that it took three years for aspirin\u2019s benefits to take effect, and death rates were reduced only after a minimum of five years. The risk of side effects, however, also increased after five years \u2013 the most serious of which were bleeding in the stomach and peptic ulcers.\n\nWhile the risk of stomach bleeding for adults age 60 who take daily aspirin for 10 years is a relatively low 3.6 percent, the risk increases dramatically after 70, Cuzick said. He recommended that people 70 and older avoid taking aspirin to prevent cancer because of this increased risk.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nCuzick, who is also on the advisory board of aspirin maker Bayer, added that people should consult with their doctor before starting to take daily aspirin.\n\nThe research doesn\u2019t prove that aspirin prevents cancer, only that there appears to be a strong association between taking it and a decrease in cancer rates. That\u2019s not quite enough to recommend that everyone start taking aspirin, Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, told HealthDay, \u201cbut it rises to the level that people should have a discussion with their doctor.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the Annals of Oncology.\n\nPhoto: sd619/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Taking a daily low-dose aspirin has been standard advice for many at risk for heart disease, but now a large scientific review of research finds that the same advice could dramatically cut older adults\u2019 risk of developing \u2013 and dying from \u2013 colon, stomach or esophageal cancer.
