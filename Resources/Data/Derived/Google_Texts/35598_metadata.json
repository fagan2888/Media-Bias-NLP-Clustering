As part of the overhaul, the school also formed a centralized office to probe sexual and gender-based harassment complaints.\n\nBut swaths of the law school objected to the policy. Among their objections, the law professors said the policy fails to give an accused student \u201cany adequate opportunity to discover the facts charged and to confront witnesses and present a defense at an adversary hearing.\u201d They also said it doesn\u2019t \u201censure adequate representation for the accused\u201d and puts in place \u201cstarkly one-sided\u201d rules governing sexual conduct between students who are impaired or incapacitated.\n\nThe wider law school faculty is meeting this afternoon to discuss the concerns raised in the letter, according to law professors.\n\nIn response, Harvard\u2019s administration defended the policy, saying it created a neutral and fair process for investigating sexual misconduct cases. \u201cThe University is confident that the policy and procedures meet their promise of a thoughtful, fair and consistent approach to these profoundly complex and sensitive situations,\u201d the university\u2019s statement said.\n\nIt noted that Harvard has set up a committee made up of faculty, staff and students to consider whether to adjust the policy in the future.\n\nA spokesperson for Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cSomething needs to happen now. The law school should not be in the position of having to discipline students based on procedures that we consider fundamentally unfair,\u201d said Ms. Bartholet.\n\n\u201cWe find it amazing that they were so oblivious to basic due process,\u201d Martha Field, a Harvard constitutional scholar, told Law Blog. \u201cWhat they would like to do is nothing, and I\u2019m sure they prefer that we didn\u2019t publicly voice these sentiments.\u201d\n\nThe tensions between faculty and the administration heightened Wednesday after the Boston Globe published a statement signed by 28 law professors condemning the new policy as \u201cinconsistent with many of the most basic principles we teach.\u201d\n\nThe overhaul of its sexual misconduct policies announced by Harvard\u2019s president, Drew Faust, came weeks after the federal government said Harvard and dozens of universities and colleges were under investigation for their handling of sexual violence or harassment complaints.\n\nThe probe of possible violations of Title IX, the federal gender-equity law, is part of a broader push by the Obama administration to press schools to take more aggressive steps to prevent and investigate sexual assaults on campuses.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter":
