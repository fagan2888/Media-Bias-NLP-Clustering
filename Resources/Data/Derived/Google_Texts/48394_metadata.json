While many hospitals and physicians are finding medical payment reform and the move toward value-based care reimbursement challenging, the concierge medicine model may offer a solution to some of the struggles doctors are facing today.\n\nThe concierge medicine model allows physicians to spend more time with their patients while giving patients an annual membership fee instead of out-of-pocket costs associated with health insurance plans.\n\nPhysicians like Dr. Jim Williams, a primary care practitioner, find the concierge medicine model a great way to spend more time communicating with their patients and helping resolve problems in a timely manner among families and the sick. Patients can spend anywhere from half an hour to 90 minutes speaking to their primary care doctor in this environment, Williams explained.\n\nThe office staff is also able to have more time devoted to helping the patients since the primary care practice handles a much smaller volume of consumers on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, the concierge medicine model may be able to help doctors achieve the Triple Aim of Healthcare due to the fact that more time is devoted to each participant.\n\nPatient satisfaction is much higher in the concierge medicine model, according to a survey released by Concierge Choice Physicians. The majority of those polled \u2013 98 percent \u2013 stated that they are satisfied with the amount of patient-doctor communication available through concierge care.\n\n\u201cPatient satisfaction in concierge care is extremely high,\u201d Wayne Lipton, Managing Partner at Concierge Choice Physicians, told RevCycleIntelligence.com. \u201cSatisfaction in a program that is consumer-driven is measured in two ways \u2013 one, by surveys, two by participation rates. There are two different kinds of concierge \u2013 one is the full model and the other is the hybrid model.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a full model program, about two-thirds of the patients who decided to become members joined simply because they don\u2019t want to have to change their doctor,\u201d Lipton continued. \u201cThe motivation is less about wanting the perks of the model and more about their satisfaction with their doctor, and not wanting to lose him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a hybrid approach to concierge, the choice to participate is much more pure, in that patients can elect to continue with their physician in the traditional model if they wanted to. Patients in a hybrid model join because they believe in the perks of the model. The percentage of patients who join a hybrid program is less than a full model program simply because the patients are not forced into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cConcierge patients enjoy greater connectivity, more time, more convenience, more of a one-to-one mapping, and a bit more of an old-fashioned approach to healthcare in terms of the personal portion of the services,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible that doctor shortages throughout the country could be reduced if a concierge medicine model is implemented among more medical practices. Matt Jacobson, CEO of concierge practice SignatureMD, explains why.\n\n\u201cConcierge medicine's growth is being fueled by both physicians and patients. Physicians are fed up with assembly line medicine in which they get paid based on the number of patients they see per day,\u201d Jacobson told RevCycleIntelligence.com. \u201cDoctors want to practice good medicine instead of fast medicine. Similarly, patients do not want to feel like a number. They want to lock into a close relationship with a trusted physician who will do what's right for them instead of what's right according to the payer.\u201d\n\nDr. Jim Williams offered more information about the concierge medicine model in an exclusive interview with HealthPayerIntelligence.com.\n\nPhysician job retention and doctor shortages\n\nWhen asked whether concierge medicine improves physician job retention and reduces doctor shortages, Williams replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to create new doctors, but it does keep physicians providing primary care. They\u2019re more invested in where they work. They are less likely to leave. They are much closer and more connected to their patients. Therefore, the doctors tend to stay in place and the patients tend to get better connections to their doctor and better care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat gets reduced are ER visits to urgent care with doctors who don\u2019t know them and, therefore, order more tests. It certainly though makes the doctor less likely to change locations,\u201d Williams clarified.\n\nHealthcare payment reform and concierge medicine\n\nWhen asked about the biggest problems of ongoing payment reform and whether concierge medicine solves these challenges, Williams answered, \u201cCurrently, physicians report increased dissatisfaction with all of the requirements of meeting meaningful use. Physicians and patients complain that the computer interrupts their communication and interrupts their time together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors have so many demands \u2013 computer and EMR-related demands. Physicians are very frustrated with this. They feel it gets in the way of their work. Concierge medicine does not get rid of the demands of meaningful use,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cIt does give physicians much more time with their patients so that the part of the visit and the part of the doctor\u2019s day that is devoted to computer work is much less of a percentage of the time when they\u2019re with the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatients get much more meaningful face-to-face time with their doctor. This means better communication, which usually means less unnecessary testing and less testing that can be labeled as being extra careful or wasteful testing. It also means that doctors are more available when the patients call. Patients get in better and are referred to emergency rooms less often,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nPopulation health management and care coordination\n\nWhen asked how concierge medicine affects population health management and care coordination, Williams explained that, \u201cIt greatly improves the quality of screening intervention and care coordination \u2013 meaning the physician and the patient have more time to discuss what screening tests, vaccinations, etcetera might be needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the doctor has more time to talk to the patients about it, they\u2019re more likely to go and get the screening test when referred,\u201d continued Williams. \u201cThe culture of the concierge practice means that all staff members have more time to help patients navigate the healthcare system to get the care they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy receptionist has more time to help coordinate care. My nurse has more time. We are spread out across fewer patients and so, therefore, each patient\u2019s needs get much more of our attention,\u201d he stated.\n\nPatient satisfaction with concierge care\n\nWhen asked about the specific ways concierge medicine boosts patient engagement and satisfaction, Williams replied, \u201cPatient satisfaction skyrockets in concierge medicine. My patients have access to me through email directly. They all have my cell phone number. Those who are able and willing can text message me appropriately for matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about detailed, private things, but we set up phone calls and the like through text messaging. They\u2019re very connected to me. Furthermore, I make myself available to out-of-town visiting relatives of my patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen their grandparents, uncles or nieces or any other relative come in for a visit on a holiday get sick \u2013 they can get in with me. Things like this lead to great improvements in satisfaction. And my staff knows my patients so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they call and they get the same person who knows them, remembers them and recognizes their voice, they feel like they\u2019re calling a neighbor rather than an impersonal clinic where there are often a different employee each time you go. It\u2019s without question a move toward greater patient satisfaction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The concierge medicine model is becoming more and more prominent around the nation.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/concierge-medicine-model-impacts-population-health-management", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Population_Health.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Concierge Medicine Model Impacts Population Health Management"}, "twitter": {"description": "The concierge medicine model is becoming more and more prominent around the nation.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Population_Health.jpg"}, "title": "Concierge Medicine Model Impacts Population Health Management", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Patient satisfaction with concierge careWhen asked about the specific ways concierge medicine boosts patient engagement and satisfaction, Williams replied, \u201cPatient satisfaction skyrockets in concierge medicine.\nPatient satisfaction is much higher in the concierge medicine model, according to a survey released by Concierge Choice Physicians.\nThe concierge medicine model is becoming more and more prominent around the nation, as healthcare providers continue to adopt the new payment system.\nAdditionally, it is possible that doctor shortages throughout the country could be reduced if a concierge medicine model is implemented among more medical practices.\nThe concierge medicine model allows physicians to spend more time with their patients while giving patients an annual membership fee instead of out-of-pocket costs associated with health insurance plans."}
