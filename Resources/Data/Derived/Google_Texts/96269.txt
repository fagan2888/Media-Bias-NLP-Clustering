Although a Deepwater Horizon supervisor is accused of ignoring clear signs that a test showed problems hours before the rig exploded in flames in 2010, another supervisor testified that three other workers shared responsibility for interpreting the test in question.

Murry Sepulvado was the second prosecution witness to testify in Robert Kaluza's trial on a misdemeanor pollution charge. Sepulvado was not on the rig when it blew wild, starting a nearly 3-month-long gusher in the Gulf of Mexico.

Prosecutors had Sepulvado describe the test in question and other operating procedures.

During cross-examination, defense attorney David Gerger asked him whether people in three other positions could order an emergency shutdown if they felt something was going wrong with that test. Sepulvado answered "yes, sir," to each.
