Strong winds battered Colorado on Monday, gusting in excess of 100 mph on U.S. 285 over Kenosha Pass and tipping over a semi on Interstate 25 north of Wellington. Driving was dangerous, with blizzard-like conditions in the high country and blinding dust storms south of Pueblo.

In the metro area, there were dozens of reports of downed trees and limbs, including a massive pine tree that fell on the quad at Regis University.

Conditions will improve along the Front Range on Tuesday.

There is a 30 percent chance of snow in the metro area before 11 a.m. Tuesday, then mostly sunny skies with a high near 43 degrees, according to the National Weather Service based in Boulder.
