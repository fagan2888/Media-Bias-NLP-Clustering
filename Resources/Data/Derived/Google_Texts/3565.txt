Sarah Palin was once again the darling of the Conservative Political Action Conference, putting on quite a show for an enthralled crowd with her keynote address Saturday night closing out CPAC 2014 with a wink and a bang—not to mention several swings at President Obama.

Palin switched tones throughout her confident performance, running the gamut from reverent to cheeky to indignant to defiant as she invited her audience to buy into her vision of a younger, stronger and wiser conservative movement led by right-wing heroes du jour like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz—and, of course, Sarah Palin.

And the group gathered at the Gaylord International Hotel and Conference Center in National Harbor, Md., were more than willing to support her in her relentless pursuit of political relevance, as they rewarded her efforts with several standing ovations and chants of “Run, Sarah, Run!”

Palin let fly with a number of zingers aimed at Obama and his supporters, even working in a dig carefully crafted to simultaneously rib junior members of the gallery and to lend her some semblance of “street cred,” telling young people that they’re “known across the river” as “Obamacare suckas.”

Predictably, Palin also piled on the Obamacare hate-wagon, reminding onlookers that there is “no free birth control” and declaring that when it comes to government-sanctioned health care, or supposedly complimentary midday meals, “someone always pays, and if you don’t know who that ‘someone’ is, it’s probably you.”

And while she was at it, she hit out against one of her favorite targets, the “lamestream” media, making Fox News proud by gracing one network in particular with one of her customary Twitter-ready catchphrases, referring to its pundits as the “sock puppets at MSLSD.” (Over to you, MSNBC.)

But Palin’s grabbiest and most gimmicky move was her Republican-friendly reworking of Dr. Seuss’ classic “Green Eggs and Ham,” delivered with singsong gusto for a congregation clearly ready for Story Time with Sarah—and ready for Sarah Palin to toss her hat in the ring for 2016.
