The image above represents serious improvement. For the first time since early October, when I created an account at Healthcare.gov, I've actually been able to get back into my account. On a weekly basis, I had tried and failed, and could never get the system to successfully send me a reset password email. Today, I got that email, logged in, and got the message above. Two times after following logging out and waiting.

So we're getting there, with there being the moment in time when I can actually scroll through the site.

Peter Suderman suggests that for all the hoopla surrounding the "tech surge" on Healthcare.gov and Obama admin claimes that 90 percent of users are now able to access the site successfully, it's going to a long while before even the front-end of the site is working the way it should. And then stuff gets really dicey, since 30 percent to 40 percent of the site has yet to be built. Including the ability to "make payments to issuers in January," when plans kick in. That quote is courtesy of congressional testimony by deputy hoo-had at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Something tells me my wait - and yours - is going to be longer than 30 minutes.

This seems like a good time for a 15-second video about HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius bringing in the "The A-Team":
