NEW YORK (AP) - Caitlyn Jenner’s loved ones were among numerous well-wishers to support her coming out Monday in Vanity Fair.

Her stepdaughter, Kim Kardashian West, tweeted: “How beautiful! Be happy, be proud, live life YOUR way!”

Khloe Kardashian declared: “We were given this life because you were strong enough to live it! I couldn’t be prouder!!! Caitlyn .” The third K sister, Kourtney, chimed in: “Freedom! Stunning.”

Jenner daughter Kendall Jenner added “be free now pretty bird.” Her little sister Kylie Jenner took to Instagram with the cover and this sentiment: “My angel on earth!”

Among others to welcome Caitlyn - and her new Twitter handle @Caitlyn_Jenner - were Lady Gaga, who tweeted: “thanku for being a part of all of our lives & using your platform to change people’s minds.”

The White House re-tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama’s sentiment: “Nice to meet you, @Caitlyn_Jenner. The brave choice to live as your authentic self is a powerful example to so many.”

The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization GLAAD promptly issued tips and terminology for referring to transgender people.

“By sharing her journey with the world, Caitlyn Jenner is accelerating acceptance of transgender people everywhere and reminds us all how important it is to live as your most authentic self,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD’s president and CEO.

From the fashion world, designer Zac Posen offered: “Be who you are and feel beautiful.” And from TV land, Jesse Tyler Ferguson represented with a reference to another famous magazine cover, that of Paper, Kim Kardashian and her famous arc of Champagne from bottle to derriere:

“CaitlynJenner has truly broken the Internet. What a moment.’”
