Mark Warner Mark WarnerLawmaker bemoans tax 'buzzsaw' for on-demand economy workers Reid throws wrench into Clinton vice presidential picks Reid: 'Hell no' to VP pick from state with a Republican governor MORE (D-Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), now has more than 20 co-sponsors.\n\nThe IRS, which enforces the mandate, has already said that it will not count volunteer fire departments or ambulances as employers under the ObamaCare mandate. But the senators warned that the government could \u201cstill reverse course\u201d without an official change to the law.\n\n\u201cThis sensible, bipartisan fix will ensure that the law permanently and properly distinguishes between full-time, paid emergency responders and volunteers so that emergency response agencies can continue focusing on keeping our communities safe,\u201d Warner wrote in a statement.\n\nToomey added that the men and women volunteering \"have enough on their plate without having to worry about whether excessive Washington red tape will close their station.\"\n\nThe employer mandate goes into effect for the first time this year after multiple \u2014 and controversial \u2014 delays. All employers with more than 50 employees are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty that increases over time.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Bill would exempt volunteer firefighters from ObamaCare mandate", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Bill would exempt volunteer firefighters from ObamaCare mandate", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/232270-bill-would-exempt-volunteer-firefighters-from-obamacare-mandate", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/232270-bill-would-exempt-volunteer-firefighters-from-obamacare-mandate", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-10T09:19-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-10T09:19:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Mark Warner,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/232270-bill-would-exempt-volunteer-firefighters-from-obamacare-mandate", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Bill would exempt volunteer firefighters from ObamaCare mandate"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb5a\"", "article_summary": "The IRS, which enforces the mandate, has already said that it will not count volunteer fire departments or ambulances as employers under the ObamaCare mandate.\nA bipartisan group of senators is relaunching an effort to exempt volunteer firefighters and emergency responders from an ObamaCare rule requiring employers to offer insurance to full-time employees.\nAll employers with more than 50 employees are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty that increases over time.\nThe employer mandate goes into effect for the first time this year after multiple \u2014 and controversial \u2014 delays.\nBut the senators warned that the government could \u201cstill reverse course\u201d without an official change to the law."}
