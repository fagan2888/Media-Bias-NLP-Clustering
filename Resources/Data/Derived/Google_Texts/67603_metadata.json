These patients aren\u2019t dying from the condition that forced them to go to the hospital in the first place. They\u2019re dying from unintended mishaps.\n\nEric Andrist is overcome with emotion as he remembers the death of his sister Cali. Andrist cared for his mentally disabled sister day and night, and recalls that once he took her to the emergency room at Providence St Joseph's in Burbank, California for a stomachache. Days later she was dead.\n\n\u201cMy sister was writhing in pain for so long. It just haunts me. The last moments my sister, are just engrained in my head,\u201d Adrist said.\n\nA binder full of medical records shows a long list of possible mistakes healthcare professionals made when treating Cali.\n\nDeadly medical errors can happen at even the most highly rated hospitals. New research shows that up to 440,000 people die every year in America from preventable medical mistakes. That would make it the third leading cause of death in the US, following heart disease and cancer.\n\n\u201cThe incidence of people dying of errors in hospitals is abysmal in this country. It\u2019s really a crisis level problem,\u201d said Leah Binder, the president and CEO of Leapfrog Group, a non-profit watchdog group which rates hospital safety in the US.\n\nIn 1999, the Institute of Medicine reported that up to 98,000 people a year die because of mistakes in hospitals. In 2013, a study in the Journal of Patient Safety said that number may now be between 210,000 and 440,000 patients: more than the population of Miami, Florida.\n\nNot all medical errors kill, but they can still cause a lifetime of pain.\n\n\u201cWhen I left the operating room, I had a fever, I was nauseous, I was having chills, and I was told that was probably due to the anesthesia,\u201d said Alicia Cole, a medical error survivor.\n\nCole, who used to work as an actress and model, went to the hospital for a routine myomectomy to remove two uterine fibroids. She expected to be out in a few days. Instead, she contracted Necrotizing Fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating bacteria.\n\n\u201cYou can see this is all eaten out here, and cut out. Here it is going down my thigh,\u201d Cole said as she showed photos of the infection overtaking her body\u2019s midsection.\n\nYears later Cole is still in physical therapy.\n\nHer claim of hospital injury is not isolated.\n\nShelly Skalicky was diagnosed with Spina Bifida as a child. In 2008, she went into the hospital for elective surgery to relieve some of her symptoms.\n\nSkalicky and her husband Danny Long used to enjoy an active outdoor lifestyle. However, after her trip to the hospital, Skalicky came out a quadriplegic and now requires round the clock care.\n\nHome videos show Long helping his wife to do the simplest tasks.\n\n\u201cWe have never been allowed to talk to any doctors. We\u2019re not allowed to talk to the patients\u2019 safety department. We\u2019re not allowed to talk to the ethics department. We\u2019re not allowed to talk to anybody except hospital lawyers,\u201d said Long.\n\nBecause some states have caps on malpractice claims, many lawyers refuse to take on cases of medical error.\n\nDespite their frustration with the healthcare system, their love has strengthened during the struggle.\n\n\u201cI rely on her as much as she relies on me. If most guys were honest they would have to admit that too. She is my rock,\u201d said Long.\n\nMany healthcare professionals want to reduce accidents but transparency remains a major barrier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long since been time that we have a national conversation about these deaths in hospitals,\u201d said Binder.\n\nA requirement in the Affordable Care Act encourages Medicare providers to report medical errors, but it stops short of requiring all health care providers from participating.\n\n\u201cThe best hospitals find ways to create safety nets around the mistakes they expect people to make,\u201d said Binder. \u201cThey double-count their sponges, they barcode their sponges, to double check they are not leaving sponges inside a patient. There is barcoding for medication administration now too,\u201d Binder added.\n\nAnd while technology might help, simple, inexpensive things like good hygiene can prevent infection.\n\nIn Alicia Cole\u2019s case, the State Health Department found her hospital had broken several patient safety laws.\n\n\u201cAsk your doctor what the infection rate is for the procedure you\u2019re going to have,\u201d said Cole\n\n\u201cDocument everything. Take a little notebook with you and write down every drug they give you. Make sure you have your cell phone with your little camera so you can take pictures of things,\u201d said Andrist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right that in a country as wealthy as the US and with the resources that we have, there\u2019s no reasons patients should have to go through that,\u201d Cole added.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Staggering new numbers are shedding light on a critical problem in the American healthcare system.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Staggering new numbers are shedding light on a critical problem in the American healthcare system.", "title": "Medical errors kill hundreds of thousands each year in the US", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/2f/40/00/000_gyi0064761041.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/medical-errors-kill-galindo-924/", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimzied": "width", "twitter": {"description": "Staggering new numbers are shedding light on a critical problem in the American healthcare system.", "creator": "@RT_com", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/2f/40/00/000_gyi0064761041.si.jpg", "title": "RT International", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "navigation": "tabbed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced21\"", "article_summary": "Not all medical errors kill, but they can still cause a lifetime of pain.\nA requirement in the Affordable Care Act encourages Medicare providers to report medical errors, but it stops short of requiring all health care providers from participating.\nA recent report by the Journal of Patient Safety indicates that between 200,000 and 440,000 people are killed each year in the United States from preventable medical errors.\nDeadly medical errors can happen at even the most highly rated hospitals.\nIn Alicia Cole\u2019s case, the State Health Department found her hospital had broken several patient safety laws."}
