Which, lovers might agree, explains the tension between the not-quite tragic and blossoming love.\n\nProspero, portrayed with a sonorous authority by Peter Simon Hilton, was robbed of his title by younger brother Antonio (Scott Bellot). Twelve years later, he exacts revenge with honed conjuring skills and the help of the spirit Ariel.\n\nThe titular storm Prospero calls forth wrecks the ship carrying his brother/ betrayer as well as Alonso, King of Naples (Chris Kendall), Alonso\u2019s son Ferdinand (Benjamin Bonenfant) and others.\n\nThree groups of survivors are scattered and presume the demise of their fellow travelers. Antonio proves to be up to his old tricks as he tries to persuade Sebastian (David Bolus) to off Alonso, who is grieving after the presumed death of his son, Ferdinand. Far from drowned, Ferdinand is sunk, having fallen hard for Miranda (Kyra Lindsey). The feeling is mutual.\n\nOn another part of the island, court jester Trinculo (Rodney Lizcano) and the king\u2019s butler, Stephano (Sammie Joe Kinnett), meet the strange creature Caliban, who recounts the cause of his contempt for Prospero. The play\u2019s most ridiculous charms comes from the bender the trio goes on.\n\nWhat kind of \u201cTempest\u201d audiences will be treated to is often signaled by which character \u2014 Caliban (Joshua Archer), amalgam of man and amphibian, or Ariel (Vanessa Morosco) \u2014 the production emphasizes. Ariel wins out here.\n\nThis should come as welcome news to those made uncomfortable \u2014 or who downright despise \u2014 interpretations that place \u201cThe Tempest\u201d in the midst of arguments about colonialism.\n\nAriel enters the play gripping white trapeze straps. Opening night, some of Morosco\u2019s performance was lost to her athletic labors. But the commitment to amaze speaks to director Geoffrey Kent\u2019s embrace of Shakespeare as lively entertainment.\n\nStill, for all the spectacle, Hilton\u2019s Prospero remains the draw. Prospero is hardly a warm or even easy- to- understand protagonist. (Sorely, the power-obsessed, Macbeth makes more emotional sense). What a world we occupy when forgiveness is the truest of mysteries.\n\nHilton leads with his voice and delivers the crests and troughs of Shakepeare\u2019s language.\n\nThis \u201cTempest\u201d revels in the magic and ultimately the mercy of Shakespeare\u2019s play \u2014 the last he wrote alone. It embraces the wit and the unfolding of Prospero\u2019s wisdom.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cTHE TEMPEST.\u201d Written by William Shakespeare.
