Lawmakers in California passed the Parent Trigger law back in 2010. The law allows parents of children attending failing public schools to force major changes if half of the parents sign a petition. Last year, parents of children attending Desert Trails Elementary School in Adelanto, Calif., pulled the parent trigger and transformed the school to a public charter school called Desert Trails Preparatory Academy. “We’ve seen major, major progress…since the beginning of the year,” says Debra Tarver, executive director of Desert Trails Preparatory Academy.

In other California school districts, just the threat of Parent Trigger is helping parents get what they want.

Back in 2011, Reason TV covered the first ever attempt by parents, with the help of the non-profit organization Parent Revolution, to use the Parent Trigger. While the effort by parents at McKinley Elementary to use the Parent Trigger ultimately failed, parents at other California schools are figuring out how use the law to their advantage, and at least seven other states have adopted some form of the Parent Trigger.
