Ted Cruz is blasting the bipartisan budget deal that passed the Senate this week, saying the deal \u201cwent backwards\u201d and would only worsen the nation\u2019s spiraling debt.The budget compromise that had been championed by GOP Rep. Paul Ryan in the House passed the Senate by a 63 to 36 vote.Speaking in an exclusive Newsmax Magazine interview, Cruz said Friday: \u201cIt\u2019s a sad statement that the easiest way to get bipartisan agreement in Washington is to increase spending, debt, and taxes.\u201cThat\u2019s why the American people are so frustrated with career politicians in Washington in both parties, because they\u2019re not listening to the American people and they\u2019re not working to solve the enormous fiscal and economic challenges that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he added.The deal on the budget reduces the impact of the automatic sequester cuts by about $63 billion over two years. Its includes a controversial 1 percent cut in cost-of-living pension adjustments to some military retirees that Cruz opposes, and only cuts $23 billion from spending over the next decade.Critics have pointed out the $23 billion over 10 years is only about 3 percent of the federal government\u2019s $680 billion deficit for 2013 alone.The U.S. national debt, which was roughly $10 trillion when President Obama took office, now stands at over $17 trillion. And Cruz warned time is running out to fix it.\u201cWe have a brief window of time to turn things around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a long time.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are nearing the point of no return.\u201dCruz described himself as \u201cprofoundly optimistic\u201d that the nation will eventually get its balance sheet back in order \u2013 but not thanks to Washington.\u201cThe answer\u2019s going to have to come from the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come from Washington. It\u2019s got to come from millions and millions of Americans across this country standing up, and holding elected officials accountable, telling elected officials of both parties, \u2018Stop doing what you\u2019ve been doing over and over again, it\u2019s not working.\u2019\u201dIncreasingly, Cruz is being mentioned among the top potential contenders for the 2016 GOP nomination. Perhaps due to the spotlight shined on him during the shutdown over Obamacare, Cruz\u2019s name recognition has skyrocketed.The freshman senator from Texas recently was named the third most influential figure in the world in a Rasmussen poll, behind only Pope Francis and President Obama.The price for his meteoric rise: Cruz is sustaining more frequent political attacks by rivals. New York Republican Rep. Peter King, reportedly flirting with tossing his own hat in the ring for the 2016 nomination, recently described Cruz and fellow movement-conservative Rand Paul as \u201cout of touch with the American people.\u201dAsked his reaction to that broadside, Cruz replied that King is \u201ccertainly entitled to his opinion.\u201dBut he added: \u201cNobody should be surprised that the Washington establishment doesn\u2019t want to change. No one should be surprised that the Washington establishment fights back.\u201cYou don\u2019t get a $17 trillion national debt without a whole lot of bipartisan cooperation, without a whole lot of Republicans going along to get along with Democrats and exploding the size, power, and spending of the federal government. And that\u2019s why so many people across this country are rightly fed up with Washington.\u201dBut Cruz says the sequester unfairly requires the military to bear a disproportionate burden.\u201cI think we owe it to the men and women in the military to stand with them, to support them,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the most disturbing aspects of this recent budget deal is that it cuts the retirements of our veterans, retroactively, and it doesn\u2019t do the same thing for civilian employees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ted cruz,budget deal", "pubdate": "2013-12-20T21:29:22", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Texas GOP Sen.
