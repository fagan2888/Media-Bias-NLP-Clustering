In an interview Sunday evening conducted jointly by The Associated Press and the Minneapolis Star Tribune that advisers said would be the only one granted, Palmer said again that he believes he acted legally and that he was stunned to find out his hunting party had killed one of Zimbabwe\u2019s treasured animals.\n\n\u201cIf I had known this lion had a name and was important to the country or a study obviously I wouldn\u2019t have taken it,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cNobody in our hunting party knew before or after the name of this lion.\u201d\n\nCecil was a fixture in the vast Hwange National Park and had been fitted with a GPS collar as part of Oxford University lion research. Palmer said he shot the big cat with the black mane using an arrow from his compound bow outside the park\u2019s borders but it didn\u2019t die immediately. He disputed conservationist accounts that the wounded lion wandered for 40 hours and was finished off with a gun, saying it was tracked down the next day and killed with an arrow.\n\nAn avid sportsman, Palmer shut off several lines of inquiry about the hunt, including how much he paid for it or others he has undertaken. No videotaping or photographing of the interview was allowed. During the 25-minute interview, Palmer gazed intensely at his questioners, often fiddling with his hands and turning occasionally to an adviser, Joe Friedberg, to field questions about the fallout and his legal situation.\n\nSome high-level Zimbabwean officials have called for Palmer\u2019s extradition, but no formal steps toward getting the dentist to return to Zimbabwe have been publicly disclosed. Friedberg, a Minneapolis attorney who said he is acting as an unpaid consultant to Palmer, said he has heard nothing from authorities about domestic or international investigations since early August.\n\nFriedberg said he offered to have Palmer take questions from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service authorities on the condition the session be recorded. He said he never heard back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Walter\u2019s lawyer in this situation because Walter doesn\u2019t need a lawyer in this situation,\u201d said Friedberg, who said he knew Palmer through previous matters. \u201cIf some governmental agency or investigative unit would make a claim that he violated some law then we\u2019d talk about it.\u201d\n\nBen Petok, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Andy Luger, declined comment about conversations with Friedberg and referred questions to Fish and Wildlife. An agency spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately return a call or an email Sunday evening.\n\nAfter Palmer was named in late July as the hunter who killed Cecil, his Bloomington clinic and Eden Prairie home became protest sites, and a vacation property he owns in Florida was vandalized. Palmer has been vilified across social media, with some posts suggesting violence against him. He described himself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d for causing disruptions for staff at his clinic, which was shuttered for weeks until reopening in late August without him on the premises. And he said the ordeal has been especially hard on his wife and adult daughter, who both felt threatened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand that level of humanity to come after people not involved at all,\u201d Palmer said.\n\nAs for himself, he said he feels safe enough to return to work \u2014 \u201cMy staff and my patients support me and they want me back\u201d \u2014 but declined to say where he\u2019s spent the last six weeks or describe security steps he has taken.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out of the public eye. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in hiding,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cI\u2019ve been among people, family and friends. Location is really not that important.\u201d\n\nPalmer, who has several big-game kills to his name, reportedly paid thousands of dollars for the guided hunt but wouldn\u2019t talk money on Sunday.\n\nTheo Bronkhorst, a professional hunter who helped Palmer, has been charged with \u201cfailure to prevent an illegal hunt.\u201d Honest Ndlovu, whose property is near the park in western Zimbabwe, faces a charge of allowing the lion hunt to occur on his farm without proper authority.\n\nAsked whether he would return to Zimbabwe for future hunts, Palmer said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about the future.\u201d He estimated he had been there four times and said, \u201cZimbabwe has been a wonderful country for me to hunt in, and I have always followed the laws.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Cecil furor, Palmer pleaded guilty in 2008 to making false statements to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service about a black bear he fatally shot in western Wisconsin outside of the authorized hunting zone. He was given one year probation and fined nearly $3,000 as part of a plea agreement.\n\nCecil\u2019s killing set off a fierce debate over trophy hunting in Africa. Zimbabwe tightened regulations for lion, elephant and leopard hunting after the incident, and three major U.S. airlines changed policies to ban shipment of the trophies.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Forliti contributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Minnesota dentist whose killing of Cecil the lion sparked a global backlash emerged for an interview in which he disputed some accounts of the hunt, expressed agitation at the animosity directed at those close to him and said he would be back at work within days.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Minnesota dentist whose killing of Cecil the lion sparked a global backlash emerged for an interview in which he disputed some accounts of the hunt, expressed agitation at the animosity directed at those close to him and said he would be back at work within days.", "title": "Cecil the lion killer Walter Palmer grants interview, set to return to dental practice", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/cecil-lion-killer-walter-palmer-grants-interview-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/Cecil.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/Cecil.jpg", "description": "The Minnesota dentist whose killing of Cecil the lion sparked a global backlash emerged for an interview in which he disputed some accounts of the hunt, expressed agitation at the animosity directed a", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Cecil the lion killer Walter Palmer grants interview, set to return to"}, "Author": "Brian Bakst", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Walter Palmer, Zimbabwe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1a4\"", "article_summary": "Walter Palmer, who has spent more than a month out of sight after becoming the target of protests and threats, intends to return to his suburban Minneapolis dental practice Tuesday.\nDuring the 25-minute interview, Palmer gazed intensely at his questioners, often fiddling with his hands and turning occasionally to an adviser, Joe Friedberg, to field questions about the fallout and his legal situation.\n\u201cIf I had known this lion had a name and was important to the country or a study obviously I wouldn\u2019t have taken it,\u201d Palmer said.\nSome high-level Zimbabwean officials have called for Palmer\u2019s extradition, but no formal steps toward getting the dentist to return to Zimbabwe have been publicly disclosed.\nZimbabwe tightened regulations for lion, elephant and leopard hunting after the incident, and three major U.S. airlines changed policies to ban shipment of the trophies."}
