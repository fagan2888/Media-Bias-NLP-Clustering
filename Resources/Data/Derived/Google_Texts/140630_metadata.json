Patients with insurance typically go home or to a nursing home and have their antibiotics administered by a home health care worker or nursing home worker.\n\nBut uninsured patients typically stay in a hospital for the entire time they need the antibiotics.\n\n\"Requiring these patients to be hospitalized for several weeks means loss of personal freedom for the patients and a delay in activities of daily living, such as returning to work and caring for children at home,\" Bhavan said. \"This practice also can lead to a tremendous cost for public hospitals, taking up beds that could go to patients who require more intensive care.\"\n\nThe four-year study compared 944 uninsured patients who were taught to administer their own IV antibiotics and 224 patients who received antibiotics from a health care worker.\n\nThe patients who self-administered had a 47 percent lower rate of hospital readmission over 30 days. Death rates were similar in both groups.\n\nThe study was published online recently in the journal PLOS Medicine.\n\nStudy senior author Dr. Robert Haley, a professor of internal medicine, called the outcome a \"win-win situation.\"\n\n\"It's an obvious win for the patients, who don't have to sit in the hospital for six weeks and can go about their normal lives. It's also a big win for the public hospitals. Having these patients take up beds has been costly for these hospitals, which are often full,\" he said in the news release.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians has more about antibiotics.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/infectious-disease-information-21/antibiotics-news-30/self-administration-iv-antibiotics-plos-med-utsmc-release-batch-2447-706238.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/40321.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Practice could save money while helping uninsured patients avoid long hospital stays, researchers say", "title": "Patients Can Self-Administer IV Antibiotics at Home: Study"}, "description": "Practice could save money while helping uninsured patients avoid long hospital stays, researchers say", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "The four-year study compared 944 uninsured patients who were taught to administer their own IV antibiotics and 224 patients who received antibiotics from a health care worker.\nTHURSDAY, Dec. 24, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Patients can be taught to safely self-administer long-term intravenous antibiotics at home, without the help of a health care worker, a new study suggests.\nSome infections require treatment with IV antibiotics for six weeks or more.\nBut uninsured patients typically stay in a hospital for the entire time they need the antibiotics.\nPatients with insurance typically go home or to a nursing home and have their antibiotics administered by a home health care worker or nursing home worker."}
