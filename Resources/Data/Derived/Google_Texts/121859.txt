A wingwalker died after his parachute failed to deploy after he fell from a plane in Pasco County, the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office said.

Mark Curto, 62, of Tampa appears to have been a part of an air show, sheriff’s spokesperson Melanie Snow said.

The pilot safely landed the biplane that Curto fell from at Topp of Tampa airport in Land O’ Lakes, Snow said.

Curto was found on Grand Oaks Boulevard in Land O’ Lakes.

It is at least the third fatal skydiving accident in the Tampa Bay area in the past three years.

In March, two skydivers from Iceland, instructor Orvar Arnarson, 41, and student, Andrimar Pordarson, 25, died in a jump March 23 at Skydive City in Zephyrhills. In that case, for an unknown reason neither man deployed his chute, and emergency chutes deployed too close to the ground to save them. Video from Amarson’s helmet cam showed he tried to open Pordarson’s chute before they hit the ground.

In 2010, Paul C. Luter III, 68, died after jumping at Skydive City. In that instance, the chute apparently malfunctioned.
