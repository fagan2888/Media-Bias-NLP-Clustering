Those in-house advisers help patients navigate the exchange, an important aid for those who haven\u2019t bought health insurance in the past.\n\nOther hospital systems in North Texas, including Parkland and Methodist, received federal approval for this relatively simple process. They\u2019ve already trained more than 100 counselors combined, while JPS remains on the sideline.\n\n\u201cWe applied in mid-August and we\u2019ve been watching and waiting,\u201d said David Salsberry, chief financial officer at JPS. \u201cBut we have day jobs, too.\u201d\n\nJPS hasn\u2019t received an explanation for the delay from federal regulators, he said, and has had trouble reaching the right officials.\n\nDoctors waiting, too\n\nMany doctors are in the dark, too. They\u2019re often a go-to source when patients want advice on insurance, but most are reluctant to offer recommendations on the exchange. That\u2019s largely because they don\u2019t know whether their practices are included in the health plans\u2019 networks.\n\n\u201cIt is not likely physicians will know in which exchange plans they have been placed by insurers,\u201d Dr. Stephen Brotherton, president of the Texas Medical Association, wrote in an email.\n\nThe group has been unable to find a simple way for patients to confirm network information, he added.\n\nThe Dallas County Medical Society said that most of its member doctors don\u2019t know which plans include them, either. Enrollment in the exchanges continues for six months, with coverage starting on Jan. 1.\n\nSome customers will pay more for a health plan whose network includes their preferred doctors and hospitals. Others will choose a lower-cost plan, even if it forces them to pick new providers.\n\nMuch of the business on the exchanges is expected to be driven by price. Insurers often create lower-priced plans by narrowing the network of doctors and hospitals. But if patients go outside the network, their out-of-pocket costs can soar.\n\nIn a recent survey, 69 percent of insurers reported narrow-network contracts.\n\n\u201cInsurers passed over major medical centers in Chicago, Indiana, Kentucky, Los Angeles, Tennessee and elsewhere in an effort to tamp down hospital and medical costs,\u201d according to the report by the Health Research Institute of PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nSome patients with complex conditions could be squeezed out of specialty hospitals, the report said.\n\nBaylor Health Care System, one of the largest in North Texas, is included in the networks for just 11 of 36 plans offered in Dallas County, Baylor officials said. Another two plans in Collin County also exclude Baylor.\n\nEvaluating plans\n\nTrade-offs of this sort have been a part of private insurance for years. About half of Americans get health coverage through their employer, and they may be accustomed to reviewing networks during open enrollment.\n\nDoing the same analysis with the exchanges could be difficult, because it\u2019s not one-stop shopping. At Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the state\u2019s largest insurer, you have to select a plan and then plug that program into the website\u2019s doctor search.\n\nMy longtime family doctor is part of the network in one bronze plan but not others. It would cost 30 percent more, $113 extra per month, to continue that relationship with an individual policy.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the easier decisions in choosing insurance on the exchange. Evaluating co-pays, deductibles and monthly premiums requires a close look backward and forward. Subsidies and tax breaks are part of the calculation, too.\n\nThose who have bought health insurance can probably handle this alone. But newcomers can turn to counselors and others trained to assist in the process. Unlike insurance brokers, they\u2019re prohibited from recommending a specific health plan, but they can explain the trade-offs.\n\nParkland and Methodist trained dozens of counselors, in part because they serve so many uninsured patients. JPS wants to get in the swing, too, while the exchanges are top of mind.\n\nThe federal program doesn\u2019t have rigorous requirements. Organizations can be approved for training if they provide social services, help people with health care issues and ensure that counselors protect patients\u2019 privacy. That\u2019s a slam dunk for JPS.\n\nThe hospital expects to be approved soon, Salsberry said, and it plans to train about 65 staff members. They can be certified after completing a five-hour course online, and he may do everybody on a single Saturday.\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve been too passive,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shoppers on the health exchanges should be patient and thorough in evaluating their options.", "og": {"description": "Shoppers on the health exchanges should be patient and thorough in evaluating their options.", "title": "Narrow networks and more snafus in Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20131007-narrow-networks-and-more-snafus-in-obamacare.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131007-health_overhaul_texas_33505179.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_TEXAS_33505179.JPG", "height": 422}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-10-08T03:01:03Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-10-08T02:59:21Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Narrow networks and more snafus in Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20131007-narrow-networks-and-more-snafus-in-obamacare.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131007-health_overhaul_texas_33505179.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_TEXAS_33505179.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1233129\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-08T02:59:21Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131007-health_overhaul_texas_33505179.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_TEXAS_33505179.JPG", "publishtime": "2013-10-08T02:59:21Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca131\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s largely because they don\u2019t know whether their practices are included in the health plans\u2019 networks.\nJPS Health Network, which treats the poor in Tarrant County, hasn\u2019t received federal approval to train certified application counselors.\nIf you want to be treated at a Baylor hospital, for instance, be warned that just 1 in 3 plans on the health exchange include Baylor in their networks.\nThose in-house advisers help patients navigate the exchange, an important aid for those who haven\u2019t bought health insurance in the past.\nSome customers will pay more for a health plan whose network includes their preferred doctors and hospitals."}
