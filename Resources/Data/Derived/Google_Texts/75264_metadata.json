Users typically fill out a short questionnaire online and then get a suggested portfolio of exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to multiple asset classes.\n\nBut investors tempted to try one of these services should be aware that the recommended portfolios can vary widely for a single person, as the Journal found when we looked at robo advisers\u2019 picks for three hypothetical investors. (The services also vary in other ways, including their fees, account minimums and the availability of phone assistance from human advisers.)\n\nAs seen in this chart, five selected robos suggested very different mixes of U.S. stocks, international stocks, U.S. bonds, international bonds and other investments for a moderate-risk investor:\n\nThere are also more subtle variations within these asset classes\u2014 including differing allocations to small stocks and emerging markets and different types of assets used besides standard stocks and bonds.\n\nFor readers who want to delve in further, here are the lists of ETFs the five services recommended for our moderate-risk investor:\n\nSCHWAB INTELLIGENT PORTFOLIOS\n\nU.S. stocks: 30%\n\nSchwab U.S. Large-Cap (SCHX), 8%\n\nSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company (FNDX), 11%\n\nSchwab U.S. Small-Cap (SCHA), 4%\n\nSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company (FNDA), 7%\n\nInternational stocks: 30%\n\nSchwab International Equity (SCHF), 5%\n\nSchwab Fundamental International Large Company (FNDF), 8%\n\nSchwab International Small-Cap Equity (SCHC), 3%\n\nSchwab Fundamental International Small Company (FNDC), 5%\n\nSchwab Emerging Markets Equity (SCHE), 4%\n\nSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company (FNDE), 5%\n\nU.S. bonds: 12%\n\nSPDR Barclays Intermediate Term Corporate Bond (ITR), 1%\n\nVanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities (VMBS), 3%\n\niShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond (SHYG), 8%\n\nInternational bonds: 9.49%\n\nVanguard Total International Bond (BNDX), 2.49%\n\nMarket Vectors EM Local Currency Bond (EMLC), 7%\n\nOther: 18.51%\n\nSchwab U.S. REIT (SCHH), 3%\n\nVanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate (VNQI), 2%\n\niShares Gold Trust (IAU), 5%\n\nCash, 8.51%\n\nWEALTHFRONT\n\nU.S. stocks: 41%\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), 35%\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), 6%\n\nInternational stocks: 31%\n\nVanguard FTSE Developed Markets (VEA), 17%\n\nVanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), 14%\n\nU.S. bonds: 23%\n\niShares National AMT-Free Muni Bond (MUB), 23%\n\nOther: 5%\n\niPath Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return (DJP), 5%\n\nBETTERMENT\n\nU.S. stocks: 33.5%\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), 12.9%\n\nVanguard Value (VTV), 12.9%\n\nVanguard Mid-Cap Value (VOE), 4.1%\n\nVanguard Small-Cap Value (VBR), 3.6%\n\nInternational stocks: 36.4%\n\nVanguard FTSE Developed Markets (VEA), 30.1%\n\nVanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), 6.3%\n\nU.S. bonds: 15.6%\n\nVanguard Total Bond Market (BND), 10.4%\n\niShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond (LQD), 5.2%\n\nInternational bonds: 14.5%\n\nVanguard Total International Bond (BNDX), 10.3%\n\nVanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond (VWOB), 4.2%\n\nTRADEKING CORE\n\nU.S. stocks: 38%\n\nVanguard Small-Cap Value (VBR)\n\nVanguard Small-Cap (VB)\n\nVanguard Mid-Cap Value (VOE)\n\nVanguard Mid-Cap Value (VO)\n\nVanguard Value (VTV)\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market (VTI)\n\nInternational stocks: 17%\n\nVanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO)\n\niShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap (SCZ)\n\nVanguard FTSE Developed Markets (VEA)\n\nU.S. bonds: 34%\n\nVanguard Short-Term Bond (BSV)\n\nVanguard Total Bond Market (BND)\n\nSPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK)\n\nSchwab U.S. TIPS (SCHP)\n\nInternational bonds: 4%\n\niShares J.P.
