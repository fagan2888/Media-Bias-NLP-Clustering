According to the lawsuit, the drug\u2019s price is exorbitant.\n\nAccording to the suit, Gilead\u2019s patent protection does not justify the drug\u2019s steep cost: $84,000 per treatment course, or about $1,000 per pill. Gilead\u2019s \u201climited rights as a patent holder do not translate into a license to price-gouge consumers,\u201d the lawsuit reads. SEPTA has shelled out $2.4 million for Sovaldi for its employees since the drug came out last year. Gilead made $8.5 billion from sales of the drug in the first three quarters of 2014.\n\nSovaldi isn\u2019t a cure-all, but the drug has been found to eliminate the hepatitis C virus in about 90 percent of patients when it is used alongside another drug. It also is better tolerated and has fewer side effects than past treatments.\n\nKeep Reading: New Hepatitis C Treatments Spur Hope for a Cure \u00bb\n\nDrug Pricing a \u2018Pressing Social Issue\u2019\n\nJim Ruble, a clinical associate professor of pharmacotherapy at the University of Utah College of Pharmacy, said he believes the case represents a very \u201cpressing social issue.\u201d\n\nWith drug costs rising overall, it brings many issues to the fore for politicians, drug manufacturers, and consumers. There are many sides to the story. Consumers may feel like they are being price-gauged, while drugmakers may see value in the increased cost of drugs like Sovaldi.\n\n\u201cTo some degree I think people feel like we\u2019re being tested as a society,\u201d he said.\n\nA lot of people will require this drug and, if insurers cover it at that price, that will affect the other things for which insurers can pay. Jason N. Doctor, University of Southern California\n\nThe amount of money drug companies spend on research and development needs to be more transparent, Ruble said. That could calm some of the outrage over high drug prices, he added.\n\nKate Greenwood, a research fellow and law lecturer at Seton Hall University, said the key is to balance drug access with the need to incentivize innovation.\n\n\u201cAt some point, restricting the price that firms can charge for medications will reduce the number of new medications that the private sector develops,\u201d she said.\n\nJason N. Doctor, a health economist at the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Pharmacy, is not sure what will come of the lawsuit, but he says demand for the breakthrough drug will continue to rise. Insurers have budgets, though. High-priced drugs are typically supported only to treat rare diseases that affect very few people.\n\n\u201cSovaldi is different,\u201d Doctor explained. \u201cA lot of people will require this drug and, if insurers cover it at that price, that will affect the other things for which insurers can pay.\u201d\n\nLearn More: New Hep C Drug Sovaldi Ignites Fierce Pricing Debate \u00bb\n\nA Battle of Values vs. OutcomesSovaldi isn\u2019t the first medication with a hefty price tag, Ruble noted. Provenge, a drug used to treat prostate cancer, costs about $93,000 for three cycles of therapy. For some people, it may be well worth it because it can prolong their lives. Others may not find value in the therapy or its cost.\n\n\u201cIs it worth it? That\u2019s where we have a lot of conflicting values,\u201d Ruble said.\n\nGreenwood said she\u2019s inclined to think Sovaldi may not be overpriced because hepatitis C is expensive for patients and for the healthcare system overall. Plus, a patient should only have to take one course of treatment to achieve a cure.\n\n\u201cSovaldi is not like, say, a drug that lowers cholesterol or treats high blood pressure, which a company would expect doctors to prescribe, and patients to take, for many years,\u201d she said.\n\nTaking Sovaldi may mean a patient can avoid liver transplant surgery. This surgery does not always guarantee results and could lead to other complications, Ruble said.\n\nSovaldi costs a lot of money now, but supporters say it will save money years later when hepatitis would have otherwise damaged a patient's liver, explained Doctor.\n\nHe said it\u2019s difficult to comprehend the value of a drug when the benefits are so far off. Plus, patients want insurers to pay for drugs that may not be cost effective if their beneficiaries later cancel their health plans.\n\nDoctor said that the United States does not have good way to reward innovation for drugs like Sovaldi.\n\n\u201cHepatitis C will have a huge social cost in the future. We have to think about that too; how can we reward the makers of this breakthrough drug and not overcharge insurers who may not directly retain the benefits?\u201d Doctor asked.\n\nOne reason Sovaldi is controversial is because its price is much lower in other countries. But this is common, Greenwood said. America is a wealthy country with a relatively free market.\n\nThe United States spends about twice as much on drugs as countries in Europe because European nations have stricter price controls, Doctor said. In France, the drug will cost about $51,000 after negotiations, he noted.\n\nRead More: Doctors Battle Insurers for Access to Pricey Hepatitis C Drugs \u00bb\n\nWill the Case Against Gilead Stand?\n\nGreenwood believes the court will dismiss the SEPTA lawsuit at an early stage.\n\n\u201cThe first and fourth counts of the complaint, alleging unjust enrichment and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, appear to boil down to a claim that the price of Sovaldi is unreasonably high, a claim that I do not believe is actionable,\u201d she said.\n\nIt would be surprising if Gilead were to discriminate against people with hepatitis C on the basis of their disability, since people with hepatitis C are the company's customers. Kate Greenwood, Seton Hall University\n\nGreenwood said that the second count in the complaint talks about Gilead\u2019s monopoly, but that is explicitly authorized by a statute \u2014 the Hatch-Waxman Act \u2014 that incentivizes drug development.\n\nThe third count alleges that Gilead has discriminated against people with hepatitis C on the basis of their disability, and violates the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Even if the ACA applies to Gilead \u2014 something Greenwood questions \u2014 SEPTA did not claim that Gilead denied drug access to patients who could afford to pay for the treatment.\n\n\u201cIt would be surprising if Gilead were to discriminate against people with hepatitis C on the basis of their disability, since people with hepatitis C are the company's customers,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated News: Life After Hepatitis C: Normal If You\u2019re Cured, Possible Criminal Charges If You\u2019re Not \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "class-action suit, sovaldi, hepatitis c, gilead sciences, drug costs", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has sued Gilead over their high-priced hepatitis C treatment.", "title": "Employer Heads to Court for Class-Action Suit Over Cost of Hep C Drug Sovaldi", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/class-action-suit-over-cost-of-hep-c-drug-sovaldi-121514", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/121514_gavel_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/121514_gavel_THUMB.jpg", "description": "The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has sued Gilead over their high-priced hepatitis C treatment.", "card": "summary", "title": "Employer Heads to Court for Class-Action Suit Over Cost of Hep C Drug Sovaldi"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-15", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has sued Gilead over their high-priced hepatitis C treatment."}, "article_summary": "It would be surprising if Gilead were to discriminate against people with hepatitis C on the basis of their disability, since people with hepatitis C are the company's customers.\n\u201cIt would be surprising if Gilead were to discriminate against people with hepatitis C on the basis of their disability, since people with hepatitis C are the company's customers,\u201d she said.\nRelated News: Life After Hepatitis C: Normal If You\u2019re Cured, Possible Criminal Charges If You\u2019re Not \u00bb\n\u201cHepatitis C will have a huge social cost in the future.\nRead More: Doctors Battle Insurers for Access to Pricey Hepatitis C Drugs \u00bbWill the Case Against Gilead Stand?"}
