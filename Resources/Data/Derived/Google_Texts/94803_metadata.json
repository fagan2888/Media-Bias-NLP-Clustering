As of last week, the ma\u00adjor\u00adity lead\u00ader had com\u00admit\u00adted ad\u00address\u00ading all of them, but no one in either party knows how ex\u00adactly how they will fit to\u00adgeth\u00ader.\n\nBoth the tele\u00adphone-sur\u00adveil\u00adlance sys\u00adtem un\u00adder the Pat\u00adri\u00adot Act and the gov\u00adern\u00adment\u2019s au\u00adthor\u00adity to draw from the High\u00adway Trust Fund ex\u00adpire at the end of the month, so Con\u00adgress needs a res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion. On high\u00adways, the Sen\u00adate\u2019s No. 3 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan, John Thune, says the up\u00adper cham\u00adber will likely fol\u00adlow the House\u2019s lead on le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion. The House is slated to vote as early as Tues\u00adday on le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to ex\u00adtend high\u00adway fund\u00ading au\u00adthor\u00adity un\u00adtil Ju\u00adly 31. Once that bill is com\u00adpleted and passed in the House, the Sen\u00adate will prob\u00adably OK it without de\u00adbate on a voice vote, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a Sen\u00adate GOP aide.\n\nThe For\u00adeign In\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence Sur\u00adveil\u00adlance Act ex\u00adten\u00adsion is a trick\u00adi\u00ader pro\u00adspect.

Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan and Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic lead\u00aders in the Sen\u00adate say they aren\u2019t sure the re\u00adquis\u00adite 60 votes are there even to ex\u00adtend FISA for 30 days.\n\nSen\u00adate Minor\u00adity Whip Dick Durbin last week out\u00adlined Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s di\u00adlemma this way: \u201cHe has two dooms\u00adday-scen\u00adario bills. He has the [high\u00adway] trust fund and the Pat\u00adri\u00adot Act. And I don\u2019t know what his plans are, but if it\u2019s leav\u00ading these un\u00adtil the last week with this trade bill pending, it\u2019s tempt\u00ading fate.\u201d\n\nDemo\u00adcrats are look\u00ading at sev\u00ader\u00adal high-pro\u00adfile amend\u00adments to the trade bill that could up\u00adset the White House and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans who sup\u00adport Trade Pro\u00admo\u00adtion Au\u00adthor\u00adity, also known as \u201cfast track.\u201d Among the most con\u00adten\u00adtious will be an at\u00adtempt to add trade-en\u00adforce\u00adment re\u00adquire\u00adments\u201d\u201dwhich in\u00adclude labor and cur\u00adrency-ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion re\u00adstric\u00adtions\u201d\u201dto TPA.

The bill pro\u00adposes some of the most am\u00adbi\u00adtious changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank fin\u00adan\u00adcial-re\u00adform act to date.
