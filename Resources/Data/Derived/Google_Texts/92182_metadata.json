Cut entitlements! Can anybody play this game?\n\nLast week was a great week for Hillary Clinton. The State of the Union was essentially 2016 Clinton\u2019s campaign kickoff speech. Its themes of work and responsibility were vintage Clinton\u2014Bill Clinton, anyway. Meanwhile, the Republicans were doing their best to have folks brand them as the party of plutocracy by again calling for \u201centitlement reform,\u201d even as wages stagnate and fewer Americans see themselves as part of the middle class. Has anyone heard of Marie Antoinette?\n\nTopping off the week that was, the latest Washington Post/ABC Poll showed Clinton with a double-digit lead over the leading possible GOP nominees both nationally and in the ever-important Midwest. Even more disturbingly for the GOP, she also leads among white working-class voters outside of the South, and among white non-evangelical Protestants. The distance between where the GOP is and where it must travel to reclaim the White House remains far.\n\nTo be sure, Obama\u2019s State of the Union was a tacit admission that the Democrats\u2019 estrangement from working-class whites has cost his party dearly, much like an alcoholic coming to grips with the reality of his drinking problem. Last November, the bill for catering to the Democrats\u2019 Coalition of the Ascendant finally came due, and its price was hefty. In 2014, little more than one-third of white voters without college degrees voted to send a Democrat to Congress, and the effects of working-class rejection were devastating.\n\nThe Democrats lost control of the Senate, while Republicans picked up 13 House seats, gaining their largest majority since 1928. At the state level, the results were equally grim for the Democrats. Thirty-one states now have Republican governors, with the GOP controlling the largest bloc of state houses since 1926. Illinois, Obama\u2019s home state, ever-blue Massachusetts, and recently (but deeply) blued Maryland now have Republican governors.\n\nSubstantively, the SOTU was a speech that a major part of the country liked, even if it made House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans cringe. For the Republicans, that\u2019s a problem, especially if the only thing Republicans have to offer the middle class is entitlement reform, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested in the run-up to the State of the Union.\n\nIn a pre-SOTU statement, McConnell beseeched the President to \u201callow us to save and strengthen Medicare,\u201d and to \u201ccooperate with both parties to save Social Security.\u201d In other words, make sure both parties have their hands on the dagger and no one will get blamed.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s prescription is a recipe for alienating the GOP\u2019s electoral base, which is chock full of retirees and voters north of 50. Green eye shades and the worn eraser of an accountant\u2019s pencil don\u2019t win elections, and angry seniors can wreak havoc on presidential aspirations.\n\nIn 2008, grandma and grandpa stayed away from the polls, and the Democrats won going away. With voter self-identification as \u201cmiddle class\u201d shrinking, and with two-fifths of Americans calling themselves \u201clower class,\u201d calls for cuts to Medicare and Social Security are politically self-defeating.\n\nOh, and then there\u2019s also economic reality. Bond yields are low, with the 10-year treasury below 1.8 percent, and 30-year home mortgages going for under 4 percent. Given these numbers, cutting entitlements right here and now will likely bring more pain than benefit\u2014except perhaps to some of Wall Street\u2019s players.\n\nAlmost on cue, Glenn Hubbard, Mitt Romney\u2019s chief economic adviser in 2012, compounded the situation by seconding McConnell\u2019s call for entitlement reform in a post-SOTU New York Times op-ed. For those who forgot, this is the same Hubbard who immediately after Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat wrote, \u201cI have fond memories of summer trips to Perkins Cove in Ogunquit, Maine\u2014for lobster but also for the scenery along Marginal Way, a narrow path along a cliff by the beach.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrecious. The only things missing from Hubbard\u2019s menu were the Grey Poupon and the Dom Perignon. Indeed, as Charles Ferguson, the Oscar winning creator of \u201cInside Job,\u201d the 2010 documentary that examined the financial crisis and Hubbard\u2019s own conflicts of interest, wrote: \u201cStanding behind every great con artist is someone like ... Glenn Hubbard.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs inconvenient as they may be to some Democrats and Republicans, working Americans are taxpaying Americans who have a right to expect something in return for their tax dollar\u2014something other than Obamacare, with its false promises and its disruptions, or cuts to Medicare that have been championed by both this Administration and congressional Republicans. Politics is transactional, and if the donor bases of both parties can get tax breaks, subsidies, and taxpayer-funded windfalls, then Joe and Josephine Six-Pack have something coming to them\u2014especially if they earned it.\n\nRather than gunning for Medicare, the Republicans should pick up on some of threads in Obama\u2019s speech, while taking a hard line against tax hikes. The GOP should bash the President for looking to undercut saving for college and 529 accounts, and also push for a reduction in payroll taxes. The fact is that most Americans pay more in Medicare and Social Security taxes than in income taxes. And if wonks and purists criticize simultaneously sparing benefits while cutting taxes, just point out that being pro-middle class and pro-worker is about rewarding their efforts and lessening their burdens.\n\nRepublicans should seize on the President\u2019s invitation to fund precision medicine to combat cancer and diabetes, and expand that war to fight Alzheimer\u2019s and autism. They should also embrace rebuilding our infrastructure. In addition to new jobs, infrastructure is a cornerstone of commerce. If building a rail system was good enough for Abraham Lincoln, and forging a national highway system was all right with Ike, then the GOP should treat infrastructure as part of its own patrimony.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, 2016 Election", "publicationDate": 201501261045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "US Politics, 2016 Election", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Republicans Must Speak to the Middle Class", "tags": "topic:politics,obsessional:2016-election", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "So Obama tees it up for Clinton by focusing on the middle class, and what does the GOP say?
