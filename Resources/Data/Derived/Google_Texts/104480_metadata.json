I wouldn't want to -- and besides, CBS, wisely, doesn't allow it.\n\n\n\nNor are we allowed to endorse products. That's another good rule.\n\nSo what follows is neither a paid commercial nor an endorsement.\n\nRather it is just a simple \"thank you\" to the drug store chain CVS for announcing it will no longer sell tobacco products -- that's a thank you from a survivor of bladder cancer who still takes daily medication to control two other cancer-related, incurable diseases: ulcerative colitis and diabetes.\n\nI began chewing tobacco at age 16 because I was a ballplayer and that was part of the culture. But the heavy addiction continued long after my arm gave out.\n\nToday, I consider myself lucky to be alive.\n\nIt's going to cost CVS $2 billion a year in revenue, but the company decided it could not promote itself as a health care provider if it continued to sell the product that is the number one cause of preventable disease and death, a product directly responsible for 480,000 deaths last year.\n\nThere was a lot more back-and-forth last week about Obamacare, but to me the heath news that really mattered came from CVS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Says &quot;thank you&quot; to the drug store chain for announcing it will no longer sell tobacco products", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-schieffer-on-cvs-and-cigarettes/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/09/95df5b76-e1a2-4803-9704-653ac25ffc7a/thumbnail/1200x630/eff276704ca307550a0dff3bc53054d2/cvs-tobacco-cigarettes-467356671.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Says \"thank you\" to the drug store chain for announcing it will no longer sell tobacco products", "title": "Bob Schieffer on CVS and cigarettes"}, "twitter": {"description": "Says \"thank you\" to the drug store chain for announcing it will no longer sell tobacco products", "title": "Bob Schieffer on CVS and cigarettes", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/bob-schieffer-on-cvs-and-cigarettes/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/bob-schieffer-on-cvs-and-cigarettes/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-schieffer-on-cvs-and-cigarettes/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@https://twitter.com/bobschieffer", "site": "@facethenation", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/09/95df5b76-e1a2-4803-9704-653ac25ffc7a/thumbnail/1200x630/eff276704ca307550a0dff3bc53054d2/cvs-tobacco-cigarettes-467356671.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-schieffer-on-cvs-and-cigarettes/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/bob-schieffer-on-cvs-and-cigarettes/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FaceTheNation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0856\"", "article_summary": "As a journalist, I don't endorse political candidates, nor do I contribute to political campaigns.\nNor are we allowed to endorse products.\nThere was a lot more back-and-forth last week about Obamacare, but to me the heath news that really mattered came from CVS.\nI began chewing tobacco at age 16 because I was a ballplayer and that was part of the culture.\nI wouldn't want to -- and besides, CBS, wisely, doesn't allow it."}
