Johnson had perhaps his best game of the season, and Detroit finally showed a bit of life offensively.\n\nJoique Bell ran for two touchdowns for the Lions, and Jay Cutler threw two TD passes for Chicago (5-7). Detroit\u2019s Matthew Stafford went 34 of 45 for 390 yards with the two touchdown passes to Johnson.\n\nDetroit had not scored this many points since a 35-14 win over the New York Giants in the season opener.\n\nThe Lions have now won back-to-back games on Thanksgiving after losing their previous nine. They beat Green Bay 40-10 last year.\n\nThat victory over the Packers was Detroit\u2019s only win in its final seven games last season as the Lions frittered away a playoff spot. They are again in mix for the postseason this year, and Thursday\u2019s game was their first of three in a row at home \u2014 all against teams with losing records.\n\nDetroit came in with the league\u2019s top-ranked run defense, and Chicago\u2019s Matt Forte was a non-factor on the ground, finishing with 6 yards on five carries. Cutler went 31 of 49 for 280 yards with two fourth-quarter interceptions.\n\nJohnson had been held under 60 yards in two of three games since returning from an ankle injury, and there were rumblings that the 29-year-old receiver was slowing down. His first half Thursday was an emphatic response: nine catches for 109 yards.\n\nThe Bears opened the scoring on Cutler\u2019s 10-yard scoring pass to Alshon Jeffery, and the Bears scored again after Jared Allen sacked Stafford, forced a fumble and recovered it at the Detroit 5. Cutler\u2019s 6-yard scoring pass to Jeffery made it 14-3 with 3:35 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nStafford, however, was brilliant in the second. Johnson made a leaping catch for a 25-yard touchdown, holding on despite a hit from defensive back Kyle Fuller. That was the first time Detroit had reached the end zone since Nov. 9 against Miami.\n\nBell put the Lions ahead with a 1-yard scoring run on fourth down \u2014 leaping toward the goal line and extending the ball just far enough for a touchdown. Stafford\u2019s 6-yard touchdown pass to Johnson made it 24-14 with 24 seconds left in the half.\n\nStafford went 22 of 26 for 275 yards in the first half, and Johnson set a record as the fastest to 10,000 yards receiving, surpassing that milestone in the second quarter of his 115th game.\n\nBell\u2019s 1-yard run in the fourth was the only touchdown of the second half.\n\nNOTES: Chicago lost S Chris Conte in early on because of an eye injury. \u2026 Detroit C Dominic Raiola became the first Lions player to start 200 games. \u2026 Lions WR Corey Fuller caught a 21-yard pass in the first half, and his brother Kyle \u2014 the Chicago CB \u2014 came over and playfully knocked the ball out of his hands after the play.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Johnson caught 11 passes for 146 yards with a pair of first-half touchdowns, and the Lions boosted their postseason hopes with a 34-17 victory over the Chicago Bears on Thursday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Johnson caught 11 passes for 146 yards with a pair of first-half touchdowns, and the Lions boosted their postseason hopes with a 34-17 victory over the Chicago Bears on Thursday.", "title": "Calvin Johnson leads Lions to rout of Bears", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/27/calvin-johnson-leads-lions-rout-bears/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/27/aptopix-bears-lions-f_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/27/aptopix-bears-lions-f_lanc.jpg", "description": "Johnson caught 11 passes for 146 yards with a pair of first-half touchdowns, and the Lions boosted their postseason hopes with a 34-17 victory over the Chicago Bears on Thursday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Calvin Johnson leads Lions to rout of Bears"}, "Author": "Noah Trister", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Detroit, Calvin Johnson, Chicago, Matthew Stafford"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f4e\"", "article_summary": "Stafford\u2019s 6-yard touchdown pass to Johnson made it 24-14 with 24 seconds left in the half.\nCutler\u2019s 6-yard scoring pass to Jeffery made it 14-3 with 3:35 remaining in the first quarter.\nJohnson caught 11 passes for 146 yards with a pair of first-half touchdowns, and the Lions boosted their postseason hopes with a 34-17 victory over the Chicago Bears on Thursday.\nThe Bears opened the scoring on Cutler\u2019s 10-yard scoring pass to Alshon Jeffery, and the Bears scored again after Jared Allen sacked Stafford, forced a fumble and recovered it at the Detroit 5.\nJoique Bell ran for two touchdowns for the Lions, and Jay Cutler threw two TD passes for Chicago (5-7)."}
