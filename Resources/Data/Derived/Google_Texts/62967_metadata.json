The complaint alleges \u201cfraudulent misrepresentation\u201d and violations of U.S. immigration and labor laws. It asks for $225,000 in back pay.\n\nThe suit was originally filed in October 2014. A decision on a pending motion by Trump Model Management to dismiss is expected by the end of March, the clerk for Judge Analisa Torres, who is presiding over the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District, told Reuters.\n\nIf Torres rules the case can proceed, it could revive attention on Trump\u2019s foreign labor practices at a time when the celebrity billionaire's rise in American politics has riveted the world\u2019s attention.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have called the case \"frivolous\" and \"without merit.\" In court documents, they said Palmer wasn\u2019t an employee and was more than adequately compensated for a \u201cvery brief stint as a fashion model,\u201d which they say amounted to less than 10 days of work over three years.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm that assertion.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this model just didn\u2019t have a successful career, and we fully expect to win,\u201d said Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for Trump Model Management.\n\nAlthough Trump owns the modeling agency, the suit does not name him. Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement that Trump Model Management's treatment of Palmer was in line with \"standard practice in the modeling industry.\"\n\nPalmer's lawyer, Naresh Gehi, says his client was cheated of earnings and seduced by a life of glamour that never materialized. \"The visa application the company filed with the government requires that people are paid the full amount,\" Gehi said. \"It\u2019s a requirement.\u201d\n\nPalmer, who was 17 when she came to New York in 2011, was not available to comment.\n\nTOP JAMAICAN MODEL\n\nSylvia Ayass, a lawyer who has worked with models on visas like Palmer's, said agencies typically pay what they state on visa applications.\n\nTrump has won Republican frontrunner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker who will deport illegal immigrants, build a wall with Mexico and do away with the off shoring of U.S. jobs.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump's labor practices have drawn criticism. A Reuters story published in August revealed that Trump's companies sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to the Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.\n\nUsing a federal visa program called H-1B that allows U.S. employers to hire \"specialized\" foreign labor, Trump's modeling agency offered Palmer \"at least $75,000 per year\" for three years. It listed that salary on her H-1B visa application in 2011, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nIt's not the industry norm to use H-1B visas, which are usually reserved for highly skilled specialized labor like engineers, programmers and medical specialists. O-1 visas are more common, modeling agency lawyers and executives said. The O-1 is typically used by artists and athletes.\n\nThough H-1B use is rare, a Reuters analysis found that in the past three years, modeling agencies have submitted 181 applications for H-1B visas for foreign models. Of those, 173 stated that the model would be paid an hourly wage, ranging from as little as $8.40 an hour to as much as $500 an hour.\n\nThe Trump Model yearly salary listed in the federal database of H-1B applications was the outlier.\n\nRosen, the lawyer for Trump Model Management, said the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee.\n\nUnder that contract, Palmer agreed \"to promptly reimburse\" Trump Model Management \"for any and all costs and expenses\" that the agency incurred relating to her modeling.\n\nAccording to the suit, the agreement stipulated that Trump Model Management would take a 20 percent cut of Palmer\u2019s earnings but instead took 80 percent by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs and limousine rides, as well as $4,000 in \"administrative fees,\" according to court documents.\n\nThe suit said it was seeking class-action status to represent other models who believe they were misled and underpaid after coming to the United States with sponsorship from Trump\u2019s modeling agency.\n\n(Additional reporting by Rebekah Kebede in Jamaica.
