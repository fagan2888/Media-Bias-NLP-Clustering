But Republican politicians\u2014and, in particular, those running for president\u2014don\u2019t seem to be paying attention. In recent weeks, leading Democratic candidates have put forward plans to address climate change. Republicans, by and large, haven\u2019t. Some conservatives are hoping to break their party\u2019s silence on the issue. Key among them is Jay Faison, an entrepreneur from Charlotte, North Carolina, who announced last month that he plans to spend $175 million to encourage Republicans to advance solutions to climate change. \u201cIf conservatives fail to put forward our own agenda, climate change policy will likely go the way of health care\u2014the Democrats owned the answers, and we ended up with Obamacare,\u201d Faison wrote in a Politico op-ed.\n\nBut he\u2019s not alone in calling for policy solutions to climate change from the right. Think tanks are arguing for free-market solutions to reduce carbon emissions. Grassroots Tea Party groups are butting heads with Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity on allowing the sell of power from rooftop solar systems at the state level. Big business and some foreign oil companies are increasingly willing to accept\u2014and, in many cases, are calling for\u2014a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Even Newt Gingrich has expressed support for a GOP environmental platform that makes room for climate change. But green conservatives have their work cut out for them. As in previous elections, the forces seeking to protect the status quo are already readying their resources. The Koch brothers political network, for example, plans to mobilize around $889 million in 2016\u2014more than double what it spent on the 2012 election. Industry players can also pack a punch. During the 2012 election cycle, the oil, gas and mining industries spent millions in support of candidates, most of whom were Republican. And that represents only the money that these companies and their employees contributed through traditional political giving; additional millions in \u201cdark money\u201d were passed through various non-profit groups that shield donors. \u201cIf it were just a money thing, we would lose. But we have the truth on our side, and we have a fact pattern that's unfolding in front of us.\u201d Environmentalists on both the left and right realize they can\u2019t hope to muster that kind of money, but they see Faison as a signal that, for conservatives, the tide might be turning on climate change. \u201cI think Jay Faison is a game-changer. I describe him as the cavalry coming over the hill,\u201d said Bob Inglis, a former South Carolina Republican congressman who lost the state's primary election, in part, for accepting climate change, and who now heads the Energy and Enterprise Initiative at George Mason University. \u201cIt\u2019s just really exciting to us... to see a champion of free enterprise\u2014someone who is an exemplar of how free enterprise works\u2014engaging, and he can\u2019t be dismissed.\u201d\n\nOf Faison\u2019s $175 million, $165 million will go to polling, outreach, and advocacy efforts lead by the ClearPath Foundation, a group he founded with the aim of promoting conservative solutions to climate change. He\u2019s also putting $10 million into a political action group to support some candidates, and hoping to raise more money from like-minded conservatives. He hasn\u2019t decided, however, if he\u2019ll spread these political funds far and wide, or pick a few GOP environmental champions. And while Faison admitted his spending isn\u2019t going be able to compete with anti-climate-action interest groups, he sees an opportunity in the changing electorate. \u201cIf it were just a money thing, we would lose. But we have the truth on our side, and we have a fact pattern that's unfolding in front of us,\u201d Faison told me. Recent polling shows that there is an appetite among the conservative electorate\u2014not just among the policy wonks\u2014for the party to develop an environmental policy. According to a poll by the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, roughly three quarters of Republican primary voters in both New Hampshire and South Carolina said they would support a carbon tax, and around 40 percent said they supported Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. Conservatives and environmentalists who track the issue attributed this growing support for GOP climate action to three main drivers: Faith, the availability of new solutions, and an evolving electorate. Pope Francis\u2019s recent encyclical challenged many conservatives to think about humans\u2019 impact on climate, and 300 evangelical leaders from across the political spectrum followed up, expressing support for the Pope\u2019s message. \u201cRepublicans like to claim that we\u2019re the party of God,\u201d said Rob Sisson, executive director of the conservative environmental group ConservAmerica. \u201cPope Francis is speaking out on this and urging not just Republicans\u2014he\u2019s urging everyone\u2014to work on this from a moral standpoint...It\u2019s going to move the needle.\u201d\n\nSecond, voters are increasingly aware that tackling climate change does not have to take the form of what the fossil fuel industry has started calling an \u201cenergy tax.\u201d \u201cFor many people... it was either cap and trade or nothing. And they preferred nothing,\u201d said Adrian Gray, a Republican political analyst. \u201cNow, you\u2019re seeing this proliferation of different ideas, different solutions, more free-market-based solutions.\u201d Voters that may not support a price on carbon can still back ideas like rooftop solar and improving smart-grid technologies, he said. A veteran of the Bush White House, Gray has conducted polling to analyse how Republican candidates can talk about climate in a way that appeals to their electorate\u2014voters have a more favorable response to the term \u201cglobal environmental issues,\u201d for instance, than \u201cclimate change.\u201d But the biggest factor working in favor of climate action may be the changing makeup of the electorate: Polls show particular support for environmental initiatives among millennials. One survey conducted by the University of Texas last year found that two-thirds of Americans aged 18 through 34 said they would favor a political candidate who supported emission cuts, compared with just half of those aged 65 and older. \u201cYou ask young voters today, they all understand that the climate is changing and they all understand that their generation is going to be the one that is going to bear far more of the cost of climate inaction than the baby boomers who are running for president,\u201d said Daniel Weiss, the senior vice president of campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters, a group that tends to support Democrats. Candidates continue to keep mum on the issue. Of the four Republican presidential candidates who have affirmed that they believe the science on man-made climate change\u2014Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, John Kasich, and George Pataki\u2014only two, Bush and Kasich, made it into the prime-time televised debate, and they\u2019ve waffled on the issue. \u201cRepublicans have very little incentive to take up the cause. They have every incentive to either avoid it or raise questions about climate change,\u201d said John J. Pitney, a professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cA lot of them represent constituencies that are dependent on fossil fuels: Mitch McConnell\u2019s from Kentucky, there\u2019s a lot of coal mines in Kentucky. The Republican Party is getting stronger in West Virginia, which is a huge coal state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An entrepreneur plans to find out by spending $175 million with the aim of encouraging Republican politicians to address climate change.", "author": "John Light", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Jay Faison plans to spend $175 million with the aim of encouraging Republican politicians to address climate change.
