The CO-OPs themselves \u201care going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful. They have a lot of work to do,\" she said.\n\nThe federal government provided $2.4 billion in loans to fund the 23 CO-OPs, and loans to the failed 12 health plans total more than $1.2 billion. Some 740,000 people enrolled in coverage through the 12 failed CO-OPs.\n\nCohen told the Subcommittee on Health Care, Benefits, and Administrative Rules that the CO-OPs are expected to repay their loans and that the Obama administration is working closely with them to ensure that they do. However, she said the HHS doesn't know how much will be repaid.\n\nAt the same hearing, Maryland Insurance Commissioner Al Redmer Jr., appointed by Republican Md. Gov. Larry Hogan, said he is looking for \u201cany creative solution we could find\u201d to help save Evergreen Health Cooperative Inc. in his state. Among other things Evergreen offers a plan for diabetic patients that removes all co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles for services and medications needed to keep them from developing complications from the disease.\n\nRedmer and other state insurance commissioners have asked the federal government to adjust its formula for charging plans based on the health of their consumers, and they also want to be able to set enrollment caps for some plans that may have trouble meeting their obligations. So far the federal government has not agreed to those requests.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/acas-coops-saved-b57982067905/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "With 12 of the CO-OPs created under the Affordable Care Act either out of business or folding up shop, the question remains: Will the remaining eight non-profits make it?
