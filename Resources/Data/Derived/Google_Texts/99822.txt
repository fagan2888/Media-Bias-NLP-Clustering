Four years ago, Sen. Bob Nonini of Coeur d’Alene didn’t have kind words for Sen. Shawn Keough of Sandpoint, and was doing his part to secure her election defeat. Today, he’s working for her re-election in one of the most closely-watched primary battles in the state. Four years ago, a different issue was at the forefront for Nonini. He was adamantly opposed to anything related to Obamacare, and especially the creation of a statewide insurance exchange. So he was boldly going after Keough and others who supported the exchange. “It was a heck of a mistake on my part, because they were very nice people,” Nonini said. Nonini hasn’t changed his political stripes. By any rating, whether it’s the American Conservative Union or the Idaho Freedom Foundation, he is one of the most conservative people in the Legislature. But he also realizes, “You’ve got to work with other people to get things done”/Chuck Malloy, Idaho Politics Weekly. More here.
