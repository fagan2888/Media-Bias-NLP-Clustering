On Saturday, more than 100 volunteers participated in Christmas in Action, formerly known as Christmas in April, an event which renovates the homes of elderly residents.\n\nChristmas in Action is put on by teams of volunteers from local businesses and churches.\n\nThe Capitol Federal team spent Saturday morning fixing up a house in the 500 Block of S.E. Locust Street.\n\n\u201cHere we\u2019re replacing broken windows, fixing plumbing leaks, redoing some doors, replacing a leak under the lavatory in the master building,\u201d said Dick Bahr, a member of the Capitol Federal team.\n\nAll members of the team were employees of Capitol Federal, Bahr said.\n\nThe owner of the home, Lee Triplett, was selected through an application process that was done in the fall. To qualify, an applicant must be a senior, and must own the home and can\u2019t be renting it. Triplett said he was very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of Christmas in Action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging to know that you have the assistance, particularly when you become a senior it\u2019s very important, because then at that point when your income is limited and you\u2019re not able to do some things for a lot of different reasons \u2014 health reasons, economical reasons, social reasons,\u201d Triplett said.\n\nJewell Welch, vice president of Christmas in Action, said that much of the money that goes into renovations comes from donations and that all of the labor is free, because it is all done by volunteers.\n\n\u201cOne thing that makes this program so successful is that is it\u2019s one day a year, or two (days) maybe,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not every month, it\u2019s not every week. I\u2019d say it\u2019s one weekend a year and a lot of people can get in to volunteer for this because it\u2019s not a commitment on a weekly basis.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas team fixed leaks and painted the walls inside a home in the 200 Block of N.E. Scotland Avenue.\n\nCathy Holmes was participating in Christmas in Action for her sixth year. She served as the team captain on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nine of us, and the majority of us having been doing this for at least three years,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe know how to work together and we know what each other\u2019s strengths are, and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of coordinating to make it all happen because we work together at work too. We just carry over that camaraderie from work to here.\u201d\n\nChristmas in Action is in its 17th year. A total of 225 houses were refurbished in the program\u2019s first 16 years, according to Vern Failor, president of Christmas in Action.\n\nAbout 15 houses were renovated Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Adam Vlach", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "For some Topeka residents, Christmas came very early this year.
