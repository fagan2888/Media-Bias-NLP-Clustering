That\u2019s the message being sent by New York State Board of Elections, which disregarded the First Amendment to enact new \u201cemergency regulations\u201d on political speech that could become permanent at the end of this month.\n\nIntended to regulate spending by independent groups during campaign season, the regulations are so expansive that almost anyone, citizen or organization, hoping to have their say on any issue could find themselves in bureaucratic dire straits.\n\nImagine you hear a radio ad where your state representative \u2014 let\u2019s call him Fred \u2014 claims to oppose higher taxes. But you know that Fred voted three times for higher taxes.\n\nOutraged, you print up 500 flyers with a picture of Fred, a copy of his voting record on taxes and a brief statement about how you think your neighbors should know the truth.\n\nYou hand out these flyers at your son\u2019s Little League game, your daughter\u2019s soccer practice and in front of the grocery store while your husband is shopping.\n\nWhile most would applaud you for performing your civic duty and educating the public about a dishonest politician, the New York State Board of Elections could now fine you at least $1,000.\n\nWhy? Because you failed to register as a political committee, complete the appropriate paperwork for filing an \u201cindependent expenditure,\u201d list your donors and your treasurer and provide copies of your flyer to the board for its stamp of approval.\n\nAnd, unfortunately for you, one of Fred\u2019s campaign staffers saw your flyer and reported you to the authorities.\n\nThis, sadly, is just the tip of the regulatory iceberg. These new rules give the board unprecedented say in determining if speech is supporting or opposing a candidate.\n\nIs an ad for a charity that supports war veterans advocating for a candidate who is also a war vet? Is an AARP pamphlet opposing higher prescription-drug prices under ObamaCare opposing every candidate who supports New York\u2019s state-run insurance marketplace?\n\nWhat about billboards for a local gun show that say, \u201cSupport the Second Amendment\u201d \u2014 are those attack ads against all pro-gun control candidates?\n\nUnder the new regulations, these decisions are left entirely to the discretion of the four unelected commissioners on the Board of Elections.\n\nAnd the rules are so unclear that there is no way for New Yorkers to know the answers to these questions in advance. The board has full discretion to decide whose ads are acceptable and who to throw the book at.\n\nAs the recent IRS scandal has made abundantly clear, government bureaucrats can\u2019t fairly assess what groups have the right to speak. The opportunity for politically malicious prosecutions in New York will be rampant.\n\nFor nearly four decades, courts have consistently discarded as unconstitutional such haphazard definitions of political speech.\n\nIf the board\u2019s new regulations become permanent, they will undoubtedly face similar court challenges.\n\nUltimately, the courts will quash the rules, as they have New York\u2019s past efforts to squelch independent political speech.\n\nBut in the meantime, while the state squanders taxpayer dollars on litigation, these regulations will prevent individuals and organizations from delivering their message to the public.\n\nThe rules are so convoluted that even sophisticated lawyers won\u2019t be able to give clear guidance on what is permitted and what is not. This is especially the case for smaller groups with less experience, less access to regulators and less money to hire the necessary lawyers.\n\nThe end result? Politicians can worry less about taking actions that might offend their constituents, because fewer amateurs will be able to speak out against crony deals, crummy tax laws, environmental problems and innumerable other bad policies.\n\nThat may be great news for incumbents, but it is terrible news for New Yorkers who want a free and open democracy.\n\nThe most important aspect of the First Amendment is embodied in these citizen groups \u2014 the little guy who is willing to speak truth to power.\n\nAt the Board of Elections, however, those in power clearly aren\u2019t interested in hearing from those speaking the truth.\n\nScott Blackburn is a research fellow at the Center for Competitive Politics.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Keep quiet.
