HIV infection rates are still on the rise in Ohio and across the country. On this 25th annual World AIDS Day, health officials urge testing and education to stop new cases from developing.

17,000 people in Ohio are known to be HIV positive, but that number doesn’t tell the whole story. It’s estimated that 1 in 5 people with HIV don’t even know they’re infected, so the problem is much worse.

That would raise Ohio's HIV infection rate to more than 20,000. Bill Hardy with AIDS Resource Center Ohio says “66% of all new infections continue to be among young, gay, and bisexual males, and even more young, gay, bisexual males of color."

Medical professionals are still pinning their hopes on developing an HIV prevention drug, if not an outright cure, but Hardy says science has come a long way in managing the disease.

"With the treatment we have now,” he says, “there's a very good chance that HIV positive Americans will have a near normal life expectancy, and if we get them into care and get the virus under control, the chance or likelihood of transmitting the virus is almost zero, it's reduced by up to 96%."

But getting that treatment has not been easy for patients. A Kaiser Family Foundation study finds that 30% of HIV infected people are uninsured. Hardy says he hopes the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion will fill the gap in services. Meanwhile, he says awareness is key; get tested.

ARC Ohio provides more than 4,000 free HIV tests every year.
