Bernie Sanders by 84 to 16 percent among African-American voters in South Carolina, according to exit polls. Clinton won the state by nearly 50 points, giving her campaign a boost of momentum heading into the Super Tuesday primaries tomorrow.\n\nDemocratic Rep. James Clyburn, a prominent black leader in the state who endorsed Clinton over Sanders, drove the point home at the campaign\u2019s primary night celebration.\n\nAfter hearing from both candidates, Clyburn said, \u201cthe voters of South Carolina have rendered a significant verdict.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Sanders supporters may soon have to choose between Clinton and Trump\n\nClyburn\u2019s underlying message was clear. In a primary where African-Americans comprised 61 percent of the Democratic electorate, Clinton established herself as the preferred candidate of non-white voters.\n\nAll signs pointed to Clinton beating Sanders in South Carolina. The former secretary of state held a consistent, double-digit lead in the polls in the weeks before the primary. But the level of support she received from black voters came as a surprise, even to Clinton campaign officials.\n\nThe spectacle of Democrats descending on states like South Carolina every four years to \u201ccourt\u201d the black vote has become a routine part of the primary process.\n\n\u201cIt was higher than what we expected,\u201d a top adviser said.\n\nThe victory here was an important step forward for Clinton, who lost the state to Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries; that year Clinton drew just 19 percent of the black vote, and her campaign never fully recovered. Clinton\u2019s landslide win also dealt a blow to Sanders, who had hoped for a closer second-place finish.\n\nBut beyond the immediate implications for the primary fight ahead, the contest also revealed key differences in Clinton\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 approach to the African-American community.\n\nIt also highlighted the persistent challenges that white Democratic candidates face in addressing issues of race in the South, despite the overwhelming loyalty that most black voters show to the party.\n\n\u201cDemocratic candidates are always walking a fine line. When do you focus on race explicitly, and when do you focus on broader issues that affect\u201d the party\u2019s entire base, said Danielle Vinson, a political science professor at Furman University in Greenville.\n\n\u201cIt is a challenge, and a lot of times it leaves voters and their coalitions unhappy\u201d if candidates don\u2019t get it right, Vinson said.\n\nThe spectacle of Democrats descending on states like South Carolina every four years to \u201ccourt\u201d the black vote has become a routine part of the primary process.\n\nBut the highly public courtship involves a more complicated set of calculations on both sides than is typically acknowledged in campaign narratives about racial politics in the South, which often oversimplify the motivations of voters and candidates alike.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t simply blind support among African-Americans for Democrats,\u201d said Bruce Ransom, a political science professor at Clemson University who studies politics in South Carolina. \u201cBlack voters examine the two parties, but they usually conclude that under Democrats they get better results,\u201d said Ransom, who is black.\n\nA similar calculus took place in choosing between Sanders and Clinton. In interviews in the final days before the primary, black voters around the state said they based their decision on several factors: which candidate did the best job of connecting with, and listening to, their concerns on a wide range of issues; which candidate had the most realistic agenda; and who was more likely to win in the general election.\n\nAn assessment of Clinton and Sanders\u2019 support for Obama in general, and the Affordable Care Act in particular, also factored heavily into the decision-making process, many black voters said.\n\n\u201cClinton is positioning herself to carry on the efforts of President Obama,\u201d Cassandra Williams Rush, 66, said on the eve of the primary. \u201cI just don\u2019t get the right vibes from Sanders.\u201d\n\nRush, a retired engineer and Clinton backer, spent her early childhood on her family\u2019s 10-acre farm in Nesmith, on the eastern edge of Williamsburg County. Rush lived with her six siblings and parents in a small house with a wood stove and no indoor toilet until the family moved to a larger home in Kingstree, the county seat.\n\nAfter retiring, Rush has divided her time between her home in Columbia, the state capitol, and Williamsburg County, which has the second-highest black population by county in the state, according to census data. It\u2019s also the county where Obama recorded his largest margin of victory in the 2008 primary.\n\nIn 2010, Rush, who is documenting the county\u2019s history, opened a small museum and gallery dedicated to African-American art in a former laundromat in Kingstree. She also manages the family farm, which has been repurposed as a vineyard and community event space.\n\nBy now, Rush said, she has become accustomed to seeing Democratic presidential candidates canvass the state in search of support from black voters.\n\nBoth Clinton and Sanders are \u201ctrying to tap into things that they know are dear to our hearts,\u201d Rush said in an interview on the farm on primary day. \u201cAs a black person, you\u2019re hoping and wishing that they\u2019re 100 percent genuine in their efforts.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance in Kingstree ahead of the primary, Clinton\u2019s voice took on a slight twang as she addressed a crowd of several hundred supporters gathered at a recreational center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of President Obama, and I\u2019m proud of the progress he\u2019s made,\u201d Clinton said, making sure to highlight his healthcare law. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president gets the credit he deserves.\u201d\n\nThe line, which is a part of Clinton\u2019s regular stump speech, got the biggest round of applause of at the event, along with her call for congressional Republicans to hold hearings on Obama\u2019s pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nREAD MORE: The reason more young voters aren\u2019t connecting with Clinton is obvious, and we\u2019re missing it\n\nClinton\u2019s embrace of Obamacare stood in marked contrast to Sanders, who has been far more critical of the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a big deal in the state of South Carolina,\u201d said Caroletta Shuler Ivey, who teaches courses on criminal justice and constitutional law at Claflin University, a historically black university in Orangeburg. \u201cClinton recognizes that.\u201d\n\nRush\u2019s 88-year-old father, David Williams, attended Clinton\u2019s event in Kingstree. Williams, who was the first black man in his community to graduate from a four-year college, cited her support for the president and Obamacare as one of his main reasons for backing her. Williams said he considered the law a milestone, in line with other major markers of progress in his lifetime like the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\u201cRepublicans tried everything in the books to make him fail,\u201d Williams said of Obama. \u201cIn their world he\u2019s the worst. In my world, he\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 pride in Obama was common among black voters across the state. And surveys show that public opinion on the president is sharply divided along political and racial lines. In a Gallup poll earlier this month, 94 percent of African-Americans said that they approved of Obama\u2019s job performance, compared to just 42 percent of whites.\n\nBut black Clinton supporters in South Carolina were quick to point out that her embrace of the president and his policies wasn\u2019t the only reason why they chose her over Sanders.\n\nRegina McKnight said she believed that Clinton\u2019s proposals to create jobs and lower the costs of education were more realistic than Sanders\u2019 agenda, a commonly-held view among older black voters that the Sanders campaign disputes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d said McKnight, a retired Williamsburg County administrator. \u201cYou cannot have free college tuition for everyone. That\u2019s just not possible.\u201d\n\nPeter LaBerge, who served as a community field director for the Sanders campaign in Aiken County, defended Sanders in an interview at a campaign event at Claflin University on the eve of the primary.\n\nSanders has spent decades \u201cworking on racial justice and social justice,\u201d LaBerge said. \u201cHis approach with minorities has been very effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a black person, you\u2019re hoping and wishing that they\u2019re 100 percent genuine in their efforts.\u201d\n\nThe rally featured a speech from the rapper Killer Mike, an effective Sanders surrogate who has criticized Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s record on race and criminal justice. The critique has resonated with Sanders supporters, especially young voters.\n\nThe 1994 crime bill \u201cis responsible for the incarceration of so many African-Americans,\u201d said Derrick Quarles, who graduated from Claflin in 2013. \u201cI can\u2019t get over that.\u201d\n\nBut older black voters appeared more willing to look past the Clinton administration. Exit polls in South Carolina show that Clinton won at least 75 percent of the vote among people of all races age 30 or older.\n\nAs primary day approached last week, Clinton focused on her criminal justice reform and gun control plans at campaign stops throughout the state, leading to a flurry of attacks from critics who said that she was pandering to black voters in order to thwart a late surge by Sanders.\n\nSanders was also heavily criticized by Clinton supporters who questioned his commitment to the civil rights movement at the start of his political career.\n\nThe heated exchange on both sides pointed to the delicate balance that white Democrats must strike when appealing to black voters in the South, said Todd Shaw, a political science professor at the University of South Carolina.\n\nBut labeling Sanders and Clinton as pure opportunists ignores the realities of electoral politics, Shaw argued. Politicians are often personally invested in issues that seem to be driven by anger from voters or party activists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that there\u2019s a level of sincerity\u201d in Clinton and Sanders\u2019 campaign rhetoric, Shaw said, even if it can sometimes come off as overly strategic.\n\nIn South Carolina, Democrats have to navigate \u201ca combination of political self-interest and good electoral messaging to direct policy statements and signals to the African-American community. It would be silly not to.\u201d\n\nClinton alluded to that fact in her victory night speech. As she looked ahead to Super Tuesday, and took a veiled swipe at the Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Clinton paused to reflect on her resounding win in South Carolina.\n\nVoters \u201csent a message,\u201d Clinton said. Moving forward, \u201cwe are going to compete for every vote in every state. We are not taking anything, and we\u2019re not taking anyone, for granted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The spectacle of Democrats descending on states like South Carolina every four years to \u201ccourt\u201d the black vote has become a routine part of the primary process.
