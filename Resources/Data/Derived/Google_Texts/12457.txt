Jon and Kim Snyder watched as their business, the body parts shop, and two other businesses went up in flames Saturday morning.

“It’s really devastating when you think about there`s nothing, literally we have nothing,” says Kim Snyder.

The State Fire Marshal will visit the site this week to determine what caused the fire at 1863 NE 54th Avenue in Des Moines. The building is a distribution warehouse for car parts and paints. Jon Snyder claims because how the paints were packaged they likely were not the cause of the fire. The fire blazed for several hours and injured four firefighters who have since been released from the hospital.

Despite the loss of the building, the Snyder’s will continue business operation.

“It`s a little overwhelming to think about it but we feel confident that we`re up to the challenge,” says Kim Snyder.

The business’ 30 employees will work out of a new office space and will continue to sell products from the other location based in Omaha, Nebraska.

The owners are unsure whether they will rebuild the warehouse on the same property.
