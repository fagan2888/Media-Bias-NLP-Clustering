It\u2019s based on the absurd argument that the Congress didn\u2019t mean for subsidies to be available unless one\u2019s state set up an exchange \u2014 something the Congressional Budget Office never assumed in its many estimates of the ACA\u2019s cost.\n\nSome analysts argue that Republicans would face enormous backlash if those millions suddenly lose their insurance.\n\nIn the Washington Examiner, conservative pundit Byron York quotes an unnamed GOP aide fretting about \u201cads saying cancer patients are being thrown out of treatment, and Obama will be saying all Congress has to do is fix a typo.\u201d [source]\n\nIndeed, the possibility of tens of thousands of Mainers having the rug pulled out from under them motivated Rep. Poliquin to vote against a flat out repeal and pundit Matt Gagnon (who wants you to know he really, totally, definitely doesn\u2019t think the law is \u201cworking\u201d) to explain that Poliquin\u2019s vote was reasonable because, Gagnon says, it \u201cwould negatively impact tens of thousands of Mainers.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy\u2019s Pelosi\u2019s famous comment \u2014 and its misinterpretation \u2014 help make sense of the absurdity of this case.\n\nFor years, the strongest opponents of Obamacare will sometimes throw in something like this: \u201cWell, you know Pelosi said you had to pass the law to find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n\nThis has even been used by lawyers trying to gut the law in one of their briefs. It\u2019s their fall back from saying the law actually meant to limit subsidies to state exchanges, to a position that maybe this wasn\u2019t known but, in any case, the limit is in the text. (That latter claim runs into trouble because it conflicts with the Court\u2019s doctrine that particular parts of laws are understood in the law\u2019s broader context, but that\u2019s another story.)\n\nWhen Pelosi\u2019s comment is used by ACA opponents, the implication is that the ACA was rushed through, \u201cshoved down our throats,\u201d and no one had a chance to read it. And they say that Pelosi even admitted that.\n\nBut that interpretation is not only false, but also demonstrates the utter fiction that underlies this lawsuit.\n\nTo explain this requires a little timeline related to the ACA\u2019s passage and Pelosi\u2019s remark which shows that the law was well vetted when passed.\n\nAn extremely detailed version of this can be found in the brief by several health policy scholars submitted to the Supreme Court.\n\nHere are some highlights of the timeline:\n\nShortly after the election of Barack Obama in November 2008 , Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus (D-Montana) white paper laying out key elements for a health reform bill. It included the concept of subsidized private insurance, an individual mandate and a health insurance exchange where people could shop for and choose an insurance plan. (All of these elements had been tried in Massachusetts already.)\n\n, Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus (D-Montana) white paper laying out key elements for a health reform bill.

(All of these elements had been tried in Massachusetts already.) Senators worked in the summer and spring of 2009 drafting a health policy law, which was based on the white paper. Hearings were held with many witnesses. As the brief notes, \u201cEach relevant bill considered by the Senate in 2009 provided for backup federal authority over an exchange if a State did not exercise its authority.\u201d\n\ndrafting a health policy law, which was based on the white paper. Hearings were held with many witnesses. As the brief notes, \u201cEach relevant bill considered by the Senate in 2009 provided for backup federal authority over an exchange if a State did not exercise its authority.\u201d The Senate Finance Committee, before forwarding the bill to the Senate floor, held 53 meetings on provisions of the bill and spent 7 days debating amendments. The Senate devoted 25 legislative days, one after each other, to the bill before voting on it.\n\nThe Senate passed a health reform bill on December 24, 2009.\n\nWhile the House had been working on its own version of the bill and passed one in November 2009, the election of Scott Brown as Senator on January 19, 2010 made a compromise between the House and Senate versions impossible since Brown vowed to vote against any version of the Affordable Care Act. Thus Pelosi and others decided to just vote on the Senate bill.\n\nmade a compromise between the House and Senate versions impossible since Brown vowed to vote against any version of the Affordable Care Act. Thus Pelosi and others decided to just vote on the Senate bill. In March 21, 2010, the House of Representatives voted for the Senate version of the ACA. Recall that this had been passed nearly three months before.\n\nWhen did Pelosi make her remark?\n\nPelosi made her now famous comment on March 9, 2010. This was about two and a half months after the Senate passed the version of the ACA that had become law.\n\nThe entire Senate version of the bill had been on-line that entire time and there were many opeds and analyses of it. There was nothing secret about what was in the ACA.\n\nIn addition, reporters covering Pelosi\u2019s comments recognized that what she meant was that people would come to understand the benefits of the law as they saw it carried out.\n\nHere\u2019s what Politico said back then:\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that people won\u2019t appreciate how great the Democrat\u2019s health plan is until after it passes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about the controversies, the process about the bill\u2026but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard that it is legislation for the future \u2013 not just about health care for America, but about a healthier America,\u201d she told the National Association of Counties annual legislative conference, which has drawn about 2,000 local officials to Washington. \u201cBut we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it \u2013 away from the fog of the controversy.\u201d\n\nDuring a 20-minute speech, she touted benefits she thinks will be tangible to the audience\u2019s employers. She said there\u2019s support for public health infrastructure and investments in community health centers that will reduce uncompensated care that hospitals now need to deliver.\n\nAs you can see, Pelosi\u2019s comments had to do with what people would gain from the ACA.\n\nThere was no secrecy about what was in the law.\n\nHow could there be, when the House was to pass a version that the Senate passed more than two months before?\n\nHouse Members and Senators knew that the ACA didn\u2019t restrict subsidies to those buying insurance through state-run exchanges.\n\nThat never came up in all the comments on the House and Senate floor. The CBO never estimated costs based on such a scheme. And no state that discussed whether to set up an exchange ever considered the possibility that this decision would have implications for whether their residents would have access to subsidies.\n\nSo this lawsuit is based on a phony legislative history and an absurd, widely promulgated misinterpretation of Pelosi\u2019s remarks.\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t mean the lawsuit won\u2019t succeed. If it does, those who lose their insurance will be the biggest losers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Pollways", "description": "Obamacare is increasingly lowering the number of Americans without health insurance, but it faces a threat by a lawsuit before the Supreme Court today.
