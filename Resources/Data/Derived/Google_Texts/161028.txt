Imagine, if you will, the NFL commissioner sitting down with Zach Galifianakis for a little “Between Two Ferns” chat.

It could have been classic, a brilliant PR effort in which Roger Goodell redeemed his image with a dry deadpan in which he and the comedian took turns skewering each other. Look what it did for President Obama when he used the Funny or Die forum to promote the Affordable Care Act.

But Alex Richanbach, executive producer of Funny or Die Sports, revealed in a SXSW panel attended by SB Nation’s Eric Sollenberger last weekend that, alas, somethings are just too wonderful to be true. As Sollenberger tells it:

[T]he league responded by telling Funny or Die that they would not allow Roger Goodell to subject himself to ridicule from a comedian of all people. Professional football is a very serious business made of men with iron wills and stone faces and that starts from the top down. I wasn’t completely surprised to hear that the NFL didn’t understand how jokes work, but the next part was over-the-top, even by NFL standards. In an attempt to salvage the interview, Funny Or Die countered by reminding them that even the leader of the free world was willing to take a joke, saying “but Obama did it, and he’s president of the United States.” Richanbach said that the league shot back, “well, he’s not the commissioner of the NFL.“

Oof.
