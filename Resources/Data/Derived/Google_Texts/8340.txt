Steve O'Brien may live in Lynn Haven, but some days his home is on the range.

"A sense of euphoria," said O'Brien. "It's nice just to be able to get away and take my time and not be rushed."

Ever since it opened last October, the Bay County shooting range has given anyone a shot to test their skills pulling the trigger. Using anything from .38 Specials, to AR-15s, and everything in between.

So far, Florida Fish and Wildlife officials say the range has shot up in popularity, drawing an average of anywhere from 800 to 1,000 shooters a month, for some blue skies and blued steel.

"There's a variety of different opportunities for people to go out and use their rifles, use their pistols, things like that to get sighted in to make sure the guns are on target and enjoy the beautiful day," said FWC spokesperson Bekah Nelson.

According to Nelson, one of the newest additions to the shooting range is the 300 yard steel challenge, which allows people to bring rifles out to test their shot on steel animal targets that are about three football fields lengths away.

It's something O'Brien says that helps make the shooting range a top shot in the community.

For Dawn Pfeiffer, the range also offers a chance for those hoping to pull the trigger for the first time.

"The fact that the range officers were not only here to help control the area, but they offered fantastic shooting insights and abilities to us," said Pfeiffer. "So when you come here, not only is it a great facility, but you also get some hands-on teaching and learning, which is a great opportunity offered here in Bay County."

According to Nelson, the cost to shoot at the range is anywhere from just less than $11 to $15. She says the range is working on adding sporting clays sometime around the end of the year.
