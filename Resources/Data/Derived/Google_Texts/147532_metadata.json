While his wife will remain an accountant at Peking University for the time being, he said, he is unlikely to return to China until the political situation changes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Xia found himself in the sights of the Chinese authorities six years ago when he was a drafter of Charter 08, a petition demanding sweeping political changes in China, including individual rights and an end to one-party rule.\n\n\u201cIf you want institutional change, someone must be willing to stand out to make a contribution, even sacrifice,\u201d said Professor Xia, who at one point was placed under house arrest for three days and then under the 24-hour watch of police officers.\n\nThe main author of Charter 08, Liu Xiaobo, was convicted of trying to overthrow the government and sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison. In 2010, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \u201clong and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\u201d\n\nThe political labels of Professor Xia and the Cato Institute, in Washington, are strikingly different. Professor Xia got into trouble in China for being too liberal, while the institute is known as libertarian or \u2014 less to its liking \u2014 ultraconservative. But the professor and Cato officials say they have the same focus.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who promotes market reforms, human rights and limited constitutional democracy, and we share those values,\u201d said Ian V\u00e1squez, director of Cato\u2019s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity. \u201cIf he can use the Cato platform to call attention to the most urgent reforms, both economic and social, in China, that would be a lot.\u201d\n\nPeking University allowed Professor Xia to leave China to become a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, starting in July 2011 and then at Stanford the next year.\n\nBut in March 2012, as Professor Xia\u2019s year at U.C.L.A. was nearing its end, Wen Jiabao, who was prime minister of China, gave a speech calling for reform of the Communist Party\u2019s leadership and the country. Professor Xia took to social media, including his blog, to urge gatherings around China to press for change.\n\nHis actions angered the Chinese authorities, who ordered him back to China in January 2013. He was told in June that there would be a vote on his employment at the university, and in October he was dismissed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeking University has partnerships with many American universities, and as word spread that he would most likely be fired, Professor Xia became a symbol of Chinese scholars\u2019 limited academic freedom.\n\nAt Wellesley, which had recently signed a partnership with Peking University, more than 130 professors declared in an open letter in September that they would seek to have the agreement reconsidered if Professor Xia was fired for political reasons. After the dismissal, Peking University said the reason was poor teaching.\n\nProfessor Xia said the dean of economics, Sun Qixiang, had told him that the foreign support hurt him. \u201cShe said, \u2018You were exploited by them,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cShe formally told me, \u2018You think we all have to listen to American professors, but you\u2019re wrong. If they didn\u2019t do this, you wouldn\u2019t be in this position.\u201d\n\nWellesley\u2019s partnership with Peking University is continuing, and Professor Xia will be a visiting associate at Wellesley\u2019s Freedom Project, headed by Thomas Cushman, who organized the letter.\n\nProfessor Cushman said many of his colleagues did not understand the centrality of Communist Party officials in China\u2019s universities, and were too quick to believe that Professor Xia had been fired for bad teaching.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we\u2019re headed toward another Tiananmen Square, but there\u2019s definitely a crackdown on dissidents,\u201d Professor Cushman said.\n\nWhile both Professors Xia and Cushman stressed that American universities should be careful, Professor Xia said he supported Wellesley\u2019s ties with Peking University. \u201cI think Wellesley did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cEver since Charter 08, I knew I would be fired one day, but I never realized they would use an excuse like poor teaching.\u201d\n\nProfessor Xia was targeted in three editorials in The Global Times, a party newspaper, along the lines of \u201cPeking University Fires Bad Teacher,\u201d but he said most people in China would not take them at face value.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHow would firing a bad teacher be so important for three editorials?\u201d he said. \u201cNo one would know exactly what happened, but they would see that the atmosphere is tightening.\u201d\n\nLast month, another dissident, Xu Zhiyong, was sentenced to four years in prison. In the summer, Professor Xia said, he received an email from his department\u2019s new party secretary criticizing his support for Mr. Xu and asking what he had been thinking when he signed a petition on his behalf.\n\nSome relatives have urged Professor Xia to abandon his activism. When news of his situation reached his parents, he said, his mother called in tears.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Can\u2019t you go to the leaders and tell them you were wrong?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI told her, \u2018Mom, you know your son better than that.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140209214526, "twitter": {"description": "Xia Yeliang, dismissed from
