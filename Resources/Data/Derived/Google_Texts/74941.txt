WASHINGTON, March 15 (UPI) -- The National Rifle Association has taken a stand against President Obama's nominee to be the 19th U.S. Surgeon General.

Dr. Vivek Murthy, Obama's pick for surgeon general, has come under fire from the NRA and some Senate Republicans over his assertions that gun violence constitutes a health problem and his support for the Affordable Care Act, the New York Daily News reported.

The NRA sent out a letter voicing opposition to Murthy's nomination, while several senators, including Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and John Barrasso, R-Wy., have also been outspoken against the nomination.

"This nominee seems much more committed to politics than to patients," said Barrasso, a former surgeon. Murthy is a highly respected British-born internist who co-founded Doctors for America.

The White House may postpone Murthy's confirmation vote in the Senate or withdraw his nomination all together, the New York Times reported.

"We are recalibrating our strategy around his floor vote," said one senior White House official.

The unnamed official said the Obama administration is working with Democratic leaders to gain more support for Murthy's nomination and may delay a vote until after the midterm elections, or allowing Dr. Murthy to withdraw.

"We expect him to ultimately get confirmed," the official said.
