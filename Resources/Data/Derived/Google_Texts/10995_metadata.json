John Kasich defended his record on education at a town hall Monday night in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cNow, on this whole business of Common Core, it\u2019s like it\u2019s radioactive, you mention that and everybody all the sudden doesn\u2019t listen anymore,\u201d said Kasich, who is expected to run for president in 2016.\n\nKasich said the \u201cidea\u201d of Common Core was for \u201cstudents in every state to be given the opportunity to compete with every other student.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want kids to jump higher,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nHe said he has worked towards setting high education standards in Ohio.\n\n\u201cThe curriculum to meet those standards\u2026. is set by local school boards,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIt is not set by Barack Obama, it is not even set by John Kasich, it is set by local school boards. And we have parental advisors that work with the school boards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure, at least in my state, that standards are high and local control is maintained,\u201d Kasich continued. \u201cNow, some may call that Common Core. I don\u2019t really know, but I\u2019m telling you the way it is in my state.\u201d\n\nKasich said education should ultimately rest in the hands of parents.\n\n\u201cWe better do a better job of running our schools,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to the have local control, then we have the local responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe criticized the \u201cagrarian\u201d and \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model of the education system, and called for more vocational training and mentoring programs.\n\nKasich also proposed seeking \u201cthe finest private sector minds\u201d to come up with a solution to \u201coverhaul\u201d the Veterans Administration.\n\nKasich called himself \u201ca Reagan guy,\u201d touting his record of balancing budgets and cutting taxes. He proposed a balanced budget amendment and shifting power from Washington, D.C., \u201cto where we all live.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make sure we have a strong military, but I don\u2019t want to waste money,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste money in the welfare department, I don\u2019t want to waste money in the Pentagon, and I don\u2019t want to waste money by giving tax breaks that represent corporate welfare. I don\u2019t like any of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur children should not be put in debt,\u201d Kasich continued.\n\nKasich is expected to launch a presidential campaign later this month.\n\n\u201cWhat I think people want in this country today, whether I run or not, is that they want to believe that they can get a fair shot,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t have a lobbyist, because they don\u2019t have a big name, because they don\u2019t have a lot of money, they just want to think they\u2019re going to get a fair shot.\u201d\n\nKasich previously sought the Republican nomination for president in 2000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
