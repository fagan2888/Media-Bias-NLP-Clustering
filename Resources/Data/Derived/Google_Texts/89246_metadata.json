He went out to the front yard and launched a sleek new drone he had recently purchased online for about $1,000.\n\nThe 2.8-pound drone, advertised as \u201ceasy to fly,\u201d proved anything but. Soon after takeoff, the drone veered dangerously toward a power line. It then climbed more than 700 feet \u2013 right into the path of a California Highway Patrol helicopter. A head-on collision was averted only after the chopper\u2019s crew made a sharp right-hand turn at the last moment.\n\nThe harrowing episode illustrates a growing safety concern as more and more drones, particularly ones used for recreation, take flight into the national airspace. Their popularity is booming in the U.S., with sales of drones weighing more than a half-pound expected to reach 1 million this year. At the same time, critics fear that chances of a catastrophic collision with a manned aircraft \u2013- possibly even a commercial jetliner \u2013- also are soaring.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we have a tragedy on our hands,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a news release.\n\nSome critics focus the blame on the companies that market drones for recreational use, which can sell from under $100 to $3,000 or more. These drones, like Ouyang\u2019s device, can zoom to impressive altitudes but, the critics say, usually lack the navigation and communications systems and design quality needed to ensure safe flying.\n\nPaul Hudson, president of the airline passenger advocacy group FlyersRights.org, said drone industry lobbyists have succeeded in coaxing the Federal Aviation Administration to grant \u201ca de facto waiver of basic aircraft regulations to drone makers and sellers.\u201d\n\nIndustry says fears overblown\n\nIndustry officials say fears are overblown, and that they already are adding new safety features. \u201cThe record we have to date should speak for itself,\u201d said Brendan Schulman, a vice president of DJI, the Chinese drone company that dominates the recreational market. \u201cThe recreational drone world has tens of millions of operational hours, I would estimate, and not a single fatality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis notion that something is going to happen one day is true of everything. \u2026 You could say it about lawnmowers,\u201d Schulman said, alluding to federal figures indicating that about 110 people a year are killed by accidents involving lawnmowers, mainly riding lawnmowers.\n\nStill, Feinstein, along with Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is pushing legislation to give the FAA broad authority to regulate hobbyists who fly drones. The measure also would direct the aviation agency to require manufacturers of drones built for recreation or business to add safety features such as limits on how high, or where, their devices can fly.\n\nThe bill\u2019s supporters include Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, the retired airline pilot famed for successfully executing an emergency water landing in the Hudson River in 2009 when his aircraft was disabled after striking a flock of geese. In a press release, Sullenberger said: \u201cThe huge upsurge in the numbers of drones and of reckless actions by drone users has greatly increased the risk to everyone who flies.\u201d\n\nFeinstein has vowed to press her case during the debate over the reauthorization of FAA programs that Congress is scheduled to take up in March. The industry appears ready to put up a fight, although much of its focus is on pending regulations for operators of commercial drones.\n\nThe Small UAV Coalition \u2013 which includes manufacturers such as DJI, along with Amazon, Google X and Intel \u2014 spent $890,000 last year lobbying Congress and federal agencies. That was four times the coalition\u2019s spending on lobbying in 2014, when it was founded, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. (UAV stands for unmanned aerial vehicles.)\n\nClose encounters of the drone kind\n\nAlready, worrisome incidents abound. A report released in December by Bard College\u2019s Center for the Study of the Drone identified 327 \u201cclose encounters\u201d between drones and manned aircraft over a 21-month period that ended in September. That included 51 cases when the drones and conventional aircraft came within 50 feet of each other, and 28 incidents in which a pilot maneuvered to avoid a collision.\n\nDrones flying over a dozen wildfires last summer in California forced authorities to pull back firefighting planes in some cases to avoid a mid-air collision. Drones also have flown close to some of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, and approached commercial planes carrying hundreds of passengers.\n\nOn the ground, a commercial drone crashed into a street in Pasadena, Calif., last September, kicking up debris that cut and bruised an 11-month-old girl who was being pushed in a stroller. The same month, a student flew a drone over a packed football stadium at the University of Kentucky, crashing into the stands. No one was hurt. In November, an 18-month-old boy in the U.K. lost an eye after being hit in the face by the propeller of a drone flown by a family friend.\n\nCritics say the dangers have been exacerbated by misleading marketing that emphasizes the ease of operating a drone and ignores how things can go wrong. Manufacturers, they say, also have focused more on developing attention-grabbing technical capabilities than improving safety features.\n\nConcern also has emerged that easily available high-flying drones could become a difficult-to-defeat weapon for terrorists. When asked about that threat during a House aviation subcommittee hearing in October, Mykel Kochenderfer, a Stanford University aeronautics expert, replied: \u201cI would have to say there\u2019s relatively little we can do about that now.\u201d\n\nRegulation has been slow to come, however. Aside from a federal registration requirement announced in December, recreational drone users have operated largely under voluntary FAA guidelines dating back to 1981 for model aircraft. The guidelines, among other things, say users should limit flying to 400 feet above ground. But there are no requirements for operators to be trained or for their drones to have FAA certification. The FAA can fine those who fly recklessly, but the agency has rarely used that authority, in part because operators involved in near-misses are hard to track down.\n\nPolitical clout in Washington\n\nCritics say the makers of recreational drones have used their political clout in Washington to shield themselves from tougher regulations and have acted irresponsibly in bringing to market products that don\u2019t meet basic aviation safety standards.\n\nAmong the harshest critics is W. Hulsey Smith, chief executive of Aero Kinetics, a Fort Worth, Texas, company that sells sophisticated commercial drones costing $10,000 or more to automate tasks such as inspecting cellphone towers or refineries. He calls most recreational drones \u201ctoys\u201d and says their manufacturers should be using higher-quality designs and installing better navigation and communications systems.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for them to wait to adopt these basic principles of safety other than for greedy profit,\u201d Smith said. These companies, he added, are \u201cputting the public at risk, both in the air and on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first time we have an incident with a toy drone and a manned aircraft anywhere in the world that causes fatalities, the pending litigation will force the toy drone industry to be responsible, so why should they wait for that to happen?\u201d Smith said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FAA issued a proposal last February that would ease standards for small drones used for commercial purposes such as aerial photography, power-line surveillance and crop monitoring.\n\nThe industry-friendly proposal followed intense lobbying: Trade groups and other drone business interests met privately with White House officials more than a dozen times overall in the three months before the rules were proposed, according to records on a White House website. The industry contends the agency has dragged its feet in approving commercial drone operations. So far only about 3,300 commercial operators have been cleared by the FAA under the current temporary rules. That\u2019s only a speck in the sky compared to the hundreds of thousands of recreational users, but the number of commercial operators could surge after permanent rules are adopted, which is expected in late spring.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American skies are littered with thousands of recreational devices, raising fears of mid-air collisions VIDEO", "title": "Drones are inviting disaster: \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before we have a tragedy on our hands\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The American skies are littered with thousands of recreational devices, raising fears of mid-air collisions VIDEO", "title": "Drones are inviting disaster: \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before we have a tragedy on our hands\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/06/drones_are_inviting_disaster_its_only_a_matter_of_time_before_we_have_a_tragedy_on_our_hands_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/shutterstock_383655685.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American skies are littered with thousands of recreational devices, raising fears of mid-air collisions VIDEO", "title": "Drones are inviting disaster: \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before we have a tragedy on our hands\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/shutterstock_383655685.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rick Schmitt and Stuart Silverstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Drones, FairWarning", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He calls most recreational drones \u201ctoys\u201d and says their manufacturers should be using higher-quality designs and installing better navigation and communications systems.\nThe industry appears ready to put up a fight, although much of its focus is on pending regulations for operators of commercial drones.\nThe industry contends the agency has dragged its feet in approving commercial drone operations.\nThe guidelines, among other things, say users should limit flying to 400 feet above ground.\nSo far only about 3,300 commercial operators have been cleared by the FAA under the current temporary rules."}
