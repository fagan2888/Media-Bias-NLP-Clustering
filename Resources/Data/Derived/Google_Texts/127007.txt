Four Things You Should Know (And a Cartoon):

Bibi Blowback: If there ever was a situation which defined that overused term, it’s the reaction to House Speaker John Boehner’s decision to end-run the White House and invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. Designed, apparently, to undermine White House talks to de-nuclearize Iran, Boehner’s back got blown by influential, parties who aren’t necessarily Friends of Obama or Fans of Iran – including muscular Israeli spy agency Mossad, the Anti-Defamation League, the pencil-necks at the New York Times editorial page and Fox News anchor Shepard Smith. Now, Senate Democrats have joined the party, if tardily, by announcing they won’t vote on a Republican-led Iran sanctions bill – for now. Heeding the critics, they’ve decided to give the fragile negotiations more time.

No Strategy? Big Problem: While we’re on the subject of international affairs, three former American military commanders confirmed what many have suspected: President Barack Obama and his national security team don’t have a plan for winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the president seems paralyzed by the crisis of Islamic State group and the Rubik’s Cube of a war going on in Syria. U.S. News’ Paul D. Shinkman reports that the commanders – retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, retired Navy Adm. William Fallon (who is also a former CentCom chief) and former Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. John Keane – told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the White House has to “come out from our reactive crouch and take a firm, strategic stance in defense of our values.” No word on exactly what those are, or against whom we should defend them.
