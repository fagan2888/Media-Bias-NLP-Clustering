One Irving-based company claims to have created an online solution for hospitals to do just that.\n\nThe Aptitude online marketplace allows hospitals to view pricing for hospital supplies, negotiate contracts with suppliers directly, and track their purchases and contracts online. Irving-based Novation LLC, a health care supply chain contracting company, launched the site in April 2013.\n\n\u201cYou get to do business with vendors directly, and there\u2019s nobody in between,\u201d said Tim Ingram, director of materials management at Longmont United Hospital in Longmont, Colo.\n\nThe vast majority of health care providers in America traditionally participate in group purchasing organizations (GPOs) for better prices on their supply chain expenses.\n\nThe organizations pool the purchasing power of thousands of hospitals to get discounts from equipment suppliers. However, hospitals can negotiate contracts outside of GPOs directly with suppliers.\n\n\u201cAptitude fills in those gaps for products that do not have a GPO contract,\u201d said Ingram, whose hospital uses the platform.\n\nIngram said he gets better prices with Aptitude by buying locally or from smaller vendors. He said these vendors don\u2019t often have the opportunity to participate in group contracting.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very motivated to give you a competitive price for a product,\u201d Ingram said.\n\nMore pressure to save\n\nTroy Kirchenbauer, general manager of Aptitude, said financial challenges and developing technology in health care created the opportunity before the platform\u2019s January 2013 pilot program.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the market conditions, obviously the Affordable Care Act is putting tremendous financial pressure on health care providers,\u201d Kirchenbauer said.\n\nKirchenbauer said Novation\u2019s support for Aptitude totals more than $10 million. He said the effort began seven or eight years ago with investments in data and data collection technology. Through these investments, he said Aptitude minimizes the time invested in contract negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe remember the choices [hospitals] have made in the past, and we [automatically] cross-reference those items for future bids,\u201d said Kirchenbauer.\n\nHospitals that use Aptitude average savings of about 15 percent on their contracts, Kirchenbauer said. Ingram said his hospital saves around 18 to 20 percent per agreement.\n\nAptitude costs subscribers $50,000 a year to use. But that\u2019s pocket change for hospital supply chain budgets, especially for larger hospital systems, said Justin Hibbs, the platform\u2019s senior director for marketing and research.\n\n\u201cAny software that pays for itself, you won\u2019t see too many CFOs that won\u2019t back you up,\u201d Ingram said.\n\n$55B opportunity\n\nHibbs said Aptitude started with eight employees and now has 30 employees after its first year.\n\nAptitude began with a pilot program with five hospitals and five suppliers last January. Hibbs said Aptitude now serves more than 600 hospitals and around 40 suppliers.\n\nKirchenbauer said this growth has been mainly through hospitals affiliated with Novation, also one of the largest GPOs in America. But he said Aptitude plans to expand to other hospitals.\n\nKirchenbauer said skeptics often ask if Aptitude\u2019s approach puts Novation\u2019s GPO business model in jeopardy.\n\nOther GPOs have launched digital platforms, such as Premier Healthcare Alliance\u2019s PremierConnect. But Kirchenbauer said Aptitude\u2019s approach goes after more of the market than others. He said Aptitude can tap into the billions hospitals spend on supply chain purchases outside of GPOs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a $55 billion market opportunity, and [others in the industry] are doing it with paper and pencil and email and Microsoft Excel,\u201d Kirchenbauer said. \u201cWe can absolutely pave a much better way for the future.\u201d\n\nFollow Daniel Salazar on Twitter at @imdanielsalazar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Novation\u2019s Aptitude platform lets hospitals view pricing, negotiate supplier contracts directly, and track purchases and contracts online.", "og": {"description": "Novation\u2019s Aptitude platform lets hospitals view pricing, negotiate supplier contracts directly, and track purchases and contracts online.", "title": "Irving company creates online marketplace to cut hospitals\u2019 supply-chain costs", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20140605-irving-company-creates-online-marketplace-to-cut-hospitals-supply-chain-costs.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-06-06T02:45:14Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-06-06T02:45:14Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Irving company creates online marketplace to cut hospitals\\u2019 supply-chain costs\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20140605-irving-company-creates-online-marketplace-to-cut-hospitals-supply-chain-costs.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1715425\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-06T02:45:14Z\", \"section\": \"General Business\", \"author\": \"DANIEL SALAZAR\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-06T02:45:14Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc713\"", "article_summary": "Irving-based Novation LLC, a health care supply chain contracting company, launched the site in April 2013.\nFacing declining reimbursements and intensifying bottom-line pressure, health care providers are racing to shave millions from their supply chain costs.\nBut that\u2019s pocket change for hospital supply chain budgets, especially for larger hospital systems, said Justin Hibbs, the platform\u2019s senior director for marketing and research.\nThe Aptitude online marketplace allows hospitals to view pricing for hospital supplies, negotiate contracts with suppliers directly, and track their purchases and contracts online.\n\u201cIn terms of the market conditions, obviously the Affordable Care Act is putting tremendous financial pressure on health care providers,\u201d Kirchenbauer said."}
