Rising to the occasion, authorities announced that they will now test every tiger carcass it finds for the virus, and are also considering vaccinating dogs to prevent them from spreading it to other animals.\n\nSome argue that \u2014 with rapid development bringing people and their pets closer and closer to wildlife \u2014 such measures won\u2019t be nearly enough, and want the country to focus on more preventable threats like poaching and deforestation instead. But as the Associated Press reports, the virus is not a threat to be taken lightly:\n\nCanine distemper virus, a close relative of measles, is associated mostly with domestic dogs though it has infected \u2014 and ravaged \u2014 other carnivore populations. It brought the U.S. black-footed ferret to the brink of extinction in the late 1970s. In Tanzania in 1994, an epidemic likely introduced by tourists\u2019 dogs wiped out at least a third of the 3,000-strong African lion population in Serengeti National Park. The possibility of a disease like canine distemper hitting the world\u2019s last population of wild Asiatic lions was a major consideration in last year\u2019s Indian Supreme Court\u2019s decision ordering Gujarat state to safeguard the species by transferring some lions to a second, faraway sanctuary. While dogs can often recover from the disease, other animals including tigers, lions and leopards suffer fever, seizures and delirium before they die.
