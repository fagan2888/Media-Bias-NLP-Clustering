Thousands more people in Northeastern Pennsylvania had health insurance coverage in 2014 as the Affordable Care Act continues to shrink the ranks of the nation’s uninsured.

Lackawanna, Luzerne and Monroe counties all experienced a decrease in the percentage of individuals without insurance, mimicking the trend in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey.

Regardless of your views on President Barack Obama’s health care law, the numbers have to be seen as encouraging, said Gary Drapek, executive director of the United Way of Lackawanna and Wayne Counties.

“The more people we can insure, the better all the way around,” he said. “All the statistics show that when someone is in better health, they have a better chance of getting a job; they have a better chance of not being on welfare programs and so on and so forth ... so this is all good.”

The Census Bureau figures covered only counties and municipalities with populations of 65,000 or more:

■ In Luzerne County, 25,965 people, or 8.3 percent of the population, had no health insurance coverage last year. That was down from 30,031 people, or 9.6 percent, in 2013.

■ The number of uninsured individuals in Lackawanna County dropped from 16,180 to 15,743, or from 7.7 percent to 7.5 percent of the population.The uninsured rate for just Scranton fell from 10 percent to 9.3 percent. There were 6,749 city residents without insurance last year, down from 7,328 in 2013.

■ As a percentage of the population, Monroe County showed the most dramatic drop in uninsured individuals. The county had 17,278 people, or 10.4 percent, with no coverage in 2014, a decrease from 21,226, or 12.8 percent, the previous year.

There could be a multitude of reasons a large number of people in Northeastern Pennsylvania are still uninsured almost two years after open enrollment in the health insurance marketplace began under the ACA, said Eugene Brady, executive director of the Wilkes-Barre-based Commission on Economic Opportunity.

Some simply may not be aware coverage is available, he said. In addition, young people especially may think they do not need insurance.

“We would certainly encourage people to get advice and apply if they are eligible for health care coverage,” Brady said.

Despite the expansion of insurance coverage apparent in the census figures, the Scranton Primary Health Care Center has not noticed a decrease in demand for its services, executive director Joseph Hollander said.

In 2014, the center on Wyoming Avenue, which provides medical services to the poor, cared for 8,241 unique patients during about 30,000 separate visits.

Hollander said demand remains high because, even though there are more people with health coverage, there is still a significant number who are uninsured. In addition, the census numbers capture a specific moment in time and do not reflect individuals who were later dropped by their insurers when they don’t pay their premiums, he said.

The census numbers showed no statistically significant change in the poverty rate in the region in 2014.

In Lackawanna County, 15.5 percent of the population lived in poverty last year, up from 14.9 percent. Among children under 18, the rate dropped from 21.8 percent to 19.9 percent.

The overall poverty rate in Luzerne County fell from 16.4 percent to 16.1 percent; the rate among children dropped from 29.4 percent to 25.4 percent.

All the percentage shifts were within the census survey’s margin of error.
