It isn\u2019t even her first time at Genesis House, a residential drug treatment facility in Seaside run by Community Human Services.\n\nShe graduated from the Genesis House in early 2012 and continued to live drug-free for seven months at a county-backed sober living environment. But once she left the program, she didn\u2019t attend the weekly Genesis House grad meetings or stay connected with the staff.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t good,\u201d said Natalie, which is not her real name. \u201cBecause I relapsed.\u201d\n\nNatalie began using heroine and methamphetamine again. Unable to find employment, she lost custody of her 11-year-old child and ended up in jail for three months. She left jail clean and determined to stay that way.\n\nShe\u2019s back at Genesis, this time with a three-month-old baby. And when she leaves, she plans to sign up for something she didn\u2019t have before: Community Human Services\u2019 new outpatient treatment facilities, set to open in Salinas and Monterey in January 2015.\n\nMedi-Cal changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act expanded health care access to thousands of Californians, bringing with it coverage for substance abuse treatment. In Monterey County, that led to 40,000 new enrollees in the program, many of them low-income.\n\nThe outpatient centers, one on Garden Road in Monterey and the other in Salinas, will serve up to 100 patients each. They will offer individual and group therapy during daytime and evening hours and utilize many of the therapy techniques used in CHS\u2019s other drug-therapy programs.\n\nMost importantly, CHS is applying to be a Medi-Cal provider so that the services will be available those to who are in the most need of treatment.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever before, there needs to be more programs for those patients who want services,\u201d said Senior Programming Director Marta Sullivan, who will be overseeing the centers.\n\nIn Salinas, the new center will double the number of spots for people seeking treatment, while the Garden Road location will be the first outpatient treatment facility for Medi-Cal patients in Monterey. A treatment facility at Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula does not take Medi-Cal patients.\n\nThe need for drug treatment in Monterey is huge, according to Genesis House Program Director Clive Stewart. That facility has 36 inpatient beds, with a wait time of three to eight weeks.\n\n\u201cYou could do five outpatient centers and it wouldn\u2019t clear the number of people who need it,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart estimates there are only about 180 inpatient beds in all of Monterey County. Outpatient centers don\u2019t need beds, so counselors can schedule appointments with patients right away while they wait for a spot to open up.\n\nIn some cases, outpatient treatment itself might be enough, allowing patients to hold onto jobs and keep their families together, Stewart said.\n\nStewart also sees a role for outpatient therapy after patients leave the treatment facility. Upon entering Genesis, patients are assessed and get a treatment plan with goals, the main one is getting and staying clean. When they graduate and begin outpatient treatment, this process will be repeated.\n\n\u201cNow that they\u2019re sober, the goals have changed.\u201d said Stewart.\n\nNatalie, two months into her stay at Genesis House and drug-free for nine months, is looking to that stage of her life. She\u2019s taking parenting classes and the staff is helping her reconnect with her older child. She plans to work closely with CHS\u2019s counselors in the outpatient clinic.\n\n\u201cMy goal is just to have my family whole, to be fully present in their lives.\u201d she said.\n\nKim Smuga-Otto can be reached at 831-726-4378.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monterey >> This isn\u2019t Natalie\u2019s first time in recovery.
