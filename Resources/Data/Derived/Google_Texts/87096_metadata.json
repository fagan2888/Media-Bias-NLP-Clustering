(Rob Howard)\n\nMeet the rising star of the Republican Party: a Cuban-American, Roman Catholic Gen Xer with four young kids, a passion for football, and a powerful drive to achieve what his parents couldn\u2019t.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has been called \u201ca Latino Barack Obama\u201d and \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d But to his wife, Jeanette, he\u2019s more like Tom Hanks. On Valentine\u2019s Day 1997, Rubio planned to propose to Jeanette atop the Empire State Building, an idea inspired by her love of the movie Sleepless in Seattle. But it was so cold that day that she didn\u2019t want to go to the observation deck. \u201cI had to lure her there,\u201d Rubio recalls. \u201cI told her, \u2018I love King Kong. I\u2019ve always wanted to climb the Empire State Building!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Seriously, Marco?\u2019\u201d Jeanette says.\n\nBut up they went, 102 stories above Manhattan, where Rubio got down on one knee. The moment was just as sweet as it sounds, right up to when Jeanette said yes and accepted the ring.\n\n\u201cThen he took it back,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI was afraid she would drop it over the edge of the building,\u201d Rubio explains, laughing. \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s wait until we\u2019re on the ground. Then I\u2019ll give it back to you.\u2019\u201d\n\nNot terribly romantic, maybe, but it\u2019s just the kind of cautious pragmatism that has helped propel Rubio, 42, from his local city commissioner\u2019s office to the U.S. Capitol in 12 years. His willingness to take such great leaps is balanced by a careful, thoughtful temperament. As Al Cardenas, the chair of the grassroots American Conservative Union, describes it, Rubio has that rare ability to \u201cthink through a number of things at the same time. He\u2019s like those young guys in tech, like Mark Zuckerberg, only he\u2019s in the political arena.\u201d\n\nThis spring Rubio took the biggest calculated risk of his political career when he helped steer comprehensive immigration reform through the Senate. He was criticized by his conservative base for flip-flopping on the issue (during his 2010 Senate run, he\u2019d earned Tea Party support by opposing an earned path to citizenship), but Rubio defends his change of heart. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to consider immigration reform as a theoretical policy issue,\u201d he says, \u201cand another to meet real people whose lives are impacted by it. As a senator, I interact with people who flat-out tell you, \u2018Look, my kids were hungry. And I am going to do what it takes to feed them.\u2019 You think, \u2018If I had been in that position, would I have done something different?\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite Rubio\u2019s leadership, the Senate bill failed to find support among many of his fellow Republicans in the House, and it\u2019s unclear what will happen with immigration reform this fall. Meanwhile, Rubio\u2019s been busy adopting more conservative stances (a government shutdown over the Affordable Health Care Act; a Senate bill banning abortions after 20 weeks), which have helped maintain his credibility with right-leaning voters.\n\nA Quinnipiac University \u201cthermometer\u201d poll taken in August to measure voters\u2019 attitudes toward the nation\u2019s major political figures found the charismatic and youthful Rubio ranked third in popularity among Republican voters, after Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz. (Chris Christie came in eighth among Republican voters, but first among all voters.) The results make Rubio someone to watch as the 2016 presidential race shapes up, especially with the Republican Party trying to attract the increasingly important Latino vote.\n\nLast April on Capitol Hill, Rubio and other members of the \u201cgang of eight\u201d spoke to the media about their immigration reform bill. (Getty Images)\n\nRubio, whom Mitt Romney considered as a 2012 running mate (\u201cFrankly, it probably wasn\u2019t the right thing for me,\u201d he says), is quick to dismiss the idea that he is the GOP\u2019s Great Hispanic Hope: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can nominate someone with a last name that ends in a vowel and expect that all of a sudden Hispanics will flock to them. Voters choose the candidate who stands for what they stand for, and who stands with people like them. And I don\u2019t mean like them ethnically; I mean like them in terms of understanding what they\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\nArturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, points out that Rubio must also convince non-Hispanics that he represents their interests, too: \u201cRubio won\u2019t run as a Latino candidate; he\u2019s going to run as an American.\u201d\n\nIf so, the senator\u2019s up-by-the-bootstraps success story should help with all working-class voters, Latino or not. He is the third child of Mario and Oria Rubio, who grew up poor in Cuba and immigrated to Miami in 1956 in search of economic opportunity. (Rubio once claimed his parents were exiles who fled their homeland after Fidel Castro came to power; he revised that story after researching his 2012 memoir, An American Son.) But it was tough for Rubio\u2019s parents to find steady jobs to support a growing family\u2014Mario was a bartender, Oria a cashier\u2014 so in 1979, the family decamped to Las Vegas, where three of Oria\u2019s sisters lived.\n\nRubio\u2019s memories of that period are fond ones: Pop Warner football (he would later play defensive back for a year at Missouri\u2019s Tarkio College), family dinners at the Circus Circus Hotel\u2019s all-you-can-eat buffet, and Sunday services at the nearby Mormon church. \u201cMy mom was really attracted to its wholesome family environment,\u201d says Rubio, who returned to his Roman Catholic roots a few years later.\n\nBut Rubio\u2019s strongest recollections of Las Vegas involve his maternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, an autodidact and history lover who often lived with the Rubios. \u201cHe would sit on the porch in a folding aluminum chair, smoking a cigar, and I would sit at his feet,\u201d Rubio says. \u201cHe was a big fan of both Roosevelt and Truman for winning World War II. And he also loved Ronald Reagan. He believed that America was the only thing standing between communism and the rest of the world. He really thought America needed to be strong. He had a big influence on me.\u201d\n\n\u2018I always wanted to be in Parade but as a Parade All-American!\u2019 says the 5-foot-9 Rubio, a former college football player.\n\nGarcia died in 1984, and the next year, the Rubios returned to Miami\u2014this time seeking greater opportunity for their kids. \u201cYou could make a decent living at a young age working at a hotel in Las Vegas, and they worried we\u2019d end up doing that,\u201d recalls Rubio, who was 14 at the time. \u201cThey wanted their kids to have a professional career, the kind they couldn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nThat meant going to college. Rubio\u2019s parents never finished high school, and he remembers that homework was one thing they were painfully unable to help him with. \u201cYou see that today with immigrant communities. Parents struggle to help their kids because it\u2019s stuff they never learned,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m sensitive about when I see it in others.\u201d\n\nRubio earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Florida, then went on to the University of Miami School of Law. After graduating with more than $100,000 in student loans, which he finally paid off in 2012, Rubio planned to \u201cbecome a really good lawyer, and stay engaged politically.\u201d He was serving as a commissioner of his small city of West Miami (\u201cI joke it\u2019s like a condominium board without the power\u201d) when Florida called a special election for an empty seat in the House of Representatives in 2000. Rubio was just 28. \u201cI figured it was a good chance to run,\u201d he says.\n\nBy 2006, Rubio became the first Cuban-American speaker of the Florida House, a distinction that caught the eye of top Republicans, including Jeb Bush, Florida\u2019s governor at the time. Bush, whom Rubio considers a \u201ctrusted friend,\u201d later backed Rubio in his Senate run.\n\nBut Rubio\u2019s rise was not always easy. His Senate race against Florida\u2019s incumbent Republican governor, Charlie Crist, was so bruising that Rubio almost dropped out. It was Jeanette who pushed him to stay in, as she has throughout his career. \u201cI\u2019m not a political person,\u201d she says, \u201cbut this was something I knew he wanted. And once you\u2019re in, you\u2019ve got to go through with it.\u201d\n\nThe decision to run for president in 2016 will also be a joint one. The couple has already had \u201clittle discussions here and there,\u201d she says. \u201cAt some point late next year,\u201d he adds, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down with my increasingly opinionated children and my wife and we\u2019ll have the conversation: \u2018What do I want to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Rubios, together since their teens, with his parents on their wedding day. (Courtesy the Rubio Family)\n\nRight now, the Rubios have more pressing things to worry about\u2014namely, how to better balance work and family life, given that he\u2019s in Washington, D.C., most of the week while Jeanette is at home in the family\u2019s middle-class West Miami neighborhood with their four kids. \u201cMy family helps me a lot,\u201d she says. Her three sisters and Rubio\u2019s mother and older sister live nearby, along with 20 nieces and nephews. (Rubio\u2019s father passed away in 2010.) Jeanette says she spends much of her time in her Buick Enclave, shuttling the kids from one activity to another. Dominick, 6, and Anthony, 8, play football and basketball. Daniella, 11, rides in horse shows. And Amanda, 13, is a competitive stunt cheerleader. (Like mother, like daughter: Jeanette once cheered for the Miami Dolphins.) All that driving \u201cis bad for our car lease,\u201d Rubio jokes. \u201cWe\u2019re always over on the miles.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of their busy schedules, the Rubios are attempting to teach the kids Spanish. Although both grew up speaking it at home, they speak English to each other today. \u201cIt\u2019s our first language now,\u201d Jeanette says. Adds Rubio: \u201cWe have to force the Spanish with the kids. We try really hard. That\u2019s one thing I hope we get better at.\u201d\n\nJeanette describes herself as a strict mom. She has vetoed Amanda\u2019s request to wear platform shoes and crop tops and made Daniella sign a pet care contract before she brought home a shih tzu puppy, named Manna after the phrase \u201cmanna from heaven.\u201d \u201cThe most important thing for me is that they learn respect,\u201d Jeanette says. \u201cThey have to make their beds. They have to read during the summer. I can\u2019t stand them being on those video games\u2014they only get to play one hour on the weekend.\u201d\n\nRubio works up a sweat playing hoops with his sons. (Rob Howard)\n\nWhen the family has time off, they like to take trips to the Florida Keys on their 24-foot fishing boat. In the future, they hope to be together more often. The Rubios have put their four-bedroom home on the market with the goal of moving the family to Washington. A spokesperson says no decisions have been made, but Rubio clarifies that \u201cit\u2019s not about moving out of Florida; it\u2019s about being able to go home to your family at night. My most important job isn\u2019t senator. It\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nIn that role, Rubio hopes to be an example\u2014not only by showing his kids how far they can go, but also by helping them remember where their grandparents came from, and by protecting the unique opportunities this country offers. \u201cI do believe that the essence of the American dream is a vibrant middle class and upward mobility, the ability not just to do better yourself but to give your kids the chance to do everything you could not do. That dream is very prevalent in the Hispanic community. To the extent that people view the Republican party as a defender of this dream, I think that\u2019ll be very positive\u2014not just among Hispanics but among all Americans.\u201d\n\nGo behind the scenes of our cover shoot with the Rubio family:\n\n[onescreen item=\u201d5129408\u2033 playerFill=\u201dwidth\u201d]\n\nRead more on Senator Rubio:\n\nMarco Rubio and His Wife Share What Makes Their Relationship Work\n\nSenator Rubio Sizes Up His Party Mates\n\nMarco Rubio Explains Three of the Country\u2019s Big Issues", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016 presidential race, Al Cardenas, Family Dinners, Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, Parade cover story, politics, republican, Rob Howard, Rubio, Senator Rubio, Tom Hanks, United States", "author": "Galina Espinoza", "og": {"site_name": "Community Table", "description": "Meet the rising star of the Republican Party: a Cuban-American, Roman Catholic Gen Xer with four young kids, a passion for football, and a powerful drive to achieve what his parents couldn\u2019t.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been called \u201ca Latino Barack Obama\u201d and \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d But to his wife, Jeanette, he\u2019s more like [...]", "title": "At Home with Marco Rubio's Modern Family", "url": "http://communitytable.parade.com/151898/galinaespinoza/at-home-with-marco-rubio/", "image": "http://static.communitytable.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/marco-rubio-cover-ftr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Meet the rising star of the Republican Party: a Cuban-American, Roman Catholic Gen Xer with four young kids, a passion for football, and a powerful drive to achieve what his parents couldn\u2019t.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been called \u201ca Latino Barack Obama\u201d and \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d But to his wife, Jeanette, he\u2019s more like [...]", "title": "At Home with Marco Rubio's Modern Family", "image": "http://communitytable.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/marco-rubio-cover-ftr-1024x640.jpg", "creator": "@ParadeMagazine", "site": "@acommunitytable", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d82027", "p": {"domain_verify": "c3df3a277b0aa56b93896ae7c6c033fc"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1465014807105538}, "orginal-source": "http://communitytable.parade.com/151898/galinaespinoza/at-home-with-marco-rubio/", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wp-content/themes/wp-theme/img/ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-07T05:00:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T15:57:52-04:00"}, "keywords": "2016 presidential race, Al Cardenas, Family Dinners, Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, Parade cover story, politics, republican, Rob Howard, Rubio, Senator Rubio, Tom Hanks, United States", "google-site-verification": "cZtKSm3I5mibnoc3d2oqG--Vcv8UgT44zkEdqLwdf7A", "theme-color": "#d82027", "description": "Meet the rising star of the Republican Party: a Cuban-American, Roman Catholic Gen Xer with four young kids, a passion for football, and a powerful drive to achieve what his parents couldn\u2019t.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been called \u201ca Latino Barack Obama\u201d and \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d But to his wife, Jeanette, he\u2019s more like [...]"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee76\"", "article_summary": "The Rubios have put their four-bedroom home on the market with the goal of moving the family to Washington.\n(Chris Christie came in eighth among Republican voters, but first among all voters.)\nBut Rubio\u2019s strongest recollections of Las Vegas involve his maternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, an autodidact and history lover who often lived with the Rubios.\n(Rob Howard)When the family has time off, they like to take trips to the Florida Keys on their 24-foot fishing boat.\nGarcia died in 1984, and the next year, the Rubios returned to Miami\u2014this time seeking greater opportunity for their kids."}
