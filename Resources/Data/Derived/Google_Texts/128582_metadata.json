She knows she needs to keep her chest up and her heels glued to the floor.\n\nWill she lift weights someday or join a strength and conditioning gym? Who knows. Right now, she is enjoying a new kids fitness class at Fit Crew, the gym on 19th Avenue West in Bradenton where she gets to work out with her best friend Emma, where she gets stronger for her springboard diving team, where her dad and other family friends exercise, too.\n\nAt 9, she\u2019s already absorbed important universal truths about living a fit life.\n\nStretching is important. Exercises like \u201cSpidermans\u201d and \u201cMountain climbers\u201d are fun. And even though they are good for her, planks are her \u201cworst enemy.\u201d\n\nSince April, Fit Crew, a cross training gym in Bradenton, has hosted a fitness class, where children 6 to 12 engage in body weight exercises and basic gymnastic moves under the direction of trainer and Bradenton resident Amy Royall.\n\nIt\u2019s a scaled-down version of Fit Crew\u2019s adult classes, a hybrid of Olympic weightlifting, gymnastics and other strength and conditioning exercises that have made the gym largely successful and boosted membership to 250 since the gym opened in 2010 under co-owners and trainers Niels Renzenbrink and Andrew Terman.\n\nWhile some debate exists concerning what is the appropriate age for children to start weight-lifting, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends muscle-strengthening activities, such as gymnastics and pull-ups, be incorporated in a 60-minute, five-day-a-week, exercise regimen for children. These recommendations, which also include aerobic activity, are intended in part to decrease the roughly 12.5 million children in America who are considered obese.\n\nIn this class, where children only lift their body weight, learn basic movements like squats, push-ups and burpees and listen to lessons about nutrition, there is also a focus on boosting confidence and learning fundamentals that can help sustain healthy lifestyles, whether its through team sports or individual training.\n\n\u201cTeaching them the correct way to do these movements is so important, so that as they age they can train appropriately,\u201d Royall says. \u201cIt lays down the foundation for all these basic moves.\u201d\n\nRoyall, a longtime speech therapist in Bradenton, has certifications in Crossfit Kids and other training regimens, though her program is developed through Fit Crew.\n\nAt an average class, kids can expect to warm up and stretch through drills like jumping jacks and crab walks, work on a skill like squats and jump ropes, participate in a Workout of the Day and play a fun game.\n\nHere, there is a focus on technique and camaraderie, not competition.\n\n\u201cEverything is broken down step-by-step,\u201d Royall said. \u201cThey don\u2019t move on until they complete each step.\u201d\n\nThe class is also an important alternative for children who haven\u2019t jived with competitive team sports but still want an opportunity to be active.\n\nFit Crew member and mother Amber Westfall watched her daughter Madison, and niece Hannah Mott participate at a recent class. She and her husband have trained at Fit Crew for almost three years, and she\u2019s watched both girls flourish since starting the class in April.\n\n\u201cMadison\u2019s not athletic sports-wise but she likes activity,\u201d Westfall said, \u201cThis is a good fit for her.\u201d\n\nAbout 80 percent of the kids classes have children whose parents train at Fit Crew, Royall guesses.\n\nSometimes the motivation is getting to be like Mom and Dad.\n\n\u201cThe boys love it because it\u2019s an extension of me,\u201d Michael Terry, of Bradenton said. \u201cThey watch me push tires, and they get to push tires.\u201d\n\nTerry\u2019s sons, Austin, 6, and Mitchell, 9, regularly attend the class, sometimes while their dad is working out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s building a core and a foundation to maybe someday lift weights,\u201d Terry said. \u201cIt teaches them discipline, fundamentals and coordination, and it gets them off the couch.\u201d\n\nAt a recent class, Royall let Cailen and Emma Laade, 10, demonstrate warm-up stretches. She knelt down in front of Evan Tepfer, 7, and corrected his lunge. Kids pushed small tires across a parking lot, worked on chin-ups on a small metal bar and ended with a giggly game of dodgeball.\n\nThey are learning, even if they don\u2019t realize it.\n\nEmma, who also dives with Cailen, understands that developing her core will make her a better diver. She randomly reminds kids to take their weight off their feet and onto their heels during squats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning new stuff all the time,\u201d she said recently before kneeling down for a new exercise with Cailen during class.\n\nThe pair had to start in a plank and then lift one arm to hold each other\u2019s hands. It was hard at first to balance, but naturally there were more giggles.\n\nThis was a lot of work, but it was also a lot of fun.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/wpMFITKIDS.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Fit Crew member and mother Amber Westfall watched her daughter Madison, and niece Hannah Mott participate at a recent class.\n\u201cIt teaches them discipline, fundamentals and coordination, and it gets them off the couch.\u201dAt a recent class, Royall let Cailen and Emma Laade, 10, demonstrate warm-up stretches.\nThe pair had to start in a plank and then lift one arm to hold each other\u2019s hands.\nShe and her husband have trained at Fit Crew for almost three years, and she\u2019s watched both girls flourish since starting the class in April.\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning new stuff all the time,\u201d she said recently before kneeling down for a new exercise with Cailen during class."}
