What\u2019s your hospital doing to make sure that it's properly prescribing antibiotics and curbing such misuse?\n\nThis week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is shining a light on the topic, celebrating its Get Smart About Antibiotics Week from Nov. 16-22. Each year, some 2 million people in the U.S. are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the CDC notes, and at least 23,000 people die from those infections.\n\nAnd the overuse and misuse of antibiotics are the most critical factor in such resistance. They\u2019re one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in medicine, the CDC notes, but upward of 50 percent of antibiotics prescribed are unnecessary or not optimally effective. Given all of those numbers that I just threw at you, the CDC is using this week as an opportunity to tout awareness on the matter, coinciding with European Antibiotic Awareness Day on Nov. 18.\n\nCurrently, only about 39 percent of U.S. hospitals have an antibiotic stewardship program, systematically ensuring their proper use, and the CDC would like to eventually see that number at 100, says Lauri Hicks, D.O., a medical epidemiologist and director of the Get Smart program. \u201cWe still know we have a long way to go.\u201d For those having a tough time getting antibiotic awareness on their C-suite\u2019s priority list, Hicks says the argument is about more than just patient safety.\n\n\u201cNot only does it improve quality of care, but it also saves money,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that really resonates with leadership, especially in hospitals and health systems.\u201d\n\nThere are a host of resources and activities planned this week to help get the ball rolling in your hospital. Over on the CDC website, you can find examples of antibiotic stewardship programs, and implementation resources such as checklists and other assessment tools. The American Hospital Association\u2019s Physician Leadership Forum, too, has compiled a toolkit for hospitals to use, which AHA President and CEO Rick Polack touted in an email to members last week.\n\n\u201cAntibiotic resistance \u2014 when bacteria stop responding to the drugs designed to kill them \u2014 may be the single most important infectious disease threat of our time,\u201d Pollack wrote. \u201cWe risk turning back the clock to a world where simple infections can kill people as they did a century ago.\u201d\n\nIf all that isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s also a global Twitter chat \u2014 in concert with the World Health Organization and European CDC \u2014 on the topic slated for 2 to 4 p.m. Eastern Time Wednesday.
