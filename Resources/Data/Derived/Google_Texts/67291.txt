Today, outside the Values Voters Summit in Washington, D.C., Reason TV caught up with Sen. John McCain (R-Az.) where he talked about his strong support for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.

Nick: "What is the one main thing that he government should be working on between now and the election to get done that would actually change the economy and the environment ?"

Sen. John McCain: "You know what would really change it? A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In my view, if we got that going down the track we could easily 32 states that require agreement from them."

Nick: "That is something you and [Rep.] Justin Amash agree on."

Sen. John McCain: "Sure. Absolutely. I know of no other single act, cause that would force us...tough decisions would have to be made."
