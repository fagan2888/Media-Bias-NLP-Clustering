But he does love to reminisce.\n\nThe stories come faster now that the movies are about to shine a light on the criminal history of Tampa.\n\nBedami's own story, told in the 2007 book \u201cWho Are These Guys?\u201d never took off.\n\nSo he watches with interest the on-again, off-again progress on \u201cLive By Night and \u201cThe Infiltrator.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know they're making two movies about Tampa's underworld,\u201d he tells a visitor to his West Tampa waterfront home.\n\nFriends often stop by for the crab enchilado and to hear of Bedami's adventures.\n\nAmong his favorites: He was a partner with a pilot who claimed to have helped former Cuban President Fulgencio Batista flee the island nation when Fidel Castro overthrew him, the wild drug parties with rock 'n' roll legends such as Gregg Allman, and donkey rides on narrow paths ascending Colombian mountains to reach a secret meeting site.\n\n\u201cLive by Night\u201d is a fictional tale about real-life rum-running in Ybor City during Prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s. \u201cThe Infiltrator\u201d is the true story of a DEA agent who investigated Tampa businessmen laundering money for the Medellin Cartel in the 1980s.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nBoth movies are in limbo, but the production companies have said filming will begin within a year.\n\n\u201cInstead of two, they could make just one about my family,\u201d Bedami said. \u201cAnd all of my stories are true.\u201d\n\nTampa mafia historian Scott Deitche said Bedami is spot on in this assessment.\n\n\u201cThe Bedami family was not as known as Tampa's Trafficante family, but they were a driving force in the Tampa underworld from its inception up through the 1980s,\u201d Deitche said. \u201cThey seemed to have had a hand in everything.\u201d\n\nBedami's grandfather and namesake, Angelo Bedami Sr., was born in Sicily 1893, and after migrating to Chicago he moved to Tampa to take advantage of illegal gambling opportunities here.\n\nTampa was like the Wild West then, historians say, with speakeasies, brothels and illegal casinos, shootouts over control, and corrupt cops.\n\nAngelo Sr. rose in the ranks, Deitche said, and was brought in for questioning whenever the competition turned up dead.\n\nTwice he was found guilty of crimes connected to illegal gambling but never of murder.\n\nHis son, Joe Bedami, father of Angelo Jr., had a rap sheet, too, including six armed robberies \u2014 some of them the most notorious of the era, Deitche said.\n\nAnd though he was never charged with the crime, Joe was linked to the 1955 murder of Charlie Wall, considered dean of Tampa's underworld. Wall's head was smashed with a baseball bat and his throat cut from ear to ear.\n\n\u201cIf my father unexpectedly visited your house, it was not a social call,\u201d Bedami said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nGangsters paid social calls to the Bedami home, though.\n\nSanto Trafficante, Jr. regularly dined at his home.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather was a like an uncle to Santo Jr.,\u201d Bedami said.\n\nFrankie Carbo, a New York City hit man and boxing promoter, would visit Bedami's father whenever he was in Tampa on business. Sometimes, heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano was in tow.\n\n\u201cCarbo always showed up around two in the morning,\u201d Bedami said. \u201cAnd my mom would have to get up and cook a big meal.\u201d\n\nIn early 1967, Bedami's father was arrested in a Lakeland arson case. A few weeks before trial, he was headed to a friend's barbecue when he disappeared.\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d Bedami said. \u201cMaybe he left town, but chances are he was whacked. I was 16 and on my own.\u201d\n\nOther members of Bedami's family have criminal histories. He has two uncles who were linked to the Tampa mafia and a brother who served time in prison for drug smuggling.\n\nBedami refuses to talk about those relatives. He even changed their names in the book about his life.\n\nThey are all law abiding citizens now, he said.\n\n\u201cBut I'll tell you everything about what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, almost.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Hillsborough High, Bedami spent days working at Seaboard Coastline Railroad as a pipe fitter and nights hustling marijuana.\n\n\u201cThen I started ripping off those hippies,\u201d he said with a chuckle.\n\nBedami and his friends set up fake drug sales to three dealers, he said. As the transaction was being made, Bedami \u2014 wearing a ski mask \u2014 would jump out of hiding, pretend to steal the drugs from his partners then take the money from their victims and flee.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nWith his cut from the robberies, more than $30,000, Bedami bought the old Ponderosa Lounge \u2014 a country bar on the corner of Armenia and Waters avenues, he said.\n\n\u201cIt did good, but you have to be married to that register in that type of business. That's not me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngelo is an adventurer,\u201d said his friend Jerry Blair, who trafficked in drugs with him. \u201cHe needed excitement.\u201d\n\nBedami found his excitement in drug smuggling, but separate from the Mafia establishment.\n\nDeitche said it remains unclear how Bedami managed, without even paying a tribute.\n\nPressed for an answer, he changes the topic.\n\n\u201cHe was more interested in unorganized crime,\u201d Deitche said. \u201cHe was a real wild man who seems like he figured things out as he went. The story of his first big smuggling operation says it all.\u201d\n\nThe cook at Bedami's bar, who was from Colombia, set his boss up with connections there. Bedami's pilot was a regular at the bar. Bedami barely knew either of them.\n\nNor did he know much about the smuggling business.\n\nHe flew to Colombia expecting to pick up 5,000 pounds of marijuana on credit then pay after he sold it. Instead, the suppliers sent his pilot back to Florida \u2014 and kept Bedami as collateral.\n\n\u201cI told my guy he better know what he's doing or pieces of me would show up all over the country,\u201d Bedami said.\n\nThe pilot was supposed to return in a few weeks. It took three months.\n\n\u201cI kept promising that my guy would show up. I had no idea if he really would or if I would live.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nHis seat-of-the-pants approach was also reflected in the way he set up his operation, Blair said.\n\nMany marijuana smugglers in the 1970s would toss sealed bales from boats or airplanes into Florida's waters, and associates in smaller vessels would fish out the \u201csquare grouper.\u201d\n\nBedami went a different route, tapping \u201can associate\u201d with friends working on isolated Florida ranches who would look the other way as airplanes landed and trucks hauled off the South American cargo.\n\nSome planes were stolen. Others were bought from traffickers such as Panama's Noriega.\n\nTwice, pilots crashed the planes purposely into the Gulf of Mexico to destroy the evidence.\n\n\u201cWe acted like cowboys,\u201d Blair said. \u201cAnd we lived like kings.\u201d\n\nBy the time his smuggling ring was broken up in 1983, Bedami and his crew brought in 37 loads of marijuana \u2014 from 1,500 to 15,000 pounds each \u2014 plus a few loads of cocaine from the Medellin Cartel, he said.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Bedami married. He and his wife had a daughter, and Bedami, he said, has stayed on the straight and narrow since.\n\nHe said he didn't want his daughter to experience the pain he felt when his father disappeared.\n\n\u201cAnd I didn't need to go back to that life,\u201d he said. \u201cI did well for myself in things like real estate and sodding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d Blair quipped, \u201che actually never stopped selling grass. The family tradition lives on.\u201d\n\npguzzo@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7606", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 06 Jul 2014 16:50:05 -0400", "Description": "Angelo Bedami, 63, followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father \u2014 two mafia soldiers who instilled fear in Tampa.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Angelo Bedami, 63, followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father \u2014 two mafia soldiers who instilled fear in Tampa.", "title": "Former life of crime reads like movie", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/angelo-bedamis-former-life-in-organized-crime-is-right-out-of-a-hollywood-movie-20140706/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140706/ARTICLE/140709585/EP/1/1/EP-140709585.jpg", "height": 2662}, "updated_time": "2014-07-06T19:19:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Angelo Bedami, 63, followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father \u2014 two mafia soldiers who instilled fear in Tampa.", "title": "Former life of crime reads like movie", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140706/ARTICLE/140709585/AR/0/AR-140709585.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-06T16:50:05Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-06T19:19:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25cd\"", "article_summary": "Then Angelo broke with the family tradition in the late 1980s, walking out of prison after a three-year sentence and away from his life of crime for good.\n\u201cInstead of two, they could make just one about my family,\u201d Bedami said.\n\u201cHe needed excitement.\u201dBedami found his excitement in drug smuggling, but separate from the Mafia establishment.\n\u201cAnd my mom would have to get up and cook a big meal.\u201dIn early 1967, Bedami's father was arrested in a Lakeland arson case.\nI was 16 and on my own.\u201dOther members of Bedami's family have criminal histories."}
