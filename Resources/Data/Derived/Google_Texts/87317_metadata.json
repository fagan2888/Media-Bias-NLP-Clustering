It\u2019s part of an effort to highlight the health law\u2019s provisions allowing kids to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance until age 26 \u2014 and as a reminder that moms are often the ones who make health care decisions for their families. Michelle Obama also plans to do three pro-ACA interviews with radio hosts Yolanda Adams, Al Sharpton and Joe Madison. It\u2019s the latest media blitz, according to a White House official, that has also included high-level interviews with Women\u2019s Day, Parents Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Glamour and others.\n\nSTATES PUSHING BACK JANUARY ENROLLMENT DEADLINES \u2014 It\u2019s not just HealthCare.gov scrambling to smooth things over by the New Year. States running their own enrollment systems are pushing back deadlines for people to enroll in coverage by Jan. 1. Maryland announced yesterday that it would push its deadline back to Dec. 27, just a few days after the Obama administration formalized a plan to set the deadline to Dec. 23 for the 36 states relying on HealthCare.gov. And Rhode Island went further, giving consumers until Dec. 31 to sign up for a plan effective Jan. 1. In each case, the deadline for enrollees to pay their premiums extends into January. Illinois, too, is eyeing a change to the payment deadline. http://politico.pro/1bYVQz7\n\nHappy Wednesday and welcome to PULSE, where we\u2019re wishing a happy birthday to Medicaid Watch \u2014 the Pro Health feature that tracks what the states are up to on the major Obamacare coverage expansion. Any guesses for which states, if any, will flip in the New Year? Send \u2019em to kcheney@politico.com Check out the map as it stands today: http://politico.pro/1keAa5l\n\n\u201cJust a wanderin\u2019 PULSE, I go from town to town.\u201d (h/t Peter Ashkenaz)\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO ENROLLMENT DEADLINE FOR JAN. 1 COVERAGE: 5 days.\n\nMICROSOFT VETERAN TO LEAD HEALTHCARE.GOV REPAIR \u2014 The Obama administration tapped a Microsoft veteran to take over HealthCare.gov oversight, a move that will allow the current overseer, Jeff Zients, to transition to the National Economic Council, which he\u2019ll lead for President Barack Obama. Pro Tech\u2019s Alex Byers reports: \u201c[Kurt] DelBene\u2019s responsibilities over the next several months will cover the full gamut of running a major Web presence, if HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s announcement is any indication. He\u2019ll provide management expertise, oversee the site\u2019s operation and even advise on marketing and communications.\u201d The pick already won high praise from former Microsoft chief Bill Gates. http://politico.pro/1cPjsWY\n\nPULSE SCOOPLET: FINANCE\u2019S CLAPSIS TO CAESAR\u2019S \u2014 Senate Finance Committee staffer Tony Clapsis is departing the Hill for a new job at Caesars Entertainment. He\u2019ll be a vice president and executive associate to CEO Gary Loveman, who has made a name for himself as an innovator of employee wellness programs. \u201cLeaving here is hard. I think this is the greatest job I\u2019m going to have,\u201d Clapsis told PULSE, adding that he\u2019d like to stick around to see SGR repealed. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a 4.5-year run for me. I\u2019ve been looking forward to a new challenge as well.\u201d He started at the Finance Committee in April 2009, just as Chairman Max Baucus was holding the first roundtables on the bill that would become the ACA. Clapsis says he\u2019ll be based in DC but \u201con the road extensively\u201d for the Las Vegas-based company, which might be why he asked for shout-out to his \u201cexceptionally loving and supportive wife, Christine.\u201d\n\nADMINISTRATION PLANNING RESPONSE ON ISSA MEETING ARRANGEMENTS \u2014 The Obama administration says it will respond to a letter today from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa agreeing to a meeting with officials over documents about the security of HealthCare.gov. HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said the website is compliant with federal security standards, pushing back against charges by Issa that the administration failed to warn the public about security problems before the site launched Oct. 1. Documents released to the committee late last week under subpoena show that private contractor MITRE warned of significant data vulnerabilities in the system, Issa said. But Peters said that the website was tested before Oct. 1 and that all security concerns have either been fixed or are part of strategies and plans to get fixed.\n\nHEALTHCARE.GOV SURVEY ON CANCELED PLANS APPEARS, DISAPPEARS \u2014 A survey asking about health insurance policy cancellations briefly appeared today on the Obamacare enrollment website. \u201cHave you recently received a notice from your insurance company saying they\u2019re no longer offering you coverage?\u201d the HealthCare.gov survey read. The survey, which appeared before the page allowing website visitors to create an account, also asked if people currently had insurance or had gone a long time without it. A POLITICO inquiry to CMS shortly before noon wasn\u2019t returned until after the survey was taken off the site just over an hour later. \u201cAs part of our ongoing effort to understand and improve the consumer experience on HealthCare.gov, we will have periodic surveys for users,\u201d said CMS spokesman Aaron Albright in an emailed statement.\n\nNRCC ATTRIBUTES MATHESON RETIREMENT TO OBAMACARE \u2013 Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) may have voted against Obamacare, but the NRCC is convinced that his decision not to run for reelection next year is a signal that the law is going to \u201cbecome a total nightmare for any Democrat running in 2014.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s this bad for him, imagine how bad 2014 will be for the vast majority of Democrats who actually supported ObamaCare from its start,\u201d NRCC Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement.\n\nGLENN CLOSE ON THE HILL \u2013 The actress will visit Capitol Hill this morning to help tout the mental health bill championed by Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Roy Blunt, a version of which was added to the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s SGR legislation last week. It would establish a demonstration program where community mental health providers would offer a broader range of services under Medicaid. Close, whose sister and nephew both have bipolar disorder, has started a foundation to bring attention to mental illness. She also attended a White House conference on mental illness last spring.\n\n** At Philips, our mission is to create a company that makes a difference to you.

It\u2019s a new salvo in an intensifying conversation about the nation\u2019s supply of doctors, and it comes as some states are turning to physician\u2019s assistants and nurse practitioner to help fill gaps in primary care. \u201c[Americans] understand that physicians have the medical expertise necessary to know whether an apparently simple symptom signals a complication of a chronic condition, the onset of a new condition affecting multiple organs, or a short-term and easily treated problem,\u201d said AAFP President Reid Blackwelder, in a statement accompanying the poll. \u201cThey want that expertise for themselves and their loved ones.\u201d The poll of 1,000 adults, conducted from Nov. 8 \u2014 Nov. 15 carries a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. http://bit.ly/18OJfdm\n\nA LOOK AT THE NEW OBAMACARE DICTIONARY \u2013 American Action Forum has a new resource for the acronym-challenged: ACADictionary.com The site is intended as a resource for researchers, journalists and others who need a quick reference to the OED-sized lexicon associated with Obamacare: http://bit.ly/1fk0ibp\n\nPCORI ANNOUNCED $93.5M IN AWARDS \u2014 The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute has awarded $93.5 million for 29 research data networks that together will make up PCORnet, a new nationwide network intended to integrate diverse health information in support of a wide range of study designs for comparative effectiveness research. The awards will fund 11 clinical research networks involving clinics, hospitals and health systems, as well as 18 \u201cpatient-powered\u201d networks of patient groups and their partners to target specific conditions. The institute, which was charged with furthering comparative effectiveness research by the federal health care law, also announced $97.3 million for 53 CER projects. That funding also was announced at a PCORI Board of Governors teleconference today.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE READING, by Jason Millman\n\nConsumers and insurers are still waiting on HHS guidance on a \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d for those who\u2019ve struggled to sign up for coverage, USA Today reports. http://usat.ly/JFPo5Y\n\nWhile the White House billed yesterday\u2019s meeting with tech CEOs as health care-focused, a source familiar with the discussion told CNN that the tech chiefs came to D.C. to talk about surveillance. http://cnn.it/1czBCsg\n\nMinnesota\u2019s exchange board will speak publicly today about former executive director April Todd-Malmlov\u2019s abrupt resignation, the Minnesota Post reports. http://bit.ly/1enskGv\n\nIn Virginia, a special legislative panel is still far apart on whether the state should expand Medicaid, the Associated Press reports. http://wapo.st/1bParMo\n\nThe Massachusetts exchange, going through its own tech struggles, has removed CGI\u2019s eligibility software from its application processing system, the Wall Street Journal writes. http://on.wsj.com/1bP9lQV\n\nConservative columnist Jonah Goldberg wonders at what point insurers, who stand to benefit from the ACA, will revolt against the Obama administration for the bungled rollout. http://lat.ms/1cPYqHy\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s largest insurers aren\u2019t taking the option to renew canceled individual health policies for another year, the Bergen Record reports. http://bit.ly/1caElNN\n\n** At Philips, our mission is to create a company that makes a difference to you.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
