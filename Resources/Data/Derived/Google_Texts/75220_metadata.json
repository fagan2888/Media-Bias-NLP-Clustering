The insects spend most of their lives in water as larvae, he said, and Illinois saw its wettest June on record.\n\nHundreds of dragonflies can be seen whizzing around the lakefront in Chicago, especially in the north-side neighborhoods of Lakeview and Lincoln Park, the Chicago Tribune (http://trib.in/1IitxL1) reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Brian Shustrick of Lakeview, who walks his dog every day near Belmont Harbor.\n\nShustrick said he\u2019s noticed a surge in dragonflies in the past month and sometimes sees 50 to 70 of them at a time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll start with two or three, and then there\u2019s little groups of them,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely after 5 p.m., they\u2019re everywhere.\u201d\n\nDragonflies tend to float around on their own during the day, and hunt together starting at dusk in large, cloudlike groups called feeding swarms, Swinford said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just taking advantage of all those yummy flies and midges,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the neat thing about dragonflies - they don\u2019t sting, they don\u2019t bite, they don\u2019t give off bad odors. They\u2019re really beneficial insects. And definitely our friends.\u201d\n\nDragonflies are aggressive hunters, snacking on mosquitoes and gnats, too, and have had about 300 million years to perfect the process, said Gareth Blakesley, coordinator of the Illinois Odonate Survey, a volunteer group that measures dragonfly density throughout the state.\n\n\u201cDragonflies can be cannibalistic too, so they\u2019re known to eat each other if they\u2019re in the wrong place,\u201d he said.\n\nSince dragonflies are among the fastest flying insects in the world and have large eyes to survey their surroundings, they\u2019re also good at eluding predators like swallows, which have reportedly been spotted more in Chicago as well.\n\nThe dragonfly swarms likely will stick around until the insects begin migrating in the fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's a boom year for dragonflies - and their prey - along Lake Michigan because of record rainfall, according to a wildlife expert.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It\u2019s a boom year for dragonflies - and their prey - along Lake Michigan because of record rainfall, according to a wildlife expert.", "title": "Record rainfall brings swarms of dragonflies to Chicago", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/9/record-rainfall-brings-swarms-of-dragonflies-to-ch/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/0568d95a93f99e237e0f6a7067002b13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/0568d95a93f99e237e0f6a7067002b13.jpg", "description": "It's a boom year for dragonflies - and their prey - along Lake Michigan because of record rainfall, according to a wildlife expert.", "card": "summary", "title": "Record rainfall brings swarms of dragonflies to Chicago"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "CHICAGO (AP) - It\u2019s a boom year for dragonflies - and their prey - along Lake Michigan because of record rainfall, according to a wildlife expert.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the neat thing about dragonflies - they don\u2019t sting, they don\u2019t bite, they don\u2019t give off bad odors.\nHundreds of dragonflies can be seen whizzing around the lakefront in Chicago, especially in the north-side neighborhoods of Lakeview and Lincoln Park, the Chicago Tribune (http://trib.in/1IitxL1) reported.\nTom Swinford, an ecologist with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, believes the dragonflies were drawn by the abundance of water.\nThe insects spend most of their lives in water as larvae, he said, and Illinois saw its wettest June on record."}
