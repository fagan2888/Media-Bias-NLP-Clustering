If he initiates curriculum you don\u2019t want; if he disregards and marginalizes the elected board; if he treats employees badly; or if he nonrenews your one-year contract administrative and professional employee, too bad. You\u2019re stuck. For four years.\n\nElected superintendents politicize the system and the position, whether knowingly or unconsciously. The only realistic \u201ccheck\u201d on their power is the ballot box on an infrequent, four year cycle. Eventually they influence the elections of the very school board members that (allegedly) serve as a check to their ever-increasing power. This accumulation of power accelerates after a second and subsequent term, absent some self-inflicted political catastrophe.\n\nRegardless of how they portray themselves \u2014 the multiterm incumbent, elected superintendent of schools (wielding massive expenditure power and holding the employment fate of so many people in his/her hands yearly) eventually accumulates power that\u2019s practically absolute.\n\nLord Acton famously describes what absolute power does to people; his famous quotation on this subject remains spot-on.\n\nAppointed superintendents, by contrast, are always on the bubble. They can and do concentrate on doing their jobs instead of appeasing special interests to win the next election. They don\u2019t make decisions based upon the \u201celection cycle.\u201d\n\nSchool board members who are elected in staggered cycles every two years can and do hold the appointed superintendent accountable, lest they themselves will be out of a job at the hands of an angry constituency in the next election!\n\nElected school boards can censure, redirect, and/or terminate the appointed superintendent immediately if he/she does not perform or follow school board policy. This model exemplifies maximum accountability for the electorate!\n\nBut neither an appointed nor elected \u201csystem\u201d is a magic bullet that cures all issues in schools. For optimal performance, what\u2019s required is a professional, appointed superintendent of schools working constructively with an elected school board that possesses the intestinal fortitude necessary to hold the superintendent accountable for executing their policy.\n\nEither way, it all starts with the school board.\n\nEvery system requires a school board that is engaged, astute, and committed. Absent this, the elected-versus-appointed question becomes a problem of diminished significance.\n\nYes, more important than whether a superintendent is elected or appointed is whether or not members of a school district\u2019s board are paying attention, actively following the issues, and demanding that superintendents follow school board policy with fidelity.\n\nIf school board members are just going along to get along, providing milk-toast, anemic oversight and no opposition to bad policy and budgetary recommendations \u2014 essentially \u201cmailing it in\u201d \u2014 things won\u2019t ever improve. Under this scenario, either system (elected or appointed) always falls short of the mark for students, parents, teachers and taxpayers.\n\nJeff Bergosh is an Escambia County School Board member.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1TGtaT8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Should we appoint or elect a school superintendent?", "og": {"site_name": "Pensacola News Journal", "description": "Should we appoint or elect a school superintendent?", "title": "Viewpoint: Should we appoint or elect a school superintendent?", "url": "http://www.pnj.com/story/opinion/2015/08/15/viewpoint-appoint-elect-school-superintendent/31779565/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Should we appoint or elect a school superintendent?", "title": "Viewpoint: Should we appoint or elect a school superintendent?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50d379746f903dce69d06fbaf27d994476024251/c=0-45-2398-2443&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Pensacola/Pensacola/635752417416092526-Jeff-Bergosh-2015.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=816200923", "fb": {"app_id": 179056438789435}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Elected school boards can censure, redirect, and/or terminate the appointed superintendent immediately if he/she does not perform or follow school board policy.\nEventually they influence the elections of the very school board members that (allegedly) serve as a check to their ever-increasing power.\nFor optimal performance, what\u2019s required is a professional, appointed superintendent of schools working constructively with an elected school board that possesses the intestinal fortitude necessary to hold the superintendent accountable for executing their policy.\nWhat people don\u2019t realize is that with elected superintendents, once you vote one in, you\u2019re stuck with that person for four years.\nJeff Bergosh is an Escambia County School Board member."}
