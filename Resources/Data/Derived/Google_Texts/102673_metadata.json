The share of income accruing to the top 1 percent increased from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011. The richest 0.1 percent controlled 7 percent of the wealth in 1979 and 22 percent of the wealth in 2012. Meanwhile, there are a number of studies out there showing that the most effective way to reduce this inequality would be higher taxes on income and wealth, but the rich won\u2019t let it happen.\n\nConsider also this: The rise of income inequality and wealth inequality are intimately connected, and causes all sorts of problem over the long term. As Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman write,\n\nIncome inequality has a snowballing effect on the wealth distribution: top incomes are being saved at high rates, pushing wealth concentration up; in turn, rising wealth inequality leads to rising capital income concentration,which contributes to further increasing top income and wealth shares.\n\nThat is, income is a flow, which quickly becomes a stock. The rich make enough money to save; in contrast middle-class and low-income workers don\u2019t have enough money to live, so they are increasingly burdened by debt. They can\u2019t build up wealth, which means they are deprived of opportunity. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of wealth on the top and debt on the bottom.\n\nIn a comedy bit on wealth, Chris Rock claims, \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of wealth.\u201d The empirical research on the question largely supports his assertion. In \u201cThe Son Also Rises,\u201d Gregory Clark finds that wealth remains in a family for 10-to-15 generations and notes,\n\nGroups that seem to persist in low or high status, such as the black and the Jewish populations in the United States, are not exceptions to a general rule of higher intergenerational mobility. They are experiencing the same universal rates of slow intergenerational mobility as the rest of the population.\n\nBut, of course wealth and income inequality weren\u2019t always as bad as they are today. What happened? In a word: cheating. Although many people try to explain rising inequality away by arguing we live in a winner-take-all economy or that inequality is the result of skill-biased technological change, these arguments are bunk. Inequality has been driven by public policy choices that favored the rich, the decline of unions and the rise of finance. As the chart below shows, tax rates on both income and inheritance were high during the relatively equal \u201960s, \u201970s and \u201980s and then fell dramatically paving the way for the inequality we see today (Chart Source).\n\nThe best way to reduce inequality would be to tax income and wealth. While conservatives often claim that this would reduce economic growth, such claims have very little economic support. For instance, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva find no correlation between economic growth and tax cuts. Because of this, they find, \u201cthe top tax rate could potentially be set as high as 83%.\u201d (Chart Source)", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time to take take America's wealthiest down a peg \u2014 but how?", "title": "Why income inequality is America\u2019s biggest (and most difficult) problem", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's time to take take America's wealthiest down a peg \u2014 but how?", "title": "Why income inequality is America\u2019s biggest (and most difficult) problem", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/26/why_income_inequality_is_americas_biggest_and_most_difficult_problem/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/donald_trump_grin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's time to take take America's wealthiest down a peg \u2014 but how?", "title": "Why income inequality is America\u2019s biggest (and most difficult) problem", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/donald_trump_grin.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, elections, Income inequality, Tax reform, Taxes, Thomas Piketty, Wealth inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b65\"", "article_summary": "Consider also this: The rise of income inequality and wealth inequality are intimately connected, and causes all sorts of problem over the long term.\nTopics: elections, Income inequality, Tax reform, Taxes, Thomas Piketty, Wealth inequality, News, Politics NewsBold prediction: Rising inequality of income and wealth will be the most important political battleground over the next few decades.\nBut, of course wealth and income inequality weren\u2019t always as bad as they are today.\nThe best way to reduce inequality would be to tax income and wealth.\nAlthough many people try to explain rising inequality away by arguing we live in a winner-take-all economy or that inequality is the result of skill-biased technological change, these arguments are bunk."}
