The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not track buprenorphine deaths, most medical examiners do not routinely test for it, and neither do most emergency rooms, prisons, jails and drug courts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying the emergence of potential drug problems in this country for over 30 years,\u201d said Eric Wish, the director of the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland. \u201cThis is the first drug that nobody seems to want to know about as a potential problem.\u201d\n\nThe government has a vested interest in its success.\n\nThe treatment is the fruit of an extraordinary public-private partnership between a British company and the American government, which financed clinical trials and awarded protection from competition after the drug\u2019s patent expired.\n\nThe company, now a consumer goods giant called Reckitt Benckiser, hired several federal officials who had shepherded the drug, and it has financially supported many of the scientists and doctors who are studying it and advocating its use. But over the last few years, the company\u2019s aggressive campaign to protect its lucrative franchise has alienated some of its customers and allies.\n\nIn an 11th-hour bid to thwart generic competition and dominate the market with its patent-protected Suboxone filmstrip, the company sought to convince regulators that the tablet form, which earned it billions of dollars, now presented a deadly risk to children as packaged in pill bottles.\n\nThe F.D.A. did not agree. Early this year, it approved generic tablets and asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate potentially anticompetitive business practices by the company.\n\nReckitt Benckiser defended its advocacy for the Suboxone filmstrip \u2014 now its only pharmaceutical product \u2014 saying its research showed that the film was safer than the tablets, kept addicts in treatment longer and had less of a street presence. It added that it was overseeing an F.D.A.-required \u201crisk evaluation and mitigation strategy to promote the appropriate use of buprenorphine with the goal to minimize the misuse, abuse and multidose unintentional exposure of these products.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nDr. John Mendelson of San Francisco, a consultant for the company, said it could be proud of its management of a difficult product. \u201cTheir biggest success so far,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the whole system has not imploded, that enough doctors have prescribed the drug appropriately that there has been no move to withdraw it from the market.\u201d\n\nRonni Katz, a health official in Portland, Me., is less impressed.\n\n\u201cI remember the early days when we met with the pharma rep in the area \u2014 I don\u2019t think he was trying to mislead us \u2014 he truly believed it was a miracle drug,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they way underestimated the potential for abuse, which means to me they really don\u2019t understand addiction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSkeptics and Believers\n\nNearly a half-century ago, buprenorphine was born in the laboratory of an English company specializing in mustard and shoe polish, where chemists were competing to invent a less addictive painkiller.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to beat morphine, not methadone,\u201d said John W. Lewis, 81, who oversaw the drug\u2019s development.\n\nThough far more potent than morphine, buprenorphine appeared in animal tests to be unusually safe even in very high doses. In 1971, Dr. Lewis and colleagues traveled to an infirmary in Glasgow to conduct the first human tests \u2014 on themselves.\n\nBuprenorphine made Dr. Lewis violently ill. \u201cIt quite took the edge off our stay in a splendid hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond,\u201d he said in a speech, and it exposed the painkiller\u2019s \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe rather high incidence of nausea and vomiting.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Dr. Lewis began shipping the drug to the United States Narcotic Farm in Lexington, Ky., to test its abuse potential on detoxified addicts. A prison that doubled as a treatment hospital, the farm was home to the government\u2019s Addiction Research Center (and at times to jazz greats like Chet Baker, Elvin Jones and Sonny Rollins).\n\nWith opposition to human research mounting, buprenorphine would be the last drug tested there; government scientists justified the research by arguing that the painkiller also had the potential to treat addiction.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: The Lexingtonians were against methadone,\u201d said Nancy Campbell, a historian of drug policy. \u201cThey felt like addicts liked it too much, and it had overdose potential. They never thought abstinence and \u2018Just Say No\u2019 would work with this population. So they were eager to find an alternative.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe idea of using opioid substitutes to treat opioid dependence is based on the premise that long-term drug use profoundly alters the brain, that the craving, seeking and taking of opioids is a \u201cbio-behavioral\u201d compulsion. While addiction is considered a chronic, relapsing disease, experts believe that replacing illegal drugs with legal ones, needles with pills or liquids and more dangerous opioids with safer ones reduces the harm to addicts and to society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike heroin, buprenorphine attaches to the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, but it does not plug in as completely. It is slower acting and longer lasting, attenuating the rush of sensation and eliminating the plummets afterward. Addicts develop a tolerance to its euphoric effects and describe themselves as normalized by it, their cravings satisfied. It also diminishes the effects of other opioids but, studies have shown, does not entirely block them, even at the highest recommended doses.\n\nA devoted cadre of government scientists saw buprenorphine as a \u201choly grail\u201d and over the next few decades \u201cfloated in between the public and private sector for most of their careers,\u201d Dr. Campbell said. The farm\u2019s pharmacist would become an executive vice president of Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, for example, and the company would contract with the former National Institute on Drug Abuse director who originally promoted the public-private partnership.\n\nIt was a collaboration that the company, whose brand names include Lysol, resisted for a long time, said Charles O\u2019Keeffe, a former White House drug policy official who incorporated Reckitt in the United States.\n\n\u201cThey were grocers,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, I went to the board and said, \u2018It\u2019s for the social good.\u2019 Ultimately, they relented but said, \u2018Just don\u2019t spend a lot of money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe did not have to. The federal drug abuse institute financed the two big clinical trials necessary to win F.D.A. approval for $28 million and later spent an additional $52.4 million for studies at its clinical research sites. At least $19 million more in studies are underway.\n\nFurther, the F.D.A. granted the company a seven-year monopoly based on its claim that it would never recoup its development costs. (Reckitt now has a market value of $56.7 billion; 21 percent of its operating profits last year came from Suboxone.)\n\nStill, hurdles had to be cleared.\n\nFirst, Mr. O\u2019Keeffe said, \u201cWe had to change the law because it would have been illegal.\u201d\n\nThe Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, as interpreted, prohibited doctors from prescribing narcotics to narcotics addicts \u201cto maintain their addictions.\u201d In the 1970s, methadone treatment was authorized but limited to clinics where the drug was dispensed, usually daily.\n\nVideo\n\nThe original advocates of buprenorphine, though, wanted to make addiction treatment mainstream rather than segregate addicts in clinics that became lightning rods for community opposition. They wanted doctors in offices to prescribe it, just like any other take-home medication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo Mr. O\u2019Keeffe found \u201cinfluential members of Congress interested in doing this\u201d: Senators Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, with support from Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. In the end, because of law enforcement concerns, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 included unique prescribing restrictions: that doctors seek federal permission, get eight hours of training, accept a 30-patient limit and attest to their ability to make counseling referrals.\n\nThe concerns grew from other countries\u2019 experiences with buprenorphine treatment over the previous decade; successes had been accompanied by abuses. So F.D.A. officials insisted on the addition of an \u201cabuse deterrent\u201d \u2014 naloxone. If addicts crushed and injected the tablets, the naloxone would precipitate excruciating withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration was skeptical, saying studies showed that naloxone did not provoke \u201cany evidence of withdrawal\u201d in \u201ca substantial percentage\u201d of opiate abusers, and that the amount in the proposed compound would produce only a half-hour of \u201cunpleasantness\u201d in those susceptible.\n\nSkeptical, too, were buprenorphine\u2019s original champions at Reckitt, who would have preferred a different additive or more naloxone. \u201cIt was not a perfect solution,\u201d Dr. Lewis said.\n\nEven so, Suboxone \u2014 four parts buprenorphine, one part naloxone \u2014 was created. And in late 2002, along with Subutex (plain buprenorphine), it was approved by the F.D.A. just as its target audience was about to expand unexpectedly.\n\nAn estimated 2.5 million Americans were dependent on or abused opioids last year, mostly painkillers, although heroin dependence has skyrocketed, with the number of addicts doubling over a decade to 467,000, government data indicate. In 2010, the last year studied, 19,154 people died of opioid overdoses.\n\n\u201cHad buprenorphine never been released and all we had was methadone, that number would be much higher,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarly Successes\n\nIn the early days of Suboxone, with Reckitt Benckiser barely marketing its own drug, Dr. Kolodny, then a New York City health official, crisscrossed the city with colleagues to spread the word about the new medication, entice public hospitals to try it with $10,000 rewards and urge doctors to get certified.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe had New York City staff out there acting like drug reps,\u201d Dr. Kolodny said.\n\nHe himself became a prescriber. \u201cAll of a sudden, I started getting calls from white kids on Long Island who were all addicted to pain pills,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was 2003 or 2004, and my first experience of the painkiller epidemic.\u201d\n\nA psychiatrist accustomed to the slow, subtle effects of antidepressants and mood stabilizers, Dr. Kolodny was stunned by patients who arrived \u201ca total mess\u201d and in days seemed \u201cback to normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, this cures all addictions,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Jeffrey T. Junig of Wisconsin experienced a similar revelation. He was concerned that buprenorphine would create \u201call these dry drunks, people who were no longer using but who hadn\u2019t addressed their defects.\u201d Instead, he witnessed something different: \u201cThe process of craving opioids itself causes people to be so one-dimensional that it is a defect itself. Freed from the obsession to use, people change.\u201d\n\nBuprenorphine worked so well on his first patients, middle-aged painkiller addicts, that \u201cthey would have tears rolling down their faces talking about how grateful they were,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong them was Shawn Schneider, who had found his way to Dr. Junig after swallowing 400 milligrams of Ambien, thinking, \u201cIf I wake up, I wake up; if I die, I die.\u201d\n\nLike Mr. Schneider, dozens of addicts interviewed portrayed themselves as exhausted and frightened before they started on Suboxone. They acknowledged having \u201cloved\u201d their chosen opiate but not what turned into a miserable existence dominated by drug-seeking to avoid \u201cdope sickness.\u201d\n\nTravis Norton, 33, gravitated to heroin in adolescence as a result of a misguided infatuation with artist addicts like William S. Burroughs and Kurt Cobain, he said. For years, he cycled through costly abstinence-based programs, always returning to the needle.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was a chronic relapse,\u201d said Mr. Norton, who is now an addiction counselor in a Minneapolis suburb. \u201cI was a wreck until I started maintenance therapy in 2003. And I\u2019ve been great since.\u201d\n\nMr. Norton switched for a time to methadone when his Suboxone doctor retired. At that point, Suboxone, around $16 for an average daily dose, was considered \u201cthe rich man\u2019s methadone.\u201d Mr. Norton, not rich but a college-educated professional, found the methadone clinic \u201ca ball and a chain.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI had to travel for my job, and there was zero flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had thousands of clients, and I was a number.\u201d\n\nDr. Edwin A. Salsitz of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, who has been treating addiction for decades, said that in the pre-Suboxone universe, he encountered all too many middle-class addicts who refused to set foot in a clinic.\n\n\u201cAnd then sometimes, a couple of years later, they\u2019d be H.I.V. positive, or something more catastrophic would have occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to explain what this meant to the addiction field to have another option besides the clinics.\u201d\n\nReckitt Benckiser gradually built a stable of doctors paid to advocate use of the treatment, Dr. Salsitz among them.\n\nThe recruiting was tough. Those outside the addiction field were reluctant to deal with the hassles of certification, potential visits by the D.E.A. and the addicts themselves. Within the field, buprenorphine faced stiff opposition from the methadone industry as well as traditional rehabilitation programs and the Alcoholics Anonymous movement, which promotes abstinence.\n\n\u201cWith Suboxone, there is a lot of misinformation out there, and the most common is you\u2019ve replaced one drug with another,\u201d said Melissa Iverson, a 48-year-old social worker who lives in Florida and is now on disability because of fibromyalgia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Iverson first requested anonymity, like most other professionals interviewed, some of whom have never acknowledged their problem to their families, primary care physicians or even insurers. Eventually she decided to \u201ccome out of the closet,\u201d saying, \u201cThe stigma needs to be tackled by real people with real names, or else it will haunt us forever.\u201d\n\nRelying on ever-escalating doses of painkillers to cope with her chronic pain, she had gone \u201ccrazy out of control.\u201d Her life revolved around pills; she would pass out smoking in bed and wake up with burns on her hands or get into car accidents and nod out in the tow truck. Four years ago, she had \u201ca psychotic break,\u201d ended up hospitalized and \u201ccame out on Suboxone.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to her painkiller use, she has taken Suboxone at increasingly lower doses, finding that it alleviates her pain without \u201cthose self-destructive behaviors.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAs an addict, I was high all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Suboxone, I developed a tolerance within a week. There\u2019s zero euphoria.\u201d\n\nSuccesses like hers multiplied until demand outstripped supply because of the limited number of doctors and the patient cap. This brought some unintended consequences.\n\nFirst, some prescribers pushed patients off the medication prematurely to replace them with new patients because the early treatment phase was more lucrative. Second, patients began sharing the drug, trading it and selling it. Buprenorphine trickled out onto the street.\n\nHealth officials, concerned about restricted access, lobbied alongside Reckitt Benckiser for the patient cap to be raised. \u201cWhy should we bind a healer\u2019s hands from helping as many as he or she could?\u201d Senator Hatch said, getting an amendment passed in 2006 that allowed doctors, on request, to go from 30 to 100 patients after a year.\n\nThe stage was set for more patients, prescriptions and problems. \u201cIt\u2019s when the limit was raised from 30 that doctors started to get commercial about it,\u201d said Dr. Art Van Zee, whose buprenorphine program at a federally funded community health center in rural Virginia is surrounded by for-profit clinics where doctors charge $100 for weekly visits, pulling in, he estimated, about $500,000 a year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are not savvy about addiction medicine, don\u2019t follow patients very closely, don\u2019t do urine testing and overprescribe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how buprenorphine became a street drug in our area.\u201d\n\nTroubled Histories\n\nIn Fond du Lac, Wis., on the shores of Lake Winnebago, addicts come and go from a bland building housing a medical office, a cheese business and a title company. They bring their tumultuous lives into a tranquil space with hunter green walls, heathered carpet and easy-listening music, presided over by Dr. Junig\u2019s wife, Nancy, candy jar by her side.\n\nFond du Lac Psychiatry is the kind of setting the original idealists envisioned. They did not foresee the buprenorphine mega-clinics that resemble and frequently double as painkiller pill mills, sometimes with armed guards to protect their cash.\n\nThey did not foresee a buprenorphine empire like the one Dr. Thomas E. Radecki, 67, built in northwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to the evidence presented to a grand jury this summer, Dr. Radecki operated four clinics under the business name Doctors and Lawyers for a Drug-Free Youth, serving 1,000 people, many of whom did not need or use buprenorphine and resold it in their neighborhoods. To override the patient limit, he employed other doctors part time. He sold the drug directly to patients, which is legal, and was the country\u2019s largest individual buyer of buprenorphine in the first half of last year, according to investigators. The previous year, he netted $280,000 in profits from the tablets alone, they said.\n\nIn August, the Pennsylvania attorney general announced Dr. Radecki\u2019s arrest on charges of improper prescribing and trading addiction drugs for sex. His lawyer, John Froese, said Dr. Radecki \u201cdenies that he ever prescribed any medicine that was not helpful to his patients\u201d or had sexual relationships with his buprenorphine patients.\n\nDr. Radecki lost his Illinois license for just such a relationship, and his Pennsylvania license was made probationary in 2007. Nonetheless, the federal government subsequently authorized him to prescribe buprenorphine and then expand his patient load.\n\n\u201cVery few if any\u201d doctors are denied permission unless they are \u201cunder investigation or something pops up,\u201d said Rusty Payne, a D.E.A. spokesman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Times analyzed the disciplinary records of the doctors on the federal government\u2019s online listing of buprenorphine providers, which is not comprehensive because doctors can opt out, and calculated state-by-state disciplinary rates.\n\nIn 30 of the 31 states that provided their overall disciplinary rates for comparison, buprenorphine doctors are far more likely to have been sanctioned than doctors over all. In Florida and Kentucky, they are four times as likely to have been sanctioned. In New York, they are six times as likely; in Arizona, seven times; in Minnesota, nine times; and in Louisiana, 10 times.\n\nRates are even higher for the subset certified to treat the maximum patient load, The Times found in analyzing records from a sampling of states.\n\nIn Ohio, nearly 17 percent have disciplinary records, compared with 1.6 percent of all doctors. They include individuals sanctioned for: amphetamine addiction coupled with a Medicaid-fraud conviction; conducting an \u201cexcessive number of invasive procedures\u201d; smuggling steroids from Mexico; engaging in conversations regarding a \u201cmurder for hire\u201d and neglecting to report the rape of a pediatric patient; \u201cdigitally penetrating\u201d patients and having sexual intercourse with them in the office.\n\nSome were reprimanded or placed on probation before becoming Suboxone doctors; others, stripped of their licenses recently, had their offices shuttered.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis adds to the volatility of the treatment culture.\n\nA 30-year-old Michigan woman said she was invited into treatment by a doctor who frequented the strip club where she was a bartender and who paid for her medication for several months. When he was placed on probation for \u201cviolation of duty/negligence\u201d unrelated to her, she switched to a second doctor, who also got in trouble. After that, the woman bought her buprenorphine on the street for a year \u2014 saving $5,500 in medical and counseling fees, she noted \u2014 until she found an addiction specialist with an opening.\n\nIn some areas, like New York City, there is almost a glut of buprenorphine prescribers. In others, specialists routinely turn away addicts begging for help.\n\nNon-specialists pick up the slack.\n\nReckitt Benckiser recruited \u201cany doctor willing,\u201d said one former company drug representative who asked not to be identified to protect her career. Those in her territory ranged from \u201cextremely passionate\u201d to intensely commercial, she said: \u201cOne charged a $50 co-pay, and another $500 for an initial visit. I had a few physicians using the medication themselves. One guy was so enthusiastic I signed him up as a treatment advocate, but then it turned out he relapsed and lost his license.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust because doctors have disciplinary histories does not mean that they are unscrupulous. Some of the most knowledgeable, compassionate addiction doctors are former addicts themselves, with medical board actions on their records that sometimes limit their career options.\n\nDr. Junig, 53, is an anesthesiologist with a doctorate in neurochemistry who retrained as a psychiatrist after his own recovery from addiction. He did not intend to become a buprenorphine doctor.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I was just trying to build a practice,\u201d he said.\n\nNor did he intend to become a buprenorphine blogger or the host of an online conversation about the drug through his website Suboxone Forum, which gets 30,000 visits weekly, and a LinkedIn group with nearly 800 professional members. It grew from his initial passion for the treatment \u2014 a passion that got him hired briefly as a \u201ctreatment facilitator\u201d for Reckitt Benckiser and also got him in trouble.\n\nIn 2011, the Wisconsin medical board reprimanded him for using \u201ctele-psychiatry\u201d to treat five out-of-state addicts he had seen only over Skype.\n\nOver time, Dr. Junig said, he moved \u201cfrom skeptic to true believer to skeptic.\u201d Others similarly modulated their enthusiasm as they gained a nuanced appreciation of the difficulties of managing a complex patient population and a medication that had become a rampant street drug.\n\nSome patients stopped and started their medication so they could still use other opiates or mixed it dangerously with drugs like Xanax. Appointments were missed, prescriptions \u201clost.\u201d Patients cheated, dropped out and relapsed, sometimes fatally.\n\nPhoto\n\nJoseph McMahon IV, a gregarious, troubled New Yorker, was prescribed a couple of thousand Suboxone pills over nearly three years. Still, he overdosed on other drugs at least five times and at 25 died of one final overdose in December 2011, turning his father, a retired New York City fire lieutenant, into a bereft chronicler of Suboxone abuse.\n\n\u201cMy son swore Suboxone was working for him,\u201d Joseph McMahon III said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m an alcoholic and you switch my Budweiser for a Bud Lite, sure, I\u2019m doing great. They call Suboxone \u2018heroin in a pill.\u2019 It makes tons of money for the pharmaceutical industry, which has us totally bamboozled, and for these doctors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Dr. Junig, early positive experiences with older patients have been offset by rocky ones with a new generation of heroin and \u201cpoly-drug\u201d abusers.\n\nLast spring, he prepared to confront a 26-year-old patient who had landed in an emergency room with an arm infected from injecting cocaine. The man had tried to hide his cocaine use by presenting a specimen of \u201cold urine\u201d to Dr. Junig, who said, \u201cI\u2019m an inch from kicking him out, but I think he\u2019ll die if I do.\u201d\n\nThe patient, a mechanic with a young daughter, said he had \u201cslipped up\u201d during a period of homelessness. \u201cIt was just cocaine,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even really like cocaine. I wanted to tell you so bad, man. But if I lose the Suboxone, I\u2019ll go back to the heroin and the pills, and then I\u2019ll be in real trouble.\u201d\n\nDr. Junig told the mechanic he would be summoned for surprise testing.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me most are the needles,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cBut people die from cocaine, you know. What you were doing \u2014 there\u2019s a genuine risk. If you get busted for cocaine, you could end up in a situation where social services are involved. People lose their kids.\u201d\n\nAn Escalating Problem\n\nIn late 2009, a discovery made in a Walgreens in Michigan lit up the forums where recovering addicts chat: \u201cGeneric bupe!\u201d\n\nThe F.D.A. had just approved generic Subutex, buprenorphine without the abuse deterrent, despite Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s effort to prevent it. It was, according to that post, about one-third the cost of brand-name Suboxone.\n\nFor the previous six years, Reckitt Benckiser, with the government\u2019s support, had successfully discouraged Subutex except in special circumstances. Doctors and insurers, told that Suboxone was safer, had favored it.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut then Suboxone itself ended up being diverted, misused and abused by injection, indicating that the safeguard was not foolproof, although Reckitt says it stands by it. So when uninsured patients clamored for the cheaper generic, some doctors, including Dr. Kolodny, started accommodating them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt first, I did believe the marketing that there was a booby trap in there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my impression is that it doesn\u2019t work as well as promised as an abuse deterrent.\u201d\n\nThe most recent data signal an escalating problem with buprenorphine.\n\nLast year, forensic laboratories identified 10,804 drug seizures as buprenorphine, up eightfold from 2006.\n\nIn 2011, emergency room visits for the nonmedical use of buprenorphine were estimated at 21,483, nearly five times what they were in 2006. Also in 2011, poison centers recorded 3,625 cases of toxic buprenorphine exposure, nearly five times as high as the previous year.\n\nMore young children were hospitalized because of accidental ingestion of buprenorphine than for any other medication in 2010 and 2011, a federal study found. Another study, financed by Reckitt, of 2,380 buprenorphine overdoses in young children found that 587 had to be hospitalized in intensive care units and that four died.\n\nJohn Burke, the president of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators, said buprenorphine remains \u201cdown on the totem pole\u201d of worrisome prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say buprenorphine is not a serious problem; it\u2019s a product for addicts, so the propensity for diversion is probably much higher than with the other prescription drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut oxycodone, hydrocodone, Xanax \u2014 those make up the bulk of the problem.\u201d\n\nEven so, many local authorities say buprenorphine is their nemesis.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here in Delta County is really troubling,\u201d said Steven C. Parks, a prosecuting attorney in Michigan. \u201cArrest after arrest of people who are possessing or abusing Suboxone, who don\u2019t have a prescription for it, who are shooting it up and who are snorting it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what has followed the oxycodone and the hydrocodone trends here,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have heroin yet.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Parks said a big local pharmacy had stopped stocking the medication because its employees felt \u201cvery threatened.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPharmacy robberies for Suboxone alone are rare, but they do happen.\n\nIn June, Michelle Wilcox, 27, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and surgical gloves, handed a Maine pharmacy technician a note: \u201cGive me all the 8 mg Subs you have. I have a weapon and I will use it.\u201d She walked out with 84 doses of Suboxone \u2014 worth about $640 \u2014 and drove off in a pickup truck, only to be arrested within hours, according to documents and interviews.\n\n\u201cShe was just desperate,\u201d said Sheriff Scott Nichols of Franklin County, Me. \u201cShe said her own medication had been stolen.\u201d\n\nMs. Wilcox awaits sentencing after pleading guilty to felony robbery charges in federal court.\n\nIn Maine, Ms. Katz, the Portland health official, described a seemingly unstoppable flow of Suboxone onto the streets in recent years, with addicts injecting it. Shawn Verrill, serving time for Miles Malone\u2019s death from buprenorphine, said he used to sell the drug in York Beach to supplement his income as a lobster deliveryman.\n\n\u201cEvery kid on the beach was looking for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe high lasts all day.\u201d\n\nMr. Verrill said he bought cases of \u201cstop signs\u201d from a pharmacist and charged $10 to $12 for each orange hexagonal Suboxone tablet, earning $4,500 in a good month.\n\nMost buprenorphine advocates interviewed said they believed that deaths were extremely rare. But Suboxone and Subutex were considered the \u201cprimary suspect\u201d in 690 deaths \u2014 420 in the United States \u2014 reported to the F.D.A. from spring 2003 through September.\n\nThis pales in comparison with the 2,826 deaths from methadone reported to the F.D.A. over roughly the same period, as calculated by AdverseEvents, a company that analyzes data on drug side effects. C.D.C. data, drawn from death certificates, makes it clear that number is a serious undercount. The C.D.C. does not track buprenorphine deaths, which may also be undercounted.\n\nThe F.D.A. information, which is spare, does show that more than half the American buprenorphine deaths involved other substances and that only two of 224 cases specifying \u201croute of administration\u201d indicated injection \u2014 the primary concern of regulators.\n\nFifty deaths are listed as suicides, and 69 involve unintentional overdoses, drug abuse or drug misuse. Thirty were fetal or infant deaths after exposure in the womb.\n\nPhoto\n\nOutside the United States, 118 of the 270 deaths reported were in Sweden. Last year, Sweden\u2019s National Board of Forensic Medicine published an analysis of 100 autopsies where buprenorphine had been detected. In two-thirds, it was the direct cause of death, mostly in combination with other drugs. Swedish researchers attributed the \u201cfatal intoxication\u201d to low tolerance because of first-time use or a period of abstinence.\n\nThe F.D.A. cautions against assuming that a \u201cprimary suspect\u201d drug was indeed a cause of death.\n\nBut Brian M. Overstreet, the president of AdverseEvents, said, \u201cThe reality is that hundreds of thousands of cases are reported every year by front-line health care providers who purposefully identify a drug as being the primary suspect cause of a specific adverse event.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the link between drug and event,\u201d he continued, \u201cis quite real.\u201d\n\nA Death Lingers\n\nMr. Malone\u2019s death remains hauntingly real for his family.\n\nIn July, his mother told a federal judge: \u201cI try very hard to forget the last time that I saw him at his wake. He wasn\u2019t smiling at me. He didn\u2019t hug me. I touched his hand, and he didn\u2019t touch me back.\u201d\n\nMr. Verrill pleaded guilty to the distribution of buprenorphine resulting in death. \u201cI feel guilty,\u201d he said in the recent interview, wearing prison khaki, his arms inked with the saying, \u201cWhat goes around comes around.\u201d\n\nThey were friends who had met on the beach.\n\nOn the evening of Oct. 12, 2010, Mr. Malone dropped by Mr. Verrill\u2019s garage apartment with a mutual friend. He appeared \u201chigh but not wasted,\u201d Mr. Verrill said, although a convenience store clerk had called the police saying Mr. Malone had seemed worryingly intoxicated.\n\nAll three young men did drugs. Mr. Verrill and the friend snorted Suboxone and swallowed some tranquilizers. Mr. Malone took only Suboxone, two tablets under his tongue, Mr. Verrill said. Then they smoked marijuana, listened to country music and played video games.\n\nMr. Verrill said he covered Mr. Malone with a blanket when he himself went to bed, thinking he was just sleeping.\n\nMaine\u2019s medical examiner said Mr. Malone died of buprenorphine toxicity. Traces of marijuana, but no alcohol or other drugs, were found in his system; the level of buprenorphine, though, was high for just two pills.\n\nPhoto\n\nBefore being taken into federal custody, Mr. Verrill served time at a county jail on other charges. Suboxone was everywhere, he said, with detainees paying $20 for a quarter-strip that, transformed with water into a crushable pill for snorting, was enough to \u201crock\u201d two people whose systems were clean of drugs.\n\n\u201cPeople were beating each other up and taking their commissary food to sell it and buy Suboxone,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to the federal prison, he added: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen here. I\u2019m clean now. If I hadn\u2019t been arrested for Miles\u2019s death, I\u2019d probably be dead myself.\u201d\n\nCompetition on the Shelves\n\nOver the years, Reckitt Benckiser started acting more like a pharmaceutical company. It built its Suboxone sales force to about 200; flew members to Italy, Mexico and Spain for motivational meetings; and paid 400 to 500 doctors as advocates, former employees said. It lobbied for influence, the only \u201ccorporate round table\u201d member to pay at least $100,000 in dues to the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\n\nAfter losing its exclusive right to sell buprenorphine in 2009, the company used the drug\u2019s problems to its advantage. Moving aggressively to protect its franchise, it fought the increased prescribing of generic buprenorphine, or Subutex, by telling doctors they would be responsible for worsening diversion and abuse.\n\n\u201cWe had lists of the Subutex writers, and we were actively targeting them,\u201d a former employee said.\n\nEven so, over all, Subutex prescribing increased more than tenfold the first year the generic version was sold. Since it was only a matter of time before generic Suboxone would be developed, too, the company began to argue that the black market and the pediatric poisonings demanded a new formulation.\n\nThat formulation was the filmstrip, individually wrapped with a traceable bar code, which the company believed would be patent protected until 2023.\n\nIts release was delayed by F.D.A. concerns that challenged the company\u2019s rationale for creating it. First, officials predicted \u201csignificant abuse and diversion,\u201d noting that 6,000 Suboxone filmstrips went missing during clinical trials.\n\nPhoto\n\nSecond, they worried that the film might be more dangerous to children because it could not be easily spit out. The individual wrappers would not help if, once opened, each dose was divided, as is common, the F.D.A. said. It demanded better labeling and a patient-counseling plan.\n\nOnce the film was approved in 2010, Reckitt Benckiser directed its sales force to discourage the use of the tablet by arguing that its packaging made it hazardous to children \u2014 \u201cfear-based messaging,\u201d one former employee called it; \u201cselling against our own medication,\u201d another said.\n\nFrom that point, the company\u2019s representatives earned bonuses only for Suboxone film. If they did not reach a target \u201cfilm market-share penetration\u201d in their territory, they risked being dismissed, as personnel records in an employment-related lawsuit show.\n\nThe company lured patients directly by offering discounts for the film while raising the price of its tablets. It used rebates to persuade public insurers to give preference to the film. At least 15 state Medicaid agencies do; West Virginia even passed a law banning the pills and requiring the film.\n\nIn September 2012, Reckitt Benckiser, calling it \u201ca moral obligation,\u201d announced that it would withdraw its Suboxone tablets from the market \u2014 in six months \u2014 because of \u201cincreasing concerns with pediatric exposure.\u201d It effectively asked the F.D.A. to block generic tablets for the same reason, citing a company-financed study that indicated the film was far safer.\n\nThe F.D.A. disagreed and approved generic Suboxone tablets early this year.\n\nSince then, Reckitt\u2019s Suboxone journey has become bumpier. It is battling antitrust lawsuits by a dozen drug wholesalers and insurers who say the company \u201cschemed\u201d to extend its monopoly, overcharging them and, more broadly, the health care system.\n\nIn July, Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s stock suffered its biggest one-day loss in two years after CVS Caremark announced that it would drop the film from its preferred drug list in favor of tablets. And there is a new brand on the shelves, too: Zubsolv, which its manufacturer, Orexo, says has \u201chigher bioavailability, faster dissolve time and smaller tablet size with a new menthol taste.\u201d Orexo\u2019s United States medical director is Dr. Gitlow, the addiction medical society president.\n\nIn the third quarter of this year, Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s net revenues from Suboxone declined 14 percent from the same period last year, which the company attributes to its discontinuation of the tablets. The company recently announced that it was \u201creviewing all options\u201d for its pharmaceutical unit, which includes the possibility that it will sell, bringing its profitable foray into the drug business to a close.\n\nDr. Robert L. DuPont, the first director of the national drug abuse institute, said he marveled at the cutthroat business competition when \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get pharma companies to even think about addiction treatment before this $1.5 billion drug got their attention.\u201d\n\nAt a recent meeting of the addiction medicine society, \u201cthe buprenorphine sessions were all packed with doctors who wanted to get in on the gold rush,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me like they are repeating the experience of pain doctors in terms of reckless disregard of the nonmedical use of the drug.\u201d\n\nThe system could well be at a turning point, with more drug options, lower prices and expanded insurance coverage under the new health care law and an \u201caddiction equity\u201d mandate. In addition, with a recent regulation change, for-profit addiction companies that run methadone clinics are expanding their buprenorphine programs, which have no patient limits, and some state governments are pressing federally funded health centers to increase nonprofit buprenorphine treatment.\n\nFor now, though, patients whose lives have been transformed by the medication say they feel stressed by the struggle to get and pay for treatment, the long waiting lists, the doctors who overcharge and the ones whose offices are shut down. The misuse and abuse of the drug make even their own relatives suspicious of them \u2014 not to mention the public and private insurers that restrict the dosage and length of treatment, despite studies showing that higher doses improve treatment retention rates and that quitting buprenorphine often leads to relapse.\n\nBetty Jo Cumberledge, a home health aide in West Virginia, said her insurer paid \u201cforever\u201d for the potent narcotics she took for back pain. But it cut her off this fall after two years of Suboxone treatment for her resulting addiction. \u201cThat\u2019s just not humanly respectful in my opinion,\u201d she said.\n\nShe handwrote an impassioned letter, complaining that she was being \u201cdiscriminated against for seeking treatment\u201d and \u201csaying it would be on them when I ended up relapsing and dead.\u201d She won a six-month reprieve.\n\n\u201cThe whole situation is a big old mess,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHE DOUBLE-EDGED DRUG: The first of two articles examining the increasing use \u2014 and the successes and failures \u2014 of buprenorphine as an addiction treatment.
