Across town, Texas Health Resources is in the process of integrating with UT Southwestern Medical Center, a research power in its own right.\n\nWhile the deals are different, they\u2019re driven by similar forces: the pressure to reform health care and find better ways of treating more people for less.\n\nThese institutions are among the biggest, most respected players in the state, and they concluded that hooking up was better than going it alone.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cneed to create a different health care economy,\u201d said Barclay Berdan, CEO of Texas Health Resources, which has 16 acute-care hospitals and over $4 billion in annual revenue. \u201cThe system\u2019s near a point where it can\u2019t continue without breaking the bank.\u201d\n\nRising premiums for health insurance and large deductibles can eat up much of the family budget, he noted. Employers, which sponsor coverage for about half of Americans, and federal payors such as Medicare and Medicaid are all trying to squeeze reimbursements.\n\nThat\u2019s led to mergers and consolidation among hospital systems and doctors\u2019 practices. The Affordable Care Act has accelerated the trend by pushing providers to focus on the overall health of their patients, rather than a traditional fee-for-service model.\n\nIn this environment, it\u2019s simply smart to pool assets and spread resources across many more customers. Teaming with medical schools offers some unique benefits, including a reputation boost for the hospitals. Patients also get more access to leading-edge research and clinical trials, and everybody gets more referrals.\n\nThe upshot is that health care players can add revenue and talent without incurring a lot of upfront costs. As a result, collaborations are emerging in surprising places. Baylor Scott & White helps staff retail clinics at nine Walgreens locations while THR works with about three dozen clinics in CVS stores.\n\nSome high-profile deals in Dallas involve national brand names: the Mayo Clinic teaming with Methodist Health System and Cleveland Clinic working with Baylor Scott & White.\n\nUT Southwestern and THR may be the deepest partnership, at least among those that haven\u2019t actually merged (as occurred with Baylor and Scott & White in 2013).\n\n\u201cTexas Health Resources and UT Southwestern have really come together in every dimension,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Podolsky, president of UT Southwestern. \u201cThis is not a merger, but it is a fully integrated network \u2014 clinically and financially.\u201d\n\nDoctors from both organizations will work collectively throughout the region, he said. If THR patients are diagnosed with an illness that requires expert treatment from the medical school, they can be transferred to a school facility. And faculty and medical students will be able to work in THR\u2019s community health settings.\n\nThe network, known as Southwestern Health Resources, is scheduled to be operating by April 1, the CEOs said, and executive leaders will be named soon.\n\nThe two groups also have been working together on an accountable care organization that has 68,000 Medicare patients. In the first year, the collaboration generated Medicare savings of 6.5 percent, placing it among a small group of top-performing ACOs, Podolsky said.\n\nHe credited better coordinated care, analytics that are shared with doctors and care pathways that are considered best practices. In addition, the two have already exchanged over 340,000 electronic records.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of what we think we\u2019ll be able to do in an even broader way,\u201d Podolsky said.\n\nAnd the school won\u2019t have to spend millions on facilities to expand its reach. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us to duplicate the network of hospitals that THR has built over the years,\u201d he said.\n\nBaylor Scott & White has been using collaborations regularly, with leaders often saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t own everything.\u201d The deal with Baylor College of Medicine will bring the latest research to patients in Texas and the school will get access to a large, diverse population. That\u2019s a big advantage in competing for federal research grants.\n\nBaylor Scott & White already has partnerships and alliances in surgery, imaging, emergency treatment and rehabilitation. Four partner companies contributed $1.2 billion in revenue last year, said LaVone Arthur, chief integration officer.\n\nThat money \u201callows us to use additional resources for our mission-driven items \u2014 patient care, research and medical education,\u201d Arthur said.\n\nExpect to see a lot more collaboration among health care players. And that\u2019s a good thing, said Dr. Steve Berkowitz, a consultant in Austin, because it\u2019s driven by the marketplace, not a government mandate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s creative consolidation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it will improve outcomes and reduce costs overall.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @mitchschnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "To cut costs and improve care, North Texas hospitals are teaming up with medical schools and others.", "og": {"description": "To cut costs and improve care, North Texas hospitals are teaming up with medical schools and others.", "title": "Mitchell Schnurman: When health institutes work together, medical costs get a remedy", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160311-mitchell-schnurman-when-health-institutes-work-together-medical-costs-get-a-remedy.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160311-schnurman_0310bus_49315661.ece/BINARY/original/SCHNURMAN_0310BUS_49315661", "height": 855}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-03-11T22:31:23Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-03-11T17:18:51Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mitchell Schnurman: When health institutes work together, medical costs get a remedy\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160311-mitchell-schnurman-when-health-institutes-work-together-medical-costs-get-a-remedy.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160311-schnurman_0310bus_49315661.ece/BINARY/original/SCHNURMAN_0310BUS_49315661\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2685480\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-03-11T17:18:51Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160311-schnurman_0310bus_49315661.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/SCHNURMAN_0310BUS_49315661", "publishtime": "2016-03-11T17:18:51Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd328b\"", "article_summary": "This week, the state\u2019s largest health care system, Baylor Scott & White Health, announced a joint research venture with Baylor College of Medicine, a leader in medical research.\nThe upshot is that health care players can add revenue and talent without incurring a lot of upfront costs.\nThere\u2019s a \u201cneed to create a different health care economy,\u201d said Barclay Berdan, CEO of Texas Health Resources, which has 16 acute-care hospitals and over $4 billion in annual revenue.\nThe network, known as Southwestern Health Resources, is scheduled to be operating by April 1, the CEOs said, and executive leaders will be named soon.\nAcross town, Texas Health Resources is in the process of integrating with UT Southwestern Medical Center, a research power in its own right."}
