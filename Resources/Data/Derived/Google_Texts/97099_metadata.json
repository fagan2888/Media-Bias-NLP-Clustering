For all the big talk about data-driven analysis,what it actually delivers is sloppy and casual opining with a bit of data used, as the old saying goes, the way a drunkard uses a lamppost \u2014 for support, not illumination. Smith:\n\nIn sum, this so-called \u201cdata-driven\u201d website is significantly less data-driven (and less sophisticated) than Business Insider or Bloomberg View or The Atlantic. It consists nearly entirely of hedgehoggy posts supporting simplistic theories with sparse data and zero statistical analysis, making no quantitative predictions whatsoever. It has no relationship whatsoever to the sophisticated analysis of rich data sets for which Nate Silver himself has become famous. The problem with the new FiveThirtyEight is not one of data vs. theory. It is one of \u201cdata\u201d the buzzword vs. data the actual thing.\n\nSo what would real data-driven reporting look like (beyond what goes on at the sites Noah mentions, and also at the Times)? Well, here\u2019s an example: Charles Gaba\u2019s ACASignups.net. Gaba, a website developer, realized that nobody was systematically keeping track of enrollment data for Obamacare, and has turned himself into one-stop shopping on the law\u2019s progress. And he really fills a need: when you read news reports on Obamacare, you can tell right away which reporters have been reading Gaba and know what\u2019s happening and which reporters are relying solely on official announcements \u2014 or, worse, dueling political spin.\n\nFor the record, Gaba\u2019s take on the program so far is fairly optimistic: he projects 6.3 million signups by March 31, and has very carefully debunked claims that the vast majority of those signing up were previously insured. But the main point is that he\u2019s filling a niche by using a lot more data than the mainstream media. That\u2019s what we thought Nate Silver would be doing, and maybe he eventually will. But for now, Gaba is the model.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140326130025, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 26, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Data as Slogan, Data as Substance ( 20140326 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "In praise of Charles Gaba.", "title": "Data as Slogan, Data as Substance", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/data-as-slogan-data-as-substance/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "In praise of Charles Gaba.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 26, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1395853225, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-03-26T17:00:25-04:00"}, "utime": 20140326170025, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140326, "pdate": 20140326, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "In praise of Charles Gaba.", "title": "Data as Slogan, Data as Substance", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/data-as-slogan-data-as-substance/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/data-as-slogan-data-as-substance/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Data as Slogan, Data as Substance", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc650\"", "article_summary": "It is one of \u201cdata\u201d the buzzword vs. data the actual thing.\nThe problem with the new FiveThirtyEight is not one of data vs. theory.\nSmith:In sum, this so-called \u201cdata-driven\u201d website is significantly less data-driven (and less sophisticated) than Business Insider or Bloomberg View or The Atlantic.\nIt has no relationship whatsoever to the sophisticated analysis of rich data sets for which Nate Silver himself has become famous.\nIt consists nearly entirely of hedgehoggy posts supporting simplistic theories with sparse data and zero statistical analysis, making no quantitative predictions whatsoever."}
