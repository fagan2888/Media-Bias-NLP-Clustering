Good enough: Neunaber explains that Believe Again is a \u201cdifferent kind of super PAC\u201d that has invited Jindal to \u201chave a conversation with you.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Jindal arrives, and the conversation begins. Cowboy boots tucked under his jeans, the governor of Louisiana gives a notes-free speech that hones the most popular lines from his other notes-free speeches. \u201cMy daddy wasn\u2019t president,\u201d he says, whacking Jeb Bush. \u201cIt is time to fire everybody,\u201d he says, whacking \u2014 well, everybody. He tells a voter worried about sharia law that Louisiana has banned it, and he tells one who\u2019s angry about the Supreme Court that Congress should make liberal justices recuse themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a stitched-together campaign, a swaggering conservative message \u2014 and it may be starting to work. According to the \u00adcampaign-tracking group Democracy in Action, Jindal has spent 55 days in Iowa, tied with 2012 do-over candidate Rick Santorum for the most Hawkeye State turf time. Neither candidate has received any national lift. Both have been relegated to the \u00ad\u201cundercard\u201d debates that only Carly Fiorina managed to escape.\n\nBut a new NBC/WSJ poll found Jindal rising to 6 percent in Iowa \u2014 \u201ctied with Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio,\u201d as Neunaber happily put it. In the average of polls collected by RealClearPolitics, Jindal has escaped the bottom tier. Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Iowa-based Family Leader, has even written a letter to RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, telling him to cram another lectern onto the debate stage for Jindal.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when people talk to me about the race, they will talk about whoever\u2019s in the news,\u201d Vander Plaats said. \u201cAfter we\u2019ve been talking, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I really like that Bobby Jindal.\u2019 And historically when you\u2019re a lot of people\u2019s second choice, that bodes very well for you.\u201d\n\nJindal has gotten there by remixing campaign tactics that have survived the chaos of this primary. Only Donald Trump has taken more shots at his rivals. Only Jindal has held a news conference with no purpose other than to attack a rival (Trump).\n\nAnd few campaigns depend more on a super PAC. Jindal\u2019s third-quarter financial report revealed just $261,000 in the bank. The campaign raised $574,438 in that reporting period; it spent $832,214. But Believe Again hauled in close to $4 million, much of it from a mysterious nonprofit called America Next, and it\u2019s all being sprayed across Iowa.\n\nThe downside, said former Iowa GOP political director Craig Robinson, is a campaign that has marched across Iowa rather than marching with Iowans.\n\nView Graphic Here is who's winning the presidential race so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a closed-loop system of Jindal loyalists, where one of the smartest things to do in Iowa is to get someone to help show you the way, to help you run the traps,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIf he had taken a more traditional approach, find some Iowans right away willing to help him in the process, I have no doubt he\u2019d be higher in the polls.\u201d\n\nThe skills that persuaded Robinson were on display in Cedar Falls. Like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Jindal moves effortlessly between cornball jokes \u2014 \u201cmy wife was my high school sweetheart, but I wasn\u2019t hers\u201d \u2014 and sulfuric attacks on the \u201cestablishment.\u201d Like Trump\u2019s, Jindal\u2019s tax plan is estimated to deprive the Treasury of $9 trillion over 10 years. Like Cruz, Jindal sarcastically praises the Democratic Party for elevating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and says the opposition is \u201chonest,\u201d whereas Republicans lie to their base and govern like liberals.\n\n\u201cWhen they lost their 60th vote, Harry Reid didn\u2019t give up on Obamacare,\u201d says Jindal, calling for the end of the Senate filibuster. \u201cIf the other side is willing to shove Obamacare and socialism down our throats, somebody on our side needs to fight just as hard for freedom.\u201d\n\nThe Jindal stump speech is a litany of ways to dismantle Washington; the Jindal Q&A is a way for him to repeat that, more loudly. Jindal, who turned against Common Core education standards after the right rejected them, tells a woman worried about the feds and schools that the Obama regime doesn\u2019t think \u201cwe\u2019re smart enough to run our own lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only three things I think the Department of Education should be doing,\u201d Jindal says. \u201cOne on deregulation, secondly on transparency, and thirdly, true civil rights enforcement \u2014 not all the political stuff.\u201d\n\nJindal\u2019s say-anything-conservative approach pulls out exactly the crowds he\u2019s looking for. (Believe Again, naturally, did most of the outreach, sending cards to the homes of potential voters.) When Jindal asks for \u201cthe worst thing President Obama has done,\u201d at least two people cry out, \u201cHe was born.\u201d One loping question about gun rights \u2014 Jindal believes in no restrictions \u2014 turns out to be motivated by fear that a military training program called Jade Helm 15 was part of the president\u2019s dark design.\n\n\u201cSome of the troops have already been trained for Jade Helm 15,\u201d Kris Oberheu, 61, explains after the speech. \u201cObama\u2019s goal \u2014 and he totally is a Muslim \u2014 is to get the police out of the way and have martial law. If he has martial law, he doesn\u2019t have to leave office.\u201d\n\nOberheu, like everyone else at the speech, got to stick around for a conversation and a photo. Jindal refuses to leave his events until the last hand is shaken. He\u2019s talking to voters long after the Believe Again curtain has been rolled up and the T-shirts given away.\n\nIn an interview, he\u2019s downright cheerful about the economists screaming about the trillions of dollars his tax plan would cost.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s great,\u201d says Jindal. \u201cThat was intentional. You\u2019ve got to shrink the size of government.\u201d Any suggestion that he is pandering to the most active conservative voters in Iowa is dismissed as pure snobbery.\n\n\u201cThere is this arrogance on the left,\u201d Jindal says, still smiling. \u201cPeople used to respect each other\u2019s differences. Now, too many people on the left think if you\u2019re conservative, you can\u2019t be smart.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor of Louisiana has parked in the caucus state, with a super PAC paying most of the way.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The governor of Louisiana has parked in the caucus state, with a super PAC paying most of the way.", "title": "Inching up in Iowa, Bobby Jindal leaves no room on his right", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inching-up-in-iowa-bobby-jindal-leaves-no-room-on-his-right/2015/10/17/0aea955e-745c-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/17/National-Politics/Images/489222948.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inching-up-in-iowa-bobby-jindal-leaves-no-room-on-his-right/2015/10/17/0aea955e-745c-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "0aea955e-745c-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9"}, "article_summary": "It looks like a Bobby Jindal campaign stop, but there\u2019s something strange afoot.\nThe downside, said former Iowa GOP political director Craig Robinson, is a campaign that has marched across Iowa rather than marching with Iowans.\nBut a new NBC/WSJ poll found Jindal rising to 6 percent in Iowa \u2014 \u201ctied with Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio,\u201d as Neunaber happily put it.\nYou\u2019ve got to shrink the size of government.\u201d Any suggestion that he is pandering to the most active conservative voters in Iowa is dismissed as pure snobbery.\nGood enough: Neunaber explains that Believe Again is a \u201cdifferent kind of super PAC\u201d that has invited Jindal to \u201chave a conversation with you.\u201dShortly thereafter, Jindal arrives, and the conversation begins."}
