Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, remains in peril today as Hawaii elections officials have called for a re-vote in some precincts that were closed due to a tropical storm during Saturday\u2019s primary. Schatz, backed by President Obama in a bitter primary battle with Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, leads by just 1,635 votes. Worse still for the incumbent Democrat, Hanabusa said the re-vote may not be enough to keep her from mounting a legal challenge over the contested returns. Unlike the disputed GOP Senate primary in Mississippi, the result in Hawaii is close enough that, depending on how Friday\u2019s results turn out, contested ballots and other challenges might reverse the initial outcome. With Hanabusa talking openly of \u201c\u201cirregularities,\u201d it\u2019s clear that this race isn\u2019t over yet.\n\n\n\n[\u201cIt is unrealistic to think people struggling to find basic necessities and get out of their homes will have the ability to go to the polls Friday.\u201d \u2013 Statement from the campaign of Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii.]\n\n\n\nRepublicans could be saying aloha in November - Incumbent Gov. Neil Abercrombie\u2019s stunning primary loss to Democratic state Sen. David Ige sets the stage for a three-way match-up in November with former Republican Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona and former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann, the Hawaii Independent Party nominee. While Abercrombie, who was backed by President Obama, quickly embraced Ige in a show of party unity, Democrats face a tough challenge to hold onto the blue state\u2019s governor\u2019s mansion, a residence Republicans have held before. Aiona, who served under GOP Gov. Linda Lingle, is banking on a recent poll that shows him with an early lead, and the historic upset of an incumbent Governor that he says is a call for change. The only way that the Senate race could open up for GOP nominee former state Rep. Cam Cavasso would be if the eventual loser of the Democratic primary ran an independent bid to split the party.\n\n\n\n[Abercrombie\u2019s spectacular defeat \u2013 According to a WaPo analysis of 381 gubernatorial races between 1984 and 2013, only seven incumbents lost in the primary.]\n\n\n\nOh great, politicians - The hotly contested race between Schatz and Hanabusa now takes on a delicate phase as county residents recover from the ravages of Tropical Storm Iselle. \u201cBoth campaigns moved their operations to Puna on Sunday, the day after the primary, in the hopes their presence could boost voter turnout and establish enough goodwill to put them over the top,\u201d Honolulu Civil Beat reports. \u201cThey each also stressed that they are doing their best to help the people who have been hurt most by the tropical storm.\u201d\n\n\n\nPUTIN PUSHES OBAMA\u2019S LEGAL LINE\n\nPresident Obama is looking for a way to nudge a new government into power in Iraq as his longtime frustration with Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki boils over. Maliki, whom Obama once praised and with whom he heralded \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d on the way forward in Iraq, has become the administration\u2019s scapegoat for the devolution of Iraq. Perhaps Maliki looked more appealing when Obama was in a hurry to withdraw from Iraq ahead of the 2012 election. While Obama is busy with Baghdad, though, his \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe\u201d is on the move.\n\n\n\nFox News: Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that 280 trucks thought to be carrying humanitarian aid from Russia to the war-torn eastern Ukraine city of Luhansk would not be allowed to cross the border between the two countries\u2026. [Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council] showed a covertly filmed video appearing to show vehicles similar to the white-canopied trucks dispatched from Moscow on Tuesday parked at a military base in Russia. One frame displayed by Lysenko shows uniformed troops lined up in front of one of the trucks. \u2026Western officials have repeatedly expressed fears that any Russian aid mission would serve as a precursor to action by Russian ground troops. Late last week, U.S. [President Obama], German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister David Cameron issued statements proclaiming that such action would violate international law.\u201d\n\n\n\nScat: Obama says criticism of his \u2018don\u2019t do stupid s**t\u2019 foreign policy is \u201chorses**t\u201d - Daily Beast: \u201cJust before the Congressional recess, President Obama invited over a dozen Senate and House leaders from both parties to the White House to talk about foreign policy. According to two lawmakers inside the meeting, Obama became visibly agitated when confronted by bipartisan criticism of the White House\u2019s policy of slow-rolling moderate Syrian rebels\u2019 repeated requests for arms to fight the Assad regime and ISIS. According to one of the lawmakers, Sen. Bob Corker [R-Tenn.] asked the President a long question that included sharp criticisms of President Obama\u2019s handling of a number of foreign policy issues\u2014including Syria, ISIS, Russia, and Ukraine. Obama answered Corker at length. Then, the president defended his administration\u2019s actions on Syria, saying that the notion that many have put forth regarding arming the rebels earlier would have led to better outcomes in Syria was [\u2018horses**t.\u2019] White House officials confirmed the charged exchange between Obama and Corker but declined to confirm that Obama used the expletive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPricey protection for Hillary - Daily Mail: \u201cHillary Clinton left her post at the top of the U.S. State Department on Feb. 1, 2013, but the federal government spent more than $55,000 on travel expenses related to her book tour just last month, procurement documents show. The expenses included a $3,668 charge for her to enjoy a single night's lodging in a suite at the posh Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nWRONG TRACK: WAGES DOWN 23 PERCENT SINCE 2008\n\nCleveland Plain Dealer: \u201cWhile 8.7 million jobs have been regained since the 2008 recession, they are paying much less, by an average of 23 percent, according to a report released Monday by the United States Conference of Mayors.\u201d\n\n\n\n[According to a McClatchy/Marist poll the GOP leads Democrats in a generic ballot test 43 percent to 38 percent]\n\n\n\nTop insurer says ObamaCare enrollment slipping - Investors Business Daily: \u201cThe nation\u2019s third-largest health insurer had 720,000 people sign up for [ObamaCare] coverage as of May 20, a spokesman confirmed to IBD. At the end of June, it had fewer than 600,000 paying customers. Aetna expects that to fall to \u2018just over 500,000\u2019 by the end of the year. That would leave Aetna\u2019s paid enrollment down as much as 30% from that May sign-up tally.\u201d\n\n\n\nRate hikes revealed - Most enrollees will see a 7.5 percent increase in their premiums under ObamaCare in the next year, according to data compiled by the Health Research Institute. Customers in Nevada could potentially be hit with a 36 percent increase while those in Indiana could see a 15.6 percent spike. Several states have yet to release their final projections for insurance rates in 2015.\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nWhere did uptalking come from? It\u2019s that thing people do when they\u2019re making a declarative statement but infuriatingly intone the end of the sentence as if it were a question. Was it the Valley Girls? The Aussies?

Mark Dayton on Nov. 4, Minnesota Republican voters will pass judgment in Tuesday\u2019s primary election on the value of the party\u2019s endorsement. If GOP-endorsed Jeff Johnson wins, the party\u2019s stock will rise. But if he loses, the value of the party\u2019s backing will continue to erode\u2026 The party has gone through a rough patch in recent years. Its endorsed candidates have lost in two consecutive statewide elections, even in 2010, which was a good year for Republicans\u2026Johnson is in a hotly contested race with three strong GOP challengers: businessman Scott Honour, former House Minority Leader Marty Seifert and former House Speaker Kurt Zellers. The Republican contest for governor is the marquee event in Tuesday\u2019s primary election. In the party\u2019s three-way U.S. Senate race, GOP-endorsed businessman Mike McFadden is favored to win.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmmer aims to succeed Bachmann - Minneapolis Star Tribune: \u201cIn the Sixth District, former state Rep.

PETRI\n\nRoll Call: \u201cFour candidates are vying for the GOP nomination in Wisconsin\u2019s only open House district, with no clear front-runner in the Tuesday primary. In the race to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Tom Petri, three top Republican candidates have tried to brand themselves as the most conservative contender in the 6th District: state Sen. Joe Leibham, state Sen. Glenn Grothman and state Rep. Duey Stroebel.\u201d\n\n\n\nWalker, Burke look ahead - With no-contest primaries today, Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., and his presumptive Democratic opponent, former state Secretary of Commerce Mary Burke, are keeping up their general elections slugfest. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \u201cGov. Scott Walker\u2019s campaign is ready with another campaign ad to debut statewide on Wednesday, the day after Tuesday\u2019s primary. With Walker\u2019s leading Democratic opponent, Mary Burke, poised to win an easy primary race, the Republican governor will seek to block her from gaining any moment with an ad of his own. A copy of the ad shown to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter showed unidentified workers thanking the governor and saying that Walker\u2019s policies and spending on worker training helped them find a job.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Polls in Wisconsin close at 9 pm ET.

Four years ago Foley \u2013 who was once a U.S. Ambassador to Ireland and is a well-respected businessman\u2013was the Republican nominee for governor, but he lost to Gov. Dan Malloy by fewer than 6,500 votes.

Bruce Braley (D., Iowa) has once again been caught making elitist comments about Iowans, according to audio released by Republicans on Monday. The audio comes from a 2011 radio interview with Braley on Ring of Fire, a liberal radio program based in Florida. The Democratic Senate candidate says he addresses the \u2018impression that there is an elitism among progressive policies\u2019 by talking with voters in \u2018terms they can understand\u2019\u2026 The Iowa GOP blasted Braley in a statement: \u2018Bruce Braley thinks he has to talk down to us Iowans so we can understand him. We understand him perfectly.

The law, passed in 2008, included a grandfather clause allowing those elected before 2006 to remain in office\u2026 However, it was recently amended\u2026The amendment means about 160 justice and constables who were previously immune from the age restriction can no longer seek reelection, according to Moore.

From the official announcement, via NorthJersey.com: \u201cThe method is a pain stimulus in the trigeminal nerves which are found in the throats and mucus membranes of the beak and eyes. Almost all animals have these nerves, yet only birds have a negative response to methyl anthranilate. Birds \u2018feel\u2019 it as pain, while mammals, including humans, perceive it as a grape scent.\u201d Don\u2019t worry fake-grape fans, the FDA still says the chemical is \u201cgenerally regarded as safe.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cThe problem is that bullets are bouncing off the armored vehicles that ISIS has that it captured from us.
