Bissonette, Cazenovia Recovery\u2019s executive director and the acting executive director of Fellowship House. The mandated Medicaid service redesign under the Affordable Care Act hit at the same time the Niagara County agency\u2019s client load was decreasing.\n\n\u201cThey were just not going to survive financially,\u201d Bissonette said. \u201cThey ended last year with a deficit.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cOur intention is to see that these much-needed services remain and are offered to Niagara County residents for years to come. Both of our agencies share a longtime commitment to those in recovery from substance abuse disorders. We expect the transition to be efficient and seamless.\u201d\n\nCazenovia Recovery has 130 employees and 356 beds. All of its facilities \u2013 six community residences, supportive-living peer apartments and independent housing \u2013 are located in Buffalo, except for the Turning Point House intensive residential rehabilitation facility in Eden and the Liberty Hall community residence in Batavia.\n\nFellowship House was founded by Husnara Sundram and began with nine clients in Niagara Falls in 1980. Since then, the organization has served about 4,000 people in its Niagara County facilities. However, it dealt with only 159 clients in 2014, Bissonette said.\n\nFellowship House\u2019s four facilities total 85 beds, and it has 30 to 40 employees, Bissonette said. She has been working in the past four weeks to stabilize Fellowship House and reorganize its staff in preparation for the merger. \u201cAt this time, everybody will have a job,\u201d Bissonette said.\n\nAsked if all four Fellowship House facilities will remain open, she said, \u201cRight now, that is our intention, but we\u2019re taking a close look at their financials.\u201d\n\nCazenovia Recovery Services started in 1981 and provides comprehensive services to men and women in recovery, many of whom have co-occurring mental health disorders, and are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Last year, it assisted 887 people, including 65 military veterans.\n\n\u201cCazenovia is growing fast,\u201d Bissonette said. Other agencies have been asking it to take over more residential facilities, she said.\n\nemail: tprohaska@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cazenovia Recovery Services, a Buffalo provider of help to those recovering from drug or alcohol abuse, announced Tuesday it is merging with financially troubled Fellowship House, which has offered similar services in Niagara County since 1980.Cazenovia is taking over Fellowship House ...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Cazenovia Recovery Services, a Buffalo provider of help to those recovering from drug or alcohol abuse, announced Tuesday it is merging with financially troubled Fellowship House, which has offered similar services in Niagara County since 1980.Cazenovia is taking over Fellowship House ... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Cazenovia Recovery Services merges with Fellowship House  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/all-niagara-county/cazenovia-recovery-services-merges-with-fellowship-house-20150714", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFellowship House has been struggling,\u201d said Suzanne L.
