If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, your ISP should not be permitted to block it. That way, every player \u2014 not just those commercially affiliated with an ISP \u2014 gets a fair shot at your business.\n\nNo throttling. Nor should ISPs be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others \u2014 through a process often called \u201cthrottling\u201d \u2014 based on the type of service or your ISP\u2019s preferences.\n\nIncreased transparency. The connection between consumers and ISPs \u2014 the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d \u2014 is not the only place some sites might get special treatment. So, I am also asking the FCC to make full use of the transparency authorities the court recently upheld, and if necessary to apply net neutrality rules to points of interconnection between the ISP and the rest of the Internet.\n\nNo paid prioritization. Simply put: No service should be stuck in a \u201cslow lane\u201d because it does not pay a fee. That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet\u2019s growth. So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "Here are SOME of the stories in today's STACK ...\r\n1)\u00a0President Obama call for strong net neutrality rules!\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat Obama Wants:\r\n\r\nNo blocking.
