That is up slightly from 2012 but still less than the $44,000 in 2009. Likewise, the 18.7 percent poverty rate in 2013 was essentially unchanged from 2012. But it was above the 17.5 percent rate in 2009.\n\nThe same pattern can be seen in cities and counties, rich and poor. The census estimates released Thursday include local statistics for all places with at least 65,000 people \u2013 21 counties and seven cities in Alabama. Of those, the household median income remains less than it was in 2009 in 20 jurisdictions. It rose in eight.\n\nThe Census Bureau considers the changes from 2009 to 2013 statistically significant in five places \u2013 Baldwin, Lee, Madison and St. Clair counties, as well as the city of Huntsville.\n\nHardest hit was Baldwin, which sustained disproportionate impact from the housing collapse. The red-hot real estate market that bid up prices near the beach suddenly went cold, weakening the whole local economy. The county's tourism industry also suffered a blow from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\n\nThe result has been that the household median income, which in 2009 outpaced Mobile County by more than $9,800, was only $1,930 higher than its sister across the bay last year. The shrunken income also has led to less tax revenue. Less local tax revenue, combined with a $61 million cut in state funding over a two-year period, prompted officials to ask voters to approve a 1 percent sales tax. The voters said, \"yes.\"\n\nHuntsville also saw double-digit percentage decline in household median income from 2009 to 2013, dropping 10.3 percent.\n\nOn the other side of the coin were Lee and St. Clair counties. Their median household incomes rose by 11.6 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively during the period.\n\nFive counties and one city saw statistically significant changes in the poverty rate from 2009 to 2013, according to the census estimates. Cullman County led the pack in this category, shaving its poverty rate by 5.6 percentage points. Tuscaloosa County's poverty rate declined by 3.9 points.\n\nMeanwhile the poverty rate grew worse in Walker (up 8.3 percentage points), Huntsville (up 6.5 points), Madison (4.2 points) and Jefferson (2.5 points).\n\nThe Census Bureau estimated the Alabama's rate of uninsured in 2013 was 13.6 percent, essentially unchanged from the previous year. That placed Alabama better than the national average, in the middle of the pack of states.\n\nWithin Alabama, the percentage of people without insurance got better by a statically significant margin in Lee and St. Clair counties between 2009 and 2013, while it grew worse in Marshall, Shelby and Montgomery counties.\n\nCensus officials warned, however, that the 2009 and 2013 figures are not directly comparable because the agency redesigned its survey.\n\nOfficials said improvements this year will provide a strong baseline for measuring the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Next year's estimates should reflect dramatic changes with millions of people signing up this year for subsidized insurance under the program known as Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Census Bureau, data mine, news", "title": "New income, poverty estimates show Alabama slow to recover; check out your county", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "New census estimates show no statistically significant change to Alabama's household median income or poverty rate between 2012 and 2013.
