We talk about the science of how these illnesses are spread, and hear public health advice on containing and preventing them from State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso.\n\nLater in the hour, how global warming is exacerbating military conflicts around the world. Gen. Gordon Sullivan, U.S. Army (retired) will be speaking on that topic on Thursday evening at Norwich University as part of the Todd Lecture Series. Sullivan is a member of the CNA Military Advisory Board, which issued a report in May that called global warming a \"catalyst for conflict.\" Sullivan previews his lecture for Vermont Edition.\n\nAnd we read your comments to the program.
