He said most of the people he spoke with waiting inside seemed to be appreciative of the weekend work.\n\nEven though some worried that the event was an attempt to arrest people once they were inside, Hale said the program was more focused on helping people who might be confused or caught up in the legal system to the point that they\u2019re unsure of what to do next.\n\n\"If we can get the defendant to take care of it on their time table, they won\u2019t maybe lose their job because they have time in jail and they\u2019re arrested,\" he said. \"So that helps the community out at large.\"\n\nTaxpayers are helped as well, according to Hale. He said many of the city\u2019s approximately 40,000 warrants are failure to appear charges because of traffic-related incidents such as a suspended license or traffic tickets.\n\nEvery warrant that\u2019s settled before an arrest saves the $279 booking fee plus $85 for every day that a person remains in jail after that.\n\n\"If we can avoid having people arrested and taken to jail, then the city and the taxpayers avoid that cost,\" said Hale.\n\nChris Benavidez said he and his wife did not want to pay that cost. He joined her Saturday at city court to make sure her case was on the right track. Some tickets caused her to have a suspended license, but Benavidez said the help they received Saturday was a relief.\n\n\"When you have a driver\u2019s license, you can do a lot more things,\" he said. \"It helps her work and thrive. You have a clear conscience and you\u2019re able to take care of yourself.\"\n\nDonald Memale said he was skeptical about Warrant Day, but was glad he showed up to straighten out some paperwork on a charge that he thought was cleared more than seven years ago. Before Saturday, Memale said he worried all the time about being arrested.\n\n\"Anything you do, you have to just sort of wonder if that\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s going to get you put in jail for something you thought was already taken care of,\" he said.\n\nFriends of J.R. Mason would agree. He rounded up some of his friends for Warrant Day because he wanted to help them out, he said, and that would not have been possible if it were during the work week.\n\n\"It\u2019s a positive thing, and they need to do it more often,\" he said. \"It would certainly help clear things up more.\"\n\nAnyone worried about a warrant or wanting to take control of their case can do so during a morning or afternoon session Monday \u2013 Thursday at Tucson City Court, 103 W. Alameda St.\n\nCopyright 2015. Tucson News Now.
