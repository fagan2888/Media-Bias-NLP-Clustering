The development may tap critical aquifers that could deplete the groundwater and may also reduce the levels of the exclusive source of all water for Havasu Falls, the cultural foundation of the Havasupai tribe.\n\nEven the National Park Service, the U.S. agency that manages the Grand Canyon, considers the mega-development a \u201csignificant threat to Grand Canyon because it will require vast quantities of water and could lower the aquifer that feeds seeps, springs and streams that support wildlife and recreation.\u201d\n\nItalian style for an American icon\n\nThe tiny town of Tusayan, located at the south entrance to the Grand Canyon, filed a permit application with the Forest Service on behalf of Gruppo Stilo USA, an Italian developer, to build roads and utilities like sewers and water infrastructure on 40 acres of land that is completely surrounded by the Kaibab National Forest. Stilo has been seeking to develop Tusayan for over 25 years and even helped the town incorporate in 2010.\n\nIf its application is approved, Stilo would be able to go ahead with its plans to build an expansive resort and housing complex at the Grand Canyon\u2019s South Rim entrance, the most popular tourist destination at Grand Canyon National Park, where the Historic Village is located.\n\nStilo \u201chopes to bring large-scale tourist-driven commercial development and much needed residential housing.\u201d Plans include several million square feet of retail space. \u201cThe average tourist has his Kodak moment at the Rim, buys aplastic tomahawk made in China, and then leaves,\u201d said Stilo spokesperson Tom DePaolo.\n\nThe company is hoping that, after tourists are done absorbing the majesty of one of world\u2019s most beautiful and awe-inspiring natural landscapes, they will want to go shopping in malls and high-end boutiques.\n\nCoalition of the unwilling\n\nEarthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group, on behalf of the National Parks Conservation Association, the Grand Canyon Trust, Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity, has submitted a letter protesting the Forest Service\u2019s consideration of the rights-of-way permit. They are seeking 50,000 signatures to support their petition urging the Forest Service to deny Grupo Stilo\u2019s application.\n\n\u201cA giant development bigger than the Mall of America with all its traffic, noise and pollution will have significant, damaging impacts to the Forest, to the Park, to visitor experience and to wildlife,\u201d states Earthjustice\u2019s petition. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t belong next to the Grand Canyon.\u201d\n\nThe impact to wildlife is a major concern. The Grand Canyon is home to at least 25 sensitive, threatened or endangered species, including the bald eagle, Mexican spotted owl, bighorn sheep, Southwest river otter, Western red bat, desert tortoise, Northern leopard frog and razorback sucker.\n\nIn addition to the many animals who call the Grand Canyon home are some 1,750 species of plants. But only one of them is a federally listed endangered plant: the sentry milk-vetch. The sentry milk-vetch is not only endangered, but also endemic: It doesn\u2019t grow anywhere else on the planet except at the Grand Canyon. According to the NPS, \u201cThe species name cremnophylax means \u2018gorge watchman'; a suitable name for a little plant that grows only on the edge, watching over Grand Canyon \u2026 The sentry milk-vetch population near Maricopa Point was fenced in 1990 after scientists discovered that the plants were unable to withstand inadvertent trampling by visitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Forest Service is paving the way for foreign investors to exploit America\u2019s most treasured natural landmark all to turn a profit,\u201d said Earthjustice attorney Ted Zukoski, who criticized the agency for \u201cthrowing out its responsibility to serve the public interest by endangering the water, wildlife and wilderness that make the Grand Canyon so special.\u201d\n\nBut where will the mayor retire?\n\nThe city of Flagstaff and regional businesses have already passed resolutions opposing the permit, arguing that it would negatively impact Grand Canyon National Park and surrounding communities. The Forest Service is holdingpublic meetings this month in Tusayan, Flagstaff and Williams to provide information about the proposed roads and utility easements.\n\nProponents of the plan, such as Greg Bryan, the mayor of Tusayan, say the area is in desperate need of permanent housing for residents. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 17 years, and if I were to retire next week I have to leave,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cI can\u2019t retire here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A massive new development promises housing, hotels and boutiques.
