To raise awareness for the cause, the organization has announced a nationwide contest offering $64,000 to the individual who comes closest to guessing the national voter turnout numbers for the 2014 midterm election. On November 2nd, Why Tuesday? is also hosting the New York City kick-off concert-rally Let's Fix it Get Out ALL of the Vote, which includes a headlining performance from the Roots.\n\n\"We are asking the $64,000 question, because people don\u2019t realize just how low our voter turnout is,\" Why Tuesday? co-founder William Wachtel said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not because Americans don\u2019t care. It\u2019s simply that an antiquated system makes it hard for people who do care to vote. Everyone agrees it\u2019s broken, everyone agrees that there are practical ways to fix it, so the only challenge is to get our elected leaders to finally do something about it.\"\n\nTo enter the contest, participants are asked to predict the national percentage of voter turnout; the person who submits the closest prediction will win the $64,000 cash prize. The contest is open to individuals at least 18 years old residing in the U.S.\n\nNYU is challenging its students to participate for the opportunity to win a scholarship equivalent to one semester at the university. Why Tuesday? will also offer a selection of tickets to NYU for the rally, which will kick off November 2nd at 7:30 p.m. at Webster Hall.\n\nBoth the concert and contest are part of a larger Why Tuesday? campaign, launched ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act on August 6th, 2015. Supporters can help spread the word through social media by using the hashtag #FIXITNOW.\n\n\"The problem is that our elected officials don\u2019t want to get out all of the vote; they want to get out their vote,\" said Why Tuesday? Chairman Andrew Young. \"We look at it differently. We have Republicans, Democrats and independents coming together to say the system is broken and we need to fix it.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Why Tuesday? organization is holding a concert-rally headlined by the Roots, as part of a campaign focused on fixing America's voting system.", "og": {"site_name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "Non-partisan group is also offering $64,000 prize to whoever who can predict voter turnout numbers for 2014 midterm election", "title": "The Roots Headlining Why Tuesday?
