High demand for commuter bikes in Boulder County causing shortage

Community Cycles, a Boulder nonprofit that promotes bicycles for transportation, is in need of used bikes.

The organization has seen increased demand for affordable adult commuter bikes, and is asking the public to donate any bikes they're not using anymore.

"You have a bike that sits around, you're probably not going to use it or you're upgrading to another bike," said Community Cycles executive director Sue Prant. "Give it to us so that someone else can use it. It gets more people on bikes."

Prant said her organization accepts donations at its location at 2805 Wilderness Pl. in Boulder. The organization will also pick up used bikes for a $10 fee, she said. Community Cycles is also hosting bike-drop events.
