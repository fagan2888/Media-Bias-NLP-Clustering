Overall fraud reported to Treasury increased 50 percent from October to March 2013. After that, reported fraud skyrocketed, doubling between March 2013 and July 2014.\n\nTor has been in the news recently. In early November, federal law enforcement officials revealed they had taken down hundreds of websites using Tor to hide themselves from regular Internet browsers.\n\nIt was the largest ever crackdown on Tor users.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A \"majority\" of hacks could have been detected by monitoring the anonymous network.", "description": "A \"majority\" of hacks could have been detected by monitoring the anonymous network.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A \"majority\" of hacks could have been detected by monitoring the anonymous network.", "title": "Feds: Cyber thieves used Tor privacy software to commit bank fraud", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/226205-cyber-thieves-using-dark-web-for-massive-bank-fraud", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/226205-cyber-thieves-using-dark-web-for-massive-bank-fraud", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-05T18:46-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T18:46:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Internet privacy, Tor, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, cybersecurity,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/226205-cyber-thieves-using-dark-web-for-massive-bank-fraud", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A \"majority\" of hacks could have been detected by monitoring the anonymous network.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds: Cyber thieves used Tor privacy software to commit bank fraud"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds: Cyber thieves used Tor privacy software to commit bank fraud"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcb8\"", "article_summary": "In over a decade, almost no banks knew their attacker was using an IP address on the anonymous Tor network.\nAfter that, reported fraud skyrocketed, doubling between March 2013 and July 2014.\nIn early November, federal law enforcement officials revealed they had taken down hundreds of websites using Tor to hide themselves from regular Internet browsers.\nOverall fraud reported to Treasury increased 50 percent from October to March 2013.\nThe majority of bank account hacks could have been thwarted had organizations looked for and blocked transactions coming through Tor, an online anonymity communications network."}
