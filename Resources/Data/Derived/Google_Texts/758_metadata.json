Usually, Gwozdecky watches from the press box level and communicates with the coaches on the bench, but fellow assistant Steve Thomas is away from the team \u201con assignment\u201d so Gwozdecky has moved downstairs for the time being. Former NHL player and head coach Rick Bowness is the Lightning\u2019s associate coach.\n\nAfter the Lightning\u2019s morning skate Saturday, I asked \u2014 among other things \u2014 if Gwozdecky had anything he wanted to say now, after the dust has settled a bit, about his departure from DU. That exit was part contract dispute as Gwozdecky sought an extension and was part administrative disappointment with the Pioneers\u2019 lack of success in the NCAA tournament after the back-to-back national championships in 2004 and \u201905.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I want to say is that if it hadn\u2019t been for my experience at DU, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now,\u201d Gwozdecky said. He said that given his choice, \u201cI might still be working at DU, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be and that\u2019s their prerogative. But I\u2019ve enjoyed the heck out of this. I really have. My wife (Bonnie) and I still shake our heads and say it was a difficult period there for a little bit after they made their decision. But now we look back and I don\u2019t think I would want it any other way based on what has occurred to me here. This has been a great experience. I\u2019ve loved it.\u201d\n\nThe Gwozdeckys kept their house in Denver, still consider the area their home, and returned to Colorado for the summer. \u201cThat\u2019s our home,\u201d Gwozdecky said. \u201cWe like it here in Tampa, but as everyone knows, in Florida come June, July, August, it\u2019s a blast furnace \u2026 Unless it\u2019s not practical any longer, Denver will remain our home.\u201d\n\nGwozdecky said he feels more comfortable this season. He mentioned logistics, including becoming familiar with players, staff, and even the league\u2019s arenas. The Lighting is going into the game with Colorado with a 28-14-4 record. Two seasons ago, in the lockout year, Tampa Bay had 40 points \u2014 only one more than the Avalanche. The Lightning had 101 points last season, and now is on pace for about 107 this season. Cooper handles the power play himself. In addition to usually serving as the staff\u2019s eyes upstairs, Gwozdecky works with forwards. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stay on the ice awhile with the goaltending coach (Frantz Jean), like you just saw,\u201d Gwozdecky said. \u201cI work with the (scratches) for a little extra skate, too, things like that. Off-ice, we\u2019re doing clip after clip after clip, either of the guys \u2018Coop\u2019 assigned us, or pre-scouts of our opponent. It\u2019s lots of video.\u201d\n\nGwozdecky said of the NHL game: \u201cYou know, you never can quite understand how fast and big and strong these guys are, and how fast the game is, until you are there. I was on a college bench for 34 years, watching college guys and some pretty good teams, pretty good people. But what a step it is when you come to this level and watch these guys and how fast they go, not only in practice, but especially in games.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all good guys, they all want to get better. If you can do something to help them get better, that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nDid he have any desire to return to the college game?\n\n\u201cYou never say never,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain things I miss and there are things I don\u2019t miss. The coaching here at this level is just coaching. There are so many other administrative things a college coach is required to do that I don\u2019t miss, whether it\u2019s compliance, and the fund-raising, and the academics \u2014 all important things that a coach has to do that I did for multiple years.\n\n\u201cTrying to be able to determine how much of a percentage of my day back in those days I was putting toward hockey, I\u2019d say at best 30 percent. Here, it\u2019s 100 percent. So I enjoy that, I really do.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/17/chat-tampa-bay-lightning-assistant-coach-george-gwozdecky/20595/", "type": "blog", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/01/Gwoz-495x329.jpg", "site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "title": "A chat with Tampa Bay Lighting assistant George Gwozdecky"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "creator": "@TFrei", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/17/chat-tampa-bay-lightning-assistant-coach-george-gwozdecky/20595/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/01/Gwoz-495x329.jpg", "title": "A chat with Tampa Bay Lightning assistant coach George Gwozdecky", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "DU hockey,George Gwozdecky,Tampa Bay Lightning,University of Denver", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A chat with Tampa Bay Lightning assistant George Gwozdecky"}, "article_summary": "I was on a college bench for 34 years, watching college guys and some pretty good teams, pretty good people.\nTAMPA \u2014 George Gwozdecky\u2019s firing after the 2012-13 season at the University of Denver was a shock to just about everyone \u2026 including the Pioneers\u2019 coach himself.\nTwo seasons ago, in the lockout year, Tampa Bay had 40 points \u2014 only one more than the Avalanche.\n\u201cThere are certain things I miss and there are things I don\u2019t miss.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll stay on the ice awhile with the goaltending coach (Frantz Jean), like you just saw,\u201d Gwozdecky said."}
