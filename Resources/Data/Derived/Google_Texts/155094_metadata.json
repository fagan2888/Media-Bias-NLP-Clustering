Allen Dobson Jr., the president of CCNC, remains at the helm of the organization, Mahoney said.\n\nOthers confirmed that there had been significant recent departures at CCNC.\n\n\u201cThere were several staff people that left for various reasons,\u201d said Richard Stevens, a former Republican state senator who currently works as a contract lobbyist for CCNC.\n\nA listed staff lobbyist for CCNC, Amy Hobbs, resigned from her position on July 1, records with the N.C. Secretary of State\u2019s office show.\n\nThree board members have also left the non-profit leadership boards that govern CCNC.\n\nBrian Toomey, a former board member for N.C. Community Care Networks, said he recently left the board managing CCNC\u2019s network of community care centers, but not as part of any planned or unplanned exodus.\n\nRather, he said he left for his own reasons \u2013 namely to spend more time at his job managing the Carrboro-based Piedmont Health Services as state leaders debate what the future of the state\u2019s Medicaid system is.\n\n\u201cThe world is about to change,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\nCCNC manages the health care for approximately 1.4 million North Carolinians enrolled in the state\u2019s Medicaid system, a federally mandated program that provides health coverage to some of the most vulnerable North Carolinians \u2013 low-income children, seniors and disabled persons.\n\nIt\u2019s also gained national attention for its approach to health care, which has been found in studies to keep costs down while improving care. A 2011 study by a California consulting firm found CCNC saved the state nearly $1 billion between 2007 and 2010.\n\nBut the group\u2019s future has been uncertain in recent years, with Republican leaders in the state legislature disagreeing about whether or not CCNC should have a place in the state\u2019s potentially revamped $14 billion Medicaid program, the largest line-item in the state budget and one that frequently experiences cost overruns.\n\nSeveral leading House Republicans have been supportive of CCNC and its approach to use locally-based medical providers to manage the care of patients, while Senate leaders have been less enthusiastic.\n\nThe Senate version of the budget, released in mid-June, proposed severing CCNC\u2019s $65 million contract with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services after Jan. 1, in favor of pursuing a more privatized Medicaid system of contracting with managed care companies.\n\nThe House and the Senate are currently in the midst of budget negotiations.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s also gained national attention for its approach to health care, which has been found in studies to keep costs down while improving care.\nSeveral top staff and board members of Community Care of North Carolina, the provider-led network that coordinates care for many Medicaid patients in the state, have left the organization.\n\u201cStaff has been reduced by about 9 percent, including both leadership and staff levels,\u201d wrote CCNC spokesman Paul Mahoney in a statement.\nBrian Toomey, a former board member for N.C.
