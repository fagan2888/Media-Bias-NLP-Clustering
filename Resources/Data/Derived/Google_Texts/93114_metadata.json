She topped the entire ensemble with a jaunty peach sun hat, which she wore despite the cool temperature and overcast skies.\n\nSEE: PHOTOS: View Pope Francis\u2019 historic trip to the U.S.\n\nWillis and her husband, Thompson, wanted to see the pope because she\u2019s going to retire soon from her job as a midwife and might not be able to travel. She was glad for the opportunity.\n\n\u201cThis Pope Francis is a very loving person, is a pope who loves peace,\u201d she said a few moments after waving at Francis as he and his motorcade passed by to the accompaniment of cheers and cries.\n\n\u201cIf one has love, definitely, there is peace, there is unity,\u201d she said.\n\nWillis was one in a throng of perhaps as many as 1 million who turned out along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway to spend time with Francis during his last public U.S. event.\n\nCrowds lined the metal barricades set up around both sides of the parkway, standing 10 deep in some places. They waved yellow-and-white Vatican flags, purchased outside the gates for a few dollars, and held handfuls of rosaries brought from home to be blessed \u2014 somehow \u2014 by the passing of the man in the white car.\n\nSome held babies up to stern-looking Secret Service agents who trotted alongside the open popemobile like ominous escorts. Occasionally, the men in black carried bundles of pink, blue, white or yellow from the crowd to the pontiff, who alternately kissed the babies within or laid his hands on their heads.\n\nREAD: Francis bids farewell, tells Catholics to avoid \u2018perversion\u2019 of \u2018narrow\u2019 faith\n\nEach time he did, the crowds, watching on 40 Jumbotrons set around the parkway, cheered. Some cried as he passed, others hugged each other. Still others stared at phones in their hands, eager to see if they had \u201ccaught\u201d the pope forever.\n\nWhitney Crooks, 32, came from Ionia, Mich., with her husband to attend the outdoor Mass. Next year, she will have her own baby \u2014 her first. As a teacher, she has long recognized the importance of family; now the pope\u2019s vision of family as the foundation stone of society has new meaning, she said.\n\n\u201cIt resonates on a different level for me now,\u201d she said, her baby bump snug under a Detroit Tigers sweatshirt. \u201cIt has a dual purpose now, both a professional one and a personal one.\u201d\n\nJennifer Collins, a diocesan worker from Rockford, Ill., attended the Festival of Families \u2014 a celebrity-driven concert held in the same spot the night before. She, too, is taking home more than a pope bobblehead or \u201cI saw Francis\u201d T-shirt.\n\n\u201cI thought this was very beautiful and very inspiring,\u201d she said. \u201cTo come here to see the beauty this man is presenting that is so attractive to the world \u2014 that\u2019s what brought people here.\u201d\n\nYS/AMB END WINSTON", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Catholic, Christian, Philadelphia, Pope Francis, U.S. papal visit", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) The crowds waved yellow-and-white Vatican flags, purchased outside the gates, and held handfuls of rosaries brought from home to be blessed -- somehow -- by the passing of the man in the white car.", "title": "Throngs fill Benjamin Franklin Parkway for pope\u2019s final US Mass", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/27/throngs-fill-benjamin-franklin-parkway-popes-final-us-mass/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/web.-Philly-Mass-copy.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kjwinston11"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/27/throngs-fill-benjamin-franklin-parkway-popes-final-us-mass/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/27/throngs-fill-benjamin-franklin-parkway-popes-final-us-mass/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) The crowds waved yellow-and-white Vatican flags, purchased outside the gates, and held handfuls of rosaries brought from home to be blessed -- somehow -- by the passing of the man in the white car."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c5a\"", "article_summary": "All to see the 78-year-old Argentine who has captivated the nation\u2019s attention celebrate one final Mass before heading back to Rome.\nCrowds lined the metal barricades set up around both sides of the parkway, standing 10 deep in some places.\nWillis was one in a throng of perhaps as many as 1 million who turned out along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway to spend time with Francis during his last public U.S. event.\nSEE: PHOTOS: View Pope Francis\u2019 historic trip to the U.S.Willis and her husband, Thompson, wanted to see the pope because she\u2019s going to retire soon from her job as a midwife and might not be able to travel.\nShe topped the entire ensemble with a jaunty peach sun hat, which she wore despite the cool temperature and overcast skies."}
