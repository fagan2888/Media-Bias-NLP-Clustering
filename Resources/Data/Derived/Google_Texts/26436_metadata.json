CSU concluded its regular season Friday with a 27-24 loss at Air Force that snapped the Rams\u2019 winning streak at nine and dropped them to 10-2 \u2014 and 5-2 in the Mountain West. Because Boise State routed Utah State on Saturday, the Rams wouldn\u2019t have made the MW title game even with a win.\n\nIn Gainesville, Florida officials said in a statement that they had \u201cmade no job offers to anyone, and reports claiming that are false.\u201d That was in response to reports that Mississippi\u2019s Hugh Freeze had an offer on the table.\n\nAnother candidate also emerged, with word that former Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels, now back with the New England Patriots, had expressed interest in the job.\n\nMcElwain\u2019s initial $7.5 million buyout is specified in a new five-year contract signed (including by then-athletic director Jack Graham) in June and announced in August, shortly after Graham\u2019s falling-out with Frank led to his firing.\n\nThe contract includes \u201cachievement\u201d clauses that would additionally bump up McElwain\u2019s salary, already scheduled for annual increases from the $1.5 million he earned this season. For example, if the Rams finished in the College Football Playoff top 25 rankings, McElwain\u2019s base salary would have jumped to $2 million.\n\nThe buyout would be equal to his remaining salary in what would be presumed to be a five-year deal because of the annual one-year rollover clauses in the deal that can be triggered by either side.\n\nIt does include an \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d clause that could apply if McElwain signals his intention to terminate the contract \u201cwithout cause,\u201d opening the way for possible discussions about reducing the buyout, technically McElwain\u2019s responsibility. However, the contract states that CSU \u201chas no obligation\u201d to agree to reduce or eliminate the buyout.\n\nCSU will learn its bowl assignment Sunday. If Boise State is the highest-ranked champion from a \u201cnon-power\u201d conference in the College Football Playoff top 25 and thus is slotted in a major bowl, CSU could land in the Dec. 20 Las Vegas Bowl against a Pac-12 opponent.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU administrators stay quiet about Florida\u2019s interest in Jim McElwain", "title": "CSU administrators stay quiet about Florida\u2019s interest in Jim McElwain", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/01/csu-administrators-stay-quiet-about-floridas-interest-in-jim-mcelwain/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140826__jim-mcelwain-csu-rams-082614bp1.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140826__jim-mcelwain-csu-rams-082614bp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-01T20:21:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:37:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb27f\"", "article_summary": "The contract includes \u201cachievement\u201d clauses that would additionally bump up McElwain\u2019s salary, already scheduled for annual increases from the $1.5 million he earned this season.\nBecause Boise State routed Utah State on Saturday, the Rams wouldn\u2019t have made the MW title game even with a win.\nHowever, the contract states that CSU \u201chas no obligation\u201d to agree to reduce or eliminate the buyout.\nAfter Colorado State coach Jim McElwain discussed the Florida opening with Gators athletic director Jeremy Foley on Saturday night, CSU president Tony Frank Monday responded \u2014 in limited fashion \u2014 to talk about McElwain\u2019s future.\nFor example, if the Rams finished in the College Football Playoff top 25 rankings, McElwain\u2019s base salary would have jumped to $2 million."}
