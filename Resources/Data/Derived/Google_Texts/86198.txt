CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian author, journalist and speech writer for the center-left Labor Party Bob Ellis died at his Sydney home of liver cancer on Sunday, his son said. He was 73 years old.

“He died, as was his wish, at home. His family were by his bedside,” Ellis’s son Jack wrote on his father’s blog “Table Talk.”

“The camaraderie of his regular readers has been a source of tremendous joy to him these past few years. Thank you all,” he said.

Ellis’s accomplishments include the screenplay for the acclaimed 1978 Australian movie “Newsfront” and the autobiographical 1992 movie “The Nostradamus Kid.”

He wrote 19 books including best-selling “Goodbye Jerusalem” that was pulped in 1998 after then conservative government ministers Tony Abbott — who later became prime minister — and Peter Costello sued for defamation.

Born a Seventh Day Adventist in the New South Wales state country town of Lismore on May 10, 1942, Ellis became a political writer through his opposition to Australia’s military involvement in the Vietnam War.
