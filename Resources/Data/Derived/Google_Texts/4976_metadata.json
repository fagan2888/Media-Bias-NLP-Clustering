Hello?!\u201d But no one is there. It\u2019s something that has happened to all of us. But as it turns out, security experts say answering that \u201csilent call\u201d could make you a target for scammers.\n\nVijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO of Pindrop Security, says criminals use automated computer systems to robocall phone numbers across the country, according to NPR.\n\nThat call you receive, with silence on the other end, is \u201cthe first of the reconnaissance calls that these fraudsters do,\u201d Balasubramaniyan told NPR. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to see: Are they getting a human on the other end? You even cough and it knows you\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nAfter the scammers confirm your number is a working number, they will call back with a prerecorded message informing you of \u201cunusual activity\u201d on your credit card. The message usually includes a threat that your account may be closed if the issue is not resolved. If you \u201cpress 1,\u201d you\u2019re then asked to confirm or provide personal information like your date of birth or Social Security number.\n\nAccording to NPR, researchers estimate 1 in every 2,200 calls is a fraud attempt.\n\nSo how can you keep yourself safe? The best way is to never answer a call from a phone number you do not recognize. Also, it\u2019s not recommended to call back unknown numbers \u2014 this is also a way for scammers to confirm your number is a working number.\n\nThe FTC recommends that consumers \u201cjust hang up\u201d on the robocalls. If you\u2019re ever given the option to \u201cpress 1\u201d to remove your number from their calling list, it\u2019s recommended you ignore that request.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want consumers to engage in any way with robocallers,\u201d Patty Hsue, an attorney who leads the FTC\u2019s effort against robocalls, told NPR. \u201cA lot of times when you get a robocall you have the option of pressing 1 for more information or pressing 2 to ask to be removed from the list. And in either case, pressing 1 or 2 basically lets the robocaller know that it\u2019s a live person on the other line who\u2019s willing to engage and that could lead to additional robocalls.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "You answer the phone. \"Hello?
