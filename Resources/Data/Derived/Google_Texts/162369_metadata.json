For example, they are excluded from getting federal subsidies to buy health insurance, and they cannot shop for coverage in the health insurance marketplace.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made that clear last week while answering questions about the health care law on a Google Hangout sponsored by Voto Latino.\n\n\u201cYou have to be a legal resident in order to be entitled to a tax credit and purchase health insurance in the marketplace,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is estimated that more than half of all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States don\u2019t have health insurance. And only a few have insurance through employer-sponsored programs.\n\nThe Urban Institute estimates that 25 percent of the people who will remain without health insurance once the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented will be undocumented immigrants, making up the nation\u2019s second-largest population of uninsured.\n\nNonprofit group offers medical care to undocumented immigrants\n\nWith limited health care options, undocumented immigrants are turning to community health clinics and nonprofit organization to get the medical care they need.\n\nOne of those nonprofit organizations is Puentes de Salud. The organization focuses on providing Latinos in South Philadelphia with quality health care and social services at a low cost. The New York Times profiled the Puentes de Salud las week in a story written by Jon Hurdle.\n\nIn the story, Dr. Steve Larson, a co-founder of Puentes de Salud, that the organization is different from other community health groups, because it addresses the economic and social conditions that have an underlying impact on the health of individuals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about me writing prescriptions,\u201d Dr. Larson, a 53-year-old professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times. \u201cThis is an underground health system.\u201d\n\nMost of the patients who seek treatment from Puentes de Salud are immigrants who lack a legal status and are not proficient in English. The nonprofit organization charges them as little as $20 for primary care services.\n\nThe group is able to charge a low cost because most of the medical staff members are volunteers, including Dr. Larson. There are only two full-time employees. Many of the volunteers are medical students and community volunteers.\n\nBesides providing health services, the nonprofit organization also offers patients a wide variety of educational programs. Some of those programs include ESL classes, diabetes management assistance and oral health education and preventive dental care.\n\nMery Martinez, a 38-year-old undocumented immigrant from Honduras, is one of the estimated 3,300 patients who\u2019ve received treatment at Puentes de Salud, according to The New York Times story. Like many undocumented immigrants, she can\u2019t afford health insurance.\n\nMartinez suffers from leukemia. She struggled to get treatment for her illness first in New York and then in Philadelphia until she heard about Puentes de Salud. The medical staff there examined her and advised her to apply for free treatment under Pennsylvania\u2019s Emergency Medical Assistance Program, which she qualifies for because of her life-threatening condition.\n\nStates could extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants\n\nThough the Affordable Care Act bars undocumented immigrants from being eligible for federally funded health coverage, undocumented immigrants are eligible for some services.\n\nFor example, they are eligible for emergency care under Medicaid if they meet certain requirements, like having a low income. Medicaid is joint state-federal program that helps pay for health care costs of eligible non-citizens during the time of a medical emergency.\n\nThere are also some states that are considering whether to extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants. Sebelius said on the Google Hangout last week that this could be done as long as the benefits are covered with funds from the state, not the federal government.\n\nA state lawmaker in California is already planning to introduce legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to have access to health insurance through the state\u2019s version of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nState Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), who chairs the California Legislative Latino Caucus, said his bill would expand access to health care coverage for all California residents regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made enormous strides to reduce California\u2019s uninsured population with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but we won\u2019t have a truly healthy state until everyone has access to quality, affordable coverage,\u201d Lara said in a statement.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VOXXI under the title \"Health care options for undocumented immigrants are limited.\"\n\nHispanic Populations In The U.S. Hispanic Populations In The U.S.\n\n1 of 10 Mexico The nation's highest Latino population comprises 31,798,000 immigrants. The Los Angeles-Long Beach area has the nation's highest number of Mexican immigrants, with 4,569,000, although other large concentrations are found in the Chicago metro area and throughout Texas.
