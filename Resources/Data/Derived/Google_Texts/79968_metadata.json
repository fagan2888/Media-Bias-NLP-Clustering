Superfans questioned its uniqueness; after all, the previous cinematic iterations of the uniform going back to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 version have been similarly monochromatic. This week on his podcast, Kevin Smith, citing intimate knowledge of the project, stepped up to assuage such weighty concerns: The suit, Smith assures us, will be more akin to the uniform that Batman wore in Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight Returns\u201d comic book series. Translation for the non-geek: It\u2019ll have at least two colors. Smith is likely to be only the first of many experts and prognosticators on the subject.\n\nToday Warner Bros. revealed the full title of the film \u2014 \u201cBatman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d \u2014 and its promotional logo, Supe\u2019s gilded \u201cS\u201d centered inside a version of the Bat\u2019s familiar icon. The details unleashed a torrent of commentary about the title and its effectiveness \u2014 or lack thereof. Some have speculated that the use of the word \u201cJustice\u201d is a deliberate reference to a Justice League super-film to come soon after. (Again, translation for the non-geek: Just think \u201cThe Avengers\u201d but with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman et al.) But other than that, there is little else that can be deduced from the title and the accompanying logo no matter how steady the trending stream of Batman v Superman and Dawn of Justice hashtags remains this afternoon. (Warner Bros. has let go info about the cast already.)\n\nSo we have a title...Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I feel bad for Superman. Batman gets top billing. pic.twitter.com/O2cGe79Gdw \u2014 Convention Scene (@conventionscene) May 21, 2014", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new superhero adventure gets a name, a logo and twitter goes crazy.
