Since 1993, there have been 11 murders and 26 attempted murders due to anti-abortion violence, according to the National Abortion Federation, a group of healthcare providers.\n\nLawmakers continue to tighten restrictions on abortion, with 288 such limits passed by states since 2011, according to Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit that focuses on reproductive health.\n\nThe Supreme Court also plans to rule on a Texas law that mandates costly hospital-grade facilities for abortion providers, who say it actually aims to shut clinics and chip away at a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nPlanned Parenthood itself is in the crosshairs, with the Republican-led Congress voting as recently as this week to cut all of its federal funding, although Obama, a Democrat, has vowed to veto the measure when it reaches his desk.\n\nA USA Today poll in December found Americans overwhelmingly oppose cutting off federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Some 59 percent of Republicans and 89 percent of Democrats are against the idea.\n\nThe controversy was well under way 100 years ago when Sanger and her sister, both trained nurses whose mother died young after giving birth to 11 children, opened the clinic. They fitted women for diaphragms, which were the most effective birth control available at the time but were illegal under the federal Comstock Law against distributing materials that could be used for contraception.\n\n\"The women were lined up and demanding access to birth control,\" her grandson said. \"That said it all.\"\n\nOne patient turned out to be an undercover police officer, and nine days after the clinic opened in the low-income Jewish and Italian neighborhood, it was shut down, and Sanger was under arrest.\n\nMargaret Sanger's holy grail was universal access to birth control for women, whose unplanned pregnancies forced them into what she viewed as sexual servitude.\n\nSanger, who founded organizations that evolved into Planned Parenthood Federation of America, was a driving force in the early 1950s behind the development of the birth control pill, which today is largely credited with allowing women to shape their lives and compete in the workplace with men.\n\n\"Birth control has been central not just to women's political, workplace and education opportunities but also to their ability to live,\" said Carrie Baker, who teaches women's studies at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. \"What motivated Margaret Sanger was that women were dying after having so many pregnancies.\"\n\nToday about half of the 6.6 million pregnancies annually in the United States are unintended, a higher proportion than in Europe, reproductive health experts say.\n\nTeen birth rates in Brownsville, now a mostly black neighborhood that is one of the city's poorest, are among the highest in New York City, and the abortion rate is double the rest of the city, according to the city health department.\n\n\"It's still the poorest of the poor who are having more children than they want, who are having children earlier than other women, who are not getting access to preventive methods when they need them - whether it's in Brownsville or Rio de Janeiro,\" Sanger said. \"That same struggle was my grandmother's struggle, and it is mine.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cPreventing women from contraception is inhumane,\u201d said Margaret Sanger in 1916.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-01-09 12:41:53 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "\u201cPreventing women from contraception is inhumane,\u201d said Margaret Sanger in 1916.", "title": "We\u2019re Having The Same Birth Control Debates We Had 100 Years Ago", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/100-years-first-birth-control-clinic-planned-parenthood_us_568fe733e4b0a2b6fb6fc527", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/568ff07c1700002c005670c4.jpeg?cache=fedgf8eb7w", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/568ff07c1700002c005670c4.jpeg?cache=fedgf8eb7w", "height": 1000}, "title": "We\u2019re Having The Same Birth Control Debates We Had 100 Years Ago", "description": "\u201cPreventing women from contraception is inhumane,\u201d said Margaret Sanger in 1916.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-08 12:41:53 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_568fe733e4b0a2b6fb6fc527", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Planned Parenthood,Birth Control ,Women's Health,Women's Rights", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Planned Parenthood,Birth Control ,Women's Health,Women's Rights", "published_time": "2016-01-08 12:41:53 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-01-08 12:41:53 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Margaret Sanger's holy grail was universal access to birth control for women, whose unplanned pregnancies forced them into what she viewed as sexual servitude.\n\"The women were lined up and demanding access to birth control,\" her grandson said.\nA USA Today poll in December found Americans overwhelmingly oppose cutting off federal funds for Planned Parenthood.\nOutside the crumbling Brooklyn building where the first U.S. birth control clinic opened 100 years ago, Alexander Sanger reflected on the move that landed his grandmother in jail and fueled a controversy over women's reproductive rights that has raged ever since.\nThey fitted women for diaphragms, which were the most effective birth control available at the time but were illegal under the federal Comstock Law against distributing materials that could be used for contraception."}
