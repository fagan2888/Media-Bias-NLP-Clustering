Mitt Romney, a Republican \u2013 health care spending in Massachusetts is growing at a slower rate than in the country overall.\n\n\n\nThe information was released on Tuesday during a two-day hearing on health care costs at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it will highlight the enormous progress Massachusetts has made in covering virtually all its residents and beginning to tackle the national problem of controlling health care costs in a manner that improves the quality of care,\u201d said Glen Shor, secretary of the Executive Office for Administration and Finance.\n\n\n\nThe positive data on health care cost controls doesn\u2019t mean the Bay State is where it should or wants to be on making care affordable. Massachusetts residents are still spending more than the national average on their health care.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the health-care stakeholders in Massachusetts are still working together to improve health care and contain its costs \u2013 over the last half dozen years \u2013 should be an inspiration to the folks in Washington who don\u2019t seem to grasp the notion that time and an open mind can heal all wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, editorials, massachusetts-health-care-reform, mitt-romney, opinion", "title": "Editorial: Massachusetts health-care costs under control", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: Massachusetts health-care costs under control\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/10/editorial_massachusetts_health.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/11293555-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11358840\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-04T10:20:52Z\", \"author\": \"The Republican Editorials\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"editorials\",\"massachusetts-health-care-reform\",\"mitt-romney\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/11293555-standard.jpg", "description": "Seven years after the state's health-care reform bill was enacted, health-care spending in Massachusetts is growing at a slower rate than in the country overall.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@masslivenews"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, October 04, 2013,  6:20 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/opinion_impact/photo/062812-mitt-romney-repeal-obamacarejpg-3c234f498cf82e7f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"the-republican-editorials\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Republican Editorials\", \"author_id\": \"8000352\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Editorials & Opinion - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Seven years after the state's health-care reform bill was enacted, health-care spending in Massachusetts is growing at a slower rate than in the country overall.", "title": "Editorial: Massachusetts health-care costs under control", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/10/editorial_massachusetts_health.html", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/11293555-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, October 04, 2013,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "The Republican Editorials", "Description": "Seven years after the state's health-care reform bill was enacted, health-care spending in Massachusetts is growing at a slower rate than in the country overall."}, "article_summary": "The information was released on Tuesday during a two-day hearing on health care costs at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.\nMitt Romney, a Republican \u2013 health care spending in Massachusetts is growing at a slower rate than in the country overall.\nMassachusetts residents are still spending more than the national average on their health care.\nThe positive data on health care cost controls doesn\u2019t mean the Bay State is where it should or wants to be on making care affordable.\nThat\u2019s because the commonwealth, the state\u2019s major health insurers and health care policy leaders have all been working together to make the 2006 law work."}
