She founded what later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York City in the 1920s.\n\nPast recipients of the Sanger Award include Martin Luther King Jr., Katharine Hepburn, Justice Harry Blackmun, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to the PPFA website, \u201cPlanned Parenthood is the nation\u2019s leading provider and advocate of high-quality, affordable health care for women, men, and young people, as well as the nation\u2019s largest provider of sex education. With more than 700 health centers across the country, Planned Parenthood organizations serve all patients with care and compassion, with respect and without judgment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a statement issue through Planned Parenthood\u2019s website, the group\u2019s president lauded Pelosi for her role in passing the Affordable Care Act and her ongoing commitment to ensuring \u201cthe promise of the law is realized for millions of women...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/03/24/pelosi-to-receive-highest-award-from-planned-parenthood-for-womens-health-care-work/", "image": {"width": 594, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/167519446.jpg?w=594", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/167519446.jpg?w=594", "height": 393}, "type": "article", "description": "In a statement issue through Planned Parenthood\u2019s website, the group\u2019s president lauded Pelosi for her role in passing the Affordable Care Act and her ongoing commitment to ensuring \u201cthe promise of the law is realized for millions of women as the greatest advancement for women\u2019s health in a generation.\u201d", "title": "Pelosi To Receive Highest Award From Planned Parenthood For Women's Health Care Work"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/167519446.jpg?w=594", "description": "In a statement issue through Planned Parenthood\u2019s website, the group\u2019s president lauded Pelosi for her role in passing the Affordable Care Act and her ongoing commitment to ensuring \u201cthe promise of the law is realized for millions of women as the greatest advancement for women\u2019s health in a generation.\u201d", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pelosi To Receive Highest Award From Planned Parenthood For Women's Health Care Work"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, cbs washington, health, politics, abortion, aca, affordable care act, cecile richards, contraception, federal health care, hillary clinton, house minority leader nancy pelosi, margaret sanger award, planned parenthood, planned parenthood federation of america cecile richards, ppfa, president, president obama, pro-life conservatives, reproductive rights, women's health", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "abortion, aca, affordable care act, cecile richards, contraception, federal health care, hillary clinton, house minority leader nancy pelosi, margaret sanger award, planned parenthood, planned parenthood federation of america cecile richards, ppfa, president, president obama, pro-life conservatives, reproductive rights, women's health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac77\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (CBS DC) \u2014 The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) will present House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi with their highest award on Thursday for her contributions to women\u2019s reproductive rights and health care.\nShe founded what later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York City in the 1920s.\nPast recipients of the Sanger Award include Martin Luther King Jr., Katharine Hepburn, Justice Harry Blackmun, and Hillary Clinton.\nWith more than 700 health centers across the country, Planned Parenthood organizations serve all patients with care and compassion, with respect and without judgment.\u201d\nThe California Democrat will receive the Margaret Sanger Award from America\u2019s \u201cmost trusted provider of reproductive health care\u201d for her work in expanding women\u2019s access to health care during her career as the first woman to serve as speaker of the House."}
