So far the results have been mixed.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to be the great project of my autumn, but that\u2019s how it turned out. Over the past two months, in rapid succession, one of oldest and closest friends died, I sprinted to the finish line of the memoir I\u2019ve been writing about my cancer, and I found myself confronted unexpectedly with more than one painful reminder of the people who\u2019d let me down the hardest when I needed help the most. The perfect storm of intense events didn\u2019t just make me sad; it made me surprisingly furious. And then one chilly, misty afternoon, I took a long walk through my local park, overwhelmed with grief and rage, until I came home and collapsed in tears. I missed my friend. I missed my friend who\u2019d always been so steadfast and kind, not to just to me but, importantly, to my family. And I felt freshly stung by the people I had loved and trusted who hadn\u2019t been. That\u2019s when I realized I had to get to work.\n\nSo I gathered a bunch of friends together for some drinks and a healthy reality check of the abundance I do have. I worked more consciously on keeping a daily gratitude list, one of the easiest and most life changing things a person can do to feel good. I made a concerted effort to find opportunities for small acts of generosity I could do for others. And I asked a few wise friends how they have gotten through their own hardest moments of resentment and betrayal. And what they told me was exactly what I needed to hear.\n\nMy friend Cynthia, who was affected by last year\u2019s disaster in Colorado, says, \u201cI am still struggling with this HARD after my apartment was destroyed in last year\u2019s flood, and complete and utter radio silence from people whom I know knew. Unfortunately, I found out that some people I\u2019d have walked through fire for wouldn\u2019t piss on me if I were on fire. I am sadder now. I have cut off a number of people. With others, I try to focus on what other things they bring to the relationship, things that are positive about them that might give a tiny inkling that they actually care.\u201d And, she says, she\u2019s more aware now of the times she likely dropped the ball for others, and so she\u2019s cultivating the \u201cForgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\u201d attitude more. It\u2019s a very useful attitude \u2013 if a hard one to put into practice. We all have things we need forgiveness for, and we probably have things we don\u2019t even know we need forgiveness for. I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t won any gold medals at the Sensitivity Olympics in my time. And remembering that keeps pain from turning into self-righteousness.\n\n\u201cI recently started seeing a life/career coach because I\u2019m trying to get control of my life after years of stress and hell,\u201d says Inez, a beloved friend who\u2019s emerging from a contentious divorce and tumultuous work challenges. \u201cBefore we talked about anything else, my coach talked about forgiveness, for when you just can\u2019t believe someone would do what they did.\u201d She says, \u201cThe first thing I did was forgive myself. I went through everything I feel like I\u2019ve done to hurt others, and one by one I forgave myself for each act. I went through EVERYTHING, digging out stuff I haven\u2019t wanted to deal with ever. And I felt this weight lift and everything become more clear. It was amazing \u2014 and it only took an hour of my life. This week, I\u2019m making a list of people to forgive. It\u2019s way harder. I\u2019ve come upon this realization: I don\u2019t have to forgive the act. The act is still shitty. But I\u2019m finding acceptance of the person behind the act, and the feelings that may have precipitated the act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sifting through memories as I wrote my book, I had to let go of bitterness toward the loved ones who'd let me down", "title": "My imperfect forgiveness project: How writing a memoir forced me to deal with old resentments", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sifting through memories as I wrote my book, I had to let go of bitterness toward the loved ones who'd let me down", "title": "My imperfect forgiveness project: How writing a memoir forced me to deal with old resentments", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/27/my_imperfect_forgiveness_project_how_writing_a_memoir_forced_me_to_deal_with_old_resentments/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/gift.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sifting through memories as I wrote my book, I had to let go of bitterness toward the loved ones who'd let me down", "title": "My imperfect forgiveness project: How writing a memoir forced me to deal with old resentments", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/gift.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cancer, Editor's Picks, forgiveness, Life stories, PTSD", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1c6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Cancer, Editor's Picks, forgiveness, Life stories, PTSD, Life NewsI\u2019ve been working lately on forgiveness.\nI missed my friend who\u2019d always been so steadfast and kind, not to just to me but, importantly, to my family.\nWe all have things we need forgiveness for, and we probably have things we don\u2019t even know we need forgiveness for.\nBut I\u2019m finding acceptance of the person behind the act, and the feelings that may have precipitated the act.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t expect this to be the great project of my autumn, but that\u2019s how it turned out."}
