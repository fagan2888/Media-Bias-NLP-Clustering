You see, I still have a pre-Obamacare health insurance plan, and I only get $1,500 in prescription drug coverage every year.\n\nFor those of you under the age of 50, or living outside of the US, prescription drug prices are obscene in the US. Take the Asmanex I\u2019m now on for my asthma. It\u2019s much cheaper than the Advair I was on before. Asmanex is \u201conly\u201d $193 per month.\n\nAnd guess how much I bought the same Asmanex, made by the same pharmaceutical company (Merck), for this past summer in Paris?\n\n$25.\n\nYes, Merck charges American citizens nearly 8x what it charges Europeans. Why? Because they can. Americans are quite literally subsidizing \u201csocialized medicine\u201d (as the Republicans love to call it) in Europe. And our politicians are doing nothing to stop it. In fact, they\u2019re doing everything to protect it. You see, US law forbids the US government from negotiating with drug companies to get better prices in the Medicare program, for example. So, seniors get socked with higher bills.\n\nAlso, US laws bars Americans traveling abroad from bringing more than 3 months\u2019 worth of prescription drugs home with them. Why? Because the FDA claims they\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll buy bad knock-off drugs, and kill yourself. What horrible sewer-like countries is the FDA concerned you might buy drugs from? Canada.\n\nFrom the FDA Web site:\n\nIs it legal for me to personally import drugs? In most circumstances, it is illegal for individuals to import drugs into the United States for personal use. This is because drugs from other countries that are available for purchase by individuals often have not been approved by FDA for use and sale in the United States. For example, if a drug is approved by Health Canada (FDA\u2019s counterpart in Canada) but has not been approved by FDA, it is an unapproved drug in the United States and, therefore, illegal to import. FDA cannot ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs that it has not approved.\n\nSeriously \u2014 Canada?\n\nBut let\u2019s look at this a bit more closely. I\u2019ve been buying my asthma drugs in France. They\u2019re the same drugs, made and sold by the same companies that sell them to me in America, but at a 3 to 8 times mark-up. Does the FDA seriously expect us to believe that it\u2019s protecting us from Merck\u2019s, GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s and AstraZeneca\u2019s \u201cunsafe\u201d drugs they sell to Europeans? Seriously?\n\nIf Advair, Symbicort and Asmanex are so unsafe, then why are they sold in America at all? We\u2019re to believe that unsafe drugs suddenly become safe simply because the drug companies charge American several hundred dollars more than they charge Europeans for a one-month supply?\n\nAnd adding to the fun, countries like France have a national health care system similar to Medicare \u2014 there\u2019s a national plan, and then a supplemental private plan that you can pay extra for if you want additional coverage. Because the French government negotiates with drug companies, and gets the price down by a factor of anyone from 3 to 8, the drug companies simply make up the difference by charing Americans more.\n\nA lot more.\n\nSo is anyone really surprised that having a baby, even a premature birth, cost a million bucks? My dad got sick last year, and his bill came in at a whopping $1.4 million. Fortunately, all but $400 was paid for by Medicare. But seriously, $1.4 million? How many million-dollar cotton-swabs were included in that bill?\n\nObamacare was only the beginning of the kind of reform our country needs. And a big part of the reform is the insane prices that we get charged for all kinds of medical services. It\u2019s basically one big pyramid scheme, where hospitals and doctors fleece each other, when they\u2019re not fleecing you and me.\n\nWhen will enough be enough?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Canadian family is refusing to pay a Hawaii hospital million-dollar-bill for their baby's premature birth while visting on vacation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "A Canadian family is refusing to pay a Hawaii hospital million-dollar-bill for their baby's premature birth while visting on vacation.", "title": "Hawaii hospital charges Canadian family $1m for baby's birth", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/advair-symbicort-asmanex.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-19T19:05:32-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2014/11/hawaii-hospital-charges-canadian-family-1m-babys-birth.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Canadian family is refusing to pay a Hawaii hospital million-dollar-bill for their baby's premature birth while visting on vacation.", "creator": "@aravosis", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/blue-cross-canada.jpg", "title": "Hawaii hospital charges Canadian family $1m for baby's birth", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "published_time": "2014-11-20T08:00:52-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aravosis", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T19:05:32-04:00", "tag": "premature baby"}, "news_keywords": "ACA, Canada, Hawaii, health care reform, million dollar, Obamacare, premature baby"}, "article_summary": "Nonetheless, Blue Cross is refusing to cover the birth because the woman had a \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201dWhat was the deadly condition that this Canadian vixen failed to disclose to all-caring innocent-victim Blue Cross (even though the woman says Blue Cross never asked)?\nA Canadian family is refusing to pay a Hawaii hospital million-dollar-bill for their baby\u2019s premature birth while visiting on vacation.\nBecause the French government negotiates with drug companies, and gets the price down by a factor of anyone from 3 to 8, the drug companies simply make up the difference by charing Americans more.\nYou see, the insurance company that turned the family down was \u201cSaskatchewan Blue Cross\u201d \u2014 a Canadian company.\nYou see, I still have a pre-Obamacare health insurance plan, and I only get $1,500 in prescription drug coverage every year."}
