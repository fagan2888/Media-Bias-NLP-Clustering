Halloween is known to bring up some pretty problematic (and sometimes very racist) themes in America, and one Oklahoma woman was particularly affronted when she noticed her neighbors’ Obama tombstone, KOCO reports .

According to the report, Jamilla Phillips of Edmond was “absolutely offended” when she saw the fake tombstone across the street on her neighbors’ property. “He is the president of the United States and it actually is about respect," she said. "It’s a total respect thing because this person is still alive.”
