Now the tables have completely turned. Today, six in 10 Americans back owning a gun for safety, while only 30 percent believe it is dangerous.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, members of every political party are warming to the idea of gun ownership.\n\nRepublicans show the largest growth (37-percentage points since 2000) followed closely by Independents (29-point increase) and lastly Democrats (13-point growth).\n\nCuriously, despite the sharp turn in ideology, the average number of Americans who own a gun (42 percent) has hardly wavered over the past 14 years. Perhaps this will change as the benefits of the Second Amendment are more widely acknowledged.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Load 'em up. .05/25/2016 19:43:21PM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Load 'em up.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Poll: Political Parties Coming Together On Value of Gun Ownership", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/11/09/draft-n1916309", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/266/2014-09-23T222304Z_1_LYNXNPEA8M10J_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Load 'em up.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Poll: Political Parties Coming Together On Value of Gun Ownership", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/11/09/draft-n1916309", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/266/2014-09-23T222304Z_1_LYNXNPEA8M10J_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Political Parties Coming Together On Value of Gun Ownership , Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedeb\"", "article_summary": "Since 2000, the percentage of Americans who believe that gun ownership makes their homes safer has nearly doubled, according to a Gallup poll released Friday.\nWhat\u2019s more, members of every political party are warming to the idea of gun ownership.\nToday, six in 10 Americans back owning a gun for safety, while only 30 percent believe it is dangerous.\nCuriously, despite the sharp turn in ideology, the average number of Americans who own a gun (42 percent) has hardly wavered over the past 14 years.\nRepublicans show the largest growth (37-percentage points since 2000) followed closely by Independents (29-point increase) and lastly Democrats (13-point growth)."}
