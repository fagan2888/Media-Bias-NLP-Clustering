Photo: Maarten Holl/Dominion Post\n\nThe name may not ring a bell for some immediately but just about every Australian owes something to Albert Productions. For 10 glorious years from 1974, Albert Productions practically owned the Australian music industry. Or a good chunk of it that sat on your shelves, pumped out of your AM radio or filled the sticky carpeted, beer-stinking, sweat-coated pubs and clubs you spent your nights at.\n\nOver those 10 years, the production house and label that began in Sydney in 1964 as an offshoot of the powerful publishing house, instrument retailer and radio and TV network owner, J. Albert & Son, produced 20 per cent of the music on the Australian charts, regularly having three or four tracks in the top 20 at the one time.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t AC/DC and Stevie Wright, or an older hit by the Aztecs and Easybeats, it was the Angels, Rose Tattoo, Cheetah or John Paul Young. And if they slowed down there was the Choirboys, the glam pop (briefly) of William Shakespeare or the mysterious Euro-pop of Flash And The Pan, most of it recorded in the King Street studios in central Sydney.\n\nCritical support: Strictly Ballroom was funded by an Albert Productions' company.\n\nThen, just when it seemed the tide had gone out after that outrageous run of success, along came the film Strictly Ballroom. The film, a worldwide hit, was funded by an Albert production company, had its soundtrack recorded at the Alberts studio and gave the world not just the film's director Baz Luhrmann but yet another revival of Love Is in the Air .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile these days the label is doing publishing deals with Wally de Backer (aka Gotye), Megan Washington, Abbe May and Kathryn Rollins or label figureheads Dallas Crane or recording an act in the Neutral Bay studios with in-house producer Wayne Connolly that you don\u2019t even know exists yet. Or AC/DC, who even without an ailing Malcolm Young are back in the studio and likely to be back on stage in the next year for what will likely be another massive tour.\n\nFrankly, if you haven\u2019t been touched by Albert Productions in some way in the past 50 years, you have been living what could only be described as a rather sheltered life. .\n\nSeriously talented: Harry Vanda, left, and George Young at work.\n\nWith the labels 's 50th anniversarythis year comes a flurry of reissues and boxed sets, giving a fine slice of the hits along with some of the lesser-known songs that emerged from the various offices and studios (see panel, opposite page).\n\nBut among the stars it\u2019s worth remembering \u201ca whole lot of like-minded individuals and bands who were all incredibly focused and had a sense of destiny\u201d, says David Albert, son of chairman Robert Albert and Albert Productions\u2019 managing director.\n\nThose people include his uncle Ted, who started Albert Productions and produced the Easybeats; songwriters/producers George Young and Harry Vanda, who went from the Easybeats to be the powerhouses behind so many hits; and Fifa Riccobono. She started in 1968 as a secretary and by the \u201990s was the first woman CEO of any music company in Australia, and after three separate stints at Alberts still has a role with key clients \u2013 including, of course, AC/DC.\n\nThis year's model: Dallas Crane carries the flag for Albert Productions in the 21st century. Photo: Jacky Ghossein\n\n\u201cIt was partly Ted\u2019s way that no one was better than anybody else and between Ted, Harry and George, they created this,\u201d Riccobono says, The key was the trust they had in each other and the desire to work for each other, part of what enabled her to be a groundbreaker for women in the notoriously sexist Australian music industry she says.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that allowed me to do the things that I do and to do them as well as I could do them, was I always had Ted\u2019s backing,\u201d Riccobono says now. \u201cHaving someone back you like that makes you go out and fight as hard as possible. I never wanted to come back and let him down, or fail George and Harry.\u201d\n\nAnd while Albert Productions is often referred to as the house AC/DC built \u2013 and the hard rock band built around George Young\u2019s younger brothers Malcolm and Angus still is the central plank of the business \u2013 those three men and later Riccobono (\u201cshe was always there, from the first day really,\u201d Malcolm Young once said) did the heavy lifting as a partnership.\n\nCheers: Steve Wright of the Easybeats in 1986, another of Albert Productions' signings.\n\n\u201cPeople outside the business tended to give George and Harry all the credit for what went on, which I don\u2019t think is appropriate,\u201d former A&R manager Chris Gilbey told family biographer Jane Albert some years back. \u201cI think George and Harry made great records but I think Ted gave them a canvas on which to paint, free reign.\u201d\n\nThis was always acknowledged by Vanda and Young \u2013 who never actually signed a contract with Albert Productions as it all worked on trust - with George Young quoted in Jane Albert\u2019s book, House Of Hits, saying that \u2018\u2018Ted was always concerned about the music and the song\u201d above anything else.\n\n\u201cGet it right, get the song right, get the music right, get the mix right. And only then when you are happy that you have the absolute best out of the song, out of the record, out of the mix, then you release it,\u201d Young said. \u201cYou did not release records to schedules or deadlines, or because the manager or a radio station had to have it on their playlists. You released the record when the record was finished. It was the music that called the shots and that was Ted's philosophy.\u201d\n\nSupport: Ted Albert advanced AC/DC a lot of the money in the early days so the band could tour. Photo: Murray\n\nStevie Wright \u2013 the singer of the Easybeats, co-writer of their earliest hits, later a solo star with the radio format-busting Evie (Parts 1, 2 and 3) and the quintessential Australian frontman of the '60s \u2013 backs that description of Ted Albert\u2019s philosophy. Remembering how Ted Albert watched them perform for the first time from the back of the room (\u201ca bit like Brian Epstein seeing the Beatles\u201d), he says \u201cwe were recording with someone who was interested in us\u201d.\n\n\u201cGeorge left work. I left work,\u201d Wright says. \u201cBecause we felt something would happen.\u201d\n\nThe music man in Ted Albert, amplified by Vanda and Young, was remembered by Tony Barber, a member of Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, the first signing to the label in 1964.\n\nStars of today: Gotye has a publishing deal with Albert Productions. Photo: Rohan Thomson\n\n\u201cTed Albert asked me to visit him at his office. We were the only ones in the room. Ted was seated at a large desk, cushioned between two heavy wooden speaker boxes. He had just produced a record and wanted me to be one of the first to hear it,\u201d Barber says. \u201cHe told me it was called Sorry. He didn\u2019t tell me who the artist was. We sat there in silence as we listened to it. It absolutely blew me away. After the last note of the song we looked impassively at each other\u2019s face. Twenty seconds later Ted spoke first. \"What do you think, Tony?\" I replied: \u2018\u2018Ted ... you and I know we\u2019ve just listened to a number one hit record. It\u2019s sensational.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2018A smile formed across Ted\u2019s face that stretched from ear to ear. I was looking at a happy and justifiably proud man whose same opinion had been endorsed. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be the last time, either.\u201d\n\nAnd to prove that history lives on 50 years later, Dave Larkins of Dallas Crane, a band whose sound and philosophy echoes the golden years of both Alberts and Australian rock, recalls the thrill of meeting the co-writer of Sorry. \u201cGeorge [Young] has done it all; written, performed, produced. Anything with his name on it is usually pretty amazing,\u201d Larkins says. \u201cHe went out of his way to meet us when he was in Australia \u2013 even took us out to lunch. We tried to talk him into doing a record with us. It was only going to cost a carton of duty-free Marlboro Reds.\u201d\n\nGood Times: Celebrating 50 years of Albert Productions is out on August 15. The five-CD box set has 102 tracks \u2013 including two previously unreleased songs \u2013 from Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs\u2019 Mashed Potato through to Doc Neeson\u2019s recently recorded cover of Flash and the Pan\u2019s Walking In The Rain.\n\nWhat the musicians say...\n\nAngus Young\n\n\u201cWhen we first went out there, we were lucky enough to get a deal with Alberts even before we left Australia, so that was good for us. We didn\u2019t have to go shopping ourselves, but what was good was that Ted [Albert] advanced us a lot of the money so as we could get out there and tour and back-up the records. For him it was a long-term investment, but it paid in the end. It all helped.\u2019\u2019 Told to Jane Albert in the book House of Hits.\n\nDoc Neeson of the Angels\n\n\u201cWe were working with George and Harry, so it was like working with gods.\u201d Told to Music Max.\n\nStevie Wright\n\nFavourite Alberts song: Land of Make Believe. It was a Vanda/Young song \u2013 Harry was lead vocal, Steve Marriot was on it. I think Tony Cahill had joined us by then. Pat and Olivia had some guest vocals too, I think. I carried a torch for Olivia then. I played tambourine. I broke the skin of the tambourine but continued to play.\u201d\n\nTony Barber of the first Albert Production signing, the Aztecs\n\n\u2018\u2018\u2018Song searching\u2019 was a competitive sport. A race. Almost an Olympic sport. During the period of 1964-1968, every band and artist was looking for that elusive song that would get them into the charts and give them a hit. It was a race to find and record particular songs first. I loved the musical atmosphere and tension it created. We won some of those races, we lost some.\u201d\n\nWayne Connolly, of Knievel and now in-house producer/writer at Alberts\n\nFavourite Alberts song: \u201cPretty hard to go past Friday On My Mind, of course, but if we are going past it, then Remember Me, an early psych-pop classic complete with electric sitar on Ted Mulry\u2019s first album.\n\nMark Opitz, engineer and producer for Alberts through the 1970s and \u201980s\n\n\u201cIt was a small, tight unit. It was just George and Harry, myself, Fiff Riccobono and the two girls working in the office ... You were struck by the \u2018us against the world\u2019 thing, the reverse siege mentality. It was very clubby.\u201d From House Of Hits.\n\nJohn Paul Young\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for every one of their songs and I still enjoy performing them all. I\u2019m a fan and I\u2019ve always been a fan of George and Harry\u2019s, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d From House Of Hits.\n\nJohn Brewster of the Angels\n\nFavourite Alberts song: \u201cToo many favourites for me but, because of the lyric and because Bon [Scott] was such a great singer, I\u2019ll pick Long Way to the Top [by AC/DC]. That song, that lyric, resonates so much when remembering how tough it was touring Australia in the old EH station wagon trying to get the band up the ladder. It speaks for all of us rock\u2019n\u2019rollers.\n\nHerm Kovak, member of the Ted Mulry Gang\n\n\u201c[Alberts] really had a family vibe to it. Ted Albert and Fifa Riccobono really cared about their acts: without fail every royalty statement up to his passing had a personal handwritten note and Fifa carried that on. We were the last band Ted Albert produced and the only act that had him play tambourine on records. It was the love of The Goons that was the connection.\n\n\u2018\u2018We were probably the only people at Alberts that heard his repertoire of Goons' voices.\u201d\n\nDave Larkins of Dallas Crane\n\n\u201cObviously the heritage was a contributing factor [in signing to Alberts], but the main attraction was having a small artist roster, and a label that really seemed to care about what we were on about artistically on all fronts. We got signed on a demo of, let\u2019s just say, not our most commercially viable material. We were impressed that they saw potential and range in our writing abilities. We wanted to be the band that came in and reinvigorated the Alberts recording brand, and I think they were happy for us to be that band as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Music", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Albert Productions, the record label behind AC/DC, Stevie Wright, the Easybeats and so many more, have shaped Aussie rock by backing their signings to the hilt.", "title": "Albert Productions, the label behind AC/DC, rocks up 50 years", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/albert-productions-the-label-behind-acdc-rocks-up-50-years-20140807-1018kh.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/08/07/5659948/1407714548593.jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 60523937}, "description": "Albert Productions, the record label behind AC/DC, Stevie Wright, the Easybeats and so many more, have shaped Aussie rock by backing their signings to the hilt."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb597\"", "article_summary": "But among the stars it\u2019s worth remembering \u201ca whole lot of like-minded individuals and bands who were all incredibly focused and had a sense of destiny\u201d, says David Albert, son of chairman Robert Albert and Albert Productions\u2019 managing director.\nMusicLoyal: Albert Productions, the label of AC/DC, backed them from day one.\nPhoto: Maarten Holl/Dominion PostThe name may not ring a bell for some immediately but just about every Australian owes something to Albert Productions.\nWe were the last band Ted Albert produced and the only act that had him play tambourine on records.\nThis year's model: Dallas Crane carries the flag for Albert Productions in the 21st century."}
