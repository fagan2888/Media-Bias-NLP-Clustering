From cartoonist Clay Jones about ‘Ben Carson and a Grain of Truth,’ the purpose of the pyramids, and other possible Ben Carson tall tales

There’s something going on with Ben Carson. Liberals are playing with theories. They range from the man is brilliant but may be an idiot savant or that he only knows one thing but knows it’s really well to the theory that he’s a freaking idiot or a sociopath. Carson supporters tend to ignore it.

News came out that Dr. Carson stated seven years ago that the Egyptian pyramids were not built to serve as tombs but to store grain. You would think if you Googled “Carson” and “pyramid” that the word “scheme” would show up. But anyway, it’s a “God thing” for Carson. I really don’t like to disrespect anyone’s faith, but it’s hard when people use it to justify their stupidity.

Intelligent people are actually having to spend time explaining why this ridiculous pyramid belief is not true. But does Carson still feel that way? You bet he does. He doubled down on it. He also stated that many scientists believe aliens built the pyramids. Now I don’t think the man knows what a scientist is.

Let’s waste a little space and play with crazy: The pyramids are not hollow. Scientists don’t believe aliens built them. The Egyptians actually wrote what the pyramids were for. The pyramids’ purpose is not a mystery. It’s not Stonehenge, but someone should ask Dr. Carson about that. Maybe he’ll say Jesus built them as a testament that gay people shouldn’t be allowed to sing karaoke.

Today, many people are thinking Carson is crazy, yet it may not be the most baffling thing he’s claimed.

This man has stated he’s qualified to serve as president because the Titanic, which sank, was built by professionals. Noah’s Ark was built by amateurs. Got a headache yet? The Titanic was real. Noah’s Ark is mythology. And I don’t care how much God has faith in the guy, I’d rather take a Carnival cruise than ride on a wooden boat built by a 300-year-old man.

He’s also stated people go into prison straight and come out gay.

He claims he never had an involvement with a company selling snake oil despite being paid by them to give speeches and being prominently featured on their website.

He’s stated Obamacare is worse than slavery. That’s red meat for Republicans.

He believes Fox News has saved the United States from becoming another Cuba.

He doesn’t understand the debt ceiling. He’s believes Congress can remove Supreme Court Justices if they rule an opinion the majority of citizens don’t like.

While saying people should rush shooters, he described an incident when he had a gun pulled on him in a Baltimore Popeyes (in which he did not actually rush the gunman but rather told him he needed to rob the man behind the counter). The Baltimore police say they can’t verify the incident ever happened.

Speaking of being unable to verify stuff Carson claims, he says he was violent when he was younger. He attacked his mother once and his brother pulled him off. He attacked people with rocks, bricks and baseball bats. He once attempted to stab a fellow student when he was a teenager. CNN tried talking to people who knew Carson when he was younger, and not one person can remember him ever being a hostile person. It’s called lying.

A lot of conservatives have this narrative that Obama came out of nowhere. That nobody knew him when he was younger, as a kid, or as a high school or college student. That’s really not true, but they still believe it. It will be interesting to see how these people handle Carson’s fictional violent childhood as a member of The Warriors.

I don’t know what’s funnier, the stuff Carson says or the fact he’s leading in a lot of polls.

I’m OK with Carson and Trump leading the polls. If Republicans are too stupid to nominate someone with real talent and a real danger of winning, like Marco Rubio, then that’s fine with me.
