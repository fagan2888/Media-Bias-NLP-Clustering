sioux falls, sd

Street construction crews will be working on a number of projects across Sioux Falls in the coming days. A couple of those projects could impact your travel around the city.

On Monday morning, northbound traffic will be reduced to one lane on North Sycamore Avenue between East 10th Street and East Taylor Street while contractors replace the retaining wall on the east side of the road. A lane will also be closed on East 18th Street near Sycamore Avenue, so the city is warning the area could be congested for drivers in that area. The work is expected to be done by July 15.

Also on Monday morning, work will resume on Westport Avenue from Sencore Drive through the Benson Road intersection. Westport Avenue will be closed so traffic will be detoured north on I-29 to 60th Street North and south on I-29 to Russell Street. You will be able to get to businesses near the Sanford Sports Complex off of 60th Street North, south on Westport Avenue to 51st Street. Crews expect to be done on this project by the end of June.

Here are other projects getting underway this week:

Six Mile Road Construction

Beginning on Tuesday, June 16, 2015, Six Mile Road will be closed at Willow Wood Street to allow construction crews to begin work on a water main connection in the intersection.

This work is anticipated to be finished by the evening of June 17, 2015.
