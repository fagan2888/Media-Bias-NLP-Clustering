John Russell Houser stood up about 20 minutes into Thursday night's showing of \"Trainwreck\" and fired on the audience with a semi-automatic handgun.\n\nA decade of documented mental health issues didn\u2019t preclude John Russell Houser from purchasing a handgun from an Alabama pawn shop last year. That gun would later be used in a lethal assault against moviegoers during which Houser shot 11 people \u2014 two of whom died \u2014 before taking his own life.\n\nA week after the move theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana, information has surfaced about Houser\u2019s checkered past and the missed opportunities for authorities to treat him and stop his attempt to buy a weapon. For instance, a report shows that the judge on Houser\u2019s case could do nothing beyond recommend he undergo a mental health evaluation if necessary, despite family members\u2019 warnings about his bipolar disorder and imminent danger to others.\n\nA 1968 federal law prohibits the sale of handguns to those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility. However, procedures and situations that call for involuntary commitments vary between states, often confusing federal authorities about the steps that should be taken. Second Amendment advocates admit it\u2019s a challenge to balance guaranteeing public safety and allowing gun owners to exercise their rights.\n\nEven so, Muscogee County Probate Judge Marc E. D\u2019Antonio, the chief clerk during Houser\u2019s case, told the Washington Post that involuntary commitment could have alerted state and national law agencies to the danger Houser posed to himself and others: \u201cIf he had been adjudicated in need of involuntary treatment, I would have reported that to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, who would then send it to the FBI,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said. \u201cI clearly would have known. That did not happen.\u201d\n\nIn the days after the theater shooting, lawmakers and mental health experts expressed similar sentiments. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal (R) called for all states to include mental health information in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, telling Face the Nation\u2019s John Dickerson that Louisiana already reports relevant data. During a press conference last week, Russell County Sheriff Health Taylor pointed out that budget cuts have weakened the quality of Alabama\u2019s mental health care.\n\nThough Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine, warned against labeling all people with mental illness as dangerous, he told the Washington Times the recent mass shooting highlighted gaps in America\u2019s mental health care system. \u201cForty percent of people with serious mental illness are going without treatment \u2014 our systems are fragmented and overburdened,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWhen do we pay attention to this? We pay attention when there\u2019s a horrifying mass casualty shooting, and then people say: Let\u2019s fix the system.\u201d\n\nFewer than 8 percent of American adults receive mental health services, most of which private insurance covers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Today, more children and low-income and elderly people can access preventative mental health services through Medicare and Medicaid. Even so, out-of-pocket costs for inpatient and outpatient mental health services still remain high compared to that of a gun purchase \u2014 especially in non-Medicaid expansion states. Additionally, many states in the years after the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage haven\u2019t been able to keep up with the demand for treatment among the mentally ill.\n\nMass shootings that made national headlines have provided some opportunity to critique the nation\u2019s current mental health care system and rally for background checks that take one\u2019s history of mental illness into account.\n\nThe Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, for instance, spurred lawmakers to work toward comprehensive mental health care reform \u2014 efforts that have since stalled. Authorities learned that long before convicted shooter James Holmes opened fire on moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, he had a documented history of mental illness that included meetings with three mental health professionals and a report to the University of Colorado\u2019s Behavior Evaluation and Threat Assessment team. This hot-button issue could also affect veterans. Ivan Lopez, the Iraq War veteran behind the mass shooting on the Fort Hood military base, also purchased a semiautomatic pistol with ease, despite his history of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe nuances of the mental health-gun safety link notwithstanding, mental health advocates argue that tackling this issue requires some acknowledgement that lawmakers should prioritize improving the U.S. mental health care system. However, many GOP lawmakers have failed to take concrete legislative steps in this area.\n\nIn 2008, GOP lawmakers voted 145-47 against the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act \u2014 a law that would require insurance providers to treat mental health services like those for physical health. In June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) vetoed a bipartisan mental health bill that would allow doctors in the state to hold mentally ill patients who pose a danger to themselves and others for an additional four hours. Reports later surfaced that he did so out of a belief that mental illnesses don\u2019t exist.\n\nSome advocates argue such a lax attitude has prevented the appropriate reforms from taking place. During an interview with CBS News, Sen. Joe Machin (D-WA) criticized the National Rifle Association and other gun lobbyists for their part in his background check proposal\u2019s defeat, saying that the Lafayette theater shooting illustrates why his GOP colleagues need to more seriously focus on mental health. If it passed, his 2013 legislation would have required background checks on all commercial sales of guns.\n\n\u201cI need my friends on the Republican side of the aisle to help us with a most reasonable, seasonable path forward,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not gun control, it\u2019s just saying that, listen, if you go to a gun show, commercial transaction, we need to know who you are and if you\u2019ve had a problem before, if you\u2019ve been criminal or a mental problem. And if you go on the Internet. Those are two areas that we don\u2019t have personal contact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It's just the latest example.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It's just the latest example.", "title": "One Change To Our Gun Laws That Could Have Prevented The Last Mass Shooting", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/07/28/3685169/gun-laws-mental-health-lafayette/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theatre-shooting-aftermath.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's just the latest example.", "title": "One Change To Our Gun Laws That Could Have Prevented The Last Mass Shooting", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theatre-shooting-aftermath-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theatre-shooting-aftermath.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theatre-shooting-aftermath.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-28T13:13:06+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "That did not happen.\u201dIn the days after the theater shooting, lawmakers and mental health experts expressed similar sentiments.\nA 1968 federal law prohibits the sale of handguns to those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility.\nDuring a press conference last week, Russell County Sheriff Health Taylor pointed out that budget cuts have weakened the quality of Alabama\u2019s mental health care.\nA decade of documented mental health issues didn\u2019t preclude John Russell Houser from purchasing a handgun from an Alabama pawn shop last year.\nToday, more children and low-income and elderly people can access preventative mental health services through Medicare and Medicaid."}
