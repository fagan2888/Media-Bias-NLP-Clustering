Arriving amid chaos, police officers shot and killed two unarmed men, one of them developmentally disabled, and wounded four other unarmed civilians.\n\nAll of the victims were Black. Four of the seven officers eventually charged are Black or Hispanic. The other three are White.\n\nAfter Louisiana prosecutors botched the case against the seven officers, producing a mistrial, the Holder Justice Department took over and obtained convictions. However, the Justice Department engaged in conduct so egregiously unethical that the district court overturned the convictions. And this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed that ruling in stinging opinion condemning the DOJ prosecutors.\n\nOnce again, as Christian Adams says, the Holder Justice Department did what it does best \u2014 delay and deny justice. (Adams\u2019 account is here; Andy McCarthy\u2019s is here. I draw in this post from these two accounts, both of which deserve to be read.)\n\nWhat was the nature of the federal prosecutors\u2019 misconduct? It began with a campaign to inflame potential jurors through the local media, including blogs.\n\nSal Perricone, a high-ranking prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, using a fake name, posted commentary on Nola.com, the website of the Times-Picayune, that (in the words of the Court of Appeals) \u201ccastigated the defendants and their lawyers and repeatedly chastised the New Orleans Police Department as a fish \u2018rotten from the head down.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerricone was joined in this outrageous misconduct by Jan Mann, the first assistant to the U.S. attorney.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Washington, Karla Dobinski, a veteran of Holder\u2019s Civil Rights Division, also posted inflammatory commentary under at least one assumed name. Ironically \u2014 appallingly \u2014 Dobinsky was part of the DOJ \u201ctaint team\u201d in this case. As such, she was assigned to protect the civil rights of the indicted defendants.\n\nThe cover-up, we are often told, is usually worse than the crime. In this case, the cover-up gave the offense a good run for its money.\n\nIt began when, after the trial in which the police officers were convicted, the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans, flanked by Jan Mann, assured the trial judge \u2014 Kurt Engelhardt \u2014 that no one else in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office knew about Perricone\u2019s smear campaign. Later Mann, who was assigned to investigate the matter, told the judge that, indeed, Perricone was the sole culprit.\n\nYet, as noted above, Mann herself had engaged in the same kind of misconduct as Perricone.\n\nThe Justice Department was also less than forthcoming about the involvement of Dobinski, the Civil Rights Division lawyer who was supposed to protect the defendants\u2019 rights, in the blogging campaign against the defendants. This devastating information had to be pried out of the DOJ.\n\nFor example, the DOJ\u2019s chief prosecutor in the case, Barbara Bernstein, told the district court that no member of \u201cthe trial team\u201d had commented online. As the court made clear, however, its concern was not limited to just the \u201cteam.\u201d And even after Bernstein revealed that DOJ lawyers based in New Orleans were posting anonymously, she never gave up Karla Dobinski, according to Adams.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s misconduct left Judge Engelhardt little choice but to reverse the convictions and blast the Department. This he did in a scathing 129-page opinion which describes the Justice Department\u2019s conduct as \u201cbizarre,\u201d \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cgrotesque.\u201d\n\nNow, the Fifth Circuit, noting that the Justice Department lawyers stoked a \u201cmob mentality\u201d against police officers, has affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to order a new trial. In addition to blasting the DOJ\u2019s rabble rousing blog campaign and dishonest \u201cinvestigation\u201d thereof, the court found that cooperating defendants called to testify by the government lied; that defense witnesses were intimidated from testifying; and that inexplicably gross sentencing disparities resulted from the government\u2019s plea bargains and charging practices.\n\nWhat has happened to the DOJ culprits? Perricone resigned. Mann retired with (as the Fifth Circuit made a point of noting) her \u201cpanoply of federal benefits intact,\u201d notwithstanding her bald-faced lies to the district court.\n\nAnd Dobinski? She remains in her high-paying job at the Civil Rights Division, in the unit that prosecutes police officers, having received only a \u201cbare reproof,\u201d as the appeals court describes it.\n\nFinally, Bernstein, who held out on the trial judge, received an award from Eric Holder for her work after the New Orleans police trial.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision on New Orleans fiasco provides a fitting coda to Eric Holder\u2019s ideology-driven reign of malfeasance at the DOJ. Now that Loretta Lynch is in charge, can we expect better?\n\nDuring the Lynch confirmation hearing, Adams reminds us, Ted Cruz asked Lynch what she intended to do about Dobinski\u2019s misconduct and continued employment. Lynch gave no substantive answer.\n\nThe question arises even more acutely now, in light of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "In the anarchy following Hurricane Katrina, a group of heavily armed New Orleans police officers was dispatched in response to an emergency call reporting shots being fired at police.
