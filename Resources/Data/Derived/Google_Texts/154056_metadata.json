(AP) - Tracking technology is now available to search and rescue personnel to help find residents who wander due to cognitive or neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, autism and Down Syndrome.\n\nThe Delta County Sheriff\u2019s Office purchased the tracking gear from Project Lifesaver International, which uses technology to locate an individual who wanders and is equipped with a radio transmitter wristband, according to the Daily Press of Escanaba (http://bit.ly/1xzf4ES ).\n\nTate Thompson, director of the Delta County Search and Rescue Team, attended the Train the Trainer course last week offered in Escanaba by Project Lifesaver International. Thompson is now certified to teach other rescuers and family members of program participants about the tracking program.\n\n\u201cWhen needed, surrounding participating counties can also use their equipment to help us find our people,\u201d said Thompson, explaining there are both vehicle-mounted and hand-held tracking units available.\n\nThompson was trained by St. Croix County Deputy Neil Johnson from Hudson, Wisconsin, who is an approved instructor with Project Lifesaver International. The program started in 1999 at the Search and Rescue Company of the Chesapeake Sheriff\u2019s Office in Virginia, said Johnson.\n\n\u201cProject Lifesaver is a program for at-risk wanderers, people who don\u2019t realize they need help or can\u2019t ask for help,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhen the time comes for enrollment, the appropriate residents and caregivers will be required to complete documentation and obtain some training. Residents enrolled in the program will wear a small personal radio transmitter around the wrist or ankle that emits an individualized tracking frequency signal. If an enrolled resident goes missing, the caregiver would notify 9-1-1. Trained emergency response teams would go to the wanderer\u2019s area and use a directional antenna tracking device to connect with the individual\u2019s specific frequency.\n\nMost individuals who wander are found within a few miles from home, said Johnson. With the Project Lifesaver technology, search times are drastically reduced from hours and days to minutes. Recovery times for individuals on the Project Lifesaver program can average about 30 minutes - 95 percent less than standard operations.\n\nThe program is offered locally through the generosity of county residents, social services organizations, businesses and foundations such as the Walmart Foundation among many other financial contributors.\n\nDelta County Sheriff Ed Oswald said the sheriff\u2019s department has discussed bringing this technology to the county for a while.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, (recently) retired Sheriff Gary Ballweg and I made searching for funds to pay for the program our top priority under special operations projects. Because of the great community we live in, $10,000 was received in about seven months. We are happy that Project Lifesaver will be fully operational by January 2015 and we will inform the community when the program is ready to accept enrollments.\u201d\n\nA few jurisdictions in the Upper Peninsula offer Project Lifesaver or a similar life-saving tracking program. Those agencies are the sheriff\u2019s offices in Menominee, Alger and Marquette counties. Tracking technology in these communities has been credited for quickly and safely locating several residents who have wandered including children and adults.\n\nPartners in the Delta County Project Lifesaver program include the Retired Senior Volunteer Program at the Menominee-Delta-Schoolcraft Community Action Agency, Perspectives Adult Day Care, and the Delta County Search and Rescue Team.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Press, http://www.dailypress.net", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tracking technology is now available to search and rescue personnel to help find residents who wander due to cognitive or neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism and Down Syndrome.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tracking technology is now available to search and rescue personnel to help find residents who wander due to cognitive or neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, autism and Down Syndrome.", "title": "Upper Michigan agency uses technology in searches", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/upper-michigan-agency-uses-technology-in-searches/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/83b9a15fa3ecfb2d650f6a7067006cb8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/83b9a15fa3ecfb2d650f6a7067006cb8.jpg", "description": "Tracking technology is now available to search and rescue personnel to help find residents who wander due to cognitive or neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism and Down Syndrome.", "card": "summary", "title": "Upper Michigan agency uses technology in searches"}, "Author": "Daily Press (Escanaba)", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "With the Project Lifesaver technology, search times are drastically reduced from hours and days to minutes.\nRecovery times for individuals on the Project Lifesaver program can average about 30 minutes - 95 percent less than standard operations.\nThompson is now certified to teach other rescuers and family members of program participants about the tracking program.\nTracking technology in these communities has been credited for quickly and safely locating several residents who have wandered including children and adults.\nPartners in the Delta County Project Lifesaver program include the Retired Senior Volunteer Program at the Menominee-Delta-Schoolcraft Community Action Agency, Perspectives Adult Day Care, and the Delta County Search and Rescue Team."}
