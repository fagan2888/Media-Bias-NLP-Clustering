* Matea Gold and Robert Costa report that the anti-Trump effort from within the GOP establishment is looking rather anemic:

When Donald Trump landed in Ohio this week, he got a taste of the meager Republican super PAC efforts aimed at him: a 47-second Web video clipping together some of his most provocative comments and a small airplane trailing a banner proclaiming, “Ohioans Can’t Trust Trump.” As the combative mogul enters his fifth month at the top of the GOP presidential field, attempts to derail him remain anemic, underfunded and unfocused — and they are likely to stay that way until the Iowa caucuses in less than 10 weeks. Most of the party’s financiers and top strategists are sitting on the sidelines. Many are reluctant to spend money against Trump after watching others fumble as they tried to handle his counter-punches. Others, citing past elections, remain confident that the race will eventually pivot away from him early next year.

They should just repeat “serenity now, serenity now” to themselves over and over.

* And have you ever said to yourself, “What America needs is a little more of a Cultural Revolution vibe”? Well Trump agrees:

GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump said late Tuesday that everyday Americans should monitor their neighbors for questionable behavior. “The real greatest resource is all of you, because you have all those eyes and you see what’s happening,” he told listeners in Myrtle Beach, S.C. “People move into a house a block down the road, you know who’s going in,” Trump continued. “You can see and you report them to the local police. “You’re pretty smart, right?” he asked his audience. “We know if there’s something going on, report them. Most likely you’ll be wrong, but that’s OK. “That’s the best way. Everybody’s their own cop in a way. You’ve got to do it. You’ve got to do it.”

Like my life isn’t busy enough already, now I have to start informing on my neighbors? Just think of the paperwork involved. And my favorite part is, “Most likely you’ll be wrong, but that’s OK.”
