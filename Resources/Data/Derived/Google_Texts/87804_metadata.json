Fogelman Professional Development Center in the college.\n\nFogelman Fit, now a staple in the college, includes exercise classes, plus yoga, karate and self-defense for students and university employees.\n\nStudents preparing to be leaders in corporate America will be expected to mirror their companies\u2019 commitment to good health, which will play an increasing role in the bottom line and corporate culture as executives dig in to contain insurance costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term process because there are so many cost variables,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cIf our students, as future leaders, can help their employers be more focused on preventive health not only will health care costs be maintained or be lower, but productivity will go up. People who feel better, work better.\u201d\n\nPromise Day is a tutorial in the underlying habits. Every student in the college was expected to visit three of five booths \u2014 representing Fogelman\u2019s pillars of health. They included the Fogelman Feud table, where students were rated on how well they responded to stress.\n\nParticipants that met the requirements got a healthy, free, 600-calorie lunch, prepared by Dan Bamrick, food and beverage director for the Fogelman Executive Center and Holiday Inn-University of Memphis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a day of everything coming together,\u201d said senior Brandon Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s like the reckoning of all you have worked for throughout the year.\u201d\n\nTuberville ties them all up in a three-credit class, Managing Employee Wellness, now mandatory for students in the management track.\n\n\u201cOne of the things this class is about is training students to understand the importance of health for corporations,\u201d said Tuberville. \u201cBut it first starts with them. At the beginning of the semester, they take a health assessment just like they would in a company. Each part of the semester focuses on something they are working on: maybe exercising, eating better or handling stress.\u201d\n\nA big part of the class is the workplace-like health fairs students are required to put on with local agencies. A group of students, for instance, assigned to learn all they can about domestic violence in Memphis might pair with the Memphis Area Women\u2019s Council.\n\nThey are graded on how compelling they make their presentations, including their booth\u2019s curb appeal.\n\nTuberville designed and teaches the course. She and Dr. Carol Danehower, also at Fogelman, will present the course\u2019s framework this summer at the Academy of Management annual meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\u201cThis is such a new part of HR, no textbook is complete. The employers are part of our curriculum,\u201d she said, ticking of a half-dozen corporate leaders who are guest lecturers, including Michael Drake, found of master IT here; Mary Spangler, occupational nurse at International Paper; and Jeff Weintraub, regional partner in Fisher & Phillips law firm.\n\nThe University rebranded Promise Day two years ago, hoping to raise the profile of what it takes to be healthy, ethical business leaders.\n\n\u201cWe get to know each other. It breaks down the barriers in everyday life and makes it a more sociable event,\u201d said student Ashley Minks.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Promise Day at U of M affirms power of good living", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/schools/promise-day-at-u-of-m-affirms-power-of-good-living-ep-1040810324-326674311.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/fogelman_health_3_16909059_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "Fogelman College of Business and Economics hosted is annual Promise Day Thursday, a chance for students to commit to maintaining emotional, fiscal, mental, physical and social health.", "title": "Promise Day at U of M affirms power of good living"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/fogelman_health_3_16909059_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Promise Day at U of M affirms power of good living", "description": "Fogelman College of Business and Economics hosted is annual Promise Day Thursday, a chance for students to commit to maintaining emotional, fiscal, mental, physical and social health.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd056e\"", "article_summary": "The University rebranded Promise Day two years ago, hoping to raise the profile of what it takes to be healthy, ethical business leaders.\nFogelman Fit, now a staple in the college, includes exercise classes, plus yoga, karate and self-defense for students and university employees.\nHundreds of students, community sponsors and staff milled around the Promise Day fair at Fogelman College of Business and Economics Thursday, the most visible sign of the college\u2019s growing commitment to health \u2014 emotional, fiscal, mental, physical and social.\n<p>Karate instructor Jenny Lykins (left) demonstrates self-defense techniques with University of Memphis graduate student Casey Flannery during the annual Fogelman Promise Day at U of M.
