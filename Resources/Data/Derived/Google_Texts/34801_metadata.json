Still, HCIT software makers Cerner (CERN), Allscripts (MDRX), Athenahealth (ATHN) and Quality Systems (QSII) are expected to see their combined revenue rise more than 12% this year to $8.14 billion, and 11%, to $9 billion, next year, Wall Street analysts estimate.\n\nThat\u2019s an achievement, since the biggest spenders \u2014 hospitals \u2014 are expected to increase their IT budgets by only 8% in 2016, up from 6%-7% in 2015, says analyst Matthew Gillmor with investment banker Robert W. Baird.\n\nThat 8% increase will be shared with other companies that compete in HCIT, including IBM\u2018s (IBM) Watson Health, an analytics provider launched last year that is expected to ramp up to 2,000 employees. Another rival is Verona, Wis.-based, privately held Epic Systems, which employs some 8,500 workers and reportedly generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2014.\n\nThe workforce for Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, the largest of the HCIT software pure plays, reached 22,000 employees last year after the company acquired Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cerner\u2019s revenue to rise 13% in 2016, to $5.01 billion.\n\nDoctors Struggle With New Laws\n\nHCIT growth faces a unique struggle, heavily influenced by policymakers in Washington, D.C., determined to expand and improve care while keeping a lid on patient costs. While federal rules have stimulated HCIT growth, they\u2019re also challenging hospitals\u2019 ability to keep up, compromising doctors and nurses\u2019 ability and time to provide care, some observers say.\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes the Health Information Technology (HITECH) Act, established the Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs that reward and punish hospitals and doctors\u2019 practices for the pace of their EHR transition. Then the Affordable Care Act of 2010, better known as ObamaCare, and most recently the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which became law in April, also hasten higher HCIT standards.\n\nIn between the lawmaking, rule writers continue to draft implementation language that the federal director of HCIT standards in October called an \u201cIT bonanza.\u201d\n\nThis is good for the software vendors as they race to refine and sell Population Health software. PopHealth records expenses, tracks patient care and outcomes, incorporates patients\u2019 evaluations of their care, parses data from similar patient populations, encourages communication between caregivers, and collects performance metrics throughout a hospital \u2014 all intended to improve patient care while giving regulators tools to measure compliance.\n\nCerner calls its PopHealth platform HealtheIntent and says it\u2019s used \u201cto address the growing demand, payer pressures and policy mandates organizations face today.\u201d\n\nThose policy mandates are driving some doctors, nurses and hospital IT executives up the wall \u2014 and some are pushing back.\n\nHealth Rules Changing \u2014 Again\n\nAt this month\u2019s JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where Cerner was among presenters, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees HCIT, tweeted: \u201cIn 2016, MU as it has existed \u2013 with MACRA \u2013 will now be effectively over and replaced with something better.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the rules are changing again, maybe.\n\nMU is meaningful use, a protocol that has guided health care IT spending and systems development, and which the director of HCIT standards, Steven Posnack, has been implementing with a certification process under the auspices of MACRA. (At 39,010 words, MACRA is 10% the length of ObamaCare, which most consider complex.)\n\nIn November, Dr. John Halamka went public with the case for changing or eliminating MU.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m likely going to violate many rules with this post,\u201d he prefaced in a blog post. He\u2019s chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 631-bed teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School. Halamka wrote in a post titled \u201cThe Path Forward for Meaningful Use\u201d that MU had outlived its usefulness and is doing damage.\n\n\u201cStage 1 created a foundation of functionality for everyone,\u201d Halamka wrote. \u201cThat was good.\n\n\u201cStage 2 tried to change too much too fast and required an ecosystem of applications and infrastructure that did not exist. \u2026 Stage 3 makes many of the same mistakes as Stage 2, trying to do too much too soon. \u2026\n\n\u201cClinicians cannot get through a 12-minute visit, enter the necessary Stage 3 data elements, reconcile problems/allergies/medications from multiple institutions, meet the demands of the Stage 3 clinical quality measures, make eye contact with patients and deliver safe medical care. There needs to be a new approach.\u201d\n\nAs a veteran medical-surgical registered nurse at a big California hospital told IBD: \u201cWe\u2019re set up to fail.\u201d\n\nElectronic Health Records \u2018Elusive\u2019\n\nThis uncertainty helps explain why HCIT spending is growing slowly as hospital administrators hesitate to invest in systems requiring, as Halamka put it, \u201cinfrastructure that did not exist\u201d under a \u201cmeaningful use\u201d protocol of questionable viability for a MACRA law just 9 months old, with pending regulations yet to come.\n\nTwo days after Slavitt\u2019s declaration to do away with MU under MACRA, his office issued its regular newsletter, \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening in Health IT,\u201d highlighting news of the \u201cAdopted 2015 Edition Criteria for Testing and Certification Under the Health IT Certification Program\u201d and \u201cIn Preparation for Testing, ONC Publishes Certification Companion Guides,\u201d among other HCIT must-reads.\n\n\u201cHCIT spending is still in the process of resetting post the MU bonanza, but the overall environment remains healthy,\u201d said Baird analyst Gillmor in a research note issued Jan. 8.\n\nHe says the electronic health records replacement \u201copportunity remains elusive,\u201d even though many hospitals need to get moving on their EHR efforts.\n\nChicago-based HIMSS Analytics says only 4% of U.S. hospitals had achieved the most advanced Stage 7 of EMR proficiency as of Q3 2015, with 25% in Stage 6 and the remainder at the lower levels.\n\n\u201cReplacement activity has been slow, and we expect this will continue in 2016,\u201d said Gillmor. \u201cCERN and Epic will continue to win the lion\u2019s share of replacements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care IT is growing fitfully, but growth for Cerner, Athenahealth, Allscripts and Quality Systems together might outpace hospital IT budgets in 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Health care information technology is growing fitfully \u2014 hurt and helped by government policies.
