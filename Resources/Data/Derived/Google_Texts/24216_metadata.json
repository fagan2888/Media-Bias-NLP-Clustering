How else to explain the 10-month battle authorities have been waging to keep secret the police body camera footage of an officer-involved fatal shooting?\n\nOn Thursday morning, it seemed likely that the Iowa Public Information Board would tighten that lid of secrecy. Its staff, after all, had twice recommended that a complaint filed by the Hawk Eye newspaper in Burlington be dismissed, saying the full video doesn\u2019t have to be released because it\u2019s part of an investigative file and can be withheld under Iowa law.\n\nBut public information board members, in a 4-3 split, disagreed. Instead, they opted for formal charges \u2014 only the third time they\u2019ve done so in their two years of existence \u2014 and sent the case to an administrative law judge.\n\nIt was an important first step. Had the board dismissed the complaint, the Hawk Eye would have little legal wiggle room to continue fighting for those records.\n\nIn the city of Burlington, population 25,000, fatal officer-involved shootings are rare. And this one has been cloaked in suspicion and secrecy from the start.\n\nWe know that Officer Jesse Hill was wearing a body camera when he shot 34-year-old Autumn Steele in January while responding to a disturbance. Steele had been hitting her husband outside their home after spending the previous night in jail on accusations of assaulting him, police said.\n\nA 12-second clip of the video from Hill\u2019s body camera \u2014 the only portion released by authorities \u2014 shows Hill firing his gun twice without warning after a growling dog is heard. It\u2019s not seen on the video, but authorities have said the family\u2019s German shepherd jumped on Hill\u2019s back and bit his thigh, causing injuries that required treatment.\n\nWe don't know much more than that, or why Hill's account doesn't seem to line up with those of Steele's husband and a neighbor. Presumably, the video could help clear it up, and would show what happened and what was said immediately after Hill fired his weapon.\n\nThe shooting was quickly deemed justified. The case was closed. Hill returned to work.\n\nAnd yet evidence of what transpired that day \u2014 captured on a tool designed to increase transparency \u2014 remains hidden.\n\nThe Iowa Public Information Board did the right thing in refusing to rubber-stamp the staff's recommendation. As board member Bill Monroe aptly noted, the state\u2019s public records law was written before police began using body cameras, and part of the board\u2019s job is to interpret how new technology fits into the law.\n\nBut the other, much bigger problem is the law itself. It\u2019s hard to imagine that when lawmakers drafted the clunky section of the public records law on police investigative files, they intended the records to be kept secret forever, even after the investigations are completed.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s been argued that if it wasn\u2019t for the placement of a comma in the 36-word sentence that makes up this section of the law, that wouldn\u2019t be the case. Citizens would be allowed to inspect the records once the files were closed.\n\nIt\u2019s past time for lawmakers to address this serious defect in state law. They should do it because public trust matters. And they should do it because public access to the records of a fatal police shooting shouldn't hinge on a comma.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1m311ai", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lawmakers must fix law as more police use body cameras", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Lawmakers must fix law as more police use body cameras", "title": "Editorial: Shooting exposes wide hole in public records law", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/21/editorial-burlington-fatal-shooting-state-public-records-law-autumn-steele-jesse-hill/77579774/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers must fix law as more police use body cameras", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "title": "Editorial: Shooting exposes wide hole in public records law", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Iowa Public Information Board", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Iowa Public Information Board", "title": "Editorial: Shooting exposes wide hole in public records law", "author": "The Register's Editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "contenttype": "story", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "publishtime": "2015-12-20T23:47:28.447000-06:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Fix public records law", "articleid": 77579774}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday morning, it seemed likely that the Iowa Public Information Board would tighten that lid of secrecy.\nThe Iowa Public Information Board did the right thing in refusing to rubber-stamp the staff's recommendation.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that when lawmakers drafted the clunky section of the public records law on police investigative files, they intended the records to be kept secret forever, even after the investigations are completed.\nBut public information board members, in a 4-3 split, disagreed.\nAnd they should do it because public access to the records of a fatal police shooting shouldn't hinge on a comma."}
