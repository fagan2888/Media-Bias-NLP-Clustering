The drive went 70 yards on 15 plays and nearly seven minutes long. The third quarter saw a shift of momentum on offense as UM edged the Raiders 9-to-2 in first downs and outgained Middle Tennessee in yardage 132 to 22.\n\nThe Tigers used another extended drive to take their first lead of the game early in the fourth quarter. Memphis marched down 69 yards on 10 plays in five minutes. UM scored a TD and took a 15-14 edge when Lynch found Alan Cross for a one-yard touchdown strike.\n\nWith less than three minutes remaining, the Blue Raiders made a pair of long throws to reach field goal range. Kilgore threw an 18-yard strike to Marcus Henry before finding Jefferson for 25 more yards.
