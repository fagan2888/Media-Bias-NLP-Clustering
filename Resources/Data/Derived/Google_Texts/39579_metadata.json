Always seen as a weak and geographically dispersed constituency it seems the military and its servicemen and women will once again take a backseat in the fiscal largess of this Administration and its congressional allies.\n\nWhile the troops digest a 1 percent basic pay raise for the second year as well as cuts in their housing allowances, we witness a 16 percent increase of $49 billion in Medicaid thanks to Obamacare and a 51 percent increase of $30 billion for the Department of Education thanks to defaults on student loans. During the last Democratic primary debate veterans\u2019 issues were discussed in passing only, and not once by the presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton. But \u201cfree college tuition\u201d and what would sure to be federally subsidized in-state tuition for \u201cundocumented immigrants\u201d? Sure, we can afford that.\n\nIs it any wonder that this Commander-in-Chief\u2019s approval ratings among the military have fallen to a dismal 15 percent? Or that only 12 percent believe that both Republicans and Democrats are truly concerned with their interests?\n\nTen years ago we were the pride of the nation. Today we\u2019re a fiscal liability whose morale and readiness has been sacrificed upon the altar of political pandering and gamesmanship.\n\nThe ineptitude in Washington has already put our national security at great risk. While not front-page news anymore, we still have troops deployed around the world and still \u201cfighting\u201d in Afghanistan and conducting missions in Iraq and Syria. Yet we have systematically reduced our ability to train, equip and deploy. The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers, 13 Brigade Combat Teams, and 3 aviation brigades.\n\nJust recently the outgoing Army Chief of Staff General Odierno stated, \u201cThe unrelenting budget impasse has compelled us to degrade readiness to historically low levels \u2026 Even today we only have 33 percent of our brigades ready, when our sustained rate should be closer to 70 percent.\u201d\n\nAnd if sequestration occurs again in 2016 those numbers would only get worse.\n\nThe current strategy of peace through hope better work, otherwise we\u2019re in trouble. And yet, we\u2019ve seen this before as a nation. Between every major conflict in our history politicians have made the mistake of confusing public disdain for the cost of war with the necessary ability to wage it effectively. The major difference between the post 9-11 force and that of our previous major wars is that we are an entirely volunteer force. When only .4 percent of the population makes up those volunteers the nation should sit up, pay attention, and demand that Washington ceases it\u2019s intransigence and do the job they were elected to do. Instead we assign Czars, build new agencies, hold summits, all while the very people entrusted to keep us safe fight for primacy over dollars and dominion.\n\nUntil Washington chooses action over platitudes, please, stop the bullshit.\n\nStop giving speeches on Veterans Day celebrating our service when it\u2019s painfully obvious politicians don\u2019t understand the first thing about \u201cserving.\u201d They should stop walking in parades surrounded by the very veterans they\u2019ve failed through the disaster that is the VA. Stop issuing useless press releases on Memorial Day honoring the sacrifices made in past wars as you gut our preparedness for the next one. And stop grandstanding over policy failures that have forced us to watch every street, block and city we bled to secure in Iraq and Afghanistan devolve back into chaos and into the hands of our enemies. Stop pretending that leaving a meager force in Afghanistan is anything other than a political punt to our next election.\n\nIf our elected officials really want to honor us, act. Prove to the American people and more importantly the servicemen and women of todays military that you actually have the courage and character as our elected \u201cleaders\u201d to put aside the political machinations for once and do what is necessary and right, political consequences be damned.\n\nFollow the author on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ben Collins", "description": "Ten years ago we were the pride of the nation.
