Eliza Filene has been nominated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a leader making a difference not only through key issues on campus, but in bridging the gender gap in politics.\n\nAs part of msnbc\u2019s \u201cWomen in Politics\u201d series, these hand-selected women become part of a larger discussion of women candidates and women\u2019s issues on a national level. \u201cWomen in Politics\u201d features newsmaker interviews, profiles, photos, and deep dives into the key conversations, including a series on \u201cWomen Leaders Bridging Tech and Politics in 2016.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom the Ivy Leagues to the Big Ten to liberal arts colleges and beyond, young women are making a difference across the country \u2013 meet them here!\n\nName: Eliza Filene\n\n\n\nSchool: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nHometown: Carrboro, NC\n\nConcentration: Major in Public Policy, Minor in Entrepreneurship and Chemistry\n\nRole in student government, organizations: : Student representative on UNC\u2019s Faculty Council, undergraduate research assistant at UNC AIDS Clinical Trials Unit.\n\nDream job: I want to be a doctor\u2014right now I\u2019m thinking infectious disease or OB-GYN. I\u2019m interested in rural health in the US. By working with patients in high-need areas, I believe I\u2019ll be in a better position to make a meaningful impact on health policy. It is important for doctors with experience in the healthcare system to contribute directly to the crafting of policies that affect their patients.\n\nEventually I want to come back to University governance\u2026It\u2019s my dream-big goal to become chancellor at a university like UNC!\n\nClass year: 2018\n\n***\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to work in student government?\n\nAs a public policy major, it has been interesting to see how university policies are crafted, debated, and passed. I have learned a lot\u2014seemingly small policies and changes can end up having dramatic impacts on people\u2019s lives. At its core, student government is about students having a say over policies that affect their lives. Education, like healthcare, has to be tailored to fit individuals\u2019 needs. It\u2019s important that the student voice be heard and taken seriously. We have to be active if we want policies passed in our interests.\n\nThe concept of a university is powerful. There\u2019s really nothing like it. A university is a place where students and experts come together with common goals\u2014to learn and make a difference. A university is a place where people learn how to communicate cross-culturally, to build bridges across disciplines, and make connections. As someone who has been tremendously shaped by her college experience, I want to help make UNC the best that it can be for all students.\n\nWhat issues are you most passionate about following this election season? Why?\n\nThere are so many to choose from! The next few years will be huge for healthcare legislation. From building on the progress of the Affordable Care Act to protecting women\u2019s access to reproductive healthcare, the outcomes will have serious ramifications for all patients. However, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned through working with the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit, it is that a host of other issues play into ensuring accessible, safe and affordable care. For example, matters such as the United States\u2019 mass incarceration crisis, racial justice, and gun violence must be addressed in order to ensure the health and well being of all people.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s important for college students to vote during elections? Why or why not?\n\nAbsolutely. Our vote truly matters\u2014we may be the ones to swing this election. It\u2019s happened before\u2014an analysis done by the Center for Information and Research on Civil Learning and Engagement found that the support of young people won President Obama almost 80 electoral votes. Get to the polls!\n\nSecondly, countless people devoted their lives to fighting for this right. This past week, I voted early with one of my girlfriends. When I was looking at our selfie with our \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, I actually got emotional thinking of the women who fought for our right to vote\u2026 and then the folks who had to fight and die for their right until 1965. There is no better way for us to honor their struggle than to exercise our right.\n\nHas feminism played a role in your life? If so, how?\n\nFeminism has greatly affected my life. My mother is a historian who focuses on women\u2019s movements and modern feminism. I grew up around dinner conversations about feminism, politics, and justice. With my mom as a role model, I have always expected fair treatment, have felt empowered to reach my goals, and have been aware of the adversities that women face around the world.\n\nIf you could be any social media platform, which one would you be and why?\n\nHmm interesting! I suppose Facebook best represents my personality because it allows both sharing publicly and connecting personally. I care a lot about staying in touch with people. While surface-level updates are great for staying in the loop, a good conversation always trumps a \u201clike.\u201d\n\nMake sure to check out last week\u2019s college woman leader here!\n\nTo nominate an exceptional undergraduate female leader in student government please email Anna Brand at Anna.Brand@nbcuni.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Welcome to Women in Politics: College Edition, where women leaders in student government across the country will be featured on msnbc.com.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/women-politics-college-edition-unc-chapel-hill", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Welcome to Women in Politics: College Edition, where women leaders in student government across the country will be featured on msnbc.com.", "title": "Women in Politics: College Edition -- UNC Chapel Hill", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/women-politics-college-edition-unc-chapel-hill", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/elizafilene.jpg?itok=6hXaZ5hp", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/women-politics-college-edition-unc-chapel-hill", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/elizafilene.jpg?itok=s-DRJhwn", "title": "Women in Politics: College Edition -- UNC Chapel Hill", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Welcome to Women in Politics: College Edition, where women leaders in student government across the country will be featured on msnbc.com."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-06T13:27:49-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"date": "05/06/2016 13:27:49 EDT", "title": "Women in Politics: College Edition -- UNC Chapel Hill", "published": 1, "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/women-politics-college-edition-unc-chapel-hill", "tags": "college,education,equality,women,women-in-politics"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Welcome to Women in Politics: College Edition, where women leaders in student government across the country will be featured on msnbc.com.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Education, Equality, Women, Women in Politics, Women in Politics: College Edition"}, "article_summary": "Welcome to Women in Politics: College Edition, where promising women leaders in student government on college and university campuses across the country will be featured on msnbc.com over the course of the year.\nAs part of msnbc\u2019s \u201cWomen in Politics\u201d series, these hand-selected women become part of a larger discussion of women candidates and women\u2019s issues on a national level.\nAs a public policy major, it has been interesting to see how university policies are crafted, debated, and passed.\nEventually I want to come back to University governance\u2026It\u2019s my dream-big goal to become chancellor at a university like UNC!\nAs someone who has been tremendously shaped by her college experience, I want to help make UNC the best that it can be for all students."}
