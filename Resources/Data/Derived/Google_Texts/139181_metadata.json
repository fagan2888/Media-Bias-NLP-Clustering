A Field Poll in September shows the rate-regulation initiative is still out in front with 41 percent surveyed indicating support versus 26 percent in opposition and many remaining undecided.\n\nThe massive proportion of undecided voters is why Prop. 45 isn\u2019t polling as well, say its backers, who argue that it\u2019s still early and many people had not yet heard of the measure, \u201cor are aware there\u2019s even an election coming up.\u201d\n\nWith about a month to go expect anyone who watches television, listens to radio or who passes a billboard on the street to be made aware of the proposition as millions of dollars are spent by both sides to get out their message. Also expect Prop. 103 to be thrown into the mix \u2013 a lot.\n\nNo on Prop 45\u2019s chief spokeswoman has several times compared the initiative \u2013 known as the Insurance Rate Public Justification and Accountability Act \u2013 to Prop. 103 while highlighting why voters should oppose the measure.\n\nLike Prop. 103 passed in 1988, Prop. 45 would require changes to health insurance rates to be approved by the insurance commissioner.\n\nIt would also create a requirement for public notice and hearings on any health insurance rate changes and prohibit health, auto and homeowners insurers from determining policy eligibility or rates based on lack of prior coverage or credit history.\n\n\u201cI think what we saw with Prop 103, which this initiative is modeled after, is that the proponents, namely Consumer Watchdog, made millions of dollars off of these intervenor fees,\u201d said Robin Swanson, a campaign spokeswoman.\n\nUnder California\u2019s intervenor process consumer groups can intervene in proceedings for insurance rate increases and decreases and charge a fee for doing so.\n\nThe process has been scrutinized by some, including in 2012 when then state Senator Juan Vargas, D-San Diego, called on the California Department of Insurance to review the program.\n\nDating back to the launch of the program with Prop. 103, Santa Monica, Calif.-based Consumer Watchdog has been the most commonly listed intervenor, charging nearly $9 million for their services, according to CDI\u2019s list of intervenors.\n\n\u201cWhen outside intervenors are allowed to come in and charge $675 an hour, of course that drives up rates,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nThe average number of days for a typical intervenor process is 343 days, she said.\n\nThe delays created by the intervenor process will create headaches for those dealing with a finite amount of time allotted to enroll in health plans, Swanson added.\n\n\u201cThe truth is they don\u2019t want people to know all of the delays that were created by Prop. 103,\u201d she said, referring to those backing the measure.\n\nThe measure would also create \u201chuge operational issues\u201d with those working to implement the changes mandated by the Affordable Care Act, Swanson said.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a model for a successful health exchange, and I think this turns back the clock,\u201d she said.\n\nThe measure would also give the insurance commissioner sweeping new powers over the healthcare industry and generate a bureaucratic mess, according to opponents of the measure.\n\nCurrently the healthcare industry is overseen by the California Department of Managed Healthcare and the California Department of Insurance.\n\n\u201cIt will make insurance more expensive,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cMore bureaucracy drives up rates.\u201d\n\nConsumer Watchdog spokeswoman Carmen Balber embraced the Prop. 103 comparison, and argued that it and the intervenor program has saved drivers a great deal in auto insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cIf you think that the $100 billion in savings for drivers that has been achieved under Prop. 103 since 1988 is a good thing then you vote \u2018Yes\u2019 on Prop. 45 to get the same savings for health insurance policyholders,\u201d Balber said.\n\n\u201cSince 2002 Consumer Watchdog\u2019s challenges to excessive have saved policyholders over $3 billion,\u201d Balber added.\n\nAccording to Balber, that money goes to pay staff attorneys and to outside experts.\n\nFiguring the ratio between what\u2019s spent on intervenor fees and the savings, Balber said:\n\n\u201cFor every $100 in savings our attorneys and outside experts have been paid a quarter. That\u2019s a pretty good deal for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe supporters of the proposition include Consumer Attorneys for California, the California Nurses Association and U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones.\n\nOpponents include the California Medical Association, the California Taxpayer Protection Committee, California Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse and the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of California.\n\nSee related stories:\n\nInitiative to Expand California Prop 103 Ignites Insurance Battle\n\nCalifornia Health Rates Initiative Qualifies for 2014 Ballot\n\nWebsite Attacks Consumer Watchdog", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Opponents of Proposition 45 on the upcoming California ballot like to draw a comparison with Proposition 103, the state's primary auto insurance law.
