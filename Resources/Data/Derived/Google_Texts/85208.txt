GRAND RAPIDS, MI – The federal government is cutting payments to Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital and 720 other hospitals nationwide as a penalty for high infection and patient injury rates.

Medicare payments are being reduced 1 percent for the fiscal year that began in October, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The penalties are assessed for one in seven hospitals in the country. The list includes some leading academic medical centers, such as the Cleveland Clinic, and 21 hospitals in Michigan.

Under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare reductions are required for the hospitals that rank in the top quarter on a Hospital Acquired Condition score.

Dr. Michael Kramer, Spectrum’s vice president for system quality and safety, cited a couple of reasons Butterworth made the list.

“We are very conscientious about reporting things that CMS and the federal government consider a complication,” he said.

Butterworth performed worse than the national benchmark in catheter-associated urinary tract infections, for example.

“We are very diligent in reporting any sign of infection, even those things that would not cause harm to the patient,” Kramer said.

Dr. Darrel Campbell, chief medical officer for the University of Michigan Health System, echoed that concern in a report by Kaiser Health News. The hospital is not among those penalized but has a higher rate of catheter-associated infections.

“How hard you look for something influences your results,” he said.

Also, Kramer said Butterworth handles patients with more complex medical conditions than many hospitals. Although infection rates are adjusted for differing levels of patient sickness and vulnerability, the adjustments don’t go far enough, he said.

“In the way in which it is reported, we are compared to all hospitals with intensive care units,” he said.

Academic medical centers also complained the adjustment did not account for the complexity of their caseloads. A Kaiser Health analysis showed 143 of 292 major teaching hospitals were penalized.

However, Kramer said he welcomed the increased federal emphasis on patient safety.

“We make a huge investment in quality and safety and avoiding hospital-acquired infections,” he said. “We really are appreciative that the national dialogue has risen to this level of visibility.”

Every patient has a bedside chart showing how many days the patient has had a catheter, for example, as a step toward reducing the use of catheters and lowering infection risk. Spectrum has become a national leader in promoting hand-washing.

The Hospital Acquired Condition scores used to determine the penalties were based on three factors – infections associated with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and a patient safety rating assessed to each hospital.

Each hospital was assessed a score on a 10-point scale. Penalties were imposed on those with a total score of 7 or higher.

Spectrum’s score was 9.025. Mercy Health Saint Mary’s scored 6.75. Metro Health Hospital scored 5.425.

The data was reported in 2012 and 2013. Kramer said it does reflect improvements since then. Last month, the hospital had just one central line-associated infection.

“We are making great progress,” he said. “Our goal is to get to zero in all of these.”
