Evidence is mounting that the team approach improves quality of life for Parkinson\u2019s patients, reduces hospitalizations and saves money.\n\nThe disease, which affects nearly 1 million people in the United States, is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative condition with no known cure. Associated with more than 20 motor and nonmotor manifestations, Parkinson\u2019s presents differently in every patient, and its manifestations change over time, notes Michael S. Okun, M.D., professor and neurologist at the University of Florida and medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation.\n\nThese various manifestations can land Parkinson\u2019s patients in the hospital \u2014 falls can lead to fractured bones, or difficulty swallowing can lead to aspiration pneumonia, for example. But, as inpatients, people with Parkinson\u2019s can be challenging to care for. The relative rarity of Parkinson\u2019s creates difficulty for hospital staff, Parkinson\u2019s disease experts say.\n\nFor example, drug regimens for Parkinson\u2019s patients are often complicated, with some patients requiring medication every hour or two, Okun says. Yet, medication schedules for Parkinson\u2019s patients are often changed to match schedules of other drugs to better accommodate the nursing schedule, note the authors of a literature review published in 2011 in the journal Parkinsonism & Related Disorders.\n\nA missed or delayed dose can quickly worsen mental and motor symptoms. \u201cParkinson\u2019s disease medications are as necessary for a Parkinson\u2019s patient as insulin is to diabetics,\u201d says Peter Schmidt, vice president of research programs at the National Parkinson Foundation.\n\nHowever, because Parkinson\u2019s is seen less frequently in the hospital than other chronic conditions, medication management protocols and drug alerts by and large haven\u2019t been a focus in electronic health record or computerized physician order entry systems, Schmidt says. Furthermore, drugs commonly prescribed in hospitals \u2014 antipsychotic drugs, for example \u2014 may exacerbate Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. And some hospitals may not stock all Parkinson\u2019s medications.\n\n\u201cIn general, community hospitals are a dangerous place for Parkinson\u2019s patients, but so are university hospitals,\u201d Okun says. \u201cEven if there are Parkinson\u2019s specialists there, it doesn\u2019t mean that day-to-day the care is done optimally.\u201d\n\nParkinsonNet\n\nTo improve care and avoid hospital stays for Parkinson's patients, many hospitals are exploring team-based approaches, among them, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Southern California Permanente Medical Group, which serves more than 7,000 members with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Starting in September 2014, Kaiser Permanente adopted ParkinsonNet in partnership with Radboud University in the Netherlands, which developed the program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CM Parkinson\u2019s By Geri Aston Framing the issue \u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the U.S. after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, yet it is still a relatively rare condition relative to other chronic illnesses. \u2022 Approximately 630,000 people in the United States had diagnosed Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2010 \u2014 a number expected to double by 2040. \u2022 The combined direct and indirect cost of Parkinson\u2019s disease, including treatment, Social Security payments and lost income, is estimated to be nearly $25 billion per year . . .", "csrf-token": "KXVuQhKXLCZEYAVFtiustDuydD7fNC3EizHbIiJGH1Q=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/November/FEA_parkinsons_190x127.jpg?1448315769", "description": "Effective Parkinson\u2019s treatment may not require a village, but consensus is growing among providers that it would definitely benefit from a team.", "card": "summary", "title": "A Better Approach to Treating Parkinson's Using Teams"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/November/FEA_parkinsons_190x127.jpg?1448315769", "type": "Article", "description": "Effective Parkinson\u2019s treatment may not require a village, but consensus is growing among providers that it would definitely benefit from a team.", "title": "A Better Approach to Treating Parkinson's Using Teams"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "hospitals,kaiser,okun,parkinsonnet,parkinson\u2019s,patients", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Evidence is mounting that the team approach improves quality of life for Parkinson\u2019s patients, reduces hospitalizations and saves money.\n\u2022 Approximately 630,000 people in the United States had diagnosed Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2010 \u2014 a number expected to double by 2040.\n\u201cIn general, community hospitals are a dangerous place for Parkinson\u2019s patients, but so are university hospitals,\u201d Okun says.\nThe relative rarity of Parkinson\u2019s creates difficulty for hospital staff, Parkinson\u2019s disease experts say.\n\u201cParkinson\u2019s disease medications are as necessary for a Parkinson\u2019s patient as insulin is to diabetics,\u201d says Peter Schmidt, vice president of research programs at the National Parkinson Foundation."}
