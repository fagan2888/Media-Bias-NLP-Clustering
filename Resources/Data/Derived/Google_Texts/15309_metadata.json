He asked them to help parents understand the new Common Core academic standards. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who is spending part of his considerable fortune trying to improve U.S. public education, called on teachers Friday to help parents understand the new Common Core academic standards in an effort to beat back \u201cfalse claims\u201d lobbed by critics of the standards.\n\n\u201cThere are many voices in this debate but none are more important or trusted than yours,\u201d Gates told several thousand educators gathered in the District for the inaugural conference of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a nonprofit organization that runs a voluntary system to certify teachers. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was a sponsor of the conference; it has awarded about $5 million to the board since 2010.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has spent more than $170 million to develop and promote the Common Core standards, and is their biggest nongovernmental backer. Forty-five states and the District have fully adopted the standards, which call for wholesale changes in the way math and reading are taught from kindergarten through 12th grade.\n\nThe standards are a set of expectations about knowledge students should have and skills they should possess by the end of each grade. The standards are not curricula; decisions about what and how to teach are left up to states and local school districts.\n\nUntil now, every state has set its own standards, and they varied widely in quality.\n\nGates said common standards could transform U.S. education, reduce the number of students taking remedial courses in college and enable American students to better compete globally.\n\nStandardization is especially important to allow for innovation in the classroom, said Gates, who used an analogy of electrical outlets.\n\n\u201cIf you have 50 different plug types, appliances wouldn\u2019t be available and would be very expensive,\u201d he said. But once an electric outlet becomes standardized, many companies can design appliances and competition ensues, creating variety and better prices for consumers, he said.\n\nIf states use common academic standards, the quality of classroom materials and professional development will improve, Gates said. Much of that material will be digital tools that are personalized to the student, he said. \u201cTo get this innovation out, common standards will be helpful,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Gates said he worried about \u201cbumpy\u201d implementation in some states and some of the political attacks that have been lobbed at the Common Core.\n\n\u201cThere is one thing that worries me, though,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the false claims that some people keep making about the standards. We have to make sure people know that it\u2019s not the federal government setting standards or that it\u2019s a block to innovation. Often, people are talking about problems that aren\u2019t really there. It\u2019s important that we stick to these facts.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that critics are uninformed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another case when I was naive \u2014 I thought people who spoke out against the Common Core would be people who read the Common Core,\u201d Gates said during a question-and-answer session after his remarks.\n\nThe real problems with the Common Core have been \u201cbumpy\u201d implementation in some states and districts \u2014 places where teachers complain that they have not been given enough time, training and quality materials to teach to the new standards, Gates said.\n\nLeaders of the nation\u2019s two major teachers unions support the standards but have decried the way states are implementing them. Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, said it has been \u201ccompletely botched\u201d and that seven of out 10 NEA members surveyed complained that the implementation has been poor. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, has called the rollout worse than the debut of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnion leaders want more time for implementation, especially when it comes to plans by states to judge teacher quality based on the way students perform academically under the new standards.\n\nGates and other Common Core supporters say the standards emphasize critical thinking and analytical skills, as opposed to rote learning.\n\nOpponents span the political spectrum, from tea party activists who say the standards amount to a federal takeover of local education to progressives who bristle at the emphasis on testing and the role of the Gates Foundation. Some academics say the math and reading standards are too weak; others say they are too demanding, particularly for young students.\n\nMeanwhile, parents are left to wonder about all the changes taking place in the classroom.\n\nGates urged teachers to talk with parents and explain the value of the new standards and said that was the most effective way to shoot down false claims.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to answer every false tweet and post,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThe most authoritative voices will be teachers who\u2019ve had this exposure [to the standards]. . . . I hope you can communicate with parents. This is not just another policy thing. It\u2019s pivotal to the effort to improve education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "national education, education, Bill Gates, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Common Core, Tea Party, Common Core standards, NEA, AFT", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Microsoft founder says teachers should push back against \u201cfalse claims\u201d and explain the standards", "title": "Bill Gates calls on teachers to defend Common Core", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/bill-gates-calls-on-teachers-to-defend-common-core/2014/03/14/395b130a-aafa-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/14/Education/Images/Was8415159-208.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@lyndseylayton"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "national education, education, Bill Gates, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Common Core, Tea Party, Common Core standards, NEA, AFT", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "395b130a-aafa-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Microsoft founder says teachers should push back against \u201cfalse claims\u201d and explain the standards"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a57\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s just another case when I was naive \u2014 I thought people who spoke out against the Common Core would be people who read the Common Core,\u201d Gates said during a question-and-answer session after his remarks.\nThe Gates Foundation has spent more than $170 million to develop and promote the Common Core standards, and is their biggest nongovernmental backer.\nGates and other Common Core supporters say the standards emphasize critical thinking and analytical skills, as opposed to rote learning.\nHe asked them to help parents understand the new Common Core academic standards.\nBut Gates said he worried about \u201cbumpy\u201d implementation in some states and some of the political attacks that have been lobbed at the Common Core."}
