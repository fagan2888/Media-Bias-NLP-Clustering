(AP Photo/Mike Derer, File)\n\n4930593\n\nI am a plaintiff in Priests for Life vs. HHS, one of seven cases against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate that will be heard by the Supreme Court on March 23.\n\nThe argument in our case, and the others, is that by forcing faith-based non-profits to provide contraceptives, abortifacient drugs and sterilization devices and services to our employees, our rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are being violated. That\u2019s the truth and that\u2019s the argument we believe will convince the Court to rule in our favor.\n\nBut beyond my religious objections to birth control that are consistent with my Catholic faith, I have major objections that have nothing to do with religion and everything to do with women\u2019s health.\n\nHormonal birth control kills.\n\nThat is an incontrovertible fact but one that seems strangely absent from the debate on free contraception for all. Why on earth would I, as executive director of Priests for Life, sign my name on a form that would give the government a pathway to providing contraception to my employees, knowing what I know about birth control?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t, and I won\u2019t. My employees support this decision, even though for them it raises the very frightening possibility that we will have to drop their health insurance.\n\nLet\u2019s have a quick look at the rogue\u2019s gallery of the worst offenders in the birth control arsenal.\n\nYaz/Yasmin: Birth control pills that contain drospirenone, a synthetic progesterone. As of April 2015, 190 deaths had been linked to these birth control pills owned by Bayer. The company has spent $1.8 billion to settle lawsuits, and in the biggest suit to date, representing 12,000 complaints, the company agreed to set aside an additional $57 million in settlement money. Yet Bayer continues to sell Yaz and Yasmin and doctors keep prescribing it. These killer pills are especially popular with girls 13 to 18.\n\nOrtho Evra patch: A small patch applied to the skin for three weeks of every month, it prevents fertilization or implantation by delivering a steady amount of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, through the skin and into the bloodstream. At least 50 deaths have been linked to the patch, amid claims that the manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, knew that its high levels of estrogen increased the chance of blood clots and strokes.\n\nNuva Ring: A flexible ring that a woman inserts into her vagina. Over a three-week period, Nuva Ring releases a continuous low dosage of the synthetic hormones estrogen and progestin to prevent fertilization or implantation. It\u2019s hard to quantify the number of deaths among women using NuvaRing but the risk of this long-acting contraception is great enough that Merck & Co. decided to pay out $100 million to settle more than 3,000 liability lawsuits. Stories about the women who have died or been harmed by these drugs are heart-breaking and rage-inducing.\n\nDepo-Provera: An injection of a hormone similar to progesterone that prevents ovulation or, failing that, blocks implantation of the fertilized embryo. Repeat injections are needed every 12 weeks. Documented side effects include increased risk of HIV infection, breast cancer and cervical cancer; blood clots; ectopic pregnancy; reduced fertility; excessive weight gain, and bone loss. Although usage of the patch produced by Upjohn is fairly low in the United States \u2013 1.2 million women \u2013 Depo Provera is popular among teenagers.\n\nMirena: An intrauterine device implanted in the uterus for up to five years that works by releasing daily doses of hormones. Serious side effects include device migration, uterine perforation, internal bleeding, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. Mirena manufacturer Bayer was scolded by the FDA in 2009 for minimizing the risks of the device, and the agency has received more than 45,000 complaints from women who had the implant.\n\nEssure: A permanent sterilization device implanted in the fallopian tubes. Resulting scar tissue around the nickel-titanium alloy blocks fertilization. Tens of thousands of women have reported a long list of side effects, including late-term miscarriage, and four deaths have been linked to the coils. The FDA has received so many complaints about the device from women that it convened a hearing in September 2015 and this month directed Bayer (again!) to launch new clinical trials and to add a \u201cblack box warning\u201d to make sure women understand the risks.\n\nThere is no dispute that hormonal birth control, in general, increases a woman\u2019s risk of blood clots, and it is indisputably linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cervical and liver cancer, elevated blood pressure, decreased desire and sexual dysfunction and stroke.\n\nThe main question, however, is how the Pill and hormone-releasing devices impact a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe medical community agrees that the risk of breast cancer is greater in women who have an increased exposure to the hormone estrogen. Women who begin menstruating early \u2014 before the age of twelve \u2014 and experience menopause late \u2014 after fifty-five \u2014 are at a greater risk of breast cancer because of this extra estrogen. Hormonal birth control functions precisely by increasing a woman\u2019s exposure to estrogen. Therefore, it would seem, the longer a woman uses hormonal birth control, the greater her risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe argument should end there: Birth control is harmful to women. But drug manufacturers and others who profit handsomely from the HHS mandate downplay the serious and even fatal side effects, including death and breast cancer, by insisting that of millions of women using these drugs and devices, only a statistically small number are being harmed.\n\nBut how many is too many?\n\nFaulty ignition switches on General Motors cars have been linked to 124 deaths and hundreds of injuries, which led to numerous lawsuits, millions of vehicle recalls and congressional hearings. Ford Pintos were recalled in 1978 after a design flaw with the engine killed three people. Firestone recalled 14 million tires in 2000 after reports of 25 deaths.\n\nBut where contraception is concerned, rather than recalling these deadly drugs and grilling pharmaceutical executives in Congress, the Obama administration is promoting their use and insisting that employers foot the bill.\n\nNot this employer. I care about the women on my staff \u2014 some still single, some newlyweds, some with growing families. Their health matters to me, and so I will continue to spread the word that birth control is harmful to women. And I will not obey the mandate.\n\nThe HHS mandate is the real war on women.\n\nJanet Morana is the executive director of Priests for Life; co-founder of the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, and author of Recall Abortion www.RecallAbortion.com (2013 Saint Benedict Books).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Janet A.
