That move by Merrill has prompted several specialized practices to seek new homes elsewhere, including with its biggest Wall Street rival, according to Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com. One Michigan-based team, led by longtime Merrill veterans Brian and Timothy Brice, managed $4.5 billion in assets and moved over to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in September. Brian Brice says it \u201cfeels like home already\u201d\u2013in part because they now answer to CEO James Gorman and President Greg Fleming, who spent time at Merrill.\n\nMANAGING THE MONEY:\n\nResetting expectations for active funds. Even when they pick the right actively managed funds, investors often have unrealistic expectations that set them up for failure, says Russell Kinnel, director of manager research for Morningstar Inc. To get the most out of an active fund, an investor must understand the holding period required and the fund\u2019s likely volatility, he writes on Morningstar\u2019s website. To trounce an index, a fund has to diverge from that benchmark\u2013and funds that do that are sure to have periods of underperformance. It would be wrong to expect great performance every year.\n\nA great run for intermediate-bond funds. Most actively managed funds have lagged behind their benchmarks in recent years, but that\u2019s not true of active intermediate-bond funds. Over three years through June 30, almost 70% of them outperformed, while the number of outperformers over five years was over 60%, notes investment analyst Ben Carlson on his blog, A Wealth of Common Sense. He explores some possible explanations, including the larger funds\u2019 capacity to exploit economies of scale in the bond market, or to underweight government bonds and overweight mortgage or corporate bonds.\n\nNew non-transparent funds may be a hard sell. There\u2019s problem for advisers who are considering using the new breed of non-transparent exchange-traded funds planned by Eaton Vance, according to Mark Luschini of Janney Capital Management. \u201cHow do you build trust with a client while recommending funds that are less transparent, not more?\u201d he tells Financial Advisor IQ. He says the design of the funds, to be called NextShares, involved \u201cbasically trading a more fund-manager-friendly disclosure policy for one that\u2019s less client-friendly.\u201d\n\nTHE PRACTICE:\n\nRestoring a client\u2019s self-esteem. California-based adviser Rob Schultz saw a problem with a client couple: The husband, who had retired as a professional musician, was feeling inferior to his still-employed spouse and deferring to her on all financial decisions. So Mr. Schultz decided to appoint the husband as the household\u2019s chief operating officer, he tells Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com. He also encouraged him to become involved in philanthropy, which led to a new gig\u2013teaching music to schoolchildren.\n\nTHE BUSINESS:\n\nIndustry sees high cost, mission creep in data plan. A powerful trade group for the securities industry is firing away again at a proposal to require brokerages to regularly supply data on transactions to regulators. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association previously had warned, among other things, that confidential client information could wind up in the wrong hands. Now, InvestmentNews reports, it says the data-collection system would be too expensive for brokerages and give the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority too much power.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s advisers are happier, Merrill\u2019s maybe not. Morgan Stanley\u2019s advisers are happier with their employer this year than last year, while Merrill Lynch\u2019s appear less so, according to WealthManagement.com. In the annual REP magazine survey, Morgan\u2019s overall approval rating by its own brokers rose to an average 8.3 on a 10-point scale, compared to 6.6 last year. At Merrill it dropped to 6.6 from last year\u2019s 7.6\u2013although less than 100 of Merrill\u2019s 14,000 brokers answered the survey. The happiest brokerage shops, once again, were Edward Jones (9.5) and Raymond James (9.1).\n\nThe Wealth Adviser briefing covers topics of special interest to wealth managers, financial planners and other advisers.
