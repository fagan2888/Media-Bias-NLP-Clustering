The locker room is already filled with so much judgment, and I barely feel OK changing in front of my naturally born girl peers.\n\nA third student, a 16-year-old sophomore, expressed frustration.\n\n\u201c[W]e are supposed to accept this and feel like nothing really is happening, but the fact of the matter is that this did get pretty big and now we have someone with male genitals in our girls\u2019 locker room when we are changing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Daily Signal spoke with five girls who attend the same high school as Student A, four of whom oppose the student\u2019s use of their locker room and one who supports it.\n\nThe Daily Signal also spoke with parents and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Student A in the lawsuit.\n\nWhat became clear is that neither side is pleased with the final agreement the district reached with the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, suggesting that public schools are not sure how best to deal with the difficult issues surrounding transgender students\u2019 use of gender-specific facilities.\n\nPrivacy in the Locker Rooms\n\nThe Department of Education\u2019s investigation into alleged discrimination found that \u201cthe district honored Student A\u2019s request to be treated as a female in all respects except her request to be provided access to the girls\u2019 locker rooms.\u201d\n\nThis included granting the transgender student \u201cunlimited\u201d access to the girls\u2019 bathrooms and allowing the student to play on the girls\u2019 sports teams.\n\nIn lieu of granting access to the girls\u2019 locker rooms, the school at one point installed a bank of lockers in a private bathroom and encouraged the student to invite friends who were comfortable changing there to move their lockers. This was meant to avert Student A from being forced to change alone.\n\nStudent A wasn\u2019t happy with the setup and sought equal access to the locker area because \u201cshe wanted to be a girl like every other girl,\u201d the Department of Education\u2019s report said.\n\nBut on this front, the school administration wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nThe school originally held its ground based \u201cnot only on Student A\u2019s rights and needs, but on the privacy concerns of all students,\u201d the Department of Education noted in its report.\n\nThat all changed Nov. 2, when the school received the report saying if it did not change its policies to allow Student A into the girls\u2019 locker rooms, the government could suspend or terminate the school\u2019s federal education funding for violating Title IX regulations.\n\nTitle IX is the federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program. Experts disagree whether the law applies to transgenders\u2019 use of separate facilities, although courts in Pennsylvania and Virginia ruled it does not.\n\nBoth those cases are being appealed.\n\nTo avoid charges of discrimination, District 211 reached an agreement with the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. In it, the school promised to provide Student A access to the girls\u2019 locker room throughout the duration of the student\u2019s time there.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, District 211 receives more than $5 million in federal funding each year.\n\nThe federal agency and Illinois school district reached the deal \u201cbased on Student A\u2019s representation that she will change in private changing stations in the girls\u2019 locker room,\u201d the report said. Since Student A\u2019s use of the privacy curtains is non-binding, legal experts say it is not clear what would happen if the student decided to change out in the open.\n\nBut even if Student A does abide by the arrangement, those who oppose the student\u2019s use of the girls\u2019 locker rooms say they\u2019re still uncomfortable with the settlement.\n\n\u201cWhen she\u2019s walking in and out of the privacy curtain, what happens when you\u2019re in a state of undress?\u201d a sophomore on the lacrosse team asked rhetorically, adding:\n\nThen she is fully exposed to everything in the locker room. That was my main concern with the privacy curtain. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a curtain around her face, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s not looking at everything around her.\n\nTo accommodate girls who \u201cwish to be assured of privacy while changing,\u201d the district agreed to install additional private changing stations inside the locker rooms.\n\nThose critical of the compromise say the school is giving Student A \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will always be respectful to Student A and will treat her like I would anyone else I know,\u201d the 15-year-old sophomore told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe all have to deal with inconveniences that we have to deal with, and I don\u2019t feel as though someone should gain special treatment over me and all other naturally born girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I understand [Student A\u2019s feelings], but there are so many other people that you have to consider despite yourself,\u201d another student added.\n\nWhen the school board voted 5-2 in favor of the agreement, members made clear that the deal applies only to Student A and is not a district-wide policy.\n\nTo accommodate Student A during off-campus sporting events, the Department of Education will require District 211 to provide access to girls\u2019 locker rooms \u201cin a manner consistent\u201d with the home high school.\n\nIf locker rooms don\u2019t already have them, this could mean installing privacy curtains inside all those locker rooms.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s What\u2019s on the Inside That Counts\u2019\n\nLauren Gregory, a 17-year-old attending the same high school as Student A, sees the situation differently. Gregory, who had no qualms going public with her name, said she believes those against Student A\u2019s use of the girls\u2019 locker rooms are more concerned with the \u201cprinciple of being transgender rather than the locker room thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people are talking about privacy, and there\u2019s been a lot of talk about anatomy \u2026 [but] the things that we value most in life are not physical,\u201d Gregory said, adding:\n\nEveryone tells your kids when you\u2019re growing up, don\u2019t worry how you look, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. I think I really carry that with me still, and I think that if someone feels a certain way and they feel like they\u2019re in the wrong body, then I don\u2019t have a problem with it. I think they have the right to become whoever they should be.\n\nGregory agreed that girls already feel uncomfortable changing in the locker rooms\u2014some even change in bathroom stalls to prevent other girls from seeing their bodies, she said.\n\nBut Gregory believes that transgender students face similar insecurities and therefore are \u201cnot going to flaunt it or use it for bad things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that these people who want to change their gender, they truly do not like the way that they are\u2014the way that they were born\u2014they don\u2019t like the anatomy that they have, and they\u2019re not going to flaunt it or use it for bad things,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even want it. They want to change it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Lynching the Board\u2019\n\nThe ACLU of Illinois represents Student A in the lawsuit against District 211.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the organization, said the girls who spoke out deserve \u201ca lot of credit\u201d for attempting to be \u201csensitive and yet show their concerns the best way they could.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yohnka said, \u201cThe concern that is being raised on the part of these students is not the concern that actually arises in the use of the locker rooms.\u201d He suggested that girls don\u2019t fully disrobe for physical education and sporting events.\n\n\u201cThis is not an instance in which she intends to be immodest or provocative in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Yohnka said of Student A. \u201cIf one actually reads the findings from the [Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights], what they reveal is that, despite the reputed claims of the administration, students don\u2019t fully disrobe in the locker rooms that she\u2019s seeking access to.\u201d\n\nMultiple girls who spoke with The Daily Signal disputed that, saying they undress in the locker room for various sporting events, including lacrosse. They added that most sports teams share the same locker room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a misguidance people have about high school girls not changing their entire clothes,\u201d the lacrosse player said.\n\n.@ACLUofIL Director of Communications and Public Policy Ed Yohnka speaks in support of Student A #WeStandWithHer pic.twitter.com/lFRQPeKszb \u2014 ACLU of Illinois (@ACLUofIL) December 8, 2015\n\nStudents say showering hasn\u2019t been an issue in this case because of the way the PE and sports programs work, although the school has a swim requirement that could affect future cases.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Yohnka said the concern about Student A\u2019s anatomy is simply \u201chysteria\u201d created by the school administration.\n\n\u201cThis administration has gone on television and talked about our client\u2019s anatomy,\u201d Yohnka, criticizing the school\u2019s decision to go public with the negotiations, told The Daily Signal. \u201cIf they had done this to any other student in this district, the parents would be there lynching the board.\u201d\n\nReached by The Daily Signal, a spokesman for District 211 officials said they would let previous statements and actions speak for themselves.\n\nIn October, when Superintendent Daniel Cates went public with the complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Right, he put out a statement defending the administration\u2019s original position of limiting Student A\u2019s access to the girls\u2019 locker room.\n\nIn a message published in a newsletter, Cates wrote: \u201cDistrict 211 has supported\u2014and continues to support\u2014transgender students and their families while always balancing the rights and concerns of all students we serve.\u201d (The full message is below.)\n\nSome parents in District 211 told The Daily Signal that the school should have made the complaint public earlier than October so that the community could have been more involved in the school\u2019s formulation of policy.\n\n\u201cWe just want to decide this as a community first, instead of just quickly responding to the government, who has no business telling us what to do at a local level, especially on this,\u201d Vicki Wilson, a mother of a sophomore, told The Daily Signal.\n\nWilson has been active in the debate and is a member of the group D211 Parents for Privacy.\n\nYohnka suggested that the ACLU would have preferred that the school administration had reached a final agreement with the Department of Education before making the dispute public.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not denying for a moment that they shouldn\u2019t have shared a resolution, but I think there\u2019s a way to, first of all, reach a resolution first,\u201d Yohnka said. \u201cAt the time that they had made their announcement, they were still negotiating with [the Department of Education.] \u2026 It created this frenzy around all this as opposed to simply announcing we\u2019ve reached a settlement, this is what it is, this is what it entails and really being prepared to do the educational piece.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\nOne of the things they might have thought to do was to use this moment as an opportunity to educate everyone involved in the community, in the school, et cetera, about these particular issues, but of course instead they decided to go out and engage in what really was a cynical public relations campaign in which you had a grown man on television talking about a young woman\u2019s body.\n\nThe dispute is far from over, and if another transgender student comes along, the high school might have to address the situation again.\n\n\u201cThe school district says at the end of the day that they\u2019re still going to limit unfettered access to locker rooms based on anatomy, which fundamentally still misunderstands the notion of what it means to be transgender,\u201d Yohnka said. \u201cThe anatomy in some ways scientifically is the least important indication of gender identity that there is, and yet they seem to be relying so heavily on it.\u201d\n\nTo avoid facing the same problem, lawmakers in Illinois are considering addressing the issue at the state level.\n\n\u201cThis is a push by the federal government to bully local units of government into adopting these kind of policies,\u201d Illinois state Rep. Tom Morrison, a conservative Republican who has three children in the area, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThis patchwork of policies is making it very confusing for parents and students and visitors to these schools,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt would be helpful to have some guidance and guidelines that establish clear boundaries for bathroom and locker room policy.\u201d\n\nEmergency Meeting\n\nIn early December, the District 211 school board called an emergency meeting to reconsider its decision to change its original position and instead allow Student A full access to the girls\u2019 locker rooms.\n\nThe meeting drew a large crowd, with students and parents telling The Daily Signal that people came from all over the state.\n\nDecember 7th, 2015, District 211 School Board public forum for a new Transgender policy. Owen Daniel-McCarter:\u2026 https://t.co/fTvKb1xt8L \u2014 IL Safe Schools (@ILSafeSchools) December 9, 2015\n\nSources attributed the high attendance to groups such as the ACLU that advocate on behalf of transgender rights. Before the meeting, those groups sent out press releases telling members their support was needed. One ACLU press release read:\n\nThere were many supportive voices at the board meeting last week. However, the opponents to fairness made up the majority of speakers. We\u2019d like to see more supporters turn out on Monday and could use your help.
