For anyone fortunate enough to catch one between evening classes, museum visits, round-the-world trips, bike rides, hikes, wild swimming or 18 holes on the golf course, it\u2019s important to talk fast and glean all you can from them before their next engagement. Because these ladies are busy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just getting my things together for Italian class and then I\u2019ve got pilates,\u201d 65-year-old Anna-Grethe Mikkelsen explains at 9am on a Thursday morning from her immaculate home in Viborg, Jutland. \u201cWe\u2019re also off to Helsinki, then Munich on a house swap, so there\u2019s lots to do.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s my sewing, knitting, gardening and playing piano for the local church as well as a lot of walking,\u201d she tells me. Quickly. \u201cBut being retired is great!\u201d she insists when I suggest it sounds exhausting. \u201cIt\u2019s like one long really fun holiday!\u201d Her hectic social schedule isn\u2019t unusual among Danish retirees.\n\nEva Kerner, 71, a former secretary, has been retired since 2006 and goes to the gym twice a week (\u201cjust for a couple of hours a time\u201d), attends concerts, visits museums, travels extensively, sings in a choir and is a prolific seamstress (\u201cI\u2019m making two dresses for my daughter-in-law just now\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s a nice life,\u201d Kerner tells me. \u201cPeople say, \u2018oh, you\u2019re doing so much! You must be tired!\u2019 but actually it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 being so active keeps you young. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. A study claims that retired Danish women are the most content in Europe , with those aged 65-74 scoring 8.6 out of 10 on the happiness scale \u2013 something experts suggest is partly down to the perspective that comes with age. \u201cOlder people are much better at knowing what makes them happy and living according to that, instead of what other people expect from them,\u201d says Aarhus University professor and \u201chappiness\u201d economist Christian Bj\u00f8rnskov. Or, as Kerner puts it: \u201cI\u2019m happier because I don\u2019t stress so much. I don\u2019t have to look after anyone else \u2013 I can do as I please.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cI have lots of friends who are all retired as well, so we can meet up whenever we like\u201d \u2013 and these friendships explain why Denmark\u2019s female retirees are faring better than their male counterparts.\n\n\u201cWomen are typically better at creating and maintaining social relationships,\u201d says Meik Wiking of Denmark\u2019s Happiness Research Institute, \u201cand we know from studies that a sense of belonging is one of the best indicators of happiness.\u201d Research also shows that staying active improves wellbeing and learning a second language has a positive effect on the brain. No wonder Mikkelsen and Kerner sound upbeat.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just being over 65, female and busy that guarantees you a retirement of pure revelry. There\u2019s something about the experience of \u201cliving Danishly\u201d that also helps.\n\n\u201cDenmark is a country that takes care of its citizens,\u201d says retired associate professor Jette Eiberg, 71, from Copenhagen. \u201cI feel very lucky to be here and I\u2019m really grateful\u201d \u2013 something else that has been proven to boost happiness levels.\n\n\u201cWe often say to each other what a privileged life we have,\u201d agrees Kerner, who says being a pensioner in the country regularly voted the happiest on the planet has served her generation well. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good in my mother\u2019s day \u2013 there wasn\u2019t so much state support \u2013 and I hear younger people complaining about money, but we have the best of both worlds. Denmark\u2019s good for families, too \u2013 with childcare for our kids when they were small and then for our grandchildren.\u201d\n\nThe famous welfare state subsidises day care places for children from the age of six months, making childcare affordable for all and excusing grandparents from a second career as unpaid babysitters (unlike in the UK where one in four working families rely on grandparents for childcare). \u201cWe always told our children we were happy to help out, but that looking after the grandchildren shouldn\u2019t dictate our lives,\u201d says Kerner.\n\nSky-high taxes that make capitalists choke on their Chablis may also have the happy side effect of making Danes more content. Denmark has the lowest income inequality among all the OECD countries and studies show that living in neighbourhoods where most people earn about the same can make you happier. \u201cYou pay taxes all your life and then you get a pension that\u2019s enough to live on \u2013 though you need savings for some of the extras,\u201d explains Kerner, \u201cso it\u2019s a pretty good deal.\u201d\n\nDenmark has the best pension system in the world, according to the Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index, with the average Dane retiring at 65. And because Denmark has one of the shortest working weeks at just 37 hours, Danes have plenty of time to foster friendships and extracurricular interests throughout their careers to see them through retirement.\n\n\u201cThe job you have as a woman often isn\u2019t your whole identity,\u201d adds Eiberg. \u201cYou also have your friends and your home life and your family. We have more social relationships and I have friends I\u2019ve known my whole life, but for men it\u2019s not the same. I think women are probably \u2018better\u2019 at being retired. I have a pretty good life now. I read a lot, I go to lectures at the university \u2013 I\u2019m just starting a class on Marcel Proust \u2013 and I travel, like a lot of Danes.\u201d Viking wanderlust could also improve wellbeing; research from Nuffield Health showed that holidays can reduce stress.\n\nOf course, not all Danish pensioners are jetting off on minibreaks or ruminating on the work of Proust. Older women face many of the same challenges as they would in the rest of the world. Ruth Lemche, 80, from Copenhagen, who has been a widow for 10 years, says: \u201cI have a few health problems now and my legs aren\u2019t so good. I miss my husband terribly and because women tend to be the ones that live longer it can be difficult for women like me.\u201d\n\nThe Eurostat study showed a slight decline in the happiness of Danish women after the age of 74, from 8.6 to 8.4, although the figure is still far higher than the 6.8 EU average for this age group. \u201cBut I can\u2019t complain, Denmark is a good place to be,\u201d adds Lemche. \u201cI still play golf and there are organisations through the local kommune [council] that do a lot for old people like organising events and even holidays. I have nice life. Plus I\u2019m off on a trip tomorrow to see my sister \u2013 and she\u2019s 89!\u201d\n\nJane Holm, 72, a former administrator from Copenhagen echoes Lemche\u2019s sentiments. \u201cLife\u2019s not perfect, but I have my family and good friends to socialise and travel with. I keep busy \u2013 I\u2019m on the board of the local co-operative shop; I go to museums and art galleries; I cycle and do exercise classes and run to keep fit.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m put to shame by the fitness regime of a pensioner. Running? \u201cOf course! I don\u2019t want to live until I\u2019m 120, but it\u2019s nice to feel healthy. I don\u2019t think about my age too much. I certainly don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in my 70s. I mean, I know I\u2019ll die eventually, but not now. Not yet. I don\u2019t have time \u2026\u201d\n\nHelen Russell is a freelance journalist based in Denmark and author of The Year of Living Danishly", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Viking wanderlust and the pension system all play their part.
