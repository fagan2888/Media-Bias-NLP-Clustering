Ketapang, Borneo, Indonesia

A baby orangutan who was rescued after being kept for months in a chicken cage has been slowly recovering in West Borneo.

Budi was found in a critical condition late last December in the village of Kubing, Ketapang, neglected and starving in a small, dark chicken cage.

He was being fed entirely on condensed milk for just over a year, according to charity International Animal Rescue (IAR).

Budi's owner contacted the charity, informing them she was willing to hand her pet orangutan over as he was very sick.

The charity transported Budi at the IAR Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Ketapang, West Kalimantan, where he is still being treated in the quarantine section by a veterinary team.

At the time of his rescue, he was in extreme pain, unable to move, sit up or lift his limbs, which were malformed as a result of months of malnutrition.

His body was swollen with fluid and he suffered from severe anaemia, the charity said.

His food had to be pureed because he never learned how to chew.

In the past couple of months, with intensive treatment, care and physiotherapy sessions, Budi has started making progress, according to IAR.

In the latest video released by the charity on Friday, he is seen clinging to his veterinary's fingers and swinging his legs.

Fifteen orangutans were rescued by IAR between October to December 2014, resulting in a total of 82 orangutans in the care of its rehabilitation centre in West Kalimantan at the end of the year.
