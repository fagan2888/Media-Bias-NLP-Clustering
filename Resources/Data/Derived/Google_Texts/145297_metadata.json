March 30 and 31, when several fire calls were reported by county dispatchers \u2014 including one for a large wildfire northwest of Topeka that damaged several structures \u2014 the average wind speed was 15.7 and 20.1 mph, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, for March 30 the maximum sustained wind speed was 31 mph, and the peak wind gust was 41 mph. For March 31, the maximum sustained wind speed was 31 and the peak gust was 44 mph. Other areas in northeast Kansas had similar windy numbers for March.\n\nWith all that in mind, the state statute for legal burning says the wind speed has to be 15 mph or lower.\n\nSo while farmers burned March 29 when the wind was an average speed of 4.9 and perfect for burning, the next few days caused havoc for fire crews.\n\n\u201cOne gust of wind from a different direction could just change your whole day,\u201d said Silver Lake fire chief Joe Hawkins, who said calls were up for his volunteer fire department this year, in large part because of the grass fires.\n\nHawkins said last year around this time, the department had just 55 calls. This year? They already have done 93. The 93rd didn\u2019t come for them until May 28 last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been kind of a weird season, I would say. This is the rough time (for grass fires),\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nOne farmer who hasn\u2019t had any problem with his burns this year is Rossville\u2019s Derek Brunin.\n\nA rancher who has several acres of crops, as well as around 250 acres of pasture for his calf-cow operation, Brunin has been around farming his whole life, including the institution of prescribed burning.\n\nThe 27-year-old, with several friends and family, burned around 200 acres of pasture two weekends ago on March 29 not far from Rossville with no troubles of wildfires.\n\nWhile burning serves several purposes, including helping with wildlife habitats and prairie preservation, Brunin and his fellow ranchers use it to help make grazing better for their cattle. They need the fire to bulk up the calves to make more money to provide for their families.\n\nAs shown through studies at Kansas State University Research and Extension, cattle who graze on grass that was burned previously as opposed to the alternative are healthier and gain several more pounds.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is, you know, a lot of people not involved in agriculture, they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Brunin said. \u201cThey probably think, \u2018Oh yeah, they just don\u2019t want to mow (the grass).\u2019 There\u2019s a lot more that burning accomplishes than just cleaning it up.\u201d\n\nBrunin said the key to a successful, safe burn is prep work and back burning, which creates a buffer around the desired burn area so it doesn\u2019t escape into other areas.\n\nWhile Brunin said he has never seen an out-of-control fire in person, Hartman said the Sunflower State doesn\u2019t lack for wildfires.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make CNN like Montana or Colorado or California, but there are a lot of years actually where we\u2019ll have more acres burned than those states will,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cBut our fires, they\u2019re over in four, five, six hours and then they\u2019re done. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t really make national media news.\n\n\"We do get a few structures each year,\u201d Hartman added, \u201cand that\u2019s unfortunate, but we don\u2019t get dozens of houses lost all in one event like some of those western states do, fortunately.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Eric Smith", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Prairie fires in the spring months are as much of an annual ritual in Kansas as, say, good Sunflower State college hoops.", "title": "Fires, while beneficial, keep fire crews busy", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-04-06/fires-while-beneficial-keep-fire-crews-busy", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13238658.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Prairie fires in the spring months are as much of an annual ritual in Kansas as, say, good Sunflower State college hoops.And while some question why the fires are started, fire experts agree, the benefits of the burning are crucial to keeping Kansas\u2019 prairie land alive.Each year in the months of March and April, farmers and ranchers set pastures ablaze through the use of prescribed burns \u2014 that is, having a plan, then burning the grass by using fire as a tool with an end goal in mind."}, "article_summary": "Additionally, for March 30 the maximum sustained wind speed was 31 mph, and the peak wind gust was 41 mph.\nFor March 31, the maximum sustained wind speed was 31 and the peak gust was 44 mph.\nPrairie fires in the spring months are as much of an annual ritual in Kansas as, say, good Sunflower State college hoops.\nWith all that in mind, the state statute for legal burning says the wind speed has to be 15 mph or lower.\nAnd while some question why the fires are started, fire experts agree, the benefits of the burning are crucial to keeping Kansas\u2019 prairie land alive."}
