Rather than defending it against those enemies, we slept,\u201d he added.\n\nCharles Kesler, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said free men used to seek understanding and justice through the liberal arts.\n\nStudents of the \u201c\u201960s new left\u201d appealed to Abraham Lincoln and the Declaration of Independence to motivate national reforms, he explained at the Heritage event Friday.\n\nBut not anymore, said Kesler, who is also a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute. Students on the left now \u201cdon\u2019t have a good word to say for America, really,\u201d Kesler added. \u201cFor them, America and the West represent legacies of racist, sexist, imperialist, capitalist power.\u201d\n\nFor these students, education is about power, not justice, he said.\n\nUniversity of Missouri President Tim Wolfe recently resigned because the university football team threatened not to play until he had departed. Their grievance against him? \u201cStructural racism.\u201d\n\nPointing to Wolfe\u2019s resignation, Wood suggested that students have started a \u201ccrybully\u201d movement, clamoring not for education, but for privileges to which they believe they are entitled.\n\nInstead of viewing higher education as \u201ca privilege to be earned by \u2026 sustained intellectual effort, humility, and the task of taking up what great minds have already discovered,\u201d Wood said, students increasingly view college as their \u201cdue\u201d and \u201clook on anything that hampers their free enjoyment of what goes on on campus\u2014sex, drugs, rock and roll\u2014as an insult \u2026 and an outrage.\u201d\n\nKesler said student demands have spread across the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not recommending it,\u201d he chuckled, referencing thedemands.org\u2014a website that lists 77 colleges and universities where students have demanded apologies, tuition, events, classes, and other relief from \u201csystemic and structural racism on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than ordering young minds, administrators have been ordered to resign,\u201d Arthur Milikh, the panel host and assistant director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics, wrote in a recent article for The Daily Signal. Milikh added:\n\nHaving become convinced that universities service non-intellectual ends like multiculturalism, social justice, and pre-professionalism, presidents and administrators have little authority outside bookkeeping, job-placing, and safe space-creating.\n\n>>> Watch the entire event: \u2018Who Rules the Universities?\u2019", "article_metadata": {"description": "For students on the left, \u201cAmerica and the West represent legacies of racist, sexist, imperialist, capitalist, power,\u201d an education expert says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For students on the left, \u201cAmerica and the West represent legacies of racist, sexist, imperialist, capitalist, power,\u201d an education expert says.", "title": "'Crybully' Movement Infects Universities, Scholars Say", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160226_WhoRulesUniversities_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T21:49:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RoOFAZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For students on the left, \u201cAmerica and the West represent legacies of racist, sexist, imperialist, capitalist, power,\u201d an education expert says.", "title": "'Crybully' Movement Infects Universities, Scholars Say", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160226_WhoRulesUniversities_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2016-03-02T14:20:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T21:49:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Who Rules the Universities, Charles Kesler, Peter Wood, Heritage Foundation, higher education, students, structural racism, privilege, protests, student demands"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFor them, America and the West represent legacies of racist, sexist, imperialist, capitalist power.\u201dFor these students, education is about power, not justice, he said.\n\u201cStructural racism.\u201dPointing to Wolfe\u2019s resignation, Wood suggested that students have started a \u201ccrybully\u201d movement, clamoring not for education, but for privileges to which they believe they are entitled.\nStudents on the left now \u201cdon\u2019t have a good word to say for America, really,\u201d Kesler added.\nMilikh added:Having become convinced that universities service non-intellectual ends like multiculturalism, social justice, and pre-professionalism, presidents and administrators have little authority outside bookkeeping, job-placing, and safe space-creating.\nCharles Kesler, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said free men used to seek understanding and justice through the liberal arts."}
