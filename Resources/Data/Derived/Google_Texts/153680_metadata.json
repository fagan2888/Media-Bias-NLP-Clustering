Looks like the swimming pool lifeguard is getting a bonus this year: less than ten percent of swimmers died on his watch! Or try telling the IRS during an audit that \u201ceverything\u2019s good: the error rate was below ten percent.\u201d\n\nThe IG found the rate for Medicare\u2019s fee-to-service program was 12.09 percent, but the topline numbers were equally appalling.\n\nMedicaid spending as a whole was 9.78 percent fraud, barely under ten percent. No biggie, though. That program only costs $475 billion per year \u2026 wait, what? How can we possibly be wasting ten percent of that?\n\nThe IG report notes the government had set for itself the goal of only wasting 6.7 percent from Medicaid, or $31.8 billion. The difference between the actual amount of fraud and the goal was $14.6 billion. Get \u2019em next time, HHS, you\u2019re only the cost of an aircraft carrier from your goal!\n\nAll this makes you think that surely \u2013 surely \u2013 there are urgent efforts to stop $4,000 a second from being completely wasted?\n\nThat\u2019s funny. No, the next finding of the IG was faulting HHS for failing to conduct audits of its spending. HHS is supposed to be conducting these audits not just because they are wasting so much money, but because there is a duly enacted law making it illegal for them not to, and they still didn\u2019t.\n\nThe program is called \u201cRecovery Audit Contractors\u201d (RACs), and it\u2019s a tiny oasis of thrift in the Sahara Desert of squander. The program pays private auditors a small percentage of the funds they help the government recover, giving them a financial incentive to do the jobs federal employees won\u2019t do.\n\nIn the past few years, the RACs have been able to identify more than $10 billion in fraud that was successfully put back into Uncle Sam\u2019s bank account.\n\nAs you can imagine, the people previously receiving that $10 billion were not happy, and they hired a small army of lobbyists to launch a K Street jihad against the RACs. The Obama administration, which relied the money and power of some of the same industry segments (namely unscrupulous hospitals) to help pass Obamacare, sided with the RAC opponents, and has been slowly strangling the program to death.\n\nThe latest regulation limits the RACs to reviewing .5 percent of payments for the entities they\u2019re supposed to be auditing, or one of every 200, which is just insane. That\u2019s like evaluating a mural from a postage stamp-size patch of it \u2013 it\u2019s impossible.\n\nAll of this is happening while wasteful payments are exploding. According to the Government Accountability Office, in fiscal year 2014 the government took $125 billion and essentially lit it on fire. One year earlier, the amount was $106 billion. If you extrapolate that rate of increase for ten years, the government would be wasting the entire cost of the Vietnam War every year.\n\nAt the very least, the Obama administration needs to stop trying to kill the RAC program, which is seems to be about the only effective way of combating waste yet invented, starting by giving the auditors access to review all payments, not a laughably-small portion of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What A Waste: HHS Throwing Away Billions on Medicare", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "What A Waste: HHS Throwing Away Billions on Medicare", "title": "What A Waste: HHS Throwing Away Billions on Medicare - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_16100507509147.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/20/what-a-waste-hhs-throwing-away-billions-on-medicare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What A Waste: HHS Throwing Away Billions on Medicare", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_16100507509147.jpg", "title": "What A Waste: HHS Throwing Away Billions on Medicare - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "government waste, HHS, Medicare,Big Government,HHS", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Medicare", "published_time": "2016-05-20T11:16:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "No, the next finding of the IG was faulting HHS for failing to conduct audits of its spending.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse: the fact that HHS is wasting more than ten percent of taxpayer dollars, or that the goal was to waste only ten percent.\nGet \u2019em next time, HHS, you\u2019re only the cost of an aircraft carrier from your goal!\nThe IG report notes the government had set for itself the goal of only wasting 6.7 percent from Medicaid, or $31.8 billion.\nThe program is called \u201cRecovery Audit Contractors\u201d (RACs), and it\u2019s a tiny oasis of thrift in the Sahara Desert of squander."}
