Early Saturday morning, part of the paddle board community rallied together to paddle for a purpose.

Chief Deputy, A.J. Smith of the Walton County Sheriff's Office traveled to Bay County for the event.

"Great cause, love to paddle, needed to get a work out in today," said Chief Smith. "So we're going."

Ed Naggiar, a local father of two children with autism, created the "Panama City Paddle Classic," a race that consists of a 30-mile paddle board relay race around Bay county.

The event's purpose was to benefit Panama City's FSU "Early Childhood Autism Program."

"It'll be a team effort," said participant Lauren Dorsey. "We've got three people, so I'm sure I'll be paddling 10 plus miles today."

Winds were almost 20 MPH, and temperatures were in the low 30's. Naggiar said he made the race hard, because autism is hard.

"When you think about giving up just remember why you're doing this," said Naggiar. "And you won't."

"It takes a certain mindset to do 30-miles it's not something anyone can just go ahead and do," said Naggiar. " It also takes a certain amount of reliance and tenacity to raise a child with autism."

Those participating either supported the cause or are in some way affected by it, some paddled for their family.

"I have a couple cousins with autism," said Dorsey. "It's close to home for me and I think its wonderful that we're raising money."

Others were there to support their friends.

"Some of the kids with autism seem to find comfort in being on the water and being on the board," said Chief Smith. "And I think that's one of the things that Naggiar is trying to do with his kids."

For nine hours paddle boarders, paddled with momentum and the reminder that nothing good in life comes easy.

"I'm just completely incredibly touched by all the support we've gotten from the locals and the people who've got involved in the race," said Naggiar.
