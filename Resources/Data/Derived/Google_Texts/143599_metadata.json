We didn\u2019t expect our event to go viral across blogs, event websites, Facebook,\u201d the church said in a prepared statement Sunday.\n\nHowever, controlling the egg-loving crowd, which the church estimated at 10,000 people, proved too much, and no eggs were delivered.\n\n\u201cGetting people off the egg drop field proved to be a near impossible task \u2014 given the amount of people that ignored communication and rushed the field,\u201d pastor George Feiser said in the prepared statement.\n\nThe church received complaints that the event was unorganized. \u201cWe did our best to plan and organize, but the pure unforeseen volume of people made the entire event feel disorganized,\u201d Feiser said. \u201cI can assure you it would not have felt that way had there been less people.\u201d\n\nThe Plano event was not the only Easter egg event to go awry this weekend.\n\nA cherished Easter tradition at the Pez candy company visitor center in Orange, Conn., turned into a mess after pushy parents caused a scene at egg hunts over the weekend.\n\nThe event drew hundreds of people, some of whom ignored the rules.\n\n\u201cEveryone just rushed the field and took everything,\u201d Pez general manager Shawn Peterson told WFSB-TV.\n\nEvent organizers placed more than 9,000 eggs on three fields with the intention of having staggered start times for each age group. But Pez officials say parents didn\u2019t wait.\n\nPeterson said the crowd was \u201ckind of like locusts.\u201d\n\nPez, in a prepared statement, apologized for \u201can unfortunate situation,\u201d adding that the actions of a few turned the event into \u201ca mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe sincerely tried our best to create a fun, free activity for everyone to enjoy,\u201d Pez said.\n\nPeople who attended the hunt took to Facebook to comment on the event, calling it \u201ca joke\u201d and blaming \u201cgreedy parents\u201d for ruining it. The event ended early. No injuries were reported.\n\nIn Proctor, Vt., police were called to an overbooked Easter egg hunt Saturday at Wilson Castle after someone reported \u201cmultiple irate parents.\u201d Organizers say more than 1,200 people turned out for the event.\n\nMichael Cuthbertson, 34, of Newbury, Vt., turned his anger toward police, allegedly threatening them before fleeing. A foot chase ensued, and police used pepper spray to subdue him. He was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\n\nCuthbertson did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAzL25vLWVnZ3MtZm9yLXlvdS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWVhc3Rlci1lZ2ctZHJvcC1jYW5jZWxlZC1hZnRlci1jcm93ZC1vdmVyd2hlbG1zLXBsYW5vLWNodXJjaC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Hannah Wise", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Tossing Easter eggs from a helicopter sounds like a nice, fun, family-friendly event, until news about it goes viral and your staff can't control a 10,000-person crowd.
