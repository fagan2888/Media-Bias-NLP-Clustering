Denver International Airport broke a record on Sunday with the amount of passengers, officials said.

The airport projected that more than 182,000 passengers were served on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, making it the busiest day in DIA history, said airport spokesman Heath Montgomery.

The previous record was set on July 1, 2011 with 177,000, Montgomery said, adding that Sunday’s record “shattered” the former one.

While snow began falling Sunday evening, Montgomery said flights looked to stay on track.
