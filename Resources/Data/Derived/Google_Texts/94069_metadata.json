Gary George has filed to run for Congress against fellow Democrat U.S Rep. Gwen Moore, who has represented the 4th Congressional District in Milwaukee County since 2005.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound too out of the ordinary, right? Au contraire.\n\nGeorge was recalled from his state Senate seat in 2003, almost a year before he was convicted of one felony count of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 conspiring to defraud the government.\n\nA felon in Congress? Here are seven matches made in heaven that make just as much sense:\n\n1. Eric Shinseki, emergency room director\n\nThe former head of the Department of Veteran Affairs resigned last week amid revelations of veterans having to wait for care at VA facilities, delays that occasionally lead to deaths.\n\nSo, he should be able to make a smooth transition overseeing emergency rooms across the country.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives here.\n\n2. David Bowen, economist\n\nThe Milwaukee County Supervisor who wrote the county\u2019s new \u201cliving wage\u201d law repeatedly has claimed the increased pay would have little-to-no effect on taxpayers.\n\nYet taxpayers already are having to dole out at least $217,369 a year for three government positions to review compliance of the living wage.\n\nAnd the county\u2019s no-partisan comptroller\u2019s office estimates the living wage will remove about $11.3 million from the tax levy through 2019 and could cause the Department of Family Care to shut down because of a lack of reserves.\n\n3. Anthony Weiner, marriage counselor\n\nThe former New York politician was caught in quite a pickle when he was busted for sending sexually suggestive photographs to several women.\n\nActually, if he can stay married after that, he should be able to fix any relationship.\n\n4. Brett Hulsey, psychiatrist\n\nThe Wisconsin state representative who intends to run for governor this year has made a name for himself for his often puzzling antics.\n\nThe hijinks from the Democratic lawmaker include bringing a box cutter into the Capitol for self-defense training, being cited for disorderly conduct for allegedly flipping off a 9-year-old an inner tube at a local lake and dressing in Confederate attire outside a GOP convention.\n\nWould you really want him messing with your mind?\n\n5. Larry Craig, bathroom inspector\n\nCraig, once a Republican U.S. senator from Idaho, saw his political career effectively come to an end after he was arrested at a Minnesota airport bathroom for trying to engage in a lewd act with a police officer in an adjacent stall.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but Craig sure could come in handy for anyone who is unfortunate enough to run out of toilet paper.\n\nDon\u2019t act like it\u2019s never happened to you.\n\n6. Kathleen Sebelius, web programmer\n\nThe former secretary of Health and Human Services stepped down from her post in April following the problematic federal roll out of the federal Affordable Care Act exchange, which cost taxpayers at least $677 million.\n\nBut hey, let\u2019s give her another chance. It\u2019s not like she can do any worse.\n\n7. Barack Obama, president of the United States\n\nNo explanation needed here, folks.\n\nContact Adam Tobias at atobias@watchdog.org or follow him on Twitter @Scoop_Tobias", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Convicted felon and former Wisconsin senator Gary George files to run for Congress", "title": "7 partnerships that make as much sense as a felon running for Congress - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/obama_not_amused.gif", "url": "http://watchdog.org/148140/congress-wisconsin-felon/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "tag": "Anthony Weiner,Barack Obama,Brett Hulsey,Congress,David Bowen,eric shinseki,Gary George,Gwen Moore,Kathleen Sebelius,Larry Craig,Milwaukee County", "published_time": "2014-06-04T10:00:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Convicted felon and former Wisconsin senator Gary George files to run for Congress", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/garygeorgemug.jpg"}, "title": "7 partnerships that make as much sense as a felon running for Congress - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Convicted felon and former Wisconsin senator Gary George files to run for Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0dd0\"", "article_summary": "Yet taxpayers already are having to dole out at least $217,369 a year for three government positions to review compliance of the living wage.\nBrett Hulsey, psychiatristThe Wisconsin state representative who intends to run for governor this year has made a name for himself for his often puzzling antics.\nDavid Bowen, economistThe Milwaukee County Supervisor who wrote the county\u2019s new \u201cliving wage\u201d law repeatedly has claimed the increased pay would have little-to-no effect on taxpayers.\nBy Adam Tobias | Wisconsin ReporterMADISON, Wis. \u2014 Former Wisconsin Sen.
