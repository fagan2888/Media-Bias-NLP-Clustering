Without intending it, his answer revealed he would select judges by exactly the same criteria that has given us our current problem with a Supreme Court that is dominated by Republican nominated justices:\n\n\u201cWhen I was governor, we tried to find people with a proven record of judicial restraint, and people that were committed to enforcing the constitutional limits on government authority. In essence, what I\u2019m saying is I think we need to have people that have not just theoretically, but have had a proven record of not legislating from the bench.\u201d\n\nHe then doubled down:\n\n\u201cAll justices disappoint their presidents some of the time but Souter was like a 90 percent swing and miss,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cHow do you avoid Souters?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou focus on people to be Supreme Court justices who have a proven record of judicial restraint,\u201d Bush answered.\n\nThis is exactly the problem with the judicial philosophy promoted by many conservatives for the past 30 years: \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d in \u201cenforcing constitutional limits on government authority\u201d leads to NFIB v. Sebelius. In fairness, that is not what Bush actually said but, as George Will recently observed, that is what this judicial philosophy produces in practice.\n\nThoughtful conservatives today will insist that, properly defined, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d includes enforcing constitutional limits, and the term could be defined that way. But that is not the mentality of \u201crestraint\u201d as it was originally formulated by the Progressives and has been perpetuated by some conservatives. For years, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d has been primarily about not thwarting the will of \u201cdemocratic majorities.\u201d There are myriad doctrines to accomplish this. For example, you adopt a \u201cpresumption of constitutionality\u201d that cannot be rebutted. Or find a \u201csaving construction\u201d of a statute to avoid finding it unconstitutional. Or you \u201cdefer\u201d to administrative agencies\u2019 interpretation of statutes. Or you make a statute \u201cwork\u201d as the \u201clegislature intended\u201d (even if that means ignoring the plain or natural reading of its words).\n\nMany good conservatives truly wanted Obamacare invalidated in NFIB because it was unconstitutional. And they then sincerely wanted it to be enforced according to its terms in King. But selecting judges with the judicial mindset of \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d and \u201cdeference\u201d to the majoritarian branches leads to the results we witnessed in NFIB and King. If conservatives persist in supporting presidents who select judges on this basis, they will persist in being disappointed.\n\nI know, I know. What about Obergefell and gay marriage? Didn\u2019t that result from a lack of \u201crestraint\u201d? No, if you don\u2019t approve of Obergefell, it is because you do not agree with the constitutional rationale Justice Kennedy articulated for invalidating the state laws at issue, not because he was \u201cunrestrained.\u201d Winning Obergefell on the grounds urged by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissenting opinion also gives you NFIB and King. If you want to avoid the latter, then you should criticize the majority on the ground that Justice Thomas did in his dissent: that the majority misinterpreted the Due Process Clause, not that they were \u201cunrestrained.\u201d You will notice that Chief Justice Roberts did not join Justice Thomas\u2019s dissent (though regrettably, Justices Thomas and Scalia joined his). The Chief Justice\u2019s dissent was all about restraint and only secondarily about correctness. He cited Lochner v. New York 16 times because Lochner was supposedly about activism, rather than appropriate restraint. In contrast, Justice Thomas appealed to the original meaning of \u201cthe due process of law.\u201d There is a big big difference between these two judicial mindsets.\n\nSo, if conservative Republicans want a different performance from the judiciary in the future, they must vet their presidential candidates to see whether they understand this point. Jeb Bush clearly does not. And I have personally heard Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina say much the same sort of thing about judges, showing that they do not understand this either\u2013at least not yet. Only Rand Paul has been very clear about the duty of judges to invalidate unconstitutional law without restraint or deference.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard yet what other candidates think about this, but everyone should be listening closely. If you hear catch phrases like \u201cjudicial restraint,\u201d \u201cdeferring\u201d to \u201cthe democratic branches,\u201d or \u201cnot legislating from the bench,\u201d then you know this candidate intends to repeat the mistakes of past Republican presidents.\n\nConservatives must learn from the recent past what not to look for in a justice.\n\nCross posted on Instapundit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How he would repeat the same mistake that gave us \"SCOTUSCare.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "How he would repeat the same mistake that gave us \"SCOTUSCare.\"", "title": "The Definition of Insanity: Jeb Bush still favors appointing judges \u201cwith a proven record of judicial restraint\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/27/jeb-bush-still-favors-appointing-judges-with-a-proven-record-of-judicial-restraint/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RandyEBarnett"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/27/jeb-bush-still-favors-appointing-judges-with-a-proven-record-of-judicial-restraint/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf40\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHow do you avoid Souters?\u201d\u201cYou focus on people to be Supreme Court justices who have a proven record of judicial restraint,\u201d Bush answered.\nFor years, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d has been primarily about not thwarting the will of \u201cdemocratic majorities.\u201d There are myriad doctrines to accomplish this.\nIn an interview with Hugh Hewitt, Jeb Bush responded to criticism of his brother\u2019s selection of John Roberts to be Chief Justice.\nBut selecting judges with the judicial mindset of \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d and \u201cdeference\u201d to the majoritarian branches leads to the results we witnessed in NFIB and King.\nThoughtful conservatives today will insist that, properly defined, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d includes enforcing constitutional limits, and the term could be defined that way."}
