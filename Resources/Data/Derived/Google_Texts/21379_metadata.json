(Photo: Chris Brooks/Gallatin News Examiner)\n\nRodrick Napper usually found a way to be around the football this past season.\n\nWhether he carried it or brought down the opponent with it, Napper was Beech High\u2019s top playmaker in 2015.\n\nThe Buccaneer senior \u2013 who was in his second season with the team after transferring from Ripley High School prior to the 2014-15 school year \u2013 led Beech in rushing and was the team\u2019s leading tackler as well.\n\nNapper rushed for 1,581 yards on 225 carries, an average of slightly more than seven yards per carry. He rushed for 23 touchdowns in helping lead the Buccaneers to an 8-4 record, though Beech bowed out of the Class 5A playoffs after a second-round loss at Hillsboro.\n\nNapper recorded 69 tackles (54 solo) and four quarterback sacks, and he averaged 23.7 yards per kickoff return on six attempts during the season.\n\nThat performance helped Napper \u2013 who was last season\u2019s Sumner County Player of the Year \u2013 earn Co-Player of the Year honors on this season\u2019s All-County Team.\n\nNapper recently discussed his senior season, his college prospects and other topics. His feedback is as follows \u2026\n\nHow did you feel about your senior season?\n\nI feel like it went pretty good. I felt like my teammates helped me a lot. My (offensive) line and my coaches, I can\u2019t leave them out. It starts with them.\n\nHow do you manage the student-athlete life?\n\nObviously, during school hours, it\u2019s strictly school, and then, I go home and do the extra work. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time, so I\u2019m just good at managing my time like that.\n\nBeech High senior tailback/defensive back Rodrick Napper is the Sumner County Co-Player of the Year. (Photo: Chris Brooks/Gallatin News Examiner)\n\nWhat position do you hope to play at the next level?\n\nI\u2019m getting some interest at running back and at defensive back, so I\u2019m not sure yet.\n\nWhat type of recruiting interest are you getting, and are there any offers on the table?\n\nEarlier in the year, I got a call from Duke. I\u2019ve got letters from Vanderbilt and Austin Peay. I\u2019ve gotten a few letters from (Tennessee) and some smaller schools.\n\nWhat is something that people may not know about you?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of things. I don\u2019t like to just be out like that. I\u2019m a private person.\n\nWhat did you work on the most to improve during the offseason?\n\nMy speed. Last year, I was breaking runs, but I wasn\u2019t hitting the 70, 80-yarders. This year, I made it a point for myself that I wouldn\u2019t get caught from behind.\n\nWhere do you feel you still need to improve to get better?\n\nEverything. At the next level, everybody\u2019s a whole lot better. They\u2019re grown men out there.\n\nThe players of the year on the All-County Football Team include: (L to R) Gallatin junior Jordan Mason (offensive player of the year), Beech senior Rodrick Napper (co-player of the year), Hendersonville junior Terrell Carter (co-player of the year) and Beech senior Ian Hafner (defensive player of the year). (Photo: Chris Brooks/Gallatin News Examiner)\n\nWho are you closest with on the team?\n\nProbably Jowan Garrett. That\u2019s my boy. When I first got here (after transferring from Ripley prior to the 2014 season), he lived in my neighborhood, and we just linked up.\n\nWho is the best-dressed teammate?\n\nI\u2019d have to say it\u2019s Preston Tribble. Preston has everything fresh, every day.\n\nWho is the biggest jokester on your team?\n\nChris Peach. He tries to clown around, videoing stuff.\n\nDo you feel like you met or fell short of your goals, and what were those goals this season?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. The bar\u2019s always high. I gave myself big expectations. I don\u2019t feel like I did what I wanted to do.\n\nAt what point during the season did you think the team really started to get better?\n\nAfter week 4 (a 30-16 loss at Hendersonville), we went on a five-game winning streak. The team really clicked. As seniors, we stepped up. We learned how to play with each other, and that helped a lot.\n\nWhat\u2019s on your wish list for this Christmas?\n\nProbably a car, a (Ford) Mustang, a black one.\n\nDo you have any superstitions or pre-game rituals?\n\nEvery Thursday night, I eat the same thing, steak and a baked potato. On Friday, all day throughout school, I\u2019m not talking. I\u2019ve got my music in, and when I get on the field, it\u2019s go time.\n\nBeech High senior tailback/defensive back Rodrick Napper is the Sumner County Co-Player of the Year. (Photo: Chris Brooks/Gallatin News Examiner)\n\nAre you into the different styles of uniforms, and if so, which program or professional team sports your favorite uniform combination?\n\nI love it. At my old school, we had two jerseys, a home jersey and an away jersey. It\u2019s definitely an experience getting to play in these uniforms. But even though Alabama\u2019s old school, that\u2019s probably my favorite.\n\nWho is your favorite college or professional player?\n\n(Seattle Seahawks safety) Kam Chancellor. He plays with a lot of authority, and that\u2019s what I try to play with.\n\nWhich opposing high-school player do you respect the most?\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of them. I\u2019d have to say Ponchez (Gallatin junior running back Jordan Mason) and (Hendersonville junior) Terrell Carter. I\u2019ve had to try and tackle both of them. They\u2019re great players. Jordan\u2019s a college running back. He\u2019s big. He\u2019s fast, and he\u2019s strong with (the ball). Terrell can do it all. He can play offense and defense. He\u2019s got good footwork and technique.\n\nWhich is your favorite college or professional team?\n\nFor college, I\u2019m an Alabama fan. My favorite pro team is the New England Patriots.\n\nBeech head coach Anthony Crabtree\u2019s thoughts on Napper \u2026\n\nHe\u2019s a very explosive athlete, and he gave us a lot on both sides of the ball. He ran the ball extremely hard. He\u2019s a really tough, hard-nosed kid. Defensively, we were able to do a lot of things with him and move him around, stunt him, drop him off into coverage. He made a lot of tackles. He\u2019s just a very, very valuable piece to our football team. His knowledge of what we do and our scheme \u2026 he was football-smart when he got here, but he did a really good job of picking up our terminology and understanding what things meant and how that fit into our game plan each week.\n\nThe Napper file\n\n225 rushing attempts\n\n1,581 rushing yards\n\n7 yards per carry\n\n23 rushing touchdowns\n\n3 receptions for 23 yards\n\n69 total tackles (54 solo)\n\n4 quarterback sacks\n\n1 fumble recovery\n\n23.7 yards per kickoff return\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1YFLj0q", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Buccaneer senior led Beech in rushing, tackles, sacks and kickoff returns", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Buccaneer senior led Beech in rushing, tackles, sacks and kickoff returns", "title": "Napper was a two-way anchor", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/sumner/2015/12/25/napper-two-way-anchor/77902726/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Buccaneer senior led Beech in rushing, tackles, sacks and kickoff returns", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9a760c8a27d2e31686089e90fb8221a3ef2bddc/c=0-0-2329-2329&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg", "title": "Napper was a two-way anchor", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Napper was a two-way anchor", "author": "Chris Brooks", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/sumner", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ced3b91245afc88880a23f6ef5b156dbc42cda52/c=0-120-2329-3225/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3eb84309ce0e42ac50e00bea2c99cf99b7c23e65/c=0-0-2329-2329/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43550cd105ec531849f6914fca755b653612115e/c=0-52-2329-1803/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa03a5cf4747931ebecc01cb1f0b16e5d3315bbb/c=0-116-2329-1432&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-25T05:09:37.390000-06:00", "shorthed": "Napper was a two-way anchor", "articleid": 77902726, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f1f271aa6dc301a2e16393932ceca4089af8e01c/c=0-116-2329-1432/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2df6269ca61395b8b14d8ac77bd00fed0f8eaec/c=32-0-2309-4048/local/-/media/2015/12/25/Nashville/B9320262439Z.1_20151225051455_000_GU0CSV1M7.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Beech, Buccaneers, football, Rodrick Napper, All-County"}, "article_summary": "Whether he carried it or brought down the opponent with it, Napper was Beech High\u2019s top playmaker in 2015.\nBeech head coach Anthony Crabtree\u2019s thoughts on Napper \u2026He\u2019s a very explosive athlete, and he gave us a lot on both sides of the ball.\nNapper rushed for 1,581 yards on 225 carries, an average of slightly more than seven yards per carry.\nBeech High senior tailback/defensive back Rodrick Napper is the Sumner County Co-Player of the Year.\n(Photo: Chris Brooks/Gallatin News Examiner)Rodrick Napper usually found a way to be around the football this past season."}
