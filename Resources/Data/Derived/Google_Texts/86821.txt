Story highlights Trump hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Bush's gubernatorial campaign and donated $50,000 to the Republican Party in 1998

But Bush's election wasn't a boon for Trump's casino endeavors in the state

Trump has repeatedly said he gives money to politicians in hopes of getting favors in return

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump openly boasts that he donates to politicians so he can exact favors from them after they reach office.

He did so for Jeb Bush in 1998, holding a high-dollar fundraiser for the gubernatorial candidate in Trump Tower and shelling out $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party. But when Bush took office in 1999, Trump didn't get the political help he needed to make his casino dreams a reality in the Sunshine State.

Instead, Bush maintained his hardline stance against gambling in the state, delivering a death blow to Trump's hopes of building out a multi-million dollar casino endeavor with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and prompting him to abandon those plans.

"It certainly had a chilling effect," Doug Guetzloe, a Florida political consultant who worked for the gaming giant Bally Entertainment in the '90s, said of Bush's election. "Gov. Bush made it clear to everyone that he was not interested in having casinos in the state of Florida ... the word definitely went through."

As Trump and Bush now lock horns in their fight to secure the Republican presidential nomination, the casino episode illustrates that the animus between the two men took root far before the 2016 race.
