What he did not know\u2014and of course, no one told him\u2014was that he had a right to have his mom present. She didn't find out until after the forced confession, however, and has since filed a bunch of paperwork trying to appeal the label of \"sexualized minor.\"\n\n(The other child who had instructed Lopez to pull his pants down had given the boy no choice, by the way: He had told him that he would pull Lopez's pants down for him if he did not obey.)\n\nThe Dysart Unified School District insists that it was simply following standard procedures in the case of \"indecent exposure,\" which is why at this point I must recommend everyone read Philip Howard's new book, \"The Rule of Nobody.\" It talks about how we got to the point where officials believe they truly must follow protocol, even when they know it makes no sense, because this is only \"fair.\" That's the outlook that has given us zero tolerance, three strikes and you're out, and mandatory minimum laws, as well as principals who think their only recourse when a five-year-old pulls down his pants is to label him a sexual deviant. Why is there no official form for labelling someone a \"protocol fetishist?\"\n\nTo watch an interview with Lopez and his mother, go here.\n\nFor more stories like this one, check out Lenore Skenazy's Free-Range Kids blog.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "If only he couldn't write his name yet!", "title": "Kindergartener Pulls Down Pants, Forced to Sign 'Sexual Misconduct' Confession", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/27/kindergartener-pulls-down-pants-forced-t", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14038772534603.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14038772534603.jpg", "title": "Kindergartener Pulls Down Pants, Forced to Sign 'Sexual Misconduct' Confession", "description": "A&nbsp;kindergartner&nbsp;who\npulled his pants and undies down&nbsp;on the playground\nafter another kid told him to do it&nbsp;was hauled off to the\nprincipal's office and forced to sign a \"sexual misconduct\"\nform.\nIf only he couldn't write his name yet!
