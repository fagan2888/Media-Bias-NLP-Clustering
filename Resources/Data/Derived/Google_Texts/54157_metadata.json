He\u2019s also a registered nurse (RN).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone from taking lives to saving them, and for me that was something I needed,\u201d Lanning said in an interview with Healthline.\n\nIn some cases, patients request Lanning, or a man in general. They want the security of knowing a strong person isn\u2019t going to drop them.\n\n\u201cPeople will respond differently to a male who is assertive than a woman,\u201d Lanning added. \u201cAnd some people mesh well and some don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMen make up only 11 percent of registered nurses in the United States, according to the 2013 American Community Survey. The American Assembly for Men in Nursing hopes to pump that statistic up to 20 percent by 2020. In 1970, men comprised only 2.7 percent of registered nurses.\n\nImage Attribution Author: UnityPoint Trinity\n\nJohn Lanning, Illinois nurse\n\n\u201cPreviously, decades of legal barriers kept men out of the field, and nursing schools often refused to admit men,\u201d author Liana Christin Landivar wrote in the 2013 American Community Survey highlight report for men in nursing occupations.\n\nThe nursing school exclusion was deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case brought against a state-supported school in 1981.\n\n\u201cSchools are now actively pursuing higher male enrollment in their nursing programs,\u201d wrote Christin. \u201cThe relatively high wages and expanding job opportunities make this field attractive, offering stability even during recessions.\u201d\n\nRelated News: Is Your White-Collar Job Killing You? \u00bb\n\nDid Women\u2019s Rights Open the Nursing Sector to Men?\n\nIn an interview with Healthline, Peter McMenamin, a health economist for the American Nurses Association, explained that the women\u2019s rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s also, paradoxically, helped open the door to men entering nursing.\n\nWomen left nursing to snag jobs with greater earning potential that had been traditionally reserved for men, McMenamin said. Men, who for decades had been given the cold shoulder by the nursing industry, suddenly were welcomed with open arms.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take men long to move up the pay scale either. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month showed male registered nurses make about $5,100 more per year than female nurses. The research did not address whether it\u2019s possible men are being paid more because they are actively being recruited, especially as a minority group in this profession.\n\nI\u2019ve gone from taking lives to saving them, and for me that was something I needed. John Lanning, Illinois nurse\n\nJust like women who wanted to move beyond work into which they\u2019d been pigeon-holed, Fab Cabrera of Tampa, Florida, went into nursing to make good money doing something he loved.\n\nCabrera transitioned from a paramedic to a nurse because he could make a good living to help support his family but also be able to spend quality time with them.\n\nThe three-day, 36-hour work week at Brandon Hospital, along with the good salary, made nursing an attractive field, Cabrera said, even if being a male nurse in a female-dominated profession isn\u2019t always easy.\n\nRelated News: A New Generation of Dads Juggle Work and Childrearing \u00bb\n\nImmigrant Turns the Tables on Those Who Doubted Him\n\nCabrera is the quintessential American immigrant success story, but his success has not come without struggle. He moved to the United States at age 20 from El Salvador. He didn\u2019t know a word of English.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t speak the language, so I did labor; that\u2019s what we do, you know,\u201d he told Healthline. \u201cI very soon found that was something I did not want to do a lot of.\u201d\n\nDespite the language barrier, he went to school to become a paramedic.\n\n\u201cWhere I studied as a medic, in a little town in Florida called Davie, they had an active KKK chapter,\u201d Cabrera remembered.\n\nCabrera said the teacher would make him read out loud so the class could mock his accent. He says she told him he was \u201ctaking up space.\u201d\n\nImage Attribution Author: Courtesy\n\nFab Cabera, Florida Nurse\n\nOf 36 people in the class, 34 were men. After a decade as a medic, Cabrera transitioned to nursing using an online program through a community college. He had no idea the field would be so dominated by women.\n\n\u201cIn the medic culture, it is very macho \u2014 you don\u2019t even have a lot of gay guys out of the closet,\u201d he said. \u201cWatering holes in hospitals are nursing stations. I don\u2019t want to talk about diets. I don\u2019t want to talk about makeup. I don\u2019t want to talk about men.\u201d\n\nNeed for Both Genders at the Nurses Station\n\nThe state of Florida in 2008 launched a campaign called, \u201cAre you Man Enough to be a Nurse?\u201d Billboards popped up around the state showing masculine, attractive, male nurses representing a range of backgrounds.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has long had a program to help former military medics get into nursing.\n\nWatering holes in hospitals are nursing stations. I don\u2019t want to talk about diets. I don\u2019t want to talk about makeup. I don\u2019t want to talk about men. Fab Cabrera, Florida nurse\n\nThe recent JAMA article and 2013 American Community Survey noted that men in nursing tend to occupy the higher-tiered pay positions, such as nurse anesthetists. Cabrera said being a nurse anesthetist in a surgical setting is a more exacting job that can attract men.\n\n\u201cWe are very task oriented. I know how to go to work, do my job, and I must do it right because I have to provide for my wife and child,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen, I think, need more than a task. They need a cause. It\u2019s a calling. They left their kids at home. They become incredibly emotionally involved on the job.\u201d\n\nBruce Bailey is human resources employment manager for UnityPoint Health-Trinity, which serves the Quad-Cities metropolitan area of Iowa and Illinois. In a statement, he told Healthline that the healthcare system is actively recruiting nurses \u201cwith competitive salaries\u201d in several departments.\n\nThe hospital system recently expanded its Rock Island campus to include a state-of-the-art emergency department and heart center, and is actively recruiting for nurses as well.\n\nThe trend of males entering the nursing ranks has been steadily climbing for many years, and the stigma once associated to male nurses has long been forgotten, as they are a trusted resource right alongside the female nurse. Bruce Bailey, UnityPoint Health-Trinity\n\n\u201cThere has been a nursing shortage for quite some time, and we are feeling it more now in the Midwest,\u201d Bailey said.\n\nAs the Baby Boomer generation ages and more people gain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the need for nurses has continued to rise.\n\n\u201cThe trend of males entering the nursing ranks has been steadily climbing for many years, and the stigma once associated to male nurses has long been forgotten, as they are a trusted resource right alongside the female nurse,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThis is evidenced in that we also are seeing an uptick in males in nursing in leadership positions.\u201d\n\nRelated News: The Top 5 Fittest and Fattest Professions \u00bb\n\nFrom CNA to RN: Journey to Better Life\n\nTravis Grimm first obtained his certified nursing assistant (CNA) certificate and began working in memory care communities in the Midwest. He now works as a registered nurse at the same facility as Cabrera.\n\nLike many Americans, he was driven to get his nursing degree by the desire to make a better living. He has known he wants to care for others for a long time.\n\nAnd he said most women don\u2019t mind a man caring for them. He said he will occasionally have a woman patient ask for a female CNA to help with going to the restroom.\n\n\u201cBut even that has been rare. All of their doctors are males. The paramedic who picked them up was a male,\u201d said Grimm. \u201cI don\u2019t think they see it as a female-dominated profession. I think they just want quality care over gender.\u201d\n\nAll of their doctors are males. The paramedic who picked them up was a male. I don\u2019t think [women patients] see [nursing] as a female-dominated profession. I think they just want quality care over gender. Travis Grimm, Florida nurse\n\nGrimm said he expects more men will go into nursing for the good pay, the competitive benefits, and a schedule that allows a person to have a job and a personal life. Statistics show that enrollment by men in nursing schools is up.\n\nGrimm\u2019s advice for men considering nursing?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about critical decision making. It\u2019s fast paced, and your clinical judgement is key to what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re working independently as an RN,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou meet people at such an honest point in their lives,\u201d Cabrera added. \u201cYou get to know families, and see that they appreciate that you are involved.\u201d\n\nAnd for men worried about how they may be perceived entering a field dominated by women?\n\n\u201cThose people would never cut it,\u201d Grimm said. \u201cYou better have a gentle side.\u201d\n\nRelated News: Nurses Overworked and Understaff on Front Lines \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "male nurses, nurses, men, registered nurses, john lanning, fab cabrera, travis grimm", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Is the trend of men going into nursing \u2014 and getting paid at a higher rate \u2014 an unlikely result of the women\u2019s rights movement?", "title": "Male Nurses Are on the Rise \u2013 Filling a Need and Making a Living", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/male-nurses-are-on-the-rise-filling-a-need-and-making-a-living-042215", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/042215_malenurse_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/042215_malenurse_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Is the trend of men going into nursing \u2014 and getting paid at a higher rate \u2014 an unlikely result of the women\u2019s rights movement?", "card": "summary", "title": "Male Nurses Are on the Rise \u2013 Filling a Need and Making a Living"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-22", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Is the trend of men going into nursing \u2014 and getting paid at a higher rate \u2014 an unlikely result of the women\u2019s rights movement?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc505\"", "article_summary": "An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month showed male registered nurses make about $5,100 more per year than female nurses.\nThe American Assembly for Men in Nursing hopes to pump that statistic up to 20 percent by 2020.\nAs the Baby Boomer generation ages and more people gain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the need for nurses has continued to rise.\n\u201cSchools are now actively pursuing higher male enrollment in their nursing programs,\u201d wrote Christin.\nIn a statement, he told Healthline that the healthcare system is actively recruiting nurses \u201cwith competitive salaries\u201d in several departments."}
