We already know the drill: We certainly know we need to eat lean proteins, heart-healthy \u201cgood\u201d fats, rich whole grains, fresh vegetables and fruit as well as drink lots and lots of water.\n\nRelated: They May Have Solved the Mystery of Weight Gain\n\nOn the flip side, there are specific foods we should stay away from in order to achieve maximum good health.\n\nLast year cheese fries, hot dogs and microwave popcorn made our list of foods to avoid at all costs. This year, The Fiscal Times asked a few experts for their input on foods to fear - and helped us compose our new list for 2015:\n\nCookies, Candy Bars and Other Foods Made with Refined Sugar\n\n\u201cThe health bogeyman of the year is sugar \u2013 and for good reason,\u201d said Nina Teicholz, author of the noteworthy 2014 book, The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet.\n\nSugar is found in the obvious snack foods: cookies, donuts, candy bars and more \u2013 and sugar-drenched foods are no-brainers to avoid. But sugar is also added to many other foods, including salad dressings, canned soup and peanut butter \u2013 where we forget it\u2019s hiding. So we need to read labels and understand ingredients.\n\nRelated: The Big Fat Lie We\u2019ve Been Fed About Our Diet\n\n\u201cFor decades we were told that sugar was just \u2018empty calories,\u2019 and the American Heart Association even used to recommend that people choose sugary candies like gumdrops as snacks, in order to avoid fatty foods,\u201d said Teicholz, who spent more than eight years researching food and diet issues. \u201cIt turns out that sugar, far from benign, is a potent cause of obesity and diabetes if not also heart disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cSugar is roughly a 50-50 mix of glucose and fructose. Glucose has been far better studied to date, and its damage results mainly from spurring the body to produce insulin, which is the king of all hormones in storing fat. Glucose is therefore efficiently converted into body fat. Insulin circulating chronically in the blood eventually exhausts the body\u2019s ability to process it, which leads to type 2 diabetes.\u201d\n\nAs for fructose in sugar, it spikes blood markers such as triglycerides \u2013 which raises one\u2019s cardiovascular risks. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize that the 50-50 mix of glucose and fructose is also found in high-fructose corn syrup, the other major sweetener used in everything from ketchup to soda. Overall, it\u2019s best to avoid both these refined sugars if you aim to lose weight and stay healthy in 2015.\u201d\n\nChocolate-Covered Bacon\n\nThis recently trendy treat is not just laden with sugar \u2013 it\u2019s salt heavy as well. Some have called this fixture of state fairs the perfect mix of sweet and savory. But chocolate-covered bacon, no matter how delicious, has few fans among nutrition and health experts.\n\nRelated: Bacon Nation \u2013 17 Wacky Ways Americans Pig Out\n\n\u201cThis may be one of those foods I personally would never eat,\u201d said Janet Epstein-Blum, a New Jersey-based nutritionist and certified health coach. \u201cAt just two slices, chocolate-covered bacon packs in over 400 calories and over 500 mg of sodium \u2013 not to mention 16 grams of artery-clogging saturated fat.\u201d\n\nAs a health coach, Epstein-Blum added that she generally doesn\u2019t like to tell people \u201cnever\u201d to eat something. \u201cWhen people are told that, they typically want that food even more.\u201d Instead, she counsels making smart choices: \u201cIf someone is offered a treat like chocolate-covered bacon, I ask the person to stop for a moment, challenge whether eating that slice of chocolate-covered salty fat will bring them closer to optimal health or further away \u2013 and then make their choice.\u201d\n\nCorn Dogs, French Fries and Other Foods Deep-Fried in Vegetable Oils\n\nMost health experts advise staying clear of fried foods heated at high temperatures in unsaturated vegetable oils \u2013 such as popular grease-laden foods like corn dogs, French fries, onion rings, and even Twinkies deep-fried in restaurant fryers.\n\n\u201cI would avoid these at all times,\u201d said Nina Teicholz. \u201cThe vegetable oils \u2013 like peanut, corn and soybean \u2013 oxidize easily when heated to high temperatures, especially over long periods of time. In those conditions, oils produce oxidation products, some highly toxic to human health. They lead to massive inflammation in the body and the most dangerous kind of oxidized cholesterol in the bloodstream.\u201d\n\nRelated: 35 Astounding Facts About McDonald\u2019s\n\nShe emphasized it\u2019s not the fried foods themselves that are unhealthy \u2013 it\u2019s the intensely heated unsaturated vegetable oils. The current push to rid our food of trans fats has meant a return to using the regular oils, with the same old worrisome oxidation products, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen the FDA decided to get rid of trans fats, it didn\u2019t consider what alternatives would need to be used. I wouldn\u2019t eat things fried in regular trans-free vegetable oils, because they are very likely to be the kind of oil that is unstable when heated and produces huge amounts of toxic oxidation products.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s resolution time again \u2013 and the vast majority of us are hoping to eat better, los", "title": "The Foods You Should Never Eat in 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/01/Foods-You-Should-Never-Eat-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Chocolate%20Chip%20cookies.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/01/Foods-You-Should-Never-Eat-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Chocolate%20Chip%20cookies.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It\u2019s resolution time again \u2013 and the vast majority of us are hoping to eat better, los", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sugar is found in the obvious snack foods: cookies, donuts, candy bars and more \u2013 and sugar-drenched foods are no-brainers to avoid.\nLast year cheese fries, hot dogs and microwave popcorn made our list of foods to avoid at all costs.\n\u201cThe vegetable oils \u2013 like peanut, corn and soybean \u2013 oxidize easily when heated to high temperatures, especially over long periods of time.\nBut sugar is also added to many other foods, including salad dressings, canned soup and peanut butter \u2013 where we forget it\u2019s hiding.\nRelated: Bacon Nation \u2013 17 Wacky Ways Americans Pig Out\u201cThis may be one of those foods I personally would never eat,\u201d said Janet Epstein-Blum, a New Jersey-based nutritionist and certified health coach."}
