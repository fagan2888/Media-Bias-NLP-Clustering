Guardian, as one of the industry\u2019s behemoths, coversmore than 8 million employees and their families at over 115,000 companies, according to a company statement.\n\nThe deal is pending regulatory approval, and terms were not revealed.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s two key components \u2014 accessibility for all and profit limitations for insurance carriers \u2014 may be prompting insurers to re-evaluate their business models, Hill said.\n\n\u201cDental insurance is a relatively low-margin product in terms of profitability, so it is no surprise that Guardian is looking to expand their service territory and utilize the increased need for their product in order to balance how the ACA regulates their profits,\u201d Hill said.\n\nGuardian also will gain a presence on six individual state exchanges, which complements its existing offering on 48 of the Small Business Health Options Programs, or SHOP, exchanges, Guardian said in a written statement.\n\nGuardian Executive Vice President Dong Ahn said that the Affordable Care Act played a role in the acquisition of Premier Access.\n\n\u201cACA is changing the dental benefits landscape. It is the responsibility of insurers such as Guardian to deliver cost-effective, quality dental care to more Americans where and how they are looking to be served,\u201d Ahn said in a written statement. \u201cGuardian\u2019s acquisition of Premier Access demonstrates our commitment to maintaining our position as a leading dental company while expanding our reach to serve more customers who are seeking access to dental insurance through Medicaid and the exchanges.\u201d\n\nPremier Access is something of a success story. Sacramento dentist Reza Abbaszadeh started a dental health maintenance organization called Access Dental Plan. According to the Sacramento Business Journal, Abbaszadeh launched Premier Access to local employers in 1998 as a less-restrictive PPO plan. Annual revenue in 2012 was $175 million, the most recent data available, according to the Business Journal.\n\nPremier Access has about 620 employees nationwide and an estimated 110 at its Sacramento, California, headquarters, while Guardian counts 5,000 employees in the United States and a network of more than 3,000 financial representatives in more than 80 agencies nationwide, according to a Guardian statement.\n\nHill said it\u2019s possible that Premier Access is the first domino to fall, as more acquisitions could follow.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has created higher demand for benefits and it is very possible that other benefit carriers will take similar action to Guardian in order to combat the profit regulations of the ACA and reach more people,\u201d Hill said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An old-guard major player among dental benefits providers sunk its teeth into a relatively young competitor.
