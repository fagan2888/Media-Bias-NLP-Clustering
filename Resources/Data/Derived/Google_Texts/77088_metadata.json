They will also be able to select a variety of tiers of plans\u2014bronze, silver, gold, and platinum\u2014with the basic idea being that bronze plan coverage is stingy while platinum plan coverage is extremely comprehensive. The more comprehensive plans are, naturally, the more expensive.\n\nBen Handel, Igal Hendel, and Michael D. Whinston have an interesting newish paper out (PDF) arguing that in practice everyone's going to get stuck with the bronze plan. The details of their argument are complicated, but the basic logic is simple.\n\nThe ACA itself is designed to solve the problem of adverse selection. If only sick people buy insurance plans, then insurance plans have to be expensive, so there's even more reason that only sick people will buy them, so they get even more expensive. Hence the individual mandate. What Handel, Handel, and Whinston are saying is that the exact same adverse-selection spiral is going to repeat itself inside the exchanges. Instead of unraveling all the way down to a state of noninsurance, it will unravel all the way down to the regulatory minimum of the bronze plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Will Everyone End up in Obamacare Bronze Plans?", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, individuals shopping in health care exchanges will be able to select plans from a variety of insurance companies.
