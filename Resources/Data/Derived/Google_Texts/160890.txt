New York (MainStreet) - America has reached a tipping point when it comes to medical debt. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Board, these bills now account for more than half of all collections reported on consumer credit scores. Yet it’s an even bigger problem than most Americans realize, because getting health insurance doesn’t always solve the problem.

In fact, it usually doesn’t. Some 70% percent of people who struggle to pay their medical bills are insured.

A new Kaiser Family Foundation study takes a look at this problem. The reality of medical debt is that it often strikes out of the blue. People who end up dodging calls from a hospital’s debt collectors are frequently those with no other history of credit problems, according to study author Karen Pollitz. They often enjoyed financial security until illness or accident occurred, leaving them not only deeply in debt but less likely to seek future care for fear of running up even more impossible medical bills.

“For many people medical expenses are unexpected,” Pollitz said. “That’s why we have medical insurance, for ‘I didn’t know I was going to fall off my bike today and break my neck.’”

The problem generally comes from cost sharing arrangements. Virtually all health insurance plans include some form of this, often by design as a way to limit over-consumption of medical care. As the the theory goes, if the consumers have some financial stake in seeking out care then they won’t do so frivolously. This works in cases of elective or overly-cautious procedures, yet many patients don’t have a choice about seeking treatment. Someone with severe injuries or a serious illness needs specific, often intense, treatment regimes regardless of the cost.
