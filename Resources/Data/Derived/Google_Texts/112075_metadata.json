Arizona Public Radio\u2019s Ryan Heinsius reports.\n\nBabeu says illegal immigration and 2nd Amendment rights will be two of his main issues in the CD1 campaign. In the past, Gowan has run on his support of Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 immigration law and his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlso seeking the Republican nomination are former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, rancher and businessman Gary Kiehne, and Navajo businessman Shawn Redd.\n\nFormer state legislator and Sedona resident Tom O\u2019Halleran is the only Democrat currently in the race.\n\nThe mostly rural CD1 is among the largest districts geographically in the U.S. It includes Flagstaff, the White Mountains and multiple Native American tribes, and stretches to the outskirts of Tucson.
