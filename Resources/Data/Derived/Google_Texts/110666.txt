U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz discussed local business concerns at a roundtable discussion Friday hosted by the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Council.

“In my discussions with business leaders in Amarillo, the message is the same here as it is throughout the state of Texas,” Cruz said. “They want economic growth.”

Cruz touched on issues including tax reform and immigration, but he also expressed concerns about a proposed U.S. military strike on Syria, for which President Barack Obama plans to seek congressional approval.

Cruz said he was “deeply, deeply skeptical” about involving the U.S. in Syria. “I believe doing so has a very real risk of benefiting the rebels … and I think empowering them would only undermine U.S. national security interests,” he said.

“Beyond that, I think the so-called limited strikes have a potential to escalate dramatically and draw the United States into protracted military engagement in Syria,” Cruz said.

“In my view, it is not the job of our military to send statements or defend international norms,” he added. “That’s not what the young men and women in the military signed up to do.”

Amarillo Mayor Paul Harpole, a Vietnam veteran, echoed Cruz’s concerns.

“I’m not convinced there are valid reasons, and I don’t like the timing and idea of using people’s lives to pursue a conflict that doesn’t fit the just war theory,” Harpole said.

Cruz also expressed interest in defunding the Affordable Care Act, which he thinks will negatively affect businesses and their hiring practices.

State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, called the health care act “antibusiness,” and said the federal government could fund states’ efforts to develop exchanges and fund Medicaid as an alternative for dealing with rising costs.
