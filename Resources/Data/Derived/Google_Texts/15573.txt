Custer, SD

The skies of the southern Black Hills might be a bit smoky on Monday.



Crews with Custer State Park, the U.S. Forest Service and Wind Cave National Park plan to do a controlled burn in and around the southwest corner of the park.



Highway 87 from Blue Bell Gate in Custer State Park to Rankin Ridge in Wind Cave National Park will be closed from Monday morning through Wednesday evening.
