Glitches and expensive premiums mean little to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who called the Affordable Care Act “a dream come true” for millions of Americans.

Pelosi hailed Obamacare’s rollout during a weekly press conference Thursday morning, celebrating the day three of the healthcare law’s exchanges, which launched Oct. 1. The House Majority Leader, who has been an ardent supporter of the Affordable Care Act, sang Obamacare’s praises, saying it gave Americans’ the opportunity to the inalienable rights outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

“Now we are in the third day of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, a dream come true for many people in our country that they can fully realize the promise of our Founders of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness: a healthier life and the liberty to pursue their happiness,” Pelosi said.

But the former Speaker of the House failed to realize the glitches and errors that come with the healthcare law, although Pelosi has confessed she never actually read the legislation.

According to multiple reports, few people have actually been able to register for Obamacare’s exchanges, instead receiving messages of system errors as they attempt to make their way through the marketplaces. And as The Washington Post searched for Americans who did actually register, they were only able to identify a lone ranger, 21-year-old Chad Henderson.

And according to a new study from the American Action Forum, premiums for young people are set to increase 260 percent in 2014.

Looks like Pelosi’s we-have-to-pass-it-to-see-what’s-in-it approach is far from a dream come true.
