Large majorities of Republicans favor key energy issues\u2014but voters of every ideological stripe say energy issues will be an important part of their voting decisions.\n\nHickman Analytics Inc., for the Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA), has done polling on energy issues in several key states: Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. While the exact questions asked are not identical in each of the six states, the responses are so similar that assumptions can be made.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFor the 2016 presidential candidates, lessons should be learned\u2014to win, candidates must be strong on energy.\n\nIn all states polled, the majority of respondents indicated that energy issues will be at or near the top when asked: \u201cLooking ahead, how important are energy issues in terms of how you will vote in the Presidential election next year?\u201d In each state, except West Virginia, 80 percent or more answered: \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201csomewhat important.\u201d In West Virginia, though still a majority, the percentage is only 54\u2014though a smaller percentage of West Virginians, 10 percent, claim energy issues will be \u201cnot very important\u201d or \u201cnot important at all.\u201d\n\nThe polling took place in Iowa and New Hampshire in April, South Carolina in May, and in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina in June.\n\nIn Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Hickman asked how respondents felt about \u201callowing offshore oil and natural gas drilling north of Alaska, in U.S. waters inside the Arctic Circle.\u201d Overall, a majority of registered voters supported it, though opposition is higher among Democrats.\n\nThe numbers on Arctic drilling break out this way:\n\nIowa New Hampshire South Carolina Republicans 74% support, 10% oppose 70% support, 18% oppose 76% support, 16% oppose Independents 48% support, 38% oppose 54% support, 35% oppose 60% support, 32% oppose Democrats 34% support, 49% oppose 34% support, 54% oppose 51% support, 29% oppose\n\nIn Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, Hickman asked about the Atlantic Coast pipeline project\u2014a 550-mile pipeline that will bring natural gas from West Virginia through Virginia and North Carolina\u2014and found that support is strong and extends across almost every group. As with Arctic drilling, Hickman found that support for this important energy infrastructure project is stronger among Republicans, but even among those who self-identify as liberal, more support than oppose it.\n\nThe numbers on the Atlantic Coast pipeline project break out this way:\n\nVirginia West Virginia North Carolina Republicans 74% support, 12% oppose 79% support, 12% oppose 76% support, 9% oppose Independents 54% support, 24% oppose 66% support, 25% oppose 56% support, 25% oppose Democrats 43% support, 38% oppose 67% support, 20% oppose 41% support, 37% oppose\n\nWhen asked why they support the Atlantic Coast pipeline project, \u201cjobs\u201d was mentioned most frequently with \u201ca positive impact on the economy\u201d being next. \u201cContribution to energy independence\u201d was also mentioned.\n\nThe lesson? Republican and Independent voters understand that energy projects create jobs, help the economy, and energy security.\n\nIn Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, Hickman asked about other energy issues, such as coal-fueled power plants, the Keystone pipeline, offshore drilling, and hydraulic fracturing. Again, support among Republicans and Independents\u2014even many Democrats\u2014is strong on a wide range of energy issues.\n\n\u201cAs the primary season approaches, presidential candidates will need to take a strong stance on energy issues for the 2016 election,\u201d CEA President David Holt said. \u201cAs we have seen in the past, the success of candidates in 2016 will hinge on their ability to promote issues that foster economic and job growth, while ensuring safety and the protection of our environment. This can be achieved through the promotion of energy infrastructure and production, which will contribute to U.S. self-sufficiency, stimulate the economy, and create jobs.\u201d\n\nEnergy provides Republican candidates with an opportunity to stand with voters and offer contrast to Hillary Clinton\u2014whose previous speeches indicate that she will continue President Obama\u2019s energy policies. At her Roosevelt Rally, she repeated one of Obama\u2019s reoccurring themes: \u201cclimate change, one of the defining threats of our time.\u201d\n\nAs the Hickman/CEA polling shows, the frequently touted fixes for climate change\u2014opposing coal-fueled power plants and blocking fossil-fuel development and infrastructure\u2014directly conflict with what most Americans, especially Republicans and Independents, want.\n\nAs we head into the important 2016 election, it is imperative that whoever becomes the 45th president understands energy. Gratefully, as the Hickman/CEA polling indicates, the American public understands its importance.\n\nThe author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc. and the companion educational organization, the Citizens\u2019 Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).
