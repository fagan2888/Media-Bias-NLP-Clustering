The three entrepreneurs spent years working out of home offices before going in together on a renovated space on Spruill Avenue in North Charleston.\n\nThe idea of working from home had long since lost its charm when Allison and Daniel Nadeau, married co-owners of the North Charleston paper goods company Ink Meets Paper, moved their business into a former convenience store on Spruill Avenue in June.\n\nInk Meets Paper, which sells handmade greeting cards, stationery and other paper products in more than 300 stores worldwide, had swallowed up half of the Nadeaus\u2019 Park Circle home in the course of five years. Between the printing supplies, antique letterpress and shipping materials, the Nadeaus had shifted many of their personal belongings into the attic. When guests spent the night, they slept on an air mattress in the office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to focus on the business when there\u2019s dishes to be done and laundry to be put away and a yard to mow,\u201d said Daniel Nadeau, pausing for a midmorning coffee break at his bright, streamlined new office. \u201cWhen you try to bring customers over, everything in the house needs to look as nice as possible, and when you\u2019re running a business out of your house, that\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d\n\nInk Meets Paper shares its headquarters with another local business, handmade toy company Finkelstein\u2019s Center. Like the Nadeaus, Finkelstein\u2019s owner Michelle Jewell found that her business had outgrown her James Island home.\n\n\u201cWe were both pining for a space not in our house,\u201d Jewell said.\n\nThe space, which they\u2019ve dubbed Fink + Ink, is a workshop, not a storefront \u2014 although Park Circle commuters could be fooled by the inviting picture windows and cozy sitting area lined with products. The interior features an open floor plan, exposed plywood, pegboards and massive work tables in a common area for the two companies. With giant plush characters propped up in chairs, the office reflects both the whimsy of Finkelstein\u2019s hand-stitched dolls and the hip minimalism of Ink Meets Paper greeting cards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good, flexible space, whether we\u2019re working on a huge order or we\u2019re just doing custom work,\u201d Nadeau said.\n\nOne advantage of the new location: No more meeting truck drivers in parking lots across town. Previously, when Ink Meets Paper ordered large shipments of supplies, truck drivers were often skittish about delivering among the winding streets and low-hanging trees of Park Circle.\n\n\u201cThey do not like residential neighborhoods,\u201d Allison Nadeau said.\n\nFor now, the company headquarters sits among vacant storefronts, gas stations and a check-cashing center. The view from the wide front windows is of a dilapidated and vacant auto garage.\n\nBut in the slow recovery from an economic recession, with home prices already on the rise in neighboring Park Circle, Jewell said she\u2019s confident that change is coming soon to her stretch of Spruill.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going up for sale or lease, which wasn\u2019t the case even three years ago when all of these were occupied,\u201d Jewell said.\n\nBack at home, Daniel Nadeau said he and Allison are still figuring out what to do with their suddenly vacant rooms, shifting their furniture and their personal lives back into the entire house.\n\n\u201cBeing able to come home at the end of the day and it actually be home \u2014 a peaceful place where you\u2019re not sitting amongst your work \u2014 is pretty wonderful,\u201d he said.\n\nReach Paul Bowers at 843- 937-5546.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Moving out of the house brings peace of mind for small business owners, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Finkelstein's Center,Ink Meets Paper,North Charleston,Park Circle,Small businesses,Spruill Avenue,Working from home", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The idea of working from home had long since lost its charm when Allison and Daniel Nadeau, married co-owners of the North Charleston paper goods company Ink Meets Paper, moved their business into a former convenience store on Spruill Avenue in June.", "title": "Moving out of the house brings peace of mind for small business owners", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151129/151129408/moving-out-of-the-house-brings-peace-of-mind-for-small-business-owners", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151129/PC05/151129408/AR/0/AR-151129408.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151129/PC05/151129408/AR/0/AR-151129408.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The idea of working from home had long since lost its charm when Allison and Daniel Nadeau, married co-owners of the North Charleston paper goods company Ink Meets Paper, moved their business into a former convenience store on Spruill Avenue in June.", "title": "Moving out of the house brings peace of mind for small business owners", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151129/PC05/151129408/AR/0/AR-151129408.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151129408}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Moving out of the house brings peace of mind for small business owners , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Finkelstein's Center,Ink Meets Paper,North Charleston,Park Circle,Small businesses,Spruill Avenue,Working from home", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T19:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T15:28:00Z", "author": "Paul Bowers"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The idea of working from home had long since lost its charm when Allison and Daniel Nadeau, married co-owners of the North Charleston paper goods company Ink Meets Paper, moved their business into a former convenience store on Spruill Avenue in June."}, "article_summary": "Ink Meets Paper co-owners Allison and Daniel Nadeau (at left) talk business with Michelle Jewell, owner of the Finkelstein\u2019s Center toy company.\nBack at home, Daniel Nadeau said he and Allison are still figuring out what to do with their suddenly vacant rooms, shifting their furniture and their personal lives back into the entire house.\nPreviously, when Ink Meets Paper ordered large shipments of supplies, truck drivers were often skittish about delivering among the winding streets and low-hanging trees of Park Circle.\nWith giant plush characters propped up in chairs, the office reflects both the whimsy of Finkelstein\u2019s hand-stitched dolls and the hip minimalism of Ink Meets Paper greeting cards.\nLike the Nadeaus, Finkelstein\u2019s owner Michelle Jewell found that her business had outgrown her James Island home."}
