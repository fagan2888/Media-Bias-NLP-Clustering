Far too many voters assume the United States simply hands over a big chunk of our federal budget to benefit other countries, and politicians exploit that ignorance to further their own ambitions.\n\nWhen elected officials push back against this knee-jerk position, it\u2019s heartening. When a far-right congressman does it, it\u2019s extraordinary. Over at ThinkProgress yesterday, Scott Keyes highlighted some unexpected comments from Rep. Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who replaced Michele Bachmann in Congress.\n\nAcknowledging his own past opposition to foreign aid \u2013 for example, he floated the idea of pulling U.S. foreign aid in a 2012 Facebook post \u2013 Emmer told viewers that his mind had changed on the matter after a recent trip to visit beneficiaries of foreign aid in Ethiopia and Kenya. \u201cI have made the statement in the past that a dollar that we are spending for instance in Africa, in Kenya, is a dollar that we could probably be using at home to build a road or a bridge,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cWell it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d Instead, Emmer now argues, foreign aid can be a win-win. It helps pave the way for development in other countries, boosting their economies and in turn creating demand for American exports in the future. He recounted how an encounter with a dairy co-op in Kenya that has been boosted by funding from the United States Agency for International Development helped show him the light. \u201cA dollar spent on [foreign aid] is a dollar that we won\u2019t have to spend on additional bombs and bullets and God forbid boots on the ground in the future,\u201d Emmer noted.\n\nThe GOP congressman added that federal funding for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is \u201cfrankly is less than one percent of our overall budget.\u201d\n\nGenuinely pleasant surprises from this Congress are rare. Emmer\u2019s comments qualify.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Minnesota Republican, no one has ever called Tom Emmer a \u201cmoderate.\u201d Right Wing Watch has reported on his previous efforts, for example, including his work as the former state chairman of Ralph Reed\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition.\n\n\n\nI ndeed, as Scott Keyes\u2019 report added, Emmer is also a climate denier, an opponent of the minimum wage, and a former state lawmaker who proposed nullifying the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota. There\u2019s a reason Michele Bachmann\u2019s former constituents elected the guy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "One of Congress' most right-wing members used to condemn the very idea of foreign aid.
