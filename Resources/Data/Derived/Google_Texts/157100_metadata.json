Lesil McGuire, R-Anchorage, and Rep. Bob Herron, D-Bethel, introduced companion legislation to create incentives for developers in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cThe Alaskan Arctic is in desperate need of infrastructure development both for those who live there now, and for new opportunities that will come with the opening of the Arctic,\u201d McGuire said in a statement. \u201cGlobally, all eyes are on the Arctic because of the changing conditions which will bring new opportunities in shipping, tourism and resource development. In order for Alaskans to capitalize on this emerging situation, we need to think ahead and begin infrastructure development now, since we have lagged behind in the past.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 140 would authorize the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority to give loan and bond guarantees for infrastructure development in the Arctic.\n\nHerron introduced House Joint Resolution 24 and House Bill 288.\n\n\u201cThis resolution makes it clear that Alaska is ready for what the future holds in the Arctic, and that Alaska wants to be considered an important partner during our country\u2019s time as Chair of the Arctic Council,\u201d Herron said in a statement. \u201cWe want to be invited to the dance.\u201d\n\nAlaska\u2019s congressional delegation teams up with Hawaii to keep flying costs down\n\nAlaska and Hawaii\u2019s congressional delegations introduced legislation Monday that would exempt residents of America\u2019s two non-continental states from increased air travel fees included in December\u2019s budget deal.\n\n\u201cFlying is an essential part of everyday life for so many Alaskans. With so many communities off the road system, Alaskans rely on flights for critical services like medical care,\u201d Sen. Mark Begich said in a statement. \u201cStudent athletes fly to neighboring communities for sport and academic events. The additional fees are an unfair burden for these Alaskans who rely on these flights on a regular basis. My colleagues in Hawaii understand this unique situation and I am grateful for their work to exempt our states from these increased travel fees.\u201d\n\nRep. Keller introduces bill to amend U.S. Constitution\n\nRep. Wes Keller, R-Wasilla, introduced House Bill 284 Wednesday. The bill proposes \u201can interstate compact to amend the Constitution of the United States with a Balanced Budget Amendment via the Constitution\u2019s Article V process,\u201d according to a press release from the House Majority.\n\n\u201cAmerica is on an unsustainable fiscal path,\u201d Keller said in a statement. \u201cThe national debt recently surpassed $17 trillion and our debt-to-GDP ratio is well past levels considered to be healthy for long-term economic growth and stability.\u201d\n\nBoth parties ready to repeal exit exam\n\nThe State Board of Education and Early Development announced Wednesday that it supports the repeal of the High School Graduation Qualifying Examination, also known as the exit exam.\n\n\u201cThe resolution said the high school graduation qualifying exam, as a test of basic skills, is not an appropriate way to measure students\u2019 readiness for entry into careers and postsecondary education,\u201d the board wrote in a statement.\n\nThere are currently four bills in the legislature that aim to repeal the exit exam. Repealing the exam has support from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nGov. introduces legislation to extend contract with Tesoro, extend benefits to veterans\n\nGov. Sean Parnell introduced legislation Wednesday to extend the state\u2019s contract with Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company, LLC, for the continued sale of royalty oil. Tesoro owns and operates the Kenai refinery.\n\n\u201cAcross the state, Alaskans and many of our industries are impacted daily by the production of gasoline and other fuels from the Kenai refinery,\u201d Parnell said in a statement. \u201cThis extension will help make sure employment in the Kenai Peninsula region stays strong, while also ensuring a robust economy for all Alaskans.\u201d\n\nThe bill would extend Tesoro\u2019s contract by one year from Jan. 31, 2015 to Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nParnell also introduced legislation Wednesday to update housing and employment preference eligibility statutes to include 1991 Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans. \u201cThe bill also contains provisions to include veterans of future conflicts, should they arise,\u201d said a statement from the governor\u2019s press office.\n\n\u201cWith more veterans per capita than any other state, our legislation ensures that Alaska veterans, as well as their families, have the resources they need,\u201d Parnell said in a statement.\n\nRep. Pruitt compares Medicaid expansion to a child\u2019s toy, Dems push back\n\nRep. Lance Pruitt, R-Anchorage, got Alaska Democrats in a tizzy Thursday after he compared Medicaid expansion to a toy during a House Majority press conference. Pruitt asked a reporter how he would feel if they took the microphone from him midway through a question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a child, when you give them something, you give them a toy, you\u2019re not going to yank it out of their hands, and that\u2019s essentially what this is,\u201d Pruitt said.\n\nThat morning Senate and House Democrats introduced legislation to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cLance Pruitt should apologize and stop demeaning the 41,500 Alaskans who could obtain health care with Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Mike Wenstrup, Chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, in a statement. \u201cIf Pruitt thinks health care is no more necessary than a toy, then he is completely out of touch with the economic realities facing Alaskans who are seeking affordable health coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, State, JENNIFER CANFIELD, Bob Herron, Lance Pruitt, Lesil McGuire, Mark Begich, Sean Parnell, Wes Keller, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "Sen.
