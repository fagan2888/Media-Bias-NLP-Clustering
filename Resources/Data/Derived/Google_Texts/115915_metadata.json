We had a 50 year lease on the building, and received a 30 day notice to vacate. Even if we wanted to leave, we couldn\u2019t do it in that amount of time. With the Hope and Health Clinic just closing in Century, and no other doctor in town, CHCA and Mayo Street Medical can\u2019t depart without leaving hundreds of people without vital medical care. This is wrong.\u201d Located just across the street, the non-profit Health and Hope Clinic shut down on October 1 due to a lack of funding.\n\nWhile Bachman is the only doctor that practices in town on a regular basis, Baptist Medical Group, formally Century Medical Center, operates a primary care facility in Century that is staffed by nurse practitioner Georgia W. Agrait, GNP.\n\nIn the letter to Bachman, Cheryl C. McCall, chief of the Bureau of Public Land Administration Division of State Lands for DEP, wrote that the eviction was due to a violation of lease terms due to violations of Florida Life Safety Code and National Fire Protection Code.\n\nIn addition, DEP\u2019s letter said CHCA had violated other terms of the lease, including:\n\nPurpose \u2014 the leased premises shall only be used for the establishment and operation of a health care facility\n\nUnauthorized Use \u2014 the lessee shall prevent the unauthorized use the leased premises or any use in violation of the lease\n\nRight of Inspection \u2014 the state or representatives have the right to inspect the leased premises\n\nInsurance Requirements \u2013 the lessee must maintain fire, extended risk and liability insurance naming the State of Florida as co-insured.\n\nMaintenance of Improvements \u2014 the lessee must maintain the property and an improvements in good condition.\n\nCentury Health Care Access acquired the lease for the Old Century Hospital in 2006 when a concerned group of citizens from Century formed a not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing medical care to the community of Century and surrounding areas. They now host Mayo Street Medical, a family medical clinic which opened in late 2014 with Dr. Bachman at the helm, and previously hosted Century Family Practice, which closed in late 2013.\n\nBachman said the practice now provides primary medical services for hundreds of patients throughout Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. He has a reputation for seeing patients regardless of their ability to pay, and he\u2019s even known for making house calls.\n\n\u201cWe have had a very difficult time,\u201d said CHCA Office manager, Mary Gilson. \u201cIt is hard to run a medical clinic in an area where many people have Medicaid or are uninsured. We are struggling anyway, and if we lose the building we lose our ability to stay open. We can\u2019t afford to move locations even if we had another location to move to \u2013 and we don\u2019t. The people of Century desperately need us because many simply can\u2019t afford to go elsewhere. I understand that the government has rules, regulations, and procedures, but evicting us now is madness.\u201d\n\nThe letter from DEP gave CHCA until noon on September 30 to vacate the building. Now that the deadline has passed, there\u2019s no concrete answer from DEP as to what their next step may be.\n\n\u201cThe department is determining its next step,\u201d Lori Elliot, press secretary for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection told NorthEscambia.com in an email on Friday.\n\n\u201cThey will have to send in the sheriff to drag us out of here. We have a commitment to our community and to our patients,\u201d Allison Mills, Bachman\u2019s director of nursing said.\n\nPictured top: The former Century Hospital, constructed in 1965, on Mayo Street in Century.
