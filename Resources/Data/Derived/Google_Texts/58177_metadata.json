Concerning the rural areas, that\u2019s up to the discretion of local sheriffs. The bill has awaited signature from Republican Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter, which was signed on March 25; the law goes into effect later this summer (via NRA-ILA):\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Idaho will become the eighth state to recognize a law-abiding adult\u2019s ability to possess a concealed handgun for self-defense without government-mandated permitting and fees. SB 1389 will positively affect law-abiding gun owners in the following ways: SB 1389 ensures that the existing and long-standing concealed weapon license (CWL) exemption applicable \u201coutside the limits or confines of any city\u201d only protects the rights of law-abiding individuals. SB 1389 exempts law-abiding Idahoans, who are twenty-one years of age or older, from having to obtain a CWL in order to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense within city limits. SB 1389 provides a mechanism for well-trained, law-abiding individuals who are eighteen years of age or older to obtain a CWL.\n\nSo, on July 1, Idaho joins the small, but growing club of Constitutional carry states. Good on them.\n\nEditor's Note: The original post said that Idaho would become the eighth Constitutional carry state; it's actually the ninth following West Virginia. Post has been updated to reflect the changes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Good news..05/26/2016 11:34:52AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Good news.", "title": "Welcome To The Club: Idaho Is Now A Constitutional Carry State", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/28/welcome-to-the-club-idaho-is-now-a-constitutional-carry-state-n2140165", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/20/562b025e-1164-483e-a130-089669eca29c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Good news.", "title": "Welcome To The Club: Idaho Is Now A Constitutional Carry State", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/28/welcome-to-the-club-idaho-is-now-a-constitutional-carry-state-n2140165", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/20/562b025e-1164-483e-a130-089669eca29c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Welcome To The Club: Idaho Is Now A Constitutional Carry State , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd50b9\"", "article_summary": "Editor's Note: The original post said that Idaho would become the eighth Constitutional carry state; it's actually the ninth following West Virginia.\nSo, on July 1, Idaho joins the small, but growing club of Constitutional carry states.\nAs we reported earlier this month, the Gem State was on the verge of becoming the ninth Constitutional carry state in the country, which wouldn\u2019t require law-abiding gun owners to have a permit while carrying their firearms in public within city limits.\nSB 1389 provides a mechanism for well-trained, law-abiding individuals who are eighteen years of age or older to obtain a CWL.\nSB 1389 exempts law-abiding Idahoans, who are twenty-one years of age or older, from having to obtain a CWL in order to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense within city limits."}
