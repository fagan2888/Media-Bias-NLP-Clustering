Currently, 41 states including the District of Columbia have some type of regulation in place, such as requiring parental consent.\n\nSeveral states have completely banned indoor tanning for minors, as has Brazil. In July, Hawaii became the 10th state to do so, joining Vermont, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oregon, Nevada, Texas and Washington.\n\n\"Earlier exposure to indoor tanning is associated with a greater risk for developing basal cell carcinoma at a young age,\" said Margaret Karagas, director of the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at Dartmouth University in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\n\"The new FDA regulations reinforce the science that teens and young adults may be especially vulnerable to developing skin cancer if they use tanning beds,\" said Karagas. She was not involved in the review but recently published a study showing that a high proportion of patients with early-onset basal cell carcinoma had used indoor tanning.\n\nHowever, Lim\u2019s team also points to studies that found people who were exposed to tanning beds before the age of 35 years had a significantly higher risk of developing melanoma.\n\nIn their report, the researchers review the science of how skin\u2019s exposure to ultraviolet light from tanning beds, or the sun, causes the DNA damage that can lead to cancer. \u201cTanning is a clinical manifestation of cellular stress,\u201d they emphasize.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the common misconception that tanned skin offers protection from future UV radiation is proved false as there is no biochemical mechanism restricting further mutagenesis upon subsequent exposure,\u201d they write.\n\nThe study team covers evidence that use of tanning beds can be addictive in the same way as a drug. And they point out that the devices primarily emit UV-A light, which is less effective at inducing skin to make vitamin D than UV-B, so there\u2019s no argument for a health benefit there.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain how much of an effect these new regulations will have on tanning bed users, Lim\u2019s team says.\n\nNearly 30 million Americans use tanning beds each year, and more than 2 million of them are teenagers, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nAnd about 70 percent of users are girls and young women between the ages of 16 and 29 years old.\n\nThese data are the most troubling, they write, since young women are known to be the most at-risk population for developing melanoma associated with the use of tanning beds.\n\n\"Pediatricians should counsel parents and patients about the risks of using tanning beds,\" Karagas said.\n\nLim\u2019s team hopes their review will be used by doctors as a resource for doing just that.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1prBRCr\n\nJ Am Acad Derm 2014.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0JB23J20141127", "sailthru.author": "Roxanne Nelson", "Author": "Roxanne Nelson", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Early in 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration moved tanning lamps into a new category of \u201cmoderately harmful\u201d medical devices, and with good reason, researchers say.", "title": "FDA regs highlight harms of indoor tanning", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
