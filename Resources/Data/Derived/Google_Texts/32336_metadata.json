One of my favorites is the LG Rolling Bot, a spherical-shaped robot that can stay home and act as a surveillance robot, or \u201ccare\u201d for your pets, according to LG.\n\nThe robot work on a known principle of having two hemispheres that can rotate independently, thus making it possible to move forward and turn (like a tank, basically). The Rolling bot has a camera with which the user can see everything the robot sees. This, of course, controlled with the smartphone, over an Internet connection.\n\nThe robot should work with non-LG phones as well, but LG handset will benefit from an easier setup, thanks to an app called LG Friends Manager, which takes care of the network setup and other administrative tasks that may put off the novice customer.\n\nThe Rolling bot also has a laser pointer and should quickly become your cat\u2019s best friends with endless hours of play (you\u2019ll have to remote control that too, for now). If you have a dog that isn\u2019t attracted by laser pointer hunting, it\u2019s possible to talk with it (or with kids btw\u2026) via the robot, since it has a microphone and a speaker.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure if the robot is smart enough to avoid stairs, but I\u2019m tempted to believe that LG has thought of that use case. What we do know is that there is a docking station and that the Rolling bot is smart enough to go back to the base for a good charge. At this point, there\u2019s no mention of it patrolling the home, or recognizing people based on their faces, although both would be welcome features at some point.\n\nFiled in .
