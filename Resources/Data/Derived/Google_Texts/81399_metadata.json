The researchers, from the University of Freiburg in Germany, published their study in Nature Communications.\n\nThe research team focused primarily on the pathogen Yersinia ruckeri, a species of gram-negative bacteria that is tied mainly to fish diseases. Yersinia ruckeri is related to, but different than the Yersinia pestis bacteria, which is known to cause several forms of plague, including bubonic. Y. ruckeri only infects fish.\n\nThe key to treating cancer lies in a particular toxin-injection \u201cmachine\u201d located in the Y. ruckeri genome. The researchers found this machine has a structure resembling that of a virus that attacks bacteria, and that it contains a toxin known as Afp18, which deactivates the switch protein RhoA. RhoA plays a significant role in the cells of both humans and fish, such as monitoring processes in cell division and tumor spreading.\n\nThe researchers decided to take Afp18 and inject it into zebra fish embryos, thus blocking the RhoA switch protein and cell division, and preventing the embryos from developing. Using X-ray analysis, the research team was able to watch how this process unfolded. RhoA controls buildup and breakdown of actin filaments \u2014 parts of the cell that are important during cell division and tumor metastasis. When the zebra fish embryos were injected with Afp18, the actin filaments collapsed. Because RhoA proteins are often involved in cancer growth and spreading, they hope that injecting Afp18 could ultimately block cancer cell division and metastasis.\n\nResearchers have explored toxins as cancer treatment in the past \u2014 from the polio virus to infectious bacteria like Salmonella and C. novyi. But while trials are often successful in animal tissue, with many dogs, mice, and even one human patient showing remission from cancer after the treatment, it has been difficult to translate the same results to all humans. Indeed, plenty more research will need to be done to truly determine whether this fish pathogen can stop cancer from spreading. It will likely be several years before such a treatment could be tested in clinical trials.\n\nSource: Jank T, Eckerle S, Steinemann M, Trillhaase C, Schimpl M, Wiese S.
