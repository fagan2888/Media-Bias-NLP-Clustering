What makes us know that we are in our own bodies? For a new study from Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, neuroscientists created an out-of-body illusion in volunteers lying inside a brain scanner and then used this illusion to perceptually teleport them around a room. Importantly, the neuroscientists were able to decode activity patterns in specific brain regions that linked to volunteers' perceptions of their physical location.\n\nRight this minute, you are a body occupying an exact space \u2014 but how does your brain understand this? Past research has uncovered specific regions in a rat\u2019s brain that contain GPS-like place cells to signal the animals\u2019 position in a room. But it\u2019s not clear the same thing occurs with humans. What is known is our sense of being inside our own bodies while commanding a given space within the world is an enormously complex mental task. Continuously, our brains must integrate data from all of our senses to maintain the awareness of our body\u2019s location with respect to the exterior world.\n\nNeuro-Illusionists\n\nTo understand how the brain accomplishes this difficult task, a group of scientists created an out-of-body illusion in 15 healthy participants lying inside a brain scanner. For the experiment, the participants wore head-mounted displays and viewed themselves (within the scanner) from another part of the room. From this new visual perspective, the participant observes the body of a stranger, while the scientist touches the participant's body in synchrony with identical touches being delivered to the stranger's body.\n\nExperimental design Courtesy of Guterstam, Bjornsdotter, Gentile, Ehrsson, and Current Biology.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of seconds, the brain merges the sensation of touch and visual input from the new perspective, resulting in the illusion of owning the stranger's body and being located in that body's position in the room,\u201d Dr. Arvid Guterstam, lead author and doctoral candidate at Karolinska, stated in a press release.\n\nNext, the scientists used this out-of-body illusion to perceptually teleport each participant between different places in the scanner room. Meanwhile, they used pattern recognition techniques to analyze a participant's brain activity. Here they discovered the participant\u2019s sense of location could be decoded from brain activity ranging across the parieto-cingulate-hippocampal regions.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that the posterior cingulate orchestrates the flow of information concerning bodily self-location between the intraparietal sulcus and the hippocampus,\u201d the researchers concluded.\n\nImportantly, the hippocampus is the structure in which the \"place cells\" have been identified. This new evidence, then, indicates place cells not only participate in navigation and memory encoding but also play some role in generating the conscious experience of being a body in space.\n\nSource: Guterstam A, Bjornsdotter M, Gentile G, Ehrsson HH.
