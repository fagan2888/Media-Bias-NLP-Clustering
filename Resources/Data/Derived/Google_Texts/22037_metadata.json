We don\u2019t want it more populated. We don\u2019t want it more crowded. The voters put these limits in for a reason,\u201d said Kay Stimer, a resident of the Key Capri condominium along Johns Pass and part of an opposition group called Our Treasure Island.\n\n\u201cIf you continue down this path, we will fight you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nThe city commission cannot, in fact, grant a size increase for a new hotel along Johns Pass or anywhere on the island.\n\nThe commercially zoned property at the foot of Johns Pass Bridge, where the popular Gator\u2019s Caf\u00e9 & Saloon stands, is limited to a mere 22 tourist units per acre. The land\u2019s owners could request for it to be rezoned for resort hotels, which would permit up to 50 units per acre under the current city code.\n\nIt would be up to voters to grant them permission to build something larger per a city charter rule established in the early 2000s to stave off a wave of big condo construction that radically altered the face of neighboring communities.\n\nAs the economy has rebounded in the past few years, planners in nearby cities such as Madeira Beach and Clearwater have sought to work out flexible development agreements, sometimes allowing additional rooms or building height in exchange for extra parking or environmentally friendly design features.\n\nTreasure Island, too, is looking for ways to update its building code by creating a series of districts across town with varying rules for height, density and other design standards.\n\nLast spring, voters approved an increase in density for residential buildings in and around downtown, but narrowly rejected a measure to boost the number of hotel rooms.\n\nOn the city\u2019s agenda this year is a roughly 10-acre swath of land planners have dubbed the north end district. Rather than lay out a preset list of guidelines in this part of the city, planners have suggested letting developers draft proposals for the site that commissioners would subsequently review.\n\nIf part of a proposal required more rooms or height than currently allowed, the variance would be decided by voter referendum.\n\nThe rub for many residents and at least one commissioner is that plans for this north end district appear to be crafted with a specific developer in mind.\n\nA subsidiary of Homeowner\u2019s Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Co. bought up much of the property on the east side of Gulf Boulevard in 2012, including Gator\u2019s and the marina, as well as a small sliver of land across the street on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRepresentatives from its real estate arm, Greenleaf Capital, have attended numerous planning meetings since then and have shared ideas for the property with city staff.\n\nOne concept envisions two tall hotel buildings with 500 rooms, a new two-story restaurant at the Gator\u2019s site and another 25 units across the street on the Gulf.\n\nAlthough Greenleaf has met with the city on several occasions, the company\u2019s assistant general counsel Brent Von Horn reiterated to the commission and a large audience of residents that they have no definite plans for the property right now.\n\n\u201cWe were exploring the options of what possibly might be done with this very wonderful location,\u201d Von Horn said of meetings with the city in an interview after the meeting.\n\nWhile some city residents have recently voiced worries about a big hotel on the property, Von Horn points out that many residents in a survey taken a few years ago said they favored a major \u201cworld-class\u201d resort on the island\u2019s north side.\n\nSeveral residents have objected that the city code only allows properties of five contiguous acres or more to be rezoned for resort construction, which makes the Greenleaf property the only one eligible in that area.\n\nCommissioner Alan Bildz also wondered whether this approach might run afoul of state law.\n\nA rule passed in the Florida Legislature last year prohibits cities from approving specific development projects by a voter referendum.\n\nIf developers requested a height increase for a specific project above the maximum of five stories above parking, a public vote would be required, which appears to make voters the decision makers for a particular development rather than elected officials, Bildz said at a recent commission workshop.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say a challenge would not happen,\u201d City Attorney Maura Kiefer replied.\n\nHeidi Horak, a former chairperson of the city\u2019s planning board, predicted the city would see lawsuits like those that continue to hamper new construction in St. Pete Beach, the next town to the south,\n\nShe emphasized the need for making broader updates to the city\u2019s development rules.\n\n\u201cYou are trying to bend over backward for these very well-meaning people and I think it\u2019s going to bite you in the end,\u201d said Horak, a real estate attorney, who spoke at the workshop.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get what you really want and what they really want, which is a really good development, at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nA bitter dispute concerning St. Pete Beach\u2019s master city plan, which allows larger hotel development on sections of the beach, has cost more than $1 million in legal fees and has scared off new construction for years.\n\nWhile developers have shown interest in building along the main drag of Gulf Boulevard since the economy has improved, litigation that remains in appeal continues to keep new projects on hold, St. Pete Beach City Manager Mike Bonfield said.\n\nThe attorney who filed the St. Pete Beach lawsuit, Ken Weiss, says it\u2019s not the job of city commissioners to help developers like Greenleaf maximize profits.\n\n\u201cYou knew the zoning when you bought it. Why did you think we would change just for you?\u201d said Weiss, who has lived in Treasure Island for 20 years. \u201cThis is our home and we\u2019re just protective of our home.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a sentiment shared by many Treasure Island residents and their elected officials.\n\nPhil Collins was elected to the commission 12 years ago running in favor of giving voters a direct say over development.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any support to speak of from residents in Treasure Island who want to see skyscrapers, 10- to 15-story buildings on our beaches, or anywhere else,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want it to look like Clearwater, Miami or even Madeira Beach, and that\u2019s the way I feel as well.\u201d\n\nFor a town of 6,700 people that has high infrastructure costs, including a city-owned drawbridge, turning away new development could mean losing out on critical tax revenue.\n\nThe empty oceanfront lot at the end of 108th Avenue, where the Buccaneer Motel once stood, probably represents a loss of $100,000 to $150,000 a year in city revenue, Bildz said.\n\nThat only underscores the need for creating more flexible development rules, City Manager Reid Silverboard said.\n\n\u201cWe have been told for years now that the city\u2019s current regulations discourage redevelopment of property,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of older hotels and structures because the economics of redeveloping them to the current height and density just don\u2019t make it work economically.\u201d\n\nHorak, the former planning board chair, says the direction of redevelopment should be determined by a clear set of zoning principles and incentives rather than being crafted around the needs of a particular developer.\n\n\u201cPlanning is supposed to start with the community; it\u2019s not supposed to be initiated and pursued by a developer,\u201d she said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 08 Feb 2014 16:18:47 -0400", "Description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s harried Gulf Coast beach towns for decades.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s harried Gulf Coast beach towns for decades.", "title": "Treasure Island mulls limited development", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/treasure-island-mulls-limited-development-20140208/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140208/ARTICLE/140209387/AR/0/AR-140209387.jpg", "height": 426}, "updated_time": "2014-02-08T16:18:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s harried Gulf Coast beach towns for decades.", "title": "Treasure Island mulls limited development", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140208/ARTICLE/140209387/AR/0/AR-140209387.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-08T16:18:47Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-08T16:18:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Tourism,Treasure Island"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9633\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is our home and we\u2019re just protective of our home.\u201dThat\u2019s a sentiment shared by many Treasure Island residents and their elected officials.\nWhy did you think we would change just for you?\u201d said Weiss, who has lived in Treasure Island for 20 years.\nTREASURE ISLAND \u2014 It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s harried Gulf Coast beach towns for decades.\nThe voters put these limits in for a reason,\u201d said Kay Stimer, a resident of the Key Capri condominium along Johns Pass and part of an opposition group called Our Treasure Island.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any support to speak of from residents in Treasure Island who want to see skyscrapers, 10- to 15-story buildings on our beaches, or anywhere else,\u201d Collins said."}
