The home has since been torn down.\n\nPolice declined to elaborate on the timeline of when the knife, which was being tested for DNA evidence, was recovered but Neiman said it was still possible that \"the whole story is bogus from the get-go.\"\n\nHe declined to name the retired police officer or to say why the knife had been given to police only in the past two months.\n\nSimpson's ex-wife and Goldman were stabbed multiple times in the neck and head but the murder weapon was never found at the time of the trial that ended in 1995 with Simpson's acquittal.\n\nSimpson cannot be prosecuted again for the two murders since that would constitute double jeopardy.\n\nSimpson is now in prison on a 2008 armed robbery conviction related to the robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas hotel.\n\nHighlighting the enduring fascination that the case holds for the American public, there were roughly 150 tweets per minute about O.J. Simpson on Friday, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.\n\nThe public fascination has been further spurred by an FX cable television miniseries that dramatizes the behind-the-scenes details of the trial.\n\n(Reporting by Eric M.
