Protesters against the military coup are flashing the gesture as a silent act of rebellion, and they\u2019re being threatened with arrest if they ignore warnings to stop.\n\nThailand\u2019s military rulers said Tuesday they were monitoring the new form of opposition to the coup. Reporters witnessed the phenomenon and individuals were captured on film making the raised-arm salute.\n\n\u201cRaising three fingers has become a symbol in calling for fundamental political rights,\u201d said anti-coup activist Sombat Boonngam-anong on his Facebook page. He called on people to raise \u201c3 fingers, 3 times a day\u201d \u2014 at 9 a.m., 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. \u2014 in safe public places where no police or military are present.\n\nThe gesture emerged over the weekend as protesters joined small flash mobs, or stood alone, flashing three fingers in the air.\n\n\u201cWe know it comes from the movie, and let\u2019s say it represents resistance against the authorities,\u201d Col. Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, a spokesman for the junta, told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cIf a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it is a political gathering of five people or more, then we will have to take some action.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it persists, then we will have to make an arrest,\u201d he said.\n\nIn \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d movie series and book trilogy, the salute symbolizes rebellion against totalitarian rule, signifying thanks, admiration and goodbye to a loved one. But Thai protesters gave varying explanations. Some cited the French Revolution\u2019s trinity of values: liberty, equality, fraternity. Others said it means freedom, election and democracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 salute used as protest in Thailand", "title": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 salute used as protest in Thailand", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 salute used as protest in Thailand", "title": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 salute used as protest in Thailand", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/hunger_games_salute_used_as_protest_in_thailand/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/thailand-hunger-games.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 salute used as protest in Thailand", "title": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 salute used as protest in Thailand", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/thailand-hunger-games.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jocelyn Gecker and Jake Coyle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 The three-finger salute from the Hollywood movie \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d is being used as a real symbol of resistance in Thailand.\nIn \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d movie series and book trilogy, the salute symbolizes rebellion against totalitarian rule, signifying thanks, admiration and goodbye to a loved one.\n\u201cRaising three fingers has become a symbol in calling for fundamental political rights,\u201d said anti-coup activist Sombat Boonngam-anong on his Facebook page.\nReporters witnessed the phenomenon and individuals were captured on film making the raised-arm salute.\n\u201cIf a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her,\u201d he said."}
