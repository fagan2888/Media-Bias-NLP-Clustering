AVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Kurt Busch’s ex-girlfriend believed the NASCAR driver was in emotional distress when she drove to a Delaware race track to visit him, even though they had broken up earlier that week, an attorney for Patricia Driscoll said Saturday.

Driscoll has accused Busch of domestic assault, and police in Delaware said Friday they are investigating the incident that allegedly occurred inside Busch’s motorhome at Dover International Speedway on Sept. 26. Driscoll has filed court documents asking a judge to order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her, and she claims Busch verbally and physically abused her and smashed her head against a wall three times.

“He was verbally abusive to her and said he wished he had a gun so that he could kill himself,” the documents say.

Mark Dycio, Driscoll’s Virginia-based attorney, said Saturday that Driscoll traveled to Dover because she was worried about Busch’s well-being after receiving concerning text messages from the driver.

“There had been communication and she believed it was a cry for help, so she responded,” Dycio told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

Driscoll had her son, Houston, with her when she arrived at Busch’s motorhome. Dycio said his presence, coupled with an ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, led Driscoll to wait nearly six weeks to file the domestic assault claim.

“She wanted to go to police from beginning, but there were several factors that she had to first thoroughly consider,” Dycio said. “Her custody battle has claims that Kurt Busch referred to her son as his ‘adopted son’ and as his ‘surrogate stepson’ and this was a critical issue in the custody battle. Now this central figure in her custody case has committed an act against her when her son was present.
