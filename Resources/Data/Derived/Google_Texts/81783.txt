A new batch of public sculptures was unveiled in Riverside Park South Thursday, part of a program that sees a group of sculptors highlighted each year in the waterfront park.

Seven female sculptors were selected for this year’s program, organized by the Art Students League of New York. Called “Model to Monument (M2M): Creating Work for Public Spaces,” the program is in the fourth year of a five-year partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

A collaborative work by the artists will be installed in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, in addition to the seven on view in Riverside Park.

Sculptures installed in the park last year included works by Japanese artists Reina Kubota and Yasumitsu Morito, Anna Kuchel Rabinowitz, Sherwin Banfield and Beñat Iglesias Lopez. See photos of last year’s sculptures here.

“Lovers” by New York City-based artist Minako Yoshino is pictured. The theme for this year’s sculptures was “The Architecture of Nature.” The Model to Monument program trains artists to produce work for public spaces and is lead by Greg Wyatt, the sculptor-in-residence at St. John the Divine.

Ms. Yoshino said her piece honors the first loves in Japanese mythology, and she would like it to become a meeting place for couples in the city, according to the program’s website.

Ms. Takauji’s piece incorporates a swing to create a “multi-faceted viewing experience” that encourages the view to consider the act of perception.
