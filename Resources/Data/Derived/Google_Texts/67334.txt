MODESTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MCOL has announced the launch of the new HealthTurnup e-newsletter and website, featuring “healthcare news that is not quite right.” Free subscriptions, which include the monthly e-newsletter, weekly e-bulletins and periodic announcements, are available from the website at www.HealthTurnup.com.

Says Clive Riddle, MCOL President, "HealthTurnup is taking a light-hearted approach around some of the very serious issues in the business of healthcare – providing fictitious stories written by fictitious reporters with self-apparent satire." HealthTurnup will provide those in the business of healthcare a needed opportunity to laugh at themselves and the sometimes absurdly complex environment that we operate within.”

The new October issue of HealthTurnup includes these feature stories:

President, Boehner in dispute over Trademark rights to "Obamacare" name
