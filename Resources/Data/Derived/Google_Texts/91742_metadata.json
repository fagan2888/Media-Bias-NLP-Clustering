You see, the Lawrence County All-Stars have been there and done that.\n\nAs 13-year-olds two years ago, many of the same players on this year\u2019s team won the Tennessee State Championship and the Southeast Regional title in North Carolina. That earned them a trip to the World Series in Williston, N. Dakota where they finished runner-up to a strong California team.\n\nLast year, as 14-year-old \u2019Stars, the Lawrence County boys repeated as state and regional champs and advanced to the World Series in Ocala, Fla. where the team advanced to the single elimination round following preliminary pool play.\n\nNow, with the World Series headed to Lawrenceburg, the 15-year-old version of the Lawrence County teams gets to defend their home turf. It should make for some exciting baseball because the regional champions coming to town are guaranteed to be good and the home team- well, the record speaks for itself.\n\nAnchored by an extremely deep pitching staff, the Lawrence County team also has the hitting, defense and speed to present a formidable opponent for any foe. Of the team\u2019s 15 players, nine are in their third year together and five more are in their second year.\n\nThe team is truly an all-county group as the county\u2019s three largest communities and high schools are each represented by four players, two are home schooled and one is from Collinwood which had a team in the local Babe Ruth League this season.\n\nSince this year\u2019s team was assembled following a 10-game league schedule, the team has played 23 games and won all but five (one tie) against primarily 16 and 17-year-old competition. With the practice games and league games combined with the spring high school schedule, many of the players have been in 70 games this year.\n\nThe host team is ably directed by former Major League pitcher David Weathers, the manager, and coaches Mike Crane and Josh Purcell, all in their third year with the local All-Stars.\n\nExcitement for the World Series is at a fever pitch locally as scores of volunteers have joined forces with sponsors, local government and the state\u2019s tourism department to put on a first-class tournament.\n\nPlay will be conducted on two adjacent fields named for Denver Trapp (new field) and Tom Crews (existing field, renovated) near Lawrence County High School.\n\nWorld Series festivities will begin the evening of Aug. 12 at LCHS with a Banquet of Champions for players, coaches, officials and host families. Following the banquet, all-time major league legend Johnny Bench will speak in the school\u2019s gymnasium.\n\nWorld Series play will be conducted with the 10 teams (host team, East TN champs Giles County and eight regional champs) divided into two pools.\n\nEach team is guaranteed four games, one each against the other teams in the pool. The top two teams in each pool advance to the semi-finals for a single elimination \u201cFinal Four.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to be fun and exciting so don\u2019t miss it!
