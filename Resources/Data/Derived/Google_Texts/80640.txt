You will never believe this, but U.S. Senator John McCain appeared on a Sunday morning political talk show yesterday. Who knows how they were able to book such a notorious camera-shy recluse — hypnotism/witchcraft, presumably. It was during this appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” that McCain lent his support to a burgeoning front of side-criticism over the President’s “handling of Ebola,” so to speak: That Obama needs to appoint a “czar” to coordinate the government’s response. “I’d like to know who’s in charge,” McCain said, noting that the people of Arizona are “not comforted” and “need more reassurance” that they will not all die from a virus that has infected two people in Texas.

McCain’s call for a showy bureaucratic shuffling to allay the fears of the American public is bringing more attention to the “Ebola Czar” cause that his fellow Republicans have been championing for weeks. Rep. Jack Kingston said earlier this month that “while he hate[s] to invoke the term ‘czar,'” we need a lil’ czar action on the Ebola front. And last week, Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Frank Wolf sent a letter to the White House calling for an Ebola czar to serve as point person for the administration’s response to the virus.

So. We’re into administration “czars” now, are we?

It wasn’t always this way. Back in the old days (2009), the White House suffered constant criticism for appointing “czars,” a terrifyingly monarchical, Russian word that critics and the media applied to various policy point-people in the administration. The administration was appointing policy “czars,” the criticism went, to sidestep the vetting and oversight of a Senate confirmation process. Nevermind that many of the so-called “czars” were, in fact, confirmed by the Senate — assistant secretaries or whatever — and that any administration has the fairly obvious right to employ policy advisors. Nevermind that. Obama was doing a run-around on Congress and the Constitution.

Among those complaining about czars in 2009? John McCain…

Obama has more czars than the Romanovs - who ruled Russia for 3 centuries. Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20. — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 30, 2009

…Jack Kingston…

Pence’s call came after Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) introduced legislation in July that would effectively end the president’s power to appoint special advisers. Kingston, who has compiled a list of 34 Obama czars, said transparency is the issue. “These guys don’t get vetted,” he said in an interview. “They have staff and offices and immense responsibility. All that needs to come before Congress.”

…Frank Wolf…

“The American people have a right to know who is advising the president and whether they have been thoroughly vetted,” Wolf wrote.In addition to writing the president, Wolf is cosponsoring legislation that would prohibit the president from appointing high-ranking officials without going through the Senate’s confirmation process. The Czar Accountability and Reform Act (H.R. 3226) also would eliminate funding for czars who hold senior policy-making positions who carry out the same functions as officials who have been confirmed by the Senate.

… and Jerry Moran.

Congressman Jerry Moran recently introduced H. Res. 778 – a resolution to formally express Congress’ opposition to the “czar” appointment process while calling for the President to cease all “czar” appointments. Moran also sponsored H.R. 3226, the Czar Accountability and Reform Act of 2009, to prohibit paying the salary of a “czar” that has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. “The Obama Administration’s excessive czar’ appointments exemplify the ever-expanding federal bureaucracy and big government that Kansans and Americans have grown tired of,” Moran said. “The increasing use of unconfirmed government officials is irresponsible – it is time Congress stops the executive branch from abusing this flawed appointment process. I have introduced this resolution to condemn the increased use of unconfirmed government officials and heads of agencies.”
