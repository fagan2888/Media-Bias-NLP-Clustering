Republicans blame Obamacare, while Democrats blame some states\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid. In reality, the problem started years before all that.\n\nWhat's clear is that rural hospitals and the rural economy rise and fall together.\n\nHancock Memorial Hospital in the tiny town of Sparta, Georgia was among the first of nine rural hospitals that have closed across Georgia since 2000. Today, it\u2019s overgrown with weeds and vines, while the roof caves on the gurneys and computers still inside.\n\n\u201cI mean, it was just not economically feasible to maintain the staff and the equipment,\u201d says Robert Moore, whose family has lived in Hancock County since they were emancipated.\n\nSparta was once a fancy town with lots of antebellum mansions. But Moore says things really started going south in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cRural Georgia was based on the textile industry, and when NAFTA was signed, all that moved to Mexico, and\u2026 sent everything into a downspin,\u201d Moore says.\n\nHancock County Commission Chair Sistie Hudson says it\u2019s not surprising that a population so small and so poor can't support a whole hospital. \u201cThere\u2019s about 2,600 people [in Hancock County] that still work, out of the little more than 8,000 that we have,\u201d she says.\n\nBut with Hancock Memorial boarded up, the prospects for future growth are even worse. When Hudson tries to recruit a new industrial employer, one of the first things they ask is: \u201cDo you have a hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just really need a local facility just in case somebody gets hurt in these factories, you know? It\u2019s something that they like to see,\u201d Hudson says.\n\nJust imagine what having no emergency room nearby would do to a company\u2019s workers comp and other insurance costs. It\u2019s a non-starter for most businesses.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Mark Holmes studied the economic impact of 140 rural hospital closures nationwide. He found that three years out, losing a hospital costs a community, on average, \u201cabout 1.6 percentage points in unemployment, about $700 in per capita income, and that was in [year] 2000 dollars so that\u2019d be probably about $1,000 currently.\"\n\nAnd that\u2019s only the effect on economic health. What about health?\n\nSpeaking on the subject a few weeks ago, Georgia state Senator David Lucas paused several times to weep as he addressed his colleagues this spring: \u201c[It] ends up with rural communities, such as Hancock County, where 39 percent of the folks who have a stroke or have a heart attack die.\" That\u2019s a lot higher than in counties with hospitals close by.\n\nGeorgia officials are exploring solutions to this problem that could become a national model \u2013 basically, a medical facility that does more than an urgent care clinic, but isn\u2019t as big a whole hospital. But Georgia\u2019s Community Health Commissioner Clyde Reese says America\u2019s healthcare system doesn\u2019t provide enough ways for the operator of that kind of place to get paid.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be hospitals, they won\u2019t be reimbursed as hospitals, they won\u2019t be able to charge a facility fee, they won\u2019t get the Medicaid add-on rate, etc.,\u201d Reese says.\n\nReese is working on ways to fix that. Because without reimbursements, there will be no emergency care. And with no emergency care, there probably will be no new jobs in Hancock County.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/04/10/health-care/when-rural-hospitals-close-towns-struggle-stay-open", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/hospital_1.jpg?itok=icfr-UFm", "type": "article", "description": "Rural hospitals are closing at a rate that\u2019s starting to get some politicians\u2019 attention.", "title": "When rural hospitals close, towns struggle to stay open"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "sWcSNA/jaTIiAT4KIQx+t2xkUZqOK59NIwY+iM+oYy2Zjtpdr/w8XmMwn9GiMuqfSSYfao/4nDze/DpdXmDlHg==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc310\"", "article_summary": "What's clear is that rural hospitals and the rural economy rise and fall together.\nHancock Memorial Hospital in the tiny town of Sparta, Georgia was among the first of nine rural hospitals that have closed across Georgia since 2000.\nWeeds have overgrown a sign in front Hancock Memorial Hospital in Sparta, Ga., which closed in 2001.\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Mark Holmes studied the economic impact of 140 rural hospital closures nationwide.\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 2,600 people [in Hancock County] that still work, out of the little more than 8,000 that we have,\u201d she says."}
