Twenty minutes after police say the trio burglarized the home, an officer pulled the alleged burglars over for going 70 mph in a 35 mph zone.\n\n\"Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good,\" said Sgt. James Waller with the Harrah Police Department. \"The driver was sweating and obviously nervous.\"\n\nDuring the traffic stop, 911 dispatch received a burglary call less than a mile away. Police say the items reported stolen were found in the back seat of the alleged speeder's car. A shotgun, electronics, a safe with the victim's social security card and open bottles of liquor were found, according to police.\n\nNeighbor Jason Condor believes he saw the suspects casing the neighborhood days earlier.\n\n\"There was a car that just drove by really slow and stopped in front of our house,\" said Condor.\n\nPolice arrested Jimmy Gober, who was driving on a suspended license. Passengers Gary Sheppard and Shalina Grant were also arrested. All three suspects are related, according to police.\n\n\"If you want to speed, go right ahead after you've committed a burglary,\" laughed Waller. \"We'd be more than happy to make contact with you.\"\n\nOn top of all the evidence, officers say Gober admitted to burglarizing the home. Police estimate about $3,000 worth of property was stolen.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A group of three burglars didn't get far after stealing property from a Harrah house early Monday, according to police.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25059952/police-speeding-violation-nets-three-burglars", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25059952_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A group of three burglars didn't get far after stealing property from a Harrah house early Monday, according to police.", "title": "Police: Speeding Violation Nets Three Burglars"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25059952_SA.jpg", "description": "A group of three burglars didn't get far after stealing property from a Harrah house early Monday, according to police.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police: Speeding Violation Nets Three Burglars"}, "wnreadableurl": "police-speeding-violation-nets-three-burglars", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/03/24", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,burglars,harrah,speeding,traffic,stop,police,news9.com,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,burglars,harrah,speeding,traffic,stop,police,news9.com,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0ff\"", "article_summary": "A group of three burglars didn't get far after stealing property from a Harrah house early Monday, according to police.\nOn top of all the evidence, officers say Gober admitted to burglarizing the home.\nTwenty minutes after police say the trio burglarized the home, an officer pulled the alleged burglars over for going 70 mph in a 35 mph zone.\nPolice say the items reported stolen were found in the back seat of the alleged speeder's car.\nA shotgun, electronics, a safe with the victim's social security card and open bottles of liquor were found, according to police."}
