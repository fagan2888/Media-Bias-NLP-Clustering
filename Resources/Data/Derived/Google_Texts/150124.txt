COLORADO SPRINGS — Colorado College freshman Alex Roos lifted a backhander into the net over a pile of humanity, including University of Denver goalie Sam Brittain, late in the third period Saturday night to give the Tigers a 3-1 victory, series sweep and control of the coveted Gold Pan.

Roos struck with 6:06 remaining in regulation, and senior Alexander Krushelnyski added an empty-net goal in the final minute.

Brittain was helpless on Roos’ shot after being bowled over in the paint and pinned against the ice by CC defenseman Eamonn McDermott.

Replays showed McDermott was thrown onto the pile by DU’s Grant Arnold, and the goal stood.

DU was swept for the first time since Nov. 1-2.

“I think CC was the better team over the entire game,” Pioneers coach Jim Montgomery said. “If it weren’t for (Brittain) we would have been behind earlier. It was unfortunate. It was a big weekend for us. We could have made some huge strides in the NCHC, and it didn’t work out that way for us.”

The Pioneers played their third game without All-American defenseman Joey LaLeggia (upper-body injury) and didn’t seemingly get any bounces.

“For the hockey gods to be on your side, you have to be the warrior team. CC was more the warrior team,” Montgomery said. “We had some passengers again tonight.”

CC has won just six games this season — four during its past eight games — but the Tigers celebrated in front of a sellout crowd after taking possession of the Gold Pan, which DU had owned three of the last four years.

Denver, which only needed a weekend tie to retain the traveling trophy, fell to 9-21-5 against CC at the World Arena. The Tigers won 3-2 in Denver on Friday.

Game 2 on the Olympic-size ice was a chess match after both teams scored early.

CC’s Aaron Harstad tallied 16:06 into the game, and DU’s Matt Tabrum tied it at 18:20.

Harstad took a defenseman-to-defenseman pass from Erie product Jaccob Slavin and boomed a shot through traffic past Brittain.

Tabrum cashed in on linemate Arnold’s rebound down low to beat senior goalie Josh Thorimbert.

Colorado College (6-18-6, 6-9-1 National Collegiate Hockey Conference) is 4-2-2 in its past eight games. The Pioneers (14-12-6, 8-9-3) slipped to fifth in the eight-team NCHC.
