In the preamble to the proposed rule, HHS emphasizes the importance of Section 1557 for achieving the ACA\u2019s goals of expanding health care and insurance, noting that discrimination within health programs, insurance, and care can contribute to poor health outcomes or coverage, increase health disparities among underserved communities, and negatively impact the distribution of health care resources.\n\nWhile Section 1557 and the proposed rule coordinate and incorporate existing federal laws, regulations, and policy for non-discrimination in health coverage and care, they also include new protections and provisions.

Moreover, the proposed rule extends the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity (but does not explicitly include sexual orientation). In addition, the proposed rule establishes regulations related to the provision of language assistance services based on long-standing HHS policy guidance.\n\nThis issue brief summarizes key provisions of the proposed rule, including:\n\nWho is subject to the non-discrimination provisions;\n\nProtections against discrimination based on sex;\n\nAccess for individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP);\n\nProtections against discrimination based on disability;\n\nProhibitions against discrimination in health coverage; and\n\nCompliance and enforcement.\n\nThe 60 day public comment period for the proposed rule closes on November 9, 2015. A final rule will be issued based on HHS\u2019 consideration of the public comments and would be effective 60 days after it is published, and provide an additional tool to help prevent and remediate discrimination in health programs and activities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn September 8, 2015, HHS proposed regulations to implement Section 1557 of the ACA. Section 1557 prohibits certain entities that administer health programs and activities from excluding an individual from participation, denying program benefits, or discriminating against an individual based on his or her race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. While Section 1557 has been in effect since the enactment of the ACA, this proposed rule marks the first time HHS has issued implementing guidance. In the preamble to the proposed rule, HHS emphasizes the importance of Section 1557 to achieving the ACA\u2019s overarching goal of expanding access to health care and insurance for all individuals, noting that discrimination within health programs can contribute to poor and inadequate health outcomes or coverage, exacerbate existing health disparities in underserved communities, and lead to insufficient and ineffective distribution of health care resources.\n\nThe intent of Section 1557 is to coordinate existing federal laws, regulations, and policy for non-discrimination as they apply to health coverage and care and to extend sex discrimination protections to health programs and activities. Specifically, the proposed rule incorporates the existing anti-discrimination tenants of Title VI (race, color and national origin), the Age Discrimination Act, and Section 504 (disability) as they apply to health care. It also extends the sex discrimination protections of Title IX, which only apply to educational programs, to health care. As such, it is the first federal civil rights law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in health care. Moreover, the proposed rule extends the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity (but does not explicitly include sexual orientation). In addition, the proposed rule establishes regulations related to the provision of language assistance services based on long-standing HHS policy guidance. This issue brief summarizes key provisions of the proposed rule.\n\nKey Provisions of the Proposed Rule\n\nWho is Subject to Section 1557\u2019s Non-Discrimination Provisions\n\nThe proposed rule applies to health programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from HHS; health programs and activities administered by HHS, including the Federally-facilitated Marketplace; and State-based Marketplaces established under the ACA. Text Box 1 provides examples of the types of entities subject to Section 1557. While Section 1557 applies more broadly to all health programs and activities that receive federal funding through any agency, HHS limits its proposed rule to the programs that it has authority to enforce. HHS encourages other federal agencies to adopt the standards from its proposed rule when applying Section 1557 to the health programs and activities that they administer.\n\nThe proposed rule defines health programs and activities to include all operations of an entity that is principally engaged in the provision or administration of health-related services or health-related insurance coverage. Health programs and activities also include providing assistance obtaining health-related services or health-related insurance coverage and health education and research programs. The proposed rule reiterates that federal law already prohibits discrimination in research that receives federal funds as well as in research at universities. This rule would extend the nondiscrimination protections to any research that is conducted within HHS as well as non-educational institutions. In the preamble, HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope, and therefore, research protocol criteria that target or exclude certain groups are warranted when justified for subjects\u2019 health or safety, the scientific study design, or the research purpose. HHS seeks comment on which health programs and activities should be covered by the rule.\n\nBox 1: Examples of the Types of Entities Subject to Section 1557 and the Proposed Rule Health care providers, such as physicians, hospitals, community health centers, nursing facilities, home health agencies, clinical laboratories, residential or community-based treatment facilities, intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual/developmental disabilities, hospices, organ procurement centers, and physician\u2019s practices\n\nHealth related schools and education and research programs\n\nState agencies, such as Medicaid, CHIP, and public health\n\nHealth insurance issuers\n\nNavigators\n\nHHS programs, such as CMS, HRSA, CDC, IHS, SAMHSA, and the Federally-facilitated Marketplace\n\nState-based Marketplaces\n\nEmployers offering employee health benefit programs (in certain circumstances, see below) Source: Proposed 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 92.4, 92.208; 80 Fed. Reg. 54175, 54189, 54194-54195.\n\nThe proposed rule clarifies that Federal financial assistance includes not only funding received directly by covered entities but also premium and cost-sharing subsidies provided to individuals for coverage through the Federally-facilitated or State-based Marketplaces. As such, the rule applies to insurance carriers that offer plans through these Marketplaces. Moreover, the preamble clarifies that Section 1557 applies to all plans offered by these carriers, not just those available through the Marketplaces.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, Section 1557 applies to employee health programs, such as health and long-term care insurance, wellness programs, and employer-provided health clinics in three circumstances. These circumstances include the following: (1) If an employer is principally engaged in providing or administering health services or coverage and receives Federal financial assistance, Section 1557 applies to the employer\u2019s health programs and services as well as its employee health benefit program. For example, a hospital must comply with Section 1557 not only in providing health services to patients but also in providing health benefits to its employees. Similarly, a state Medicaid agency must comply with Section 1557 not only in providing Medicaid benefits but also in providing health benefits to state Medicaid employees. By contrast, a state transportation department would not be subject to Section 1557 for its employee health benefit program (assuming it is not engaged in other health programs or activities). (2) Section 1557 applies to an employee health benefit program if an employer receives Federal financial assistance for the primary purpose of funding the employee health benefits. In these cases, Section 1557 would apply regardless of whether the employer is engaged in other health programs or activities. (3) Section 1557 applies when an employer is not principally engaged in providing or administering health services or coverage but operates an employee health program or activity, other than an employee health benefit program, that receives Federal financial assistance. In these cases, Section 1557 applies only to the employee health program or activity. For example, if an employer receives Federal financial assistance for an employee wellness program and is not engaged in other health programs or activities, the employer must comply with Section 1557 only with regard to the wellness program.\n\nProtections Against Discrimination Based on Sex\n\nSection 1557 and its proposed regulations, for the first time, extend protections against discrimination based on sex to health coverage and care. Under the proposed rule, covered entities must provide individuals equal access to health programs and activities without discrimination based on sex, including pregnancy, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, recovery from childbirth or related medical conditions, and sex stereotyping which could be an important protection for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender individuals, among others.\n\nMoreover, the proposed rule extends the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on gender identity for the first time in the health care context. In the preamble to the proposed rule, HHS explains that its recognition of gender identity discrimination as part of sex discrimination is consistent with the interpretations of other federal agencies and courts. The proposed rule does not explicitly extend Section 1557 protections to cover sexual orientation. However, HHS also explains that it supports including sexual orientation discrimination as part of sex discrimination in implementing Section 1557, while acknowledging that current caselaw is mixed about whether existing Federal laws that prohibit sex discrimination also prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. HHS notes that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recently found that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily involves sex-based considerations and therefore is covered under existing law and seeks comment about the scope of the definition of sex discrimination under the proposed rule.\n\nHHS seeks comment on whether the rule should include specific exemptions from its sex discrimination requirements. For example, HHS seeks comment about whether certain sex-based distinctions in health programs and activities should be permitted, such as exceptions to account for a women\u2019s health clinic or a counseling program limited to male domestic violence victims. HHS also seeks comment on whether exemptions for sincerely held religious beliefs available in other federal laws are sufficient or if additional exemptions should be included in the proposed rule to accommodate sincerely held religious beliefs. At the same time, HHS requests comment on any health care consequences that may result from additional exemptions in this area, given the ACA\u2019s purpose of ensuring that health care services are available broadly and in a non-discriminatory manner. HHS notes that Section 1557 would not displace the religious belief protections offered by existing laws, including provider conscience laws, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the ACA provisions regarding abortion services, and the ACA\u2019s preventive health services regulations.\n\nAccess for Individuals with Limited English Proficiency\n\nUnder the proposed rule, covered entities are required to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to each individual with LEP that they serve or encounter in their health programs and activities. The proposed rule incorporates existing Title VI regulations and HHS\u2019s LEP policy guidance and outlines several specific requirements related to provision of language assistance services.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, covered entities must provide free, accurate, and timely language assistance services; protect the privacy and independence of an individual with LEP; and offer a qualified interpreter when reasonable. Language assistance services include oral language assistance, written translation, and taglines. The rule also specifies that individuals with LEP are not required to accept language assistance services.\n\nThe proposed rule defines who may be considered a qualified interpreter and outlines specific requirements related to the provision of interpreter services. The proposed rule specifies that a qualified interpreter is an individual who adheres to generally accepted interpreter ethics principles; is able to interpret accurately and impartially, both receptively and expressively; and has demonstrated proficiency in and also has an above average familiarity with speaking or understanding both spoken English and at least one other spoken language. Under the proposed rule, an entity may not require an individual with LEP to provide his or her own interpreter. Moreover, the entity cannot rely on an adult accompanying the individual with LEP to interpret, except in emergency situations or when the individual specifically requests the adult to provide those services, the adult agrees to provide the assistance, and reliance on the adult is appropriate for the circumstances. Similarly, the entity may not rely on a minor child to interpret except in an emergency when no qualified interpreter is immediately available. HHS also considered an approach that would require all covered entities to have capacity to provide telephonic oral interpretation services in at least 150 languages. It seeks comment on which oral interpretation services, if any, should be required under the proposed rule.\n\nThe proposed rule notes that when assessing an entity\u2019s compliance with these requirements, HHS will account for the nature and importance of the health program or activity and the information that is being communicated. Consideration also will be given on a case by case basis to other factors such as the length and complexity of the communication, the context of the communication, the prevalence of the language spoken by the individual among those served by the entity, the resources available to the entity, and the cost of language assistance services.\n\nHHS seeks comment on several issues related to the provision of language assistance services. First, it seeks comment on whether certain categories of covered entities should have enhanced obligations to provide language assistance services, and if so, how those categories should be defined. It also seeks comment on whether thresholds should be used to determine the minimum number of languages for which covered entities would be required to provide language assistance services, and if so, to what geographic or service areas those thresholds should apply. In addition, HHS seeks comment on whether entities should be required to be systematically prepared to provide language assistance services through advance planning activities, such as identifying resources to provide language assistance services, annually assessing the prevalent languages of individuals served, establishing policies for staff to use when encountering individuals with LEP, and monitoring and assessing the quality of language assistance services provided.\n\nProtections Against Discrimination Based on Disability\n\nUnder the proposed rule, covered entities must make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures to avoid disability-based discrimination, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the health program or activity. The proposed rule incorporates existing federal protections against disability-based discrimination from Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under Section 1557, these standards apply to the health programs and activities of HHS and state and local governments and private entities that receive Federal financial assistance.\n\nCovered entities must ensure effective communication with people with disabilities. To the extent that the ADA effective communication rules differ between Title II (which applies to state and local government) and Title III (which applies to places of public accommodation), HHS proposes adopting the Title II rules for all entities subject to Section 1557. This requires Section 1557 covered entities to give \u201cprimary consideration\u201d to the person with a disability\u2019s choice of auxiliary aid or service. Auxiliary aids and services can include, as appropriate, qualified interpreters, a variety of assistive technology devices, and the provision of materials in alternative formats.\n\nBuildings and facilities where health programs and activities are conducted must be designed, constructed, and altered in a way that is readily accessible to and useable by people with disabilities. Specifically, HHS adopts the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design for construction or alternation beginning 18 months or later from the date that the final rules are published for facilities of covered entities that receive Federal funding and State-based Marketplaces.\n\nCovered entities must make electronic and information technology in health programs and activities accessible to people with disabilities, unless doing so would create an undue financial or administrative burden or fundamentally alter the nature of the health program or activity. When providing an accessible electronic format creates an undue burden or fundamental alteration, covered entities still must provide information in another format that does not create an undue burden or fundamental alternation but that does ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that people with disabilities receive the benefits or services of the health program or activity provided through electronic or information technology. The proposed rule defines electronic and information technology to include items such as telephones, information kiosks and transaction machines, internet sites, multimedia, and office equipment such as copiers and fax machines. HHS seeks comment on its decision to apply Section 1557\u2019s accessibility rules to all health program electronic and information technology, rather than limiting the rules to covered entities\u2019 websites, in light of existing law and the importance of technology in accessing health care and coverage.\n\nHHS notes that Section 1557\u2019s prohibition against disability-based discrimination in health programs and activities also extends to medical equipment but is deferring setting accessibility standards in this area until the U.S. Access Board releases its standards. HHS requests comment on its proposal to issue regulations or policy requiring Section 1557 covered entities to comply with the forthcoming Access Board standards for accessible medical equipment.\n\nProhibitions Against Discrimination in Health Coverage\n\nThe proposed rule outlines several protections against discrimination in health insurance coverage determinations and practices. Under these protections, covered entities may not take the following actions on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability:\n\nDeny, limit, or refuse to issue or renew a health insurance policy;\n\nDeny or limit coverage for a health insurance claim;\n\nImpose additional cost sharing or other limitations or restrictions on access to covered health care services; or\n\nEmploy discriminatory marketing practices or insurance benefit designs.\n\nThe proposed rule maintains that while health insurers cannot have coverage policies that operate in a discriminatory manner, they still may apply medical necessity rules when determining covered benefits. HHS also notes in the preamble that Section 1557 does not require insurers to cover any particular services.\n\nWhile the proposed rule states that covered entities may not employ discriminatory benefit designs, it is silent on whether issuers may place all drugs to treat a single medical condition on the plan\u2019s highest cost-sharing tier. This practice is the basis of an administrative complaint filed with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR, see Box 2). Separately, in its 2016 Letter to Issuers and Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters, where HHS lays out its expectations for issuers in the Federally-facilitated Marketplace, HHS identifies this practice as an example of potential discrimination.\n\nBox 2: Case Study: A Challenge Under Section 1557 On May 29, 2014, The AIDS Institute, and the National Health Law Program (NHeLP), filed an administrative complaint with the HHS OCR. The complaint alleged that four Florida health insurance insurers operating on the Federally-facilitated Marketplace violated Section 1557\u2019s prohibition against discriminatory plan benefit design when they placed all drugs to treat HIV on the highest cost-sharing tier, sometimes with significant deductibles, thereby discouraging people with HIV/AIDS from selecting those insurers\u2019 plans. OCR has not yet officially acted on the complaint; however, the issuers have reached individual agreements with the complainants to remedy HIV drug formulary placement.\n\nThe proposed rule includes specific coverage protections for transgender individuals. While the rule generally requires that covered entities treat individuals consistent with their gender identity, as described above, it specifies a limited exception. The exception prohibits entities from denying or limiting health services (or imposing additional cost-sharing on services) that are ordinarily or exclusively available to individuals of one sex or gender based on the fact that the individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or gender recorded in a medical or health insurance plan record differs from the one to which such health services are ordinarily or exclusively available. For example, a covered entity may not deny an individual treatment for ovarian cancer where the individual could benefit medically from the treatment, based on the individual\u2019s identification as a transgender male. In addition, under the proposed rule, an insurance plan may not categorically or automatically exclude or limit coverage for all health services related to gender transition or otherwise deny or limit coverage or deny a claim for specific health services related to gender transition, if such a policy results in discrimination against the individual seeking services. HHS notes, however, that these provisions do not affirmatively require covered entities to cover any particular procedure or treatment for transition-related care.\n\nCompliance with Section 1557\u2019s Non-Discrimination Provisions\n\nEach entity applying for federal assistance must submit assurance of compliance with 1557. Assurances will also be required by each Marketplace issuer and states seeking approval to operate a State-based Marketplace.\n\nEntities covered by the proposed rule must post a notice regarding their non-discrimination policies. These notices must inform individuals about the bases of discrimination prohibited under Section 1557, the availability of free and timely auxiliary aids and services and language assistance services, how to access those services, contact information for the entity\u2019s employee responsible for Section 1557 compliance, the entity\u2019s Section 1557 grievance procedures, and HHS OCR complaint procedures. Notices must be available to beneficiaries, enrollees, applicants, and members of the public. They must be printed in a conspicuously visible font and included in significant communications (such as handbooks and outreach publications), in conspicuous physical locations where the entity interacts with the public, and in a conspicuous location on the covered entity\u2019s website homepage.\n\nCovered entities are required to post the notice in English and taglines for the notice in the top 15 languages spoken by individuals with LEP nationally, and may choose to post the notice in other non-English languages. HHS will make available sample notices in English and sample notices and taglines in the top 15 language spoken by individuals with LEP nationally. The proposed rule includes sample notices and taglines for public comment. HHS also seeks comment on alternate methodologies for determining how many languages into which the notice should be translated and whether this methodology should be applied at a national, state, or local level.\n\nEach covered entity that employs at least 15 people is required to adopt a grievance procedure that incorporates appropriate due process standards and provides prompt and equitable resolution of grievances under Section 1557. HHS and covered entities with more than 15 employees also must designate at least one employee to coordinate their efforts to carry out their responsibilities under Section 1557, including the investigation of grievances. The HHS OCR will serve as the responsible employee for Section 1557 compliance in HHS programs and activities and the Federally-facilitated Marketplace. The preamble indicates that covered entities may use the same grievance procedures and individuals as used to comply with Section 504 and Title IX if their scope is broadened to include all bases of discrimination prohibited by Section 1557. To ensure compliance with Section 1557, HHS will provide covered entities with training materials on key provisions of the rule. HHS seeks comment on whether the rule should require all covered entities to designate grievance procedures and a responsible employee, not just entities with more than 15 employees.\n\nEnforcement of Section 1557\u2019s Non-Discrimination Provisions\n\nThe proposed rule requires covered entities to take remedial action as required by the HHS OCR Director if they are found to have discriminated on any basis prohibited by Section 1557. If discrimination is not found, covered entities may also take voluntary actions to improve operations. The HHS OCR can enforce Section 1557 through informal mediation, reducing or eliminating a covered entity\u2019s Federal financial assistance, or referring matters to the Department of Justice for litigation. The proposed rule also provides that private individuals and entities can sue in federal court to challenge violations of Section 1557.\n\nThe proposed rule incorporates existing enforcement mechanisms in other federal laws for violations of Section 1557. For covered entities that receive Federal financial assistance or that are State-based Marketplaces, the existing Title VI enforcement process will apply to Section 1557 claims based on race, color, national origin, sex, and disability, and the existing Age Discrimination Act process will apply to Section 1557 claims based on age. These procedures cover issues such as keeping records, submitting OCR compliance reports, conducting reviews and complaint investigations, and providing technical assistance and guidance. For HHS health programs and activities, including the Federally-facilitated Marketplace, the Section 504 enforcement process will apply to claims alleging discrimination under any of the bases prohibited by Section 1557. HHS also proposes that it will allow OCR access to all relevant information to investigate complaints and determine compliance with Section 1557 and that HHS will not retaliate against individuals that seek protection under Section 1557.\n\nSection 1557 does not invalidate or limit other existing anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, entities may be subject to independent civil right obligations separate from Section 1557, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Architectural Barriers Act and Section 508 for persons with disabilities. Any state or local laws that provide additional protections against discrimination also still apply.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe proposed rule to implement the ACA\u2019s Section 1557 nondiscrimination protections coordinates existing federal laws, regulations, and policy for non-discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, and disability as they apply to health coverage and care. Section 1557 also extends sex discrimination protections to health care programs and activities and includes gender identity as a prohibited basis of discrimination. It does not, however, explicitly include discrimination based on sexual orientation. The proposed rule codifies HHS\u2019s long-standing policy guidance on language assistance services for individuals with LEP. It also incorporates existing provisions of Section 504 and the ADA to prohibit disability-based discrimination in health programs and activities, although it defers setting standards for accessible medical equipment pending forthcoming standards from the Access Board. The rule also prohibits insurers from using discriminatory benefit designs, although it does not specifically address the placement of all drugs to treat a single medical condition on the highest cost-sharing tier, the subject of a recent administrative complaint that is pending with OCR. The 60 day public comment period for the proposed rule closes on November 9, 2015. A final rule will be issued based on HHS\u2019 consideration of the public comments. The final rule would be effective 60 days after it is published, and provide an additional tool to help prevent and remediate discrimination in health programs and activities.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "The Henry J.
