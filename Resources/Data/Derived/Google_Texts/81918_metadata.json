The future of American medicine depends on it.\n\nWhile NIH funds some basic research that sometimes suggests drug candidates, only private companies can manage the lengthy and costly process of turning discoveries into usable products.\n\nSens. Birch Bayh and Bob Dole\u2019s bipartisan 1980 legislation allowed universities, non-profits, and small businesses to retain ownership of patents for inventions discovered with the aid of federal funding.\n\nThe economic rationale was simple. Previously, the government owned inventions made with federal funding and granted only nonexclusive licenses to developers. Few companies were willing to invest the money and time to develop an invention into a practical product unless they could own and exclude others from exploiting it. As a result, the federal government sat on tens of thousands of patents that languished unlicensed and undeveloped. America\u2019s publicly funded research was not benefiting the public.\n\nBayh-Dole allowed the discovering institutions to retain titles and negotiate license terms with private companies to develop inventions into practical products, such as new drugs.\n\nThe act has been highly successful. Universities created offices of technology licensing, and the number of patents, licenses, and technology development exploded. The act was crucial to developing America\u2019s biotechnology sector.\n\nThe act allows the federal government to \u201cmarch in\u201d and seize the intellectual property rights of the inventor and grant a license to \u201ca responsible applicant or applicants\u201d under two highly unlikely conditions.\n\nFirst, if the patentee and its licensee have not taken effective steps to achieve \u201cpractical application\u201d of the subject invention \u2014 in other words, if they\u2019re just sitting on it \u2014 the government can license the patent to someone who will develop it. The statute defines \u201cpractical application\u201d as the benefits of the invention being made \u201cavailable to the public on reasonable terms.\u201d The second condition is met when government action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs that are not being satisfied by the rights holder \u2014 think of a small company that invents a vaccine against a superbug but can\u2019t produce it fast enough during a global pandemic.\n\nIn Bayh-Dole\u2019s 35-year history, the NIH has rejected all six petitions it received to exercise march-in rights.\n\nThe 51 congressmen claimed march-in rights were intended to combat high drug prices that make drugs \u201c[un]available to the public on reasonable terms.\u201d In fact, nothing in the act or its legislative history supports this view.\n\nSens. Bayh and Dole themselves wrote that \u201cthe law makes no reference to a reasonable price that should be dictated by the government,\u201d that march-in rights are \u201cnot contingent on the pricing of a resultant product or tied to the profitability of a company that has commercialized a product that results in part from government-funded research,\u201d and that government should march in \u201conly when the private industry collaborator has not successfully commercialized the invention as a product.\u201d\n\nMoreover, march-in rights would not necessarily lower drug prices. March-in rights do not empower the government to control prices \u2014 they only allow the NIH to increase competition by giving additional companies the right to utilize drug patents that were directly derived from the government-funded research. That accounts for less than 10 percent of new drugs approved by the FDA. And nothing guarantees that anyone would step up to undertake the risky and expensive process of developing and producing a competing drug \u2014 it costs $2.6 billion to introduce a new medicine, because 90 percent of drug candidates fail in clinical trials.\n\nEven if march-in powers could lower prices for this fraction of drugs, this congressional intervention risks chilling all drug development regardless of whether government funding played a direct role. Encouraging the government to seize patent rights in a non-emergency situation is a great way to discourage firms from developing and producing any new drugs.\n\nCongress\u2019 failed political ploy asking NIH to employ march-in rights to control drug prices disregarded the spirit of the law, the best judgment of NIH officials and the interests of patients. Thankfully, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell understood the purpose of the law.
