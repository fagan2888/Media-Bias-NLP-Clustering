(WLFI) \u2013 A National Science Federation grant is giving some Indiana teachers the means to get students excited about being active and learning about technology.\n\nThe $1.2 million grant goes toward the Teaching Engineering Concepts to Harness Future Innovators and Technologists program, otherwise known as TECHFIT.\n\nThe weeklong program brings teachers from four Indiana schools to Purdue University. They each learn how to assemble circuits and wires for active games they developed.\n\nMatt Moyer, from Bremen Elementary and Middle School, helped create the game \u201cLight Speed.\u201d The game kept people on their toes, jumping between flashing lights and hitting a sensor button.\n\nMoyer said the program can engage students and show them how they can apply what they learn now to life in the real world.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re teaching, you should care about students. And part of caring about students is preparing them for the real world, and that\u2019s what this program does,\u201d said Moyer.\n\nThe teachers will take their knowledge to students who will participate in a 10-week after-school program this fall. The students will make their own games, eventually taking them to a competition against others Indiana schools at the end of the program.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.
