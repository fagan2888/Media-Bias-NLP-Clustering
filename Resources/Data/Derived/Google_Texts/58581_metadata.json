The penalty for the offense is up to five years in prison and a potential $10,000 fine.\n\nA press release from the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said that testing revealed that there was enough heroin for 30 to 40 hits to get high; if taken at the same time, the dosing could have been fatal.\n\n\u201cI want to commend my staff who remain vigilant in our efforts to keep drugs out,\u201d Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Neil said in a statement. \u201cCriminals are determined, but so are we.\u201d\n\n(H/T: Christian Post)\n\n\u2013\n\nFront page image via Shutterstock.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "When prison authorities in Ohio discovered a mysterious stain on page 420 of a Bible that was sent to an inmate last month, they instantly became suspicious.
