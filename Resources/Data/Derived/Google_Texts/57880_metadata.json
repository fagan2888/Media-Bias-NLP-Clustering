Wade ruling in 1973 overturned hundreds of laws in states across the country, more than 55 million unborn children have lost their lives to abortion \u2014 about one-third of the millennial generation.\n\nBut after that January decision, the pro-life movement was born.\n\nAs Americans United for Life puts it, the pro-life movement desires a nation in which \u201ceveryone is welcomed in life and protected in law.\u201d\n\nThis week, hundreds of thousands of Americans will make the pilgrimage to the March for Life in Washington, D.C., to mark and protest the havoc of Roe v. Wade.\n\nSince pro-life warrior Nellie Gray started the March, this annual event has rallied Americans and exposed the brutality of the procedure.\n\nIt\u2019s disturbing that, for more than four decades, our nation has been complicit in this gross violation of human rights. With the advent of the ultrasound and improved prenatal care, science has shown in vivid detail the life inside of a mother. As a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, I\u2019m excited as each new innovation confirms what everyone knows in their hearts about the unborn.\n\nBut abortion doesn\u2019t claim only the unborn as its victim.\n\nWe cannot overlook the untold toll the horror of abortion has taken on women exploited by the big abortion industry \u2014 an industry propped up by taxpayer dollars. In graphic detail, we have heard how Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia exploited women and carried out gruesome abortions in disgusting conditions \u2014 killing one woman and forever wounding countless others.\n\nBut as Susan B. Anthony List has shown, Kermit Gosnell is not an outlier.\n\nFrom Maryland and Delaware to Texas and Arizona, the violations against women are countless.\n\nIn Illinois in 2012, Tonya Reaves, a healthy 24-year-old, died of a hemorrhage following a botched abortion at a Planned Parenthood clinic. Reports indicate that the clinic ignored instructions by an emergency dispatcher to call 9-1-1. Planned Parenthood\u2019s fear of bad press outweighed their concern for the woman it had harmed.\n\nThat same year, Planned Parenthood, which has more than $1 billion in assets, performed more than 327,000 abortion \u2014 one of every four carried out nationwide. And for every one adoption referral, Planned Parenthood performed 149 abortions.\n\nFor an organization that claims to provide healthcare and choice to women, it\u2019s disturbing that most pregnant women who walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic walk out with an abortion. It seems referring a young mother to an adoption agency does not bring in a dime, while abortions account for nearly 40 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s profits. At several hundred dollars apiece, abortion is the lucrative backbone of the industry.\n\nYet, each year the United States forks over more than half a billion dollars to the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider. No taxpayer should be forced to pay for abortions, or aid any organization that performs them.\n\nThe late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) agreed. His amendment barred the use of federal funds for abortions. Congress has reaffirmed this amendment repeatedly, but we must ensure this principle extends over all areas of the federal government.\n\nThat\u2019s why we need to pass bills like H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, a bill I have co-sponsored which would make the Hyde Amendment permanent and government-wide and would stop funding insurance coverage of abortion in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNo one should be coerced into paying for a procedure that ends the lives of millions of children each year.\n\nThose who disagree often say that there is no other way \u2014 that providing cheap, government-funded abortions is the only option to address unwanted, unloved and un-cared for children.\n\nBut there are alternatives to abortion, like adoption \u2014 the theme of this year\u2019s March.\n\nThere are many organizations, like Care Net, Heartbeat International and Catholic Charities, willing to serve these women and help them give their baby a home \u2014 even if they can\u2019t provide one themselves. For millions of women who have felt trapped and ashamed, compassionate counseling and meeting the material needs of these women have helped them reconsider, saving countless lives.\n\nWhen we tell one another that abortion is okay, we reinforce the idea that human lives are disposable, that we can throw away anything or anyone that inconveniences us.\n\nNeither women nor their unborn children are disposable.\n\nBoth lives are sacred.\n\nBoth deserve better than abortion.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Since the Supreme Court\u2019s sweeping Roe v.
