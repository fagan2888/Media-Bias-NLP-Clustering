My question, for journalists who read this: What is the proper cultural label for the speaker? I will ID the speaker at the end.\n\nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve had the privilege of speaking at college campuses across the country. ... A few weeks ago, I was one of five people honored with honorary doctorates by The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. For those of you unfamiliar with the school, it\u2019s affiliated with the Episcopal Church and it\u2019s one of the top liberal arts colleges in the country.\n\nOutwardly, everything about Sewanee cries \u201ctradition\u201d -- the buildings, the beautiful 13,000-acre setting in the Cumberland Mountains and the convocation at which I addressed the student body. But politically and theologically, it\u2019s fair to say that Sewanee is better described as \u201cprogressive.\u201d ...\n\nIn my convocation address I said that there is a move afoot on campuses \u201cto marginalize and even to demonize voices of traditional and historic Christian faith ... and that this is troubling ... because to think we can have real and enduring freedom and real liberal education without robust voices of faith ignores history.\u201d What\u2019s more, these expressions of faith cannot be limited to the private sphere -- they must circulate in the free marketplace of ideas. ...\n\nI urged students to \u201clisten respectfully\u201d to those with whom they disagree, because \u201cThis is at the heart of liberal education and it's at the heart of democracy and freedom.\u201d\n\nAt the time I thought it went rather well. But then I read an opinion piece published in the student newspaper. It called my speech \u201cone of the most offensive and disgusting\u201d the writer had ever witnessed.\n\nSo, journalists, what happened? He spoke in favor of religious liberty (no scare quotes), of the free exercise of religious faith in the public square.\n\nThe student op-ed continued:\n\nIt said that, \u201cBeneath a thin veneer of reason and civil discourse,\u201d I \u201ccontinued to push [my] evangelical agenda.\u201d\n\nAccording to the writer, the response to my address in the audience was \u201cshock\u201d and \u201cdismay.\u201d Now the newspaper printed this without linking to my actual speech or even writing an article about the speech.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t only that writer. One of the clergymen on campus wrote me and told me while he was in \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d with what I said, some of his parishioners were \u201cincensed,\u201d even though they could not tell him why they felt that way.\n\nTrying to get to the bottom of it, the clergyman checked with one of the other people honored, the great N.T. Wright, who told him that he found my remarks \u201cquite unobjectionable.\u201d ...\n\nIt would be disingenuous for me to claim that I was completely surprised by the negative reaction. Not because I set out to offend anyone, but because small \u201co\u201d orthodoxy itself is increasingly offensive in some religious circles. But no one seemed to be able to say what in the speech bothered them. They just flat out were offended.\n\nAnd the speaker? Read the commentary here. And you can read the actual speech here.\n\nHowever, if you had to label the content of his remarks, what label would fit? Historically? How about in these troubled \"culture war\" times?", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the big ideas here at GetReligion is that we live in an age in which \r\nmany of our comfortable journalistic labels are becoming more and more \r\nirrelevant.
