The museum\u2019s mission statement assures museumgoers that it is \u201ccommitted to advancing knowledge and understanding of the Native cultures of the Western Hemisphere.\u201d But visitors say the museum can make it confusing to do just that.\n\n\u201cThe layout of the museum is very confusing\u2014so far all I\u2019ve seen is a bunch of gift shops,\u201d says Preston Jones, a Navajo visiting from New Mexico.\n\nIndeed, upon entering the museum, visitors immediately see a booth selling what appears to be indigenous jewelry and relics. The majority of the first floor is devoted to a large \u201cmarketplace\u201d area where visitors can buy various souvenirs. \u201cFrustrating\u2014a bunch of t-shirts and patterns\u2014I see nothing of culture; what are they going to do, give a tour of the gift shop?\u201d says Jones.\n\nOne of the first informational displays a visitor sees is a large pillar inviting people to learn about treaties. However, a small display with the question \u201care treaties bad or good for American Indians?\u201d features two large cartoons poking fun at the subject. While there is nothing wrong with a little humor, the fact that this is one of the first displays a visitor will see combined with the gift shops may suggest to visitors that the museum is putting merchandise sales first, and making light of a serious and often misunderstood topic.\n\nSeveral people of all backgrounds near an exhibit on the Dakota War of 1862 agree that the museum can be confused in the stories it attempts to tell. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear why all this happened, all the brutality,\u201d says Detlef Reineke, visiting from Germany. His wife, Heidi, who is originally from Minnesota, echoes his statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical if we are getting both sides of the story. My question, are both sides being portrayed accurately?\u201d\n\nPatrick Kipepassah, a Taos Pueblo member visiting the museum from New Mexico with his wife and young son, wonders the same. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not telling the whole story, but I see that everywhere, which can make me feel very upset and emotional,\u201d said Kipepassah.\n\nThe museum would indeed benefit from better explanations of these important events. Jack Shuler, an English professor at Denison University who was visiting with his young family from Ohio, agrees that \u201cthere should be much more \u2018hand-holding\u2019 in these presentations because people often don\u2019t understand what happened to the Native Americans.\u201d\n\nMany sections of the museum have this problem of being unclear in what they are trying to accomplish. In a theater shaped like a Sweat Lodge, complete with hi-def sweat rocks, a 13-minute film on the \u201ccontemporary life of the modern Native American\u201d was particularly foggy; the film would introduce tribes with no explanation of them or their culture, spend a minute or so on them, and move on.\n\nDifferent native languages were heard throughout the film, speaking about different cultural practices, but viewers did not hear any translations or explanations. Nearly a dozen young children in attendance were heard continually asking \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d or \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d This youthful inquisition is reflective of the museum\u2019s general inability to paint an accurate and clear portrayal of 567 federally recognized American Indian cultures.\n\nLyle Jacobs, Oglala Lakota, wrote this piece for the newsroom immersion program for student journalists at the Native American Journalists Association\u2019s annual conference in Alexandria, Virginia.
