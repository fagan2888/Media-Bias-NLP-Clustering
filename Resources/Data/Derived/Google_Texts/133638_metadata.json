(UNH) disclosed major losses on policies it had offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. Nor was the country\u2019s largest health insurer alone; competitors including Aetna Inc., Humana Inc. and Cigna Corp. have described the difficulties they face in attempting to make exchange-based offerings profitable.\n\nSo it is no surprise that UnitedHealth announced that it would reduce its exchange offerings for 2017. What did surprise at least some observers was the scale of the decision. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company will reduce its offerings from 34 states this year to \u201conly a handful\u201d going forward. In the same conference call, UnitedHealth steepened its projected losses on exchange plans for 2016 to $650 million. In contrast, the company\u2019s overall earnings for the first quarter were better than expected.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down. UnitedHealth is making money in its employer-sponsored health insurance business. It is making money in its government-paid, nonexchange health insurance business. It is making money from individual health insurance policies sold outside the Affordable Care Act exchanges. But it is losing money hand over hypodermic on policies sold through the Obamacare exchange network. How come?\n\nSimply because customers on the exchanges tend to buy insurance when they are sick and drop it if they get getter. They do so knowing that under Obamacare rules, insurers must sell them insurance again during the next open enrollment period, or even sooner if they qualify for a special exemption. You could not design a better system for making medical insurance a money-losing proposition if you tried.\n\nAs they say in the insurance business, \u201csickies never cancel.\u201d Healthy customers, on the other hand, drop off as premiums rise out of reach and deductibles continue to climb, safe in the knowledge that they can always come back if their health takes a turn for the worse.\n\nThe cycle only reinforces itself over time. As more healthy customers leave, companies raise prices to try to compensate, driving yet more customers away. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have stable ACA markets,\u201d Todd Van Tol, a partner with Oliver Wyman, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIndications are, we have in many markets another round of significant rate increases.\u201d\n\nThis instability is also reflected in the industry\u2019s consolidation. Several major insurers are currently seeking federal permission to merge, which could leave customers with effectively fewer choices even in places where companies do not quit the exchanges altogether.\n\nNot that customers are flush with choice now. According to the Journal\u2019s coverage, UnitedHealth withdrawing its offerings will leave many Americans with very few options on the exchanges. In some parts of the country, especially the rural South, customers may only have one \u201cchoice\u201d on their state exchange unless a new company decides to fill the hole that UnitedHealth leaves.\n\nIt is hard to imagine which company might step into the breach, however. Other big insurers are already struggling to manage their own offerings on the exchanges. And the small nonprofit co-ops, which were designed to offer cheaper insurance than their private sector counterparts, are already dying off at a rapid clip.\n\nEven before UnitedHealth\u2019s decision to reduce its exchange offerings, many Americans are simply choosing to do without insurance altogether. Many young and healthy customers simply cannot make the cost-benefit trade-off work as insurance costs continue to mount, especially when they know insurers will have to accept them later and the penalties for not purchasing insurance remain significantly cheaper than the cost of insurance itself. Try to get a year\u2019s worth of coverage for $2,085 anywhere in the country and see how far you get. Between premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, the answer will vary from \u201cnot very far\u201d to \u201cnowhere.\u201d\n\nOther major insurers seem likely to hold on at least through 2017, but UnitedHealth will certainly not be the last major departure for the exchanges in the long run. The very structure of the Affordable Care Act made the failure of the exchanges inevitable. Until lawmakers tackle some sort of solution, there is not much to do other than watch the dominoes fall.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "healthcare, obamacare, UNH, UnitedHealth stock", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.1", "og": {"site_name": "Wall Street Pit", "description": "Is losing money hand over hypodermic on policies sold through the Obamacare exchange network.
