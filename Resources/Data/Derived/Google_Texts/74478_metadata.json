Bush\u2019s war on terrorism, as a form of torture.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as political correctness when you\u2019re fighting an enemy who wants to destroy you and everything that you have anything to do with,\u201d Mr. Carson told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m not one who is real big on telling the enemy what we\u2019re going to do and what we\u2019re not going to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson said the U.S. needs to increase its surveillance of areas where radicalization can develop, whether it is in a mosque, shopping center or elsewhere.\n\nHe also declined to say whether a person on a terrorism watch list should be allowed to buy a gun. Instead, he focused on the difficulty that some people have getting off those lists, and whether it robs them of their constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people on that watch list and they have no idea why they\u2019re on that list and they\u2019ve been trying to get their names off of it and no one will give them information,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I am a big supporter of the Second Amendment, and I don\u2019t want to deprive people unnecessarily of that. There needs to be better due process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson declined to say Sunday whether he would bring back waterboarding as part of the fight against terrorism, saying it's never a good idea to let the enemy know what you're going to do.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ben Carson declined to say Sunday whether he would bring back waterboarding as part of the fight against terrorism, saying it\u2019s never a good idea to let the enemy know what you\u2019re going to do.", "title": "Ben Carson, GOP presidential candidate, coy on water-boarding, doesn\u2019t want to tip his hand", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/ben-carson-gop-presidential-candidate-coy-on-water/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/21/GOP_2016_Carson.JPEG-01ee8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/21/GOP_2016_Carson.JPEG-01ee8.jpg", "description": "Ben Carson declined to say Sunday whether he would bring back waterboarding as part of the fight against terrorism, saying it's never a good idea to let the enemy know what you're going to do.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Carson, GOP presidential candidate, coy on water-boarding, doesn"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Ben Carson"}, "article_summary": "He also declined to say whether a person on a terrorism watch list should be allowed to buy a gun.\nMany have decried waterboarding, used during President George W.
