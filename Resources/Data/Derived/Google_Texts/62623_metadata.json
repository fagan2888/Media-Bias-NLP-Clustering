It\u2019s contained in a silver box engraved by a British-Moroccan artist named Yahya. Its website mentions the group in the same sentence as Warhol. It will soon make appearances at museums around the world, where, after a security pat-down, fans and critics alike may listen to it one at a time, before\u2014and this is the important part\u2014the only copy will be auctioned off, secreted in the home of its super-wealthy new owner, and kept insulated from the prying ears of the masses. The concept of auctioning off a single copy of an album sounds bizarre (after all, don't they want people to hear their music?), but that\u2019s what the Wu-Tang Clan is doing, and the group has reportedly already received a bid of $5 million. A statement on the album\u2019s sleek website says the plan is patterned on a \u201c400 year old [sic] Renaissance-style approach to music,\u201d one in which a wealthy patron commissions a one-of-a-kind piece of private artwork.\n\nThe patronage model, of course, cuts a sizable (and sometimes entitled) group out of the deal: fans. Already, two outraged yet committed Wu-Tang fans have launched a Kickstarter project to match the bid of $5 million (they have not yet broken $20,000), in hopes that \u201cthe rest of us get to enjoy an epic album instead of some uber-rich bastard keeping it to himself like a collector's item.\u201d One man\u2019s patron, it seems, is another man\u2019s uber-rich bastard. The (very) limited release of Shaolin has led to conversations about music\u2019s value in the digital era\u2014conversations, it should be noted, that masquerade as debates but really boil down to people uniformly arguing that others should make a point of paying for music. Digital holdouts like Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke have complained about the devaluation of music at the hands of streaming services like Spotify and Rhapsody, and this album\u2019s single-unit sale is an attempt\u2014however high-minded and quixotic it may be\u2014to restore music\u2019s lost import. \u201cOne leak,\u201d as the album\u2019s producer, Tarik Azzougarh (aka Cilvaringz), puts it, \u201cnullifies the entire concept.\u201d (Azzougarh recently hosted a Forbes reporter in Morocco, allowing him to record and distribute 51 seconds of the album, which, theoretically, might amount to about $50,000 worth of music.) In the coverage of all this, though, Azzougarh\u2019s own background\u2014he\u2019s studied music management and entertainment law\u2014has taken a back seat to the brazenness of the sales concept. Shaolin may seem like some half-baked one-off, but in fact, Azzougarh claims on the album\u2019s website, its release marks the launch of what he calls \u201cthe world\u2019s first private music service.\u201d While such a service could conceivably devolve into an Uber for music, allowing the wealthy to frivolously commission private albums as they please, Azzougarh is hoping it might \u201csave the music album from dying.\u201d The question of whether the private-service model is at all sustainable remains to be answered. Syd Schwartz, founder of the digital marketing and strategy firm Linchpin Digital, points out that this concept is only available to well-established artists. \u201cThe Wu-Tang Clan has 20-plus years of multi-platinum success behind them,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout that, this wouldn\u2019t even be a conversation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Right now, that&#39;s the plan, but fans are outraged that the group has agreed to accommodate the requests of its Renaissance-style patron.", "author": "Joe Pinsker", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Right now, that&#39;s the plan, but fans are outraged that the group has agreed to accommodate the requests of its Renaissance-style patron.", "title": "Should Wu-Tang Sell Its Album to One Man for $5 Million?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/RTXYMD0/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/for-5-million-one-person-will-get-to-own-the-only-copy-of-the-new-wu-tang-album/371020/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Everything about acclaimed rap group the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s upcoming album \"Once Upon a Time In Shaolin\" sounds like a publicity stunt.\n), but that\u2019s what the Wu-Tang Clan is doing, and the group has reportedly already received a bid of $5 million.\nThe concept of auctioning off a single copy of an album sounds bizarre (after all, don't they want people to hear their music?\nRight now, that's the plan, but fans are outraged that the group has agreed to accommodate the requests of its Renaissance-style patron.\n\u201cThe Wu-Tang Clan has 20-plus years of multi-platinum success behind them,\u201d he says."}
