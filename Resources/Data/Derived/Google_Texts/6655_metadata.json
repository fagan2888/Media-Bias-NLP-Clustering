The Ventura base now has over 20 physicians providing round the clock health coverage for children between the approximate ages of 13 and 17 housed there, according to the Ventura County website.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBetween the Ventura base, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas and Fort Sill, Oklahoma, approximately 2,300 children are being housed according to a June 24 Military Times article quoting Defense Department spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas Crosson. U.S. Rep Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) was denied access to the Fort Sill facility on July 2. Meanwhile, some members of Congress visited the Ventura base on June 12, and the San Antonio-Lackland base has suddenly granted access to Congress for a visit Tuesday.\n\nCongressman Bridenstine released an email he sent to HHS Deputy Director of the Office of Public Affairs, Ken Wolfe, that stated, \u201cAs a Navy pilot, I have been involved in operations countering illicit human trafficking. I would like to know to whom these children are being released.\u201d\n\nVentura County\u2019s website states that 70 of the 210 children in their facility have been released to either U.S. sponsors or family until their appointed immigration court hearings. The site suggests that community members desiring to make donations for the children make their contributions to Southwest Key due to staffing and security issues that are said to make donating directly to the base difficult.\n\nIn a Powerpoint presentation proposal to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors regarding the illegal alien minors, the Ventura County Health Care Agency (VCHCA) and Human Services Agency reported on the county\u2019s participation in the emergency situation, according to a letter from two of the Board members. The presentation is entitled, \u201cMedical Services for Central American Immigrants.\u201d Mostly pictorial, the report slide-by-slide reads, \u201c2,000+ Mile Journey,\u201d \u201cChildren Aged 3-17 Years Old on a Four to Six Month Journey,\u201d \u201cAn Unprecedented Need (picture notes projected influx of 90,126 minors from Central America in 2014, 142,000 in 2015),\u201d \u201cImmediate Housing in Texas (Breitbart Texas released photo of young men housed in Texas detention facilities),\u201d \u201cFormer Naval Seabee Deployment Center; 575 Capacity,\u201d \u201cTexas to Ventura,\u201d \u201cHealth Care Agency Participation,\u201d \u201cA Safe, Clean and Organized Shelter,\u201d \u201cOne-Hour of Exercise Daily,\u201d \u201cExpanding the Mission of VCHCA,\u201d and a final slide that reads, \u201cFor Donations: https://www.swkey.org/donate Questions? Thank You!\u201d\n\nAccording to the Southwest Key website, \u201cSouthwest Key\u2019s system of shelters for unaccompanied immigrant minors are funded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in the Administration of Children and Families under the Department of Health and Human Services.\u201d\n\nIn June, public outrage squelched a permit proposal for a Southwest Key illegal alien detention facility to be established in Escondido, California. An estimated 500 people showed up to address the proposal, most to oppose it, including Escondido Mayor Sam Abed and a staff member from U.S. Rep Duncan Hunter (R-CA) office there on his behalf.\n\nCongressman Hunter posted a letter online, which was addressed to Mayor Abed and requested denial of the Health and Human Services permit application, listing annual costs of running the facility at $6-7 million and stating, \u201cThe solution must involve changes to the [Obama] Administration\u2019s underlying immigration policies and a commitment to return the children to their homes as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n$457,947,289 in taxpayer money has been awarded in HHS government grants to Southwest Key, mostly for programs and services dedicated to unaccompanied alien children according to amounts tracked through TAGGS.\n\nSouthwest Key\u2019s site currently lists \u201cimmediate hiring in Ventura, CA.\u201d All job openings posted are listed as temporary. The following are names and numbers of positions posted: Youth Care Workers (275), Youth Care Workers\u2013Transportation (60), Case Aides (75), Case Managers (25), Clinicians (16), Housekeeping/Laundry Workers (4), Human Resources Generalist (1), AP Clerk (1).\n\nWhile the Ventura facility currently lists jobs as temporary, the Southwest Key lease connected to HHS in Escondido was for a five-year period with an option to extend to fifteen years. There is no assurance that plans in Ventura would remain temporary and not involve securing a more permanent facility to operate out of.\n\nThe entire listing of Southwest Key programs currently reports multiple locations in each of six states across the country, including: Wisconsin, New York, Georgia, Texas, Arizona and California. Listings for the specific Unaccompanied Minors Shelter Program include: in Texas\u2013Canutillo, Clint, Conroe, El Paso, Glendale, Houston (2 listings) and San Antonio; in California\u2013El Cajon, Lemon Grove and Pleasant Hill; and in Arizona\u2013Phoenix.", "article_metadata": {"description": "20 Doctors On 24/7 for Alien Kids at Ventura Naval Base", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "20 Doctors On 24/7 for Alien Kids at Ventura Naval Base", "title": "20 Doctors On 24/7 for Alien Kids at Ventura Naval Base - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/border-patrol-child-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/07/07/20-physicians-on-24-7-for-unaccompanied-alien-minors-at-ventura-naval-base/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "20 Doctors On 24/7 for Alien Kids at Ventura Naval Base", "title": "20 Doctors On 24/7 for Alien Kids at Ventura Naval Base - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/border-patrol-child-ap.jpg", "creator": "@michellediana", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Human Trafficking, Jim Bridenstine,Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-07-07T05:53:00-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Jim Bridenstine", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb67\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, some members of Congress visited the Ventura base on June 12, and the San Antonio-Lackland base has suddenly granted access to Congress for a visit Tuesday.\nThe Ventura base now has over 20 physicians providing round the clock health coverage for children between the approximate ages of 13 and 17 housed there, according to the Ventura County website.\nWhile the Ventura facility currently lists jobs as temporary, the Southwest Key lease connected to HHS in Escondido was for a five-year period with an option to extend to fifteen years.\nThe entire listing of Southwest Key programs currently reports multiple locations in each of six states across the country, including: Wisconsin, New York, Georgia, Texas, Arizona and California.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBetween the Ventura base, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas and Fort Sill, Oklahoma, approximately 2,300 children are being housed according to a June 24 Military Times article quoting Defense Department spokesman Air Force Lt.
