No room. We called Queen\u2019s Medical Center. No room. We called Straub Hospital. No room. Four days later, she needed to be medivaced to Oahu as an emergency medical, forcing Straub to find a room where she could be admitted.\u201d\n\nNaka\u2018ahiki said there might be three hospitals on Kauai, but they each have different specialties.\n\n\u201cAt KVMH, our mission is to treat and stabilize,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce stable, we send patients off to the bigger hospitals like Wilcox Hospital, Queen\u2019s, or Straub.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s picketing started out with about three dozen people and quickly swelled to almost twice the amount as people got off work. Jose Bulatao, a Kekaha resident, said it was a grassroots effort to rally people to contact their lawmakers and request that full funding be restored to both KVMH and the Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, there was a reduction in funding and the resulting staff cuts,\u201d Bulatao said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to reach the public at large, but the basic reaction to the funding cuts and staff reduction is a lot of apprehension. Whatever it takes \u2014 we must save KVMH, the one hospital that covers the area from Kalaheo to the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Mana.\u201d\n\nNani Fukino, whose husband Dr. Wayne Fukino works at KVMH, said Hawaii Health Systems Corp. did not get the funding it needed for the 2015 biennium budget.\n\n\u201cThe biennium budget means the state won\u2019t look at the budget until 2017,\u201d Fukino said. \u201cWe did not get what we needed from the Legislature in 2015, and we won\u2019t be getting anything in 2016. I\u2019m afraid that if there is no funding (in the 2017 budget), it\u2019s going to be hard to keep the doors open. You know, if you don\u2019t pay the utility bills, they shut you off.\u201d\n\nRep. Dee Morikawa said she was made aware of this situation by Dr. Fukino.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sit on the finance committee, but I did hear that if HHSC got the funding they requested in the budget, they might still need to cut the number of beds, but not services,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Maui hospital issue has not been settled, and we don\u2019t know the financial impact that will have with paying off employees. I have been told that KVMH will be OK if they get the same allotment as last year since they have already done the reduction in force. There may still need to be a few adjustments.\u201d\n\nMorikawa said the Legislature is far from a final budget.\n\nFukino said she heard Gov. David Ige is signing for a $22 million infusion for HHSC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this rallying to show the governor that everything is not alright in regards to KVMH and Mahelona Hospital,\u201d Fukino said. \u201cIf there is no infusion of funds, the hospitals are going to eventually have to stop services.\u201d\n\nWilliam \u201cBill\u201d Wilcox and Stacie Aguinaldo are emergency room nurses at KVMH, and said things have been hard since the funding cuts and RIF.\n\n\u201cWe tried to reduce staff,\u201d Aguinaldo said. \u201cThat led to chaos. Right now, we\u2019re running on a skeleton crew which results in poor patient care. We are a 5-star hospital based on patient response surveys.\u201d\n\nWilcox said he\u2019s never seen conditions as bad as it is.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there for eight years,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cThey have a hard time finding funds to pay vendors for supplies and services. This is about safety.\u201d\n\nBailey Taeza, a Waimea High School student, and her brother Keoua Taeza were among the picketers.\n\n\u201cWe need KVMH because it is the only hospital on the Westside to care for our families,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWe need to keep it open. It\u2019s up to us to come together and save it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Thegardenisland.com", "description": "WAIMEA \u2014 Can you imagine a Kauai with just one hospital, said Eileen Naka\u2018ahiki Friday afternoon in Waimea.", "title": "\u2018Save KVMH\u2019", "url": "http://thegardenisland.com/news/local/save-kvmh/article_10a09788-a5cb-54b6-87ab-cd5c30e21cd3.html", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thegardenisland.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/12/e12360c6-317d-5d0f-acb5-c4b4fb22ddfc/56bec351d9323.image.jpg?crop=490%2C488%2C13%2C3&resize=490%2C488&order=crop%2Cresize", "height": 488}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thegardenisland", "card": "summary"}, "description": "WAIMEA \u2014 Can you imagine a Kauai with just one hospital, said Eileen Naka\u2018ahiki Friday afternoon in Waimea.", "fb": {"app_id": 568091426540910}, "keywords": "#topstory,local", "news_keywords": "#topstory,local"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7d5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe need KVMH because it is the only hospital on the Westside to care for our families,\u201d Bailey said.\n\u201cFour days ago, my sister-in-law needed to be admitted, and we called Wilcox Hospital.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this rallying to show the governor that everything is not alright in regards to KVMH and Mahelona Hospital,\u201d Fukino said.\n\u201cWe did not get what we needed from the Legislature in 2015, and we won\u2019t be getting anything in 2016.\nThis is about safety.\u201dBailey Taeza, a Waimea High School student, and her brother Keoua Taeza were among the picketers."}
