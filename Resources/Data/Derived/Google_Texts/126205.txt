A man was killed early Friday after he unsuccessfully tried to stop a car thief.

The employee of an automobile business saw the thief and tried to stop him; the thief ran over the employee with the stolen SUV, police said.

Officials on Friday were searching for the suspect and the vehicle.

The victim was taken to a Denver hospital for treatment but was later pronounced dead, said Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson.

The theft happened at a business near the intersection of West Alameda Avenue and South Hazel Court at around 4 a.m., Jackson said.

The victim apparently spotted the suspect in the SUV and tried to stop him, he said. The suspect drove into the employee, injuring him, Jackson said.

“We’re investigating it as a homicide case at this time,” he said.

Police set up a perimeter around the business and searched for the suspect for a few hours, Jackson said.

The Denver Medical Examiner’s Office is attempting to identify the victim, Jackson said.

Police do not have a good description of the suspect.
