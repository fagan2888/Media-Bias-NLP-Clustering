His argument? Cuba hasn't engaged in terror sponsorship in six months, so they've been taken off.\n\nIn his report to Congress, Obama certified that \u201cthe government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period,\u201d and \u201chas provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama's given reason to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism is something: pic.twitter.com/E7COe1o6vC \u2014 Doug Powers (@ThePowersThatBe) April 15, 2015\n\nNever mind the decades of terror sponsorship from the communist state. What about activity from seven months ago, does that count?\n\nAs I noted yesterday, Cuba is in fact still a state sponsor of terror and its allies are enemies of the United States. One of those enemies is Iran, the world's biggest sponsor of terrorism against the U.S. and Israel around the world through Hezbollah and Hamas. More from the Center for Security Policy:\n\nIran, Cuba and Venezuela have developed a close and cooperative relationship against the U.S. and in support of terrorist groups and states. The three regimes increasingly coordinate their policies and resources in a three way partnership aimed at counteracting and circumventing U.S. policies in the Middle East and Latin America. Within this relationship, Cuba plays a strategic role in terms of geography (proximity to the U.S.), intelligence gathering (both electronic eavesdropping and human espionage) and logistics.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has once again chosen a far-left legacy over U.S. national security.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legacy. .05/26/2016 18:09:31PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Legacy.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Obama: Cuba Hasn't Been Involved in Sponsoring Terrorism For Six Months So They're Off The List Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/04/15/obama-cuba-hasnt-been-involved-in-terrorism-for-six-months-so-theyre-off-the-list-now-n1985507", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/104/2015-04-14T191205Z_1_LYNXMPEB3D0X3_RTROPTP_3_CNEWS-US-CUBA-USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Legacy.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Obama: Cuba Hasn't Been Involved in Sponsoring Terrorism For Six Months So They're Off The List Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/04/15/obama-cuba-hasnt-been-involved-in-terrorism-for-six-months-so-theyre-off-the-list-now-n1985507", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/104/2015-04-14T191205Z_1_LYNXMPEB3D0X3_RTROPTP_3_CNEWS-US-CUBA-USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama: Cuba Hasn't Been Involved in Sponsoring Terrorism For Six Months So They're Off The List Now, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Cuba hasn't engaged in terror sponsorship in six months, so they've been taken off.\nYesterday President Obama announced he was taking Cuba off of the state sponsor of terror list just shortly after meeting with dictator Raul Castro at a summit in Panama.\nAs I noted yesterday, Cuba is in fact still a state sponsor of terror and its allies are enemies of the United States.\nOne of those enemies is Iran, the world's biggest sponsor of terrorism against the U.S. and Israel around the world through Hezbollah and Hamas.\nWithin this relationship, Cuba plays a strategic role in terms of geography (proximity to the U.S.), intelligence gathering (both electronic eavesdropping and human espionage) and logistics."}
