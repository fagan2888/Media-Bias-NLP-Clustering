Eileen was a known artist at comic book shows and created a variety of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and superhero character artwork.\n\nThe duo had been married for just one year before Eileen was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, passing away at the young age of 45.\n\nDoyle hopes the journey will help him move past Eileen\u2019s passing on Nov. 7, 2012, telling ABC\u2019s San Diego affiliate KGTV, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve gotten to November 8. I\u2019ve been stuck on November 7.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to tests of endurance, Doyle has previously participated in charitable walks. In 2013, he completed a three-day, 60-mile walk while also dressed in stormtrooper apparel and in honor of Eileen.\n\n\u201cI can just hear her saying, \u2018You\u2019re such a dork,\u2019\u201d Doyle said. \u201cBut she\u2019s a self-proclaimed geek.\u201d\n\nHe started the 645-mile journey at a famous \u201cStar Wars\u201d museum just north of San Francisco in Petaluma, California on June 6.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for me to continue on with her dreams and wishes, to make a difference,\u201d Doyle told the Time Warriors in 2013. \u201cShe believed that she could make a difference, and I believe in her.\u201d\n\nFor his current West Coast walk, Doyle created an online Crowdrise page to raise money for Eileen\u2019s Little Angels, a charitable organization he created to give gift bags to children undergoing chemotherapy. In the final stages of getting the foundation off the ground, Doyle has to date raised $3,565 via the Crowdrise page.\n\n\u201cWith the money raised I will be able to create such things as a coloring book, bandanas, a blanket and plush toys \u2026 all featuring Eileen\u2019s artwork,\u201d Doyle wrote on the Crowdrise page. \u201cIt is my hope that this walk will help me to heal and give my life purpose by sharing Eileen\u2019s spirit through her artwork with children battling cancer.\u201d\n\nDoyle will also be teaming up with 501st Legion, a worldwide costuming organization Eileen was a member of prior to her passing, and the Minnesota Superheroes United to schedule visits to local children\u2019s hospitals. Doyle plans to sit down with children and teach them how to draw superheroes.\n\nWhile the journey to Comic-Con is for his wife, the journey back will be for Doyle and his healing process. The Golden Gate Bridge will serve as his finish line.\n\n\u201cI want this to be a cleansing,\u201d he told KGTV.\n\nDoyle is expected to make it to Comic-Con on July 9.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Talk about a walk to remember.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Talk about a walk to remember.", "title": "The Beautiful Reason He's Walking 645 Miles as Stormtrooper", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Kevin-Doyle.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-09T13:01:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1G7Ui08"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Talk about a walk to remember.", "title": "The Beautiful Reason He's Walking 645 Miles as Stormtrooper", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Kevin-Doyle.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage & Family", "published_time": "2015-07-09T09:17:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T13:01:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "stormtrooper, Kevin Doyle, west coast, Comic-Con, stormtrooper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc13\"", "article_summary": "Minnesota native Kevin Doyle is currently walking 645 miles down California\u2019s West Coast in full stormtrooper armor in his late wife Eileen\u2019s memory.\nEileen was a known artist at comic book shows and created a variety of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and superhero character artwork.\nDoyle and and Eileen, both artists, shared a passion for \u201cStar Wars\u201d.\nWhile the journey to Comic-Con is for his wife, the journey back will be for Doyle and his healing process.\nIn 2013, he completed a three-day, 60-mile walk while also dressed in stormtrooper apparel and in honor of Eileen."}
