But on Florida\u2019s Space Coast, the opposite is true: The county health department offers 100 percent coverage for pregnant women.\n\nHere, 21-year-old Briana Colson has just met with her obstetrician at the Brevard County Health Department. Ten days ago, she gave birth to twins.\n\n\u201cWe were trying, but we weren\u2019t trying for two,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nIn addition to taking care of 10-day-old twins, she also has to take care of herself. She didn\u2019t slow down and heal after birth, and her doctor loaded her up with a bag of peroxide, gauze and cotton swabs.\n\nWhen Colson found out she was pregnant, she was already 10 or 11 weeks along, so she wanted to get in to see a doctor quickly. And having twins is always a high-risk pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThey got me in quick, about a week,\u201d Colson said.\n\nHealth News Florida is highlighting details of its Pregnant and Poor investigation all week. See the series here.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason things were quick. Not so much a reason, but a person: Dr. Heidar Heshmati of Rockledge. And he\u2019s not shy bragging about the program he built 20 years ago. His name is on the building.\n\n\u201cOur prenatal care, I tell you that, is No. 1 in the United States,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nBrevard County\u2019s health department offers 100 percent coverage for pregnant women. That's right: 100 percent. Here, the safety net isn\u2019t a net at all, it\u2019s a floor.\n\n\u201cIt means any pregnant woman, it doesn\u2019t matter if they have money or not, if they are legally here or not, whatever. We are open to them,\u201d Heshmati said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only county where we have 100 percent coverage.\u201d\n\nHow? Well, Heshmati developed a formula, and it\u2019s brilliantly simple.\n\nIn Brevard County, almost every OB doctor is an employee of the health department. They get paid by the hour for seeing Medicaid and uninsured patients at the county health department and for delivering their babies. The whole maternity budget is $3.2 million.\n\nSince nearly all Medicaid patients are now enrolled in private managed-care plans, those plans pay Brevard DOH under contract to provide the care.\n\nAs government employees, the OB doctors can\u2019t be sued if a birth goes bad. So they can see high-risk patients without the worry of big, multimillion-dollar lawsuits or \u2013 just as likely \u2013 not getting paid for their services. They don\u2019t have to handle billing Medicaid. And they don\u2019t have to fight each other for Medicaid business.\n\nNow, the program isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s run a little shy of cash a few times and had to ask for money from Brevard County government. But by and large, the 20-year-old program is touted as a national model.\n\n\u201cIf everybody (were) doing that, the state of Florida will be the first state to have 100 percent coverage for the pregnant woman,\u201d Heshmati said.\n\nInstead, most county health departments in Florida do not offer prenatal care. And with a few exceptions, the ones that still offer it typically contract with one or two local obstetricians, not the majority of prenatal doctors in an area.\n\nSome have described Heshmati as a visionary, a prophet even. Four cabinets in the health department are packed with awards for the county\u2019s approach to prenatal care.\n\nBut Heshmati said he just saw what was happening in prenatal care in Florida and proposed a solution. He said what he saw on the Space Coast 20 years ago is now happening in the rest of the state.\n\nHeshmati rattles off the consequences:\n\n\u201cSo many patients without prenatal care,\u201d Heshmati said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where to go. They don\u2019t have money. No prenatal care. End up in hospital emergency room for delivery. Huge, huge malpractice.\u201d\n\nLike many people described as visionaries, Heshmati spends a lot of time preaching to other health departments. But he says others fail because the counties will take bits and pieces of the program, and not the whole concept.\n\nFor example, take the three Florida counties who added prenatal care to their health department in the past three years: Pasco, Bradford and Union Counties.\n\nAt the Bradford County Health Department in Starke, about an hour north of Gainesville, Jennifer Pruitt works as a certified nurse midwife for Gainesville OB-GYN. That private practice gets a rent-free room to see Medicaid patients once a week.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re really great, they give me a little cubby, so I have my own little cubicle and then we have our own exam room,\u201d Pruitt said, showing off the room where she sees pregnant patients.\n\nHere, they can do Doppler, listen to heart tones and draw lab work.\n\n\u201cI literally have a little command unit I bring with me,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201c[We can] even do post-partum birth control options.\u201d\n\nJoseph Pietrangelo is the administrator of the Bradford County Health Department. In this rural part of the state, most people work in agriculture, trucking, or for the prison system.\n\nHe said the women on Medicaid were having to travel to Gainesville for care, an impossible task for some of them. So he asked a private doctor to come from Gainesville to the county health department.\n\nHis big concern was what if everyone turned him down. He didn\u2019t have a backup plan.\n\n\u201cThe ideal situation would be to be big enough or rich enough to have an obstetrician on staff,\u201d Pietrangelo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not big enough, we couldn\u2019t provide the panel of patients to make that reasonable. And this is the next best thing.\u201d\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
