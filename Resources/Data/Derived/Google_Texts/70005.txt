First lady Michelle Obama announced in September that her “Let’s Move!” initiate had made “a cultural shift” in the way Americans “live and eat.” It now turns out that assertion was one of those “if you like your plan you can keep it” kind of statements — it had no basis in reality.

America’s eating habits are actually getting worse.

“Make no mistake about it. We are changing the conversation in this country,” Obama said at a Washington, D.C. elementary school, according to The Hill. “We are creating a cultural shift on how we live and eat. And our efforts are having an impact on our children’s lives.”

However, Gallup announced on Wednesday the results of a poll indicating that America’s eating habits have actually deteriorated each and every month of 2013 as compared to its corresponding month in 2012.

In September, when the first lady reported on the success of her program, 63.4 percent of respondents reported that they ate healthy all day long. That’s down from 67.6 percent during the same month in 2012. As the graph below indicates, the results were similar for every month of 2013.

And it gets worse. When the first lady launched “Let’s Move!” in February 2010, approximately 69 percent of Americans reported they ate healthy. In October, that percentage dropped to 64.5.

The late humorist and social commentator Will Rogers once said, “Never miss a good chance to shut up.” The first lady should have taken that advice when she announced the success of her program.
