Prosise ran for 143 yards and two touchdowns, and DeShone Kizer threw two scoring passes, the second the 10-yarder to Robinson that made it 38-31. It was the first touchdown of the season for Robinson, who dropped several passes in the loss at Clemson.\n\n\u201cI just had to step up when my number was called. Thank God I was able to step up for this team and contribute to our success,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe Irish (6-1) also added a touchdown by former USC player Amir Carlisle on a blocked punt.\n\nSouthern California played for the first time since firing coach Steve Sarkisian on Monday. USC coaches are now 0-7 in their first games against Notre Dame in South Bend with Clay Helton, who took over for Sarkisian, becoming the second straight interim coach to fall. Two years ago it was Ed Orgeron following the firing of Lane Kiffin. The Trojans have had four different coaches against the Irish the past four seasons.\n\n\u201cWe had great momentum going into the second half. And then, at the end of the day, mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense,\u201d Helton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have those mistakes.\u201d\n\nDeShone Kizer, who was 15 of 24 for 227 yards, said it was a big win for the Irish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge. To come out here and get a signature win like that against USC is big for us and for the season moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe victory looked in doubt when the Trojans (3-3) scored three straight touchdowns to take a 31-24 lead as the Trojans scored on a 75-yard catch by JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree Jackson scored on an 83-yard pass. But the Irish rallied to win the Jeweled Shillelagh for the third time in four seasons.\n\n\u201cIf you miss a tackle, those kids are gone,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey make you pay dearly, and we missed some tackles.\u201d\n\nIt marked the first time in seven tries the Irish beat the Trojans after losing by 30 or more the season before.\n\nCody Kessler threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score for USC, but the Irish picked him off two passes in the fourth quarter to put the game away.\n\nIn a game of shifting momentum, the Irish scored 40 points against the Trojans for the first time since 1977 when Norte Dame warmed up in blue jerseys, then came out in green jerseys and beat USC 49-19 en route to the national championship.\n\nThe Trojans lost consecutive games for the first time since losing three straight to end the 2012 season. USC has three losses this early in the season for the first time since starting 1-4 in Pete Carroll\u2019s first year as coach in 2001.\n\nThe loss also adds to the mounting troubles the Trojans are facing with a game next week against No. 4 Utah followed by a game at No. 23 California. USC athletic director Pat Haden, who spent 12 years as a color analyst on Notre Dame television broadcasts, was feeling lightheaded just before kickoff and was taken to the locker room. Haden made a stop at the hospital, then headed back to Los Angeles on a private plane.\n\nHaden has been under scrutiny for his hiring of Sarkisian and for allowing Sarkisian to continue to coach after slurring his words and using inappropriate language during an event in August and other struggles by the football team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you play a very good football team like that, and these guys have had so much this week and dealt with everything you could possibly think of, and I\u2019m so proud of them,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cThey put everything they had into that game. No one gave us a fighting chance and these guys came out and showed they had heart and were competitive, but at the end of the day there were too many mistakes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP College Football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "C.J.
