And yes, it exists.\n\nSo this is something that starts happening in an incumbent president\u2019s sixth year, especially after an electoral walloping like the one the Democrats just absorbed: The fissures start to show. Because the president is becoming a lame duck and minds are turning naturally toward the next presidential election, the moment is now for the heavyweights in the party to start defining it in post-Obama terms. And the big fight the Democrats are starting to have, and need to have, is about how to put themselves squarely on the side of the broad middle class.\n\nOf course, to someone who sees the world the way I do, it\u2019s comically pathetic that there\u2019s even a competition here. The Republicans are the party of the 1 percent. Oh, maybe the 5 percent on a good day. But really the 1 percent. No\u2014actually really, the .01 percent. That more people can\u2019t see this is, ah, well, a whole \u2019nother column really.\n\nBut in fact I think most people do see it\u2014they just don\u2019t mind it that much anymore. This is because 1) after 30 years of trickle-down agitprop, they\u2019ve come to accept that what\u2019s good for their bosses is good for them (because most people don\u2019t know, for example, that U.S. wages haven\u2019t really grown in those 30 years while for their bosses it\u2019s been a party practically without rival in recent human history), and 2) most folks would simply rather blame poor people for their problems because doing so requires a lot less connecting of dots and is thus a more comforting narrative for them.\n\nThis is the crucial point that Democrats often don\u2019t get. Democrats and liberals are inclined to say to themselves things like \u201cif only most Americans knew X\u201d\u2014X being, say, that George Bush\u2019s or Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan overwhelmingly benefits the rich\u2014\u201cwhy, we\u2019d have \u2019em on our side.\u201d But most Americans do know that, in their bones anyway. And they mind it, a little, but they don\u2019t mind it as much as some of what they see from the Democrats.\n\nHere, my conservative Beast colleague Lloyd Green is not entirely wrong to argue as he did Monday that a lot of middle-class people look at the two major domestic-policy matters the Democrats have placed before them\u2014the Affordable Care Act and Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration\u2014and see a party that is more interested in helping poor people, and even illegally arrived poor people, than it is in serving them.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was always a short-term political loser with respect to middle-class voters. Most of them have insurance, and only a small percentage face catastrophic illness. And you can explain why the individual mandate is a necessary leg of the three-legged stool until you\u2019re purple in the face and it won\u2019t get through to most voters. If it survives, it may start paying political dividends in a decade or so, when people have gotten used to it and it has increased the amount and type of preventive care insurance companies offer and made us a healthier society. It was the right thing to do for these and other reasons, but I don\u2019t think anyone, including Obama himself, thought it would be a big political winner in his era.\n\nDitto the immigration executive order. True, a solid majority backs the Democratic position on the substance. But the recent batch of polls shows Americans to be, what else, deeply split on whether Obama was right to do this by fiat. (I\u2019d love to know the percentage of Americans who are actually aware that the House could have spared us all this by passing the bill the Senate passed, which the country supports roughly two-to-one, at any point in the past 18 months; it\u2019s surely single digits.) So Obama is not getting pummeled on this one so far, but he\u2019s not winning it either. Again, the right thing to do, by my lights, but something that will be seen by the broader middle class as not really benefiting them.\n\nIn the coming months and up into 2016, Republicans will make sure these two programs stay front and center, because they of course know all this, and they\u2019ll want to paint the Democrats as only looking out for \u201cthose people.\u201d So the Democrats, as Chuck Schumer put it in his big speech last week, have to show the middle class that the party is firmly on its side. (I\u2019ll write another column soon about the \u201cdefend government\u201d part of Schumer\u2019s speech, which is something I\u2019ve been arguing for years.)\n\nThe problem is that the Democrats are more divided on the \u201chow\u201d of doing this than they are on any other single question. At least that\u2019s what we\u2019re told. But are they, really? So much is made of the Elizabeth Warren Wing vs. the centrists (they don\u2019t have a figurehead who can equal Warren in stature). And sure, there are differences. Trade is probably the biggest one, and the issue puts Democratic interest groups at each other\u2019s throats, although regular voters don\u2019t care much about trade policy. Whether to attack the deficit is another, but the deficit is going down, and by the way most voters don\u2019t care much about it either. Whether to give a little ground on entitlement reform is a third, and that admittedly is a big one that there is no way to finesse (except to raise the payroll tax cap, which is the most sensible approach and one the Democrats will come around to someday).\n\nBut on loads of economic issues, as Schumer suggested in his speech, virtually all Democrats agree\u2014minimum wage, student loans, workplace rules, infrastructure, a tighter link between productivity and wages are just a few of the things that all Democrats agree on and that, with the partial exception of the minimum wage, would benefit huge majorities of voters.\n\nI said \u201cpartial\u201d because a higher minimum wage, often thought of as helpful only to those at the very bottom, would have ripple effects for workers higher up the wage chain. In fact, this is a terrific case in point for the way in which the war between the Democrats\u2019 two economic wings can be greatly exaggerated. I have before me on my browser two recent studies on this question, one by the centrist Hamilton Project and the other by the more liberal Economic Policy Institute. Both give estimates of how many U.S. workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.\n\nOnly about 3.3 million Americans (pdf) earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour or less. The Hamilton paper estimates that an increase would benefit as many as 35 million workers, while EPI puts that number at more like 28 million. In other words, the sell-out centrists have a higher number than the unreconstructed lefties! At each others\u2019 throats!\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see. Now that Warren and centrist Mark Warner are both in the Democrats\u2019 Senate leadership ranks, I think the two of them should sit down and hammer out a Warren-Warner Middle-Class Compact that consists of 10 or however many major points that they know they can get everyone from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin to agree on (and of course they also need to be confident that Hillary Clinton will agree to most of them). Warren makes one clearly recognizable gesture to the center, and the centrists make one recognizable gesture to the left. But they agree. They have the stature and the position and the power to do so. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re friends, but they don\u2019t seem to be enemies; Warren helped raise money for Warner this year.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201412021045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Now that they\u2019re both in Senate leadership, Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner should hammer out an agenda they agree on.
