And in this year\u2019s U.S. Senate races, they aim to elevate the conversation beyond the \u201crepetitive\u201d rhetoric of their Republican and Democratic colleagues.\n\nIn typical election cycles, the focus falls on the eventual nominees of the two major political parties. This year\u2019s matchups in the midterm elections Nov. 4 are no different.\n\nHowever, also on ballots are third-party candidates looking to give voters another option when the status quo isn\u2019t cutting it.\n\n\u201cGive me the opportunity,\u201d David Patterson, a peace officer who is the Libertarian nominee for Senate in Kentucky, tells The Daily Signal in an interview. \u201cRepublican and Democratic leadership has failed. They have failed miserably. We\u2019re $17.5 trillion plus in debt. \u2026 They failed.\u201d\n\nPatterson is going up against Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican incumbent and Senate minority leader, who already is opposed by Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nWhy? He explains:\n\nThey\u2019ve had their opportunity and they\u2019re really, really squandered it away. I would say, don\u2019t feel like you have to pick the winning horse. Go and look at the issues. Look at the stances on the issues. If you still want to vote for them, there\u2019s no hard feelings. At least give me a look.\n\nPatterson balances campaigning with his regular job with the city of Harrodsburg, and it\u2019s no picnic.\n\nHis shift as a peace officer begins at 4 p.m. and ends at midnight. Then he winds down and gears up for campaigning. Until daylight, Patterson answers emails and responds to inquiries from voters.\n\nAround 7 a.m., the Senate hopeful meets with a friend and adviser for a morning jog; he typically runs two miles, three times a week. Other days, Patterson heads to meetings with tea party organizations and does interviews with the media. He\u2019ll meet with voters and organizations throughout Kentucky.\n\nThen it\u2019s to bed for several hours before the routine begins again at 4 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaotic,\u201d Patterson says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to do.\u201d\n\nAn Uphill Road\n\nCompared to Grimes and McConnell\u2019s campaigns, which rely on thousands of volunteers and large staffs, Patterson is backed by a force of just four people, not including his wife and two children: a campaign manager, press secretary, one adviser and one adviser/running buddy.\n\nThe group works for free. A few unofficial volunteers also go door-to-door, doing their part to get Patterson elected.\n\nSo far this election cycle, the two major parties have spent a total of $327.7 million.\n\nIn Kentucky, McConnell and Grimes rank among the top 10 Senate candidates in fundraising: the Republican incumbent has raked in $17 million, his challenger $11 million.\n\nAccording to the last campaign finance report, by contrast, Patterson hadn\u2019t raised anything.\n\nHis wife, Ashley, is ready for the race to be over.\n\nTo win control of the Senate on Nov. 4, Republicans must net six new seats. The New York Times gives the GOP a 68 percent chance of claiming the upper chamber.\n\nWith Election Day under two weeks away, the focus is turning toward races that are tightening up. Among them: North Carolina, where the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Kay Hagan has a mere one-point lead, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls.\n\nBut Republicans fear the Libertarian candidate, Sean Haugh, could take votes from Republican nominee Thom Tillis, tipping the election to Hagan.\n\nThe latest Public Policy Polling survey found Haugh capturing just 5 percent. Tillis, though, trailed Kagan by three percentage points.\n\n\u201cI was right all along,\u201d Haugh told The Daily Signal earlier this month. \u201cThe power of a third-party Libertarian candidate is such that if they want to win elections, Democrats and Republicans have to be more Libertarian and peaceful.\u201d\n\n\u2018Something to Say\u2019\n\nGeoffrey Skelley, associate editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, says the ability of third-party candidates to spoil elections often is exaggerated. In races where a candidate has a growing lead\u2013as in Kentucky\u2013a third candidate has little chance to influence the result.\n\nHowever, their power can be felt in tight matchups.\n\n\u201cIn any political candidacy, someone is going to run because they have something to say,\u201d Skelley tells The Daily Signal. \u201cFor independent and third-party candidates, a lot of time it\u2019s a pet issue or a group they want to focus on.\u201d\n\nIn its latest survey on the Kentucky race, the Rasmussen polling firm asked voters to pick who they would send to represent them in the Senate\u2013McConnell or Grimes. Patterson wasn\u2019t listed as an option.\n\nA Fox News poll, however, put the Libertarian at 3 percent.\n\nIn the Senate race in Arkansas, Rep. Tom Cotton, the Republican challenger, and Sen. Mark Pryor, the incumbent Democrat, face not one but two third-party competitors: Libertarian Nathan LaFrance and the Green Party\u2019s Mark Swaney.\n\nA Fox News poll puts both LaFrance and Swaney at 2 percent.\n\nSwaying an Election\n\nHistory, though, shows that a third-party candidate can play a crucial role in a defeat.\n\nIn the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race, Skelley says, Libertarian Robert Sarvis snagged 6.5 percent of the vote. Republicans said his candidacy hurt Republican Ken Cuccinelli, the state\u2019s attorney general, who lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe.\n\nSimilarly, in the 2000 presidential election, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader\u2019s candidacy angered Democrats\u2013especially when the outcome came down to the results in Florida.\n\nThere, Skelley said, votes that went to Nader likely would have gone otherwise to Democratic nominee Al Gore instead of Republican George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThat could have swayed a national election,\u201d he says.\n\nThis year, the most notable Senate candidate running without major-party affiliation is Independent Greg Orman, running against Republican incumbent Pat Roberts in Kansas.\n\nOrman emerged as a strong contender after Democrat Chad Taylor withdrew and supporters turned to Orman.\n\nRepublicans argue that Orman would side with Democrats if elected. Orman, though, has said he is disillusioned with both parties.\n\nThe Kansas race is currently tied, polls show.\n\n\u2018What Happened to Representation?\u2019\n\nThird-party candidates must motivate a small army of grassroots support.\n\nIn Arkansas, LaFrance says he had to obtain 10,000 signatures just to get on the ballot \u2014 a costly and exhausting process. The father of six says:\n\nOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve struggled with is getting people comfortable with there being a third party, understanding what the party stands for as compared to the two other parties and understanding that a vote for a third party is not a wasted vote. It\u2019s a vote for a candidate they believe best represents what they want happening with their government.\n\nIn Kentucky, Patterson faced a similar challenge with a lower signature threshold. Leaders of the Kentucky Libertarian Party deployed professionals to gather more than 9,100 signatures. Of those, the state verified 5,700\u2013well over the 5,000 needed to get on the ballot.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely unacceptable,\u201d he says of the struggle to collect signatures, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s the establishment trying to keep the third-party candidates out. What happened to representation? What happened to us having a voice? That\u2019s what our country was founded on. That\u2019s the hardest thing.\n\nPatterson encountered another obstacle in the candidate debates.\n\nKentucky Educational Television, public broadcasters, hosted a debate last week between Grimes and McConnell. It didn\u2019t invite Patterson.\n\nMcConnell and Grimes \u201cdidn\u2019t want me on stage and were trying to silence my beliefs by constantly moving the criteria [to participate],\u201d Patterson says.\n\nHis exclusion led to a lawsuit, and a judge ultimately ruled against him.\n\n\u201cThat whole thing was shocking because never has a third-party candidate been left out of a debate,\u201d Patterson says.\n\nRunning on Principles\n\nEvents played out differently in Arkansas and North Carolina, where LaFrance, Swaney and Haugh were allowed to participate.\n\nLaFrance hoped to speak with Cotton and Pryor before the forum, and was surprised to receive a phone call from Pryor the previous weekend.\n\nThe two played phone tag but finally met face-to-face before the debate began.\n\nFrom Cotton, though, it was radio silence.\n\nReflecting on the debate, the Arkansas Libertarian says he was struck by how much the other candidates stuck to talking points and were \u201crepetitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a candidate trying to run on principles and ideas for reform, and get the platform out, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d LaFrance said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t tell the voters of Arkansas much of anything.\u201d\n\nHaugh, though, claims he nailed his appearance with Hagan and Tillis.\n\n\u201cI think of course I won the debate big time,\u201d he said the next day.\n\nIn both Arkansas and North Carolina, the Republican and Democrat candidates also went head-to-head in separate debates that excluded third-party candidates.\n\n\u2018A Responsibility to Educate\u2019\n\nLibertarian candidates also are seen as posing a threat to the success of Republicans in Georgia and Alaska.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican David Perdue is neck-and-neck with Democrat Michelle Nunn. Libertarian Amanda Swafford remains in the race.\n\nIn Alaska, Libertarian Mike Fish could take votes from Republican Dan Sullivan, who maintains a lead over the incumbent Democrat, Sen. Mark Begich.\n\nTragedy struck in the Senate race in Iowa last week when Libertarian candidate Doug Butzier died in a plane crash.\n\nRepublican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley both noted the loss of Butzier, whose name will remain on the ballot.\n\nIn Louisiana, Libertarian Brannon Lee McMorris separates a field of eight Republicans and Democrats pursuing the Senate seat. The Bayou State will host an open primary Nov. 4 instead of a general election. If no candidate secures more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two candidates\u2013regardless of political affiliation\u2013will compete in a runoff election Dec. 6.\n\nThird-party candidates may face challenges and skepticism, but most prefer to think their presence gives disillusioned voters hope.
