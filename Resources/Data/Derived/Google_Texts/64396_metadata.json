Her words also happened to be featured as the Austin Chronicle's Quote of the Week.\n\nOn her first day in office, Burton showed just how different her tenure would be than that of her predecessor. The new senator arrived at her swearing-in ceremony in a pair of \"Stand for Life\" boots. Her attire was extremely significant, considering Wendy Davis shot to fame in a pair of pink sneakers when she filibustered a pro-life bill in June of 2013. At the encouragement of pro-abortion advocates and new liberal fans across the country, Davis opted to run for governor in 2014, losing in an embarrassing defeat to Attorney General Greg Abbott, instead of seeking another term in the State Senate, leaving the door wide open for a more conservative candidate.\n\nBurton told Breitbart News that she was excited to erase those pink sneakers from her district's memory and usher in a new lifesaving agenda:\n\n\u201cSenate District 10 was brought into national spotlight with a pair of shoes,\u201d said Burton, \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to be allowed the opportunity to redeem that history today. As a Senator I am here to protect the rights of the citizens of District 10, life is the first of those rights.\u201d\n\nAfter Davis announced her run for governor, it became all too clear that her pro-abortion agenda was not welcome in the Lone Star State. Much of her campaign donations came from out of state as her message failed to resonate with locals. What's more, her campaign proved to be self-destructive.\n\nKonni Burton, however, was impressive from the start. The conservative ended up winning Davis's old seat with over 60 percent of the vote.\n\nWith this bold, pro-life conservative now working in the Texas State Senate, it's clear that SD 10 picked the perfect person to fill Wendy Davis's shoes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"No more pink shoe drama for SD 10!\".05/27/2016 1:30:46AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"No more pink shoe drama for SD 10!\"", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Meet Konni Burton, Wendy Davis's Pro-life Replacement", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/01/17/meet-konni-burton-wendy-daviss-replacement-n1943558", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/147/e9da255f-5dc6-4496-8726-10923b4f0de5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"No more pink shoe drama for SD 10!\"", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Meet Konni Burton, Wendy Davis's Pro-life Replacement", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/01/17/meet-konni-burton-wendy-daviss-replacement-n1943558", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/147/e9da255f-5dc6-4496-8726-10923b4f0de5.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Meet Konni Burton, Wendy Davis's Pro-life Replacement, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "That was the bold proclamation of Konni Burton (R-TX), the Republican who won Wendy Davis's old seat in the 10th Senate district of Texas at her swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday.\nWith this bold, pro-life conservative now working in the Texas State Senate, it's clear that SD 10 picked the perfect person to fill Wendy Davis's shoes.\nHer attire was extremely significant, considering Wendy Davis shot to fame in a pair of pink sneakers when she filibustered a pro-life bill in June of 2013.\nOn her first day in office, Burton showed just how different her tenure would be than that of her predecessor.\nThe conservative ended up winning Davis's old seat with over 60 percent of the vote."}
