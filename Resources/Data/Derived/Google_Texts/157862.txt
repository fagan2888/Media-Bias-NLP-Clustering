Julie Arruiza of Julie's Kitchen said she didn't even notice the jar was gone until another customer asked where she could leave a tip.

Arruiza then checked her surveillance footage and found the footage of the alleged thief taking the jar.

Arruiza says while she was distracted by another customer, the thief tried to stick the jar into her bag, but failed, so she took it around the corner and crammed it into the bag before walking out the door.

It happened around 4:30pm on Saturday, and was filled with almost a full day's tips, according to Arruiza.

She contacted the Colorado Springs Police Department, then posted the video online, where it was shared dozens of time by her fans.
