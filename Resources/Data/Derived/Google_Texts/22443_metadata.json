If they\u2019re wrong.\u2019 Several others in the field have echoed this sentiment.\u201d\n\nDavis has gained nationwide attention for ignoring the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on marriage and was hailed as a hero during the Values Voter Summit in D.C. hosted by the anti-LGBT Family Research Council. After Davis was released from prison after being found in contempt of court, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went to Kentucky to show solidarity with the Kentucky clerk.\n\nTaking note of candidates who have compared Davis to Martin Luther King, Jr., Pataki wrote that such thinking is \u201cwrong and dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis actions were not about denying others existing rights but rather about giving new rights he thought equality demanded,\u201d Pataki writes. \u201cBecause of his courage, we didn\u2019t ignore the laws. We changed the laws and made America a better place. That\u2019s the way to change the law in a nation that respects the rule of law.\u201d\n\nGregory Angelo, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, commended Pataki for speaking out against Davis and said it should play well for him in the election.\n\n\u201cArguments don\u2019t get more to the point or conservative than that,\u201d Angelo said. \u201cWhile other GOP presidential candidates have expressed similar views, Mr. Pataki clearly sees this issue as a potential key differentiator in this crowded Republican field. He also knows that Republicans are receptive to this message \u2014 especially in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nPataki is among the candidates at the bottom of the pack seeking the Republican nomination for the White House. A recent Morning Consult poll found he had support of 1 percent of Republican voters in the primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate George Pataki took his own party to task on Monday for what he said he was \"hypocrisy\" by supporting Kim Davis.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "Republican presidential candidate George Pataki took his own party to task on Monday for what he said he was \"hypocrisy\" by supporting Kim Davis.", "title": "Pataki: GOP hopefuls hypocritical for backing Kim Davis", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/07/George_Pataki_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2015-10-06T10:05:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/10/05/pataki-gop-hopefuls-hypocritical-for-backing-kim-davis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate George Pataki took his own party to task on Monday for what he said he was \"hypocrisy\" by supporting Kim Davis.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/07/George_Pataki_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "Pataki: GOP hopefuls hypocritical for backing Kim Davis", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Kim Davis", "published_time": "2015-10-05T14:36:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T10:05:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, George Pataki, Election 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd958d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI posed a question to an opponent of mine: \u2018We\u2019re going to have a president who defies the Supreme Court because they don\u2019t agree?\u2019 The response: \u2018I hope so.\n\u201cAs Americans, we should be able to engage in our religious beliefs the way we see fit, and I applaud those who stand up for our religious freedoms and rights,\u201d Pataki writes.\nAfter Davis was released from prison after being found in contempt of court, Arkansas Gov.\n\u201cWhile other GOP presidential candidates have expressed similar views, Mr. Pataki clearly sees this issue as a potential key differentiator in this crowded Republican field.\nRepublican presidential candidate George Pataki took his own party to task on Monday for what he said was their \u201chypocrisy\u201d for supporting Kim Davis as they criticize President Obama for allegedly flouting the law."}
