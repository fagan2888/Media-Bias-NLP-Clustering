You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition.\"\n\nCharging the same rates to individuals regardless of their medical history is also a key part of group health plans in the private sector.\n\nHouse Republicans, after repeated votes to repeal Obamacare, have promised to produce their own alternative to the Affordable Care Act as part of a broader policy agenda intended to attract voters in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The policy document is expected just ahead of the Republican presidential nominating convention in July.\n\nHigh-risk pools, which existed before the healthcare law, are state-level entities that guarantee coverage for people with health problems. Analysts say they can be prohibitively expensive and offer less than optimal health coverage.\n\nRepublicans have proposed state-based risk pools as an Obamacare alternative in the past. Last week, the conservative Republican Study Committee recommended risk pools as part of the House policy agenda, saying premiums should be capped at 200 percent of a state's average.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-3af9d6a02a9854da3646959922f4fe0c/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "description": "In a key election year, Paul Ryan said Wednesday that he wanted to end one of the key provisions of the president's health care law.", "author": "AOL Staff", "og": {"site_name": "AOL.com", "description": "In a key election year, Paul Ryan said Wednesday that he wanted to end one of the key provisions of the president's health care law.", "title": "Ryan wants to end Obamacare cost protections for sick consumers", "url": "http://www.aol.com/article/2016/04/28/ryan-wants-to-end-obamacare-cost-protections-for-sick-consumers/21352264/", "image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fhss-prod.hss.aol.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F458da7d0eccbd1c27bf0b11608d7ea4a%2F203747817%2F525073798.jpg", "app_id": 183146218394780, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.aol.com", "account_id": 66237835, "title": "Ryan wants to end Obamacare cost protections for sick consumers", "image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fhss-prod.hss.aol.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F458da7d0eccbd1c27bf0b11608d7ea4a%2F203747817%2F525073798.jpg", "creator": "@AOL", "site": "@AOL", "card": "summary", "description": "In a key election year, Paul Ryan said Wednesday that he wanted to end one of the key provisions of the president's health care law."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3399ff", "robots": "index,follow", "publish-date": "April 28, 2016", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-43dafc02cf4f3bf4849e499b04c0aa82/images/favicon/mstile-144x144.png?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: Paul Ryan through the yearsRyan wants to end Obamacare cost protections for sick consumers Speaker of the House Denis Hastert (L) administers the oath of office to Rep.
