In Alaska, Mississippi and North Dakota, for example, a greater portion of women than men hold bachelor\u2019s degrees, while men are more likely to have finished college in states like Washington, Idaho and Utah.\n\nAnalysts at the Census Bureau expect the broader trend to continue, even though the percentage of men attaining bachelor\u2019s degrees is growing. In the past five years, college attainment among people of both sexes between the ages of 25 and 54 has increased by about the same amount.\n\nDespite their higher educational attainment, a gap in pay between women and men continues to exist, though but demographic trends could change those numbers.\n\nRelated: 10 Public Universities with the Worst Graduation Rates\n\nThe pay gap among the youngest workers \u2014 a group that includes a higher percentage of college-educated women \u2014 is far smaller. An August analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that among the country\u2019s youngest workers (ages 22 to 27), women earn roughly 97 cents on the dollar compared to their male peers when controlling for college major and field of employment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For more than 20 years, women have outnumbered men on college campuses.", "title": "Women Now More Likely Than Men to Achieve This Big Life Milestone", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/12/Women-Now-More-Likely-Men-Achieve-Big-Life-Milestone", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10012014_Graduation_Ceremony.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/12/Women-Now-More-Likely-Men-Achieve-Big-Life-Milestone", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10012014_Graduation_Ceremony.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For more than 20 years, women have outnumbered men on college campuses.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, 30.2 percent of American women held bachelor\u2019s degrees, compared to just 29.9 percent of men.\nAnalysts at the Census Bureau expect the broader trend to continue, even though the percentage of men attaining bachelor\u2019s degrees is growing.\nIn Alaska, Mississippi and North Dakota, for example, a greater portion of women than men hold bachelor\u2019s degrees, while men are more likely to have finished college in states like Washington, Idaho and Utah.\nDespite their higher educational attainment, a gap in pay between women and men continues to exist, though but demographic trends could change those numbers.\nFor more than 20 years, women have outnumbered men on college campuses."}
