(Disclosure: Price Philanthropies helps fund Voice of San Diego. The California Endowment funds Voice of San Diego\u2019s Speak City Heights coverage.)\n\nTogether, the two foundations have spent more than $265 million in City Heights since 2000. And, indeed, data to quantify the impact of that investment is hard to come by.\n\nIt\u2019s not nonexistent, though. Here\u2019s some of what we were able to track down:\n\nCity Heights families are significantly more likely than those countywide to live below the poverty line, and they survive on just more than half of the county median income. And while some parts of City Heights have seen dramatic decreases in crime, others still track higher than the overall San Diego crime rate.\n\nBut the data are sticky and not exactly useful when grading philanthropic organizations.\n\n\u201cThere is really no consensus on how to measure impact and it\u2019s one of the top questions professionals are grappling with now,\u201d said Larry McGill, vice president of research at the Foundation Center, a national resource library and research group for the nonprofit sector.\n\nThe instinct is to look at the big picture. What, if any, dent has the organization made on the systemic problem it\u2019s trying to solve? That\u2019s what we set out to find in City Heights.\n\nNearly every researcher and community organizer in City Heights admits the needle hasn\u2019t really moved on any statistical gauge. The community still performs worse than the county average when you look at income, employment, obesity rates, educational outcomes, crime \u2013 you name it. Any trends showing improvement tend to follow national trends, meaning the community hasn\u2019t exactly rebounded from its lows.\n\nBut what we quickly found out is that change isn\u2019t as black and white as numbers. Sometimes anecdotes and stories are just as valuable, especially when the impact of nonprofit work could take a generation to bear out.\n\nLaura Dietrick, director of the Caster Family Center for Nonprofit and Philanthropic Research at the University of San Diego, is working with local nonprofits to use both quantitative and qualitative measures to appease stakeholders and capture the fuzzier change communities and clients experience.\n\n\u201cTo say, \u2018You haven\u2019t achieved this impact. You\u2019ve been here for five or 10 or 15 years,\u2019 I think is a little shortsighted,\u201d Dietrick said. \u201cBut there needs to be proof of short-term wins along the way.\u201d\n\nOut of the gates, the California Endowment made a grant to UCLA to regularly collect neighborhood-level health data to inform its work in low-income communities throughout the state. That\u2019s since stopped, in favor of tracking policy wins and asking community organizers to chart the path they took to get there.\n\n\u201cWe can begin to look at trends and we can see that we\u2019re putting things in place that are going to make it better for children in the future but it\u2019s kind of a work in progress,\u201d said Steve Eldred, the California Endowment\u2019s program manager in San Diego. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also hard to attribute \u2013 the needle-moving changes don\u2019t happen from one foundation or one effort. When we do see the needle change, it\u2019s going to be because a number of different factors and efforts come together.\u201d\n\nBut the other tricky thing about data: What\u2019s collected keeps changing. For example, Cheryl Moder, vice president of the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative, said the California Department of Education frequently changes how it collects information about obesity from its students. The county is working on a program to gather obesity information from electronic medical records because available data is so inconsistent. And Shaina Gross, senior vice president and chief impact officer for United Way in San Diego, said implementation of Common Core standards is going to reset longitudinal data on academic achievement.\n\nAnd even if there\u2019s a reliable source of long-term data, it can\u2019t paint the whole picture. For example, nearly 70 percent of City Height households live in rentals. That makes for a transient population and means the data aren\u2019t capturing those who leave neighborhood. It can show a snapshot of a family at a point in time, but it can\u2019t easily capture its social mobility.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should stop looking at what nonprofits are doing.\n\n\u201cFoundations are 501(c)(3) charities. Once the government has forgone that tax break that\u2019s given to whoever has donated to a foundation or a charity, the entity becomes the public domain,\u201d Dietrick said. \u201cFoundation boards of directors, nonprofit boards of directors, they\u2019re sitting in there for us, so we do need to pay attention.\u201d\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Neighborhood Growth, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
