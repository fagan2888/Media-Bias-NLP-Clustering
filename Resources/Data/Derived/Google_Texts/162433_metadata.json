He\u2019s building wooden frames to support congressional candidate Katrina Pierson\u2019s yard signs.\n\n\u201cWe put them on busy corners and try to get her name out there so people recognize her,\u201d Stauffer explained as he screwed together the supports.\n\nPierson, 37, was a key campaign organizer for Cruz two years ago. Now she\u2019s hoping tea party volunteers like Stauffer who supported Cruz will help her engineer an upset of Pete Sessions, who\u2019s represented a Dallas-based district for 17 years.\n\nOn one of the coldest nights this month, with sleet in the forecast, more than 300 tea party backers filled a Garland auditorium to hear Pierson and other candidates ask for their votes.\n\nSessions didn\u2019t show up, so Pierson had the stage to herself as she, like Cruz, promised to fight establishment politicians and Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe should have been doing exactly what Ted Cruz did and taken the fight to the public. I am running because it\u2019s past time for Republicans to go on offense in Washington,\u201d Pierson said to audience applause.\n\nLoyal volunteers vs. money\n\nPierson has some big, national tea party endorsements: FreedomWorks; Sen. Cruz\u2019 father, Rafael Cruz; and Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate.\n\nPierson hopes that support and her grassroots network will make up for something she doesn\u2019t have \u2013 money. At the end of January, Pierson had only $50,000 on hand. Sessions had more than $1 million.\n\n\u201cWe have a solid grassroots team of over 200 volunteers, 75 block walkers, 75 coordinators and we\u2019re all over the district all day every day,\u201d Pierson said.\n\nBut can a network of loyal, ideological volunteers overcome the big money divide?\n\nLadd Stauffer\u2019s wife, Barb, thinks so. She says tea party members are particularly fed up with long-serving officials who ignore voters once they\u2019re elected.\n\n\u201cI think the tea party has a lot of influence,\u201d Barb Stauffer said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to get our officials to hear us speak and hear our concerns and they keep telling us we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about and that we\u2019re not informed,\u201d she complained.\n\nThese voters admit some of the Republican incumbents on their hit list will probably win reelection. That includes U.S. Sen. John Cornyn. He drew their ire when he didn\u2019t back Cruz\u2019s filibuster to kill Obamacare.\n\nA battle for the \"soul of our state\"\n\nBut they\u2019ve thrown many other Republican races into question, including the reelection of State Rep. Angie Chen Button.\n\nThe Garland crowd began to stomp its feet when the three-term official from Richardson asked emotionally for their votes.\n\n\u201cOK, hold on. Listen to this,\u201d Button shouted as she asked the crowd to give her \u201csome respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been a conservative Republican all my life,\" she said. \"I even flew to Scottsdale, Arizona, to visit with Barry Goldwater,\" the Republican presidential nominee in 1964 who lost to Democrat Lyndon Johnson.\n\nAfter more than two decades in Austin, State Sen. John Carona from Dallas also showed up at the Garland forum to face off with his tea party opponent, Don Huffines, a wealthy real estate developer .\n\nHuffines frames the race as \u201can epic battle for the soul of our state,\u201d as he calls Carona the most liberal Republican in the state legislature.\n\n\u201cDo you want a guy who has no solutions?\u201d Huffines asked. \u201cHe\u2019s been there 23 years.\u201d\n\nCarona talked about his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve advocated repeatedly for issues important to our tea party,\" Carona said. \"As chairman of (the Texas Senate\u2019s) Transportation and Homeland Security Committee, I secured the first allocation of money to put the first troops on the border.\"\n\nBut after spending more than $1.5 million to win reelection in the last six months of 2013, compared to his opponent\u2019s $604,000, Carona admits he has a fight on his hands.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of support among tea party supporters but the tea party leadership really has targeted this race along with Ron Paul supporters,\" Carona said. \"I represent traditional, conservative Republicans -- that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. But, among some of these folks, that\u2019s not enough.\"\n\nAcross Texas, tea party pressure has pushed nearly every Republican candidate further to the right on issues like controlling debt, limiting government and stopping illegal immigration.\n\nWhether incumbents lose their seats this primary -- as some did two years ago -- could depend on whether tea party volunteers can pull together for lesser-known and more modestly-funded candidates, or whether Cruz\u2019s victory was unique.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Across Texas, several incumbent Republicans are facing aggressive challengers in this year\u2019s primary, and Ted Cruz is part of the reason why.
