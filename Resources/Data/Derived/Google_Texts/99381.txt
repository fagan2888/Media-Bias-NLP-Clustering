LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says he doesn’t think Obamacare is “repealable,” and contends that many of his fellow Republicans don’t really want to walk back the entire law.

The one-time Georgia congressman who often went toe-to-toe with former Democratic President Bill Clinton said parts of the law will be addressed and possibly repealed, but not the entire law. He said the law probably has more support than many Republicans are willing to acknowledge.

“I don’t think it’s repealable,” Gingrich said. His comments were published by USA Today Thursday after he spoke at a Washington health-care conference on Wednesday.

Gingrich, however, was critical of the Affordable Care Act. He said that although he once supported a mandate requiring all individuals to buy insurance, he now is opposed to it, saying it’s too “authoritarian.”

He adds that the number of people added to insurance rolls through Obamacare exchanges is relatively small, compared with the rest of the population, and that a large portion of those now covered under the law came via Medicaid expansions.

“That was always an easy, short-term fix,” he told USA Today’s Jayne O’Donnell in an interview held before those attending the conference. He said the cost to pay for getting many Obamacare recipients is high.

He also scoffed at law’s provision that allows young adults to remain on their parents’ insurance policies until the age of 26.

“I know the age of maturity has gone up,” he said. “But it strikes me that you have your kids hanging around the house until they’re 26, living on your insurance, there’s something wrong with the American economy if we have drifted into that particular model.”

Gingrich says how the Affordable Care Act fares going forward will depend on who wins the 2016 presidential election and how they will modify the divisive measure.
