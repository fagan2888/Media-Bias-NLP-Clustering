Acer isn't letting their rivals get the better of them at IFA in Berlin (or indeed at the pre-show events that are becoming standard). This morning the company announced no less than three new products: the Liquid S2, a 6-inch Android phone with 1080p video recording, the 10.1-inch Iconia A3 tablet, and the DA241HL, a 24-inch all-in-one desktop powered by Android 4.2.\n\nThe Liquid S2 is the sequel to last year's S1 which ups the ante with a 6-inch 1080p LCD screen and a Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor. But the real star of this device is its 13-megapixel real camera, which is capable of recording in 4K resolution. The spec sheet doesn't say what frame rate this 4K video can be recorded at, but 1080p video can be captured at 60fps, or in slow motion with a 4x time dilation factor. There's also an interesting ring flash, a device used for a unique, even distribution of light - note the camera module in the photo above. A suite of software photo features includes panorama assist, burst shot, exposure control, and a \"Live Screen\" mode with annotation functions. Other hardware high notes include 2GB of RAM, a 3300mAh battery, an 8.99mm-thin frame, and Android 4.2.2 with Acer's \"Float\" UI.\n\nElsewhere the phone is a little lackluster, especially when it comes to storage: it will be offered in the standard (and disappointing) 16GB with no MicroSD option. Acer plans to launch red and black versions in Europe in late October for an unnamed price. No other markets have been mentioned, but the Liquid S2 is unlikely to come to North America.\n\nAcer's latest tablet is the Iconia A3, which seems to be a capable if unspectacular update. Its 1280x800 10.1-inch screen and 1.2Ghz Cortex A7 quad-core processor are unlikely to blow anyone away, and while its \u20ac249 base price tag (about $330 at current exchange rates) is reasonable, it's nothing to get excited about. Other hardware details include either 16GB or 32GB of storage with MicroSD card expansion, a 5MP rear camera, and Android 4.2. The Iconia A3 will begin rolling out in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in early October, with a 3G model following in November for a \u20ac50 premium. Expect to see this one on U.S. retail shelves at some point.\n\nThe last Android device revealed this morning is an unconventional one, though the form factor is getting more popular. The Acer DA241HL (catchy!) is a 24\" desktop all-in-one unit running Android 4.2 on top of an NVIDIA Tegra 3 SoC. The 1080p touch panel should make for some interesting use-case scenarios, especially since this desktop has full access to the Google Play Store (or \"Google Market,\" as it's called in the press release). Acer says that the device will support multiple user accounts, potentially making it a nice family PC.\n\nThe DA241HL is also surprisingly flexible. In addition to an MHL port for showing off its video content on an external screen or TV, the desktop can work as a monitor itself, with an HDMI-in and USB port making it a touch-enabled display supporting Windows 8. The frame tilts from a touch-friendly 20 degrees to a more typical 75 degrees as well. The DA241HL will launch in mid-October with a starting price of \u20ac429 in Europe, but a full set of specifications and options isn't available at the time of writing.\n\nSource: Acer, photos via Engadget (2, 3)\n\n2013-09-02 BERLIN Acer will unveil at IFA 2013 the new Liquid S2, a full HD 6\u201d with IPS technology 4K recording capable smartphone with ultra-fast connectivity including 4G LTE and the new Wi-Fi 802.11 ac standard. Following the recent successful launch of the Liquid E, Z and S series, Acer is now ushering in a different world of clarity with four times the resolution of full HD. This technology has been featured in some cameras already, but it\u2019s a completely new experience with smartphones running on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor capable of recording in 4K.\n\nThe real beauty of the smartphone is its iconic soft round curves and red elements for the receiver mesh and metallic ring highlighting the four LED ring flash for low light and macro capturing. The curved glass surface keeps a soft touch and \u201cedgeless\u201d feeling around the rim. A touch of visual moments\n\nThe Liquid S2 combines the simple and visual interface with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera to take professional looking photographs or videos with a smartphone.

It will also support the latest Wi-Fi standard, 802.11 ac, offering significantly faster data transfer, better coverage and power efficiency when compared to today\u2019s 802.11 n standard. The Easy Hotspot enables the smartphone to act as a mobile Wi-Fi router to share wireless internet connectivity with up to 6 Wi-Fi enabled devices. The internet connection can also be shared with QR codes and NFC.\n\nAcer Float User Interface allows several app windows to stay open, so users can multitask without having to back out of one app to work on another. The press of a key brings up the Float Apps shortcut where apps on a translucent screen float over the function being used. It is easy to access or switch Float Apps anytime and can be customized with up to 7 favored app shortcuts. A Float Caller notification ensures that users will not be interrupted by incoming calls that take over the full screen. When a call comes in, the Float Caller mini-window pops up and the user can choose to take the call or reply with a quick message. A touch more power\n\nThe latest addition to the Acer smartphone family is designed with a full HD display with IPS technology and 368 ppi for brilliant, stunning graphics on the 6-inch screen with a wide viewing angle. It is 8.99 mm thin and has two stereo speakers powered with Dolby Digital Plus for a stunning sound experience. The Liquid S2 also uses curved Gorilla Glass\u00ae 3.0 to boast native damage resistance, making it stronger and more resistant to scratches and daily usage than before.\n\nAvailable in red or black, the Liquid S2 is powered by Qualcomm\u2019s quad-core 2.2GHz processor, 2GB of internal memory and 3300 mAh battery for extended use on a single charge. Users can store a large library of photos, music and videos on the expandable memory of up to 128GB to complement the standard 16GB on-board storage.
