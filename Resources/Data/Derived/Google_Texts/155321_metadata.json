Owner John Banyas hopes to keep the operation going for years to come, but rising costs are a constant concern. Banyas had to raise prices recently after packaging costs nearly doubled.\n\nLiving and working near the water also comes at a premium price, and soon it will get even costlier for many property owners.\n\nBanyas pays $5,000 annually for flood insurance on his processing plant \u2014 coverage that is required by his bank \u2014 but rates are set to spike for many homes and businesses.\n\nPremiums will increase exponentially for the riskiest properties \u2014 one Sarasota insurance agent calculated that his sister's Casey Key property faces a 400 percent rate surge \u2014 costing owners thousands in additional annual payments.\n\nThe higher rates will be phased in for existing property owners, but new owners will be hit with the full cost.\n\nA series of major flood events over the last decade sent the National Flood Insurance Program deep into debt, and Congress responded by demanding more money from policyholders.\n\nFlorida is ground zero for the rate increases, with more than one-third of all flood policies in the nation, including 109,000 in Sarasota and Manatee counties.\n\nOlder properties that were not built to current flood elevation standards will be particularly hard hit. Sarasota and Manatee have roughly 30,000 of these structures in high-hazard zones, and more could be added as flood maps are revised over the next year. They are concentrated in places such as Cortez, a fishing village first settled in the 1880s.\n\nMost properties in Cortez sit near the water, and many were built long before structures had to be elevated.\n\nIt is the same story in Siesta Key, the neighborhoods along Hudson Bayou in Sarasota, and other waterfront areas throughout the region.\n\nSpiking insurance costs could fundamentally reshape such communities, driving out longtime residents and businesses while accelerating a shift toward wealthier owners and investors. Pressure to tear down older properties in favor of new, elevated structures will grow. Some worry that older communities will lose their charm in the process.\n\n\u201cEverybody's going to get hit,\u201d Banyas said.\n\nBanyas traces his roots to one of the first families to settle Cortez, fishermen from the Carolinas who came to Florida's Gulf Coast chasing vast schools of mullet.\n\nThe Cortez peninsula is ideally situated between the mouth of Tampa Bay and the north end of Sarasota Bay. Commercial fishing has long thrived in the region and remains integral to the local economy. Indeed, this is one of the few traditional fishing communities left in Florida.\n\nBut much of the narrow peninsula is just a few feet above sea level, making the area vulnerable to flooding from a hurricane-related storm surge.\n\nA hurricane devastated Cortez in 1921, destroying most of the waterfront fishing operations and washing homes from foundations further inland. The same storm sent six feet of water cascading into downtown Sarasota.\n\nSuch disasters \u2014 and the private sector's retreat from the flood insurance market \u2014 led to passage of the National Flood Insurance Act in 1968.\n\nThe federal government agreed to provide flood coverage, but required communities to strictly police construction in flood-prone regions.\n\nMaps were created to assess flood risk. New construction had to be elevated in high-risk areas.\n\nBut older, low-lying properties were allowed to purchase coverage at what critics describe as discounted rates given their flood risk.\n\nThe rates were largely adequate to cover claims for nearly four decades. But starting with Hurricane Katrina \u2014 it submerged large segments of New Orleans in 2005 \u2014 a series of devastating flood events pushed the federal insurance program deep into debt.\n\nTotal borrowing from the U.S. Treasury could reach $28 billion when all Superstorm Sandy claims are paid.\n\nIt will take the program decades to repay that level of debt, leading many lawmakers to declare the flood insurance system fiscally unsound.\n\nCongress approved a bipartisan package of reforms in 2012.\n\nThe Biggert-Waters Act targets older, low-elevation properties in high-risk flood areas.\n\nRate hikes began for second homes earlier this year. New rates for commercial properties take effect after Oct. 1. Premiums for these two categories will increase 25 percent annually until the government decides they are adequate.\n\nThe annual cap on rate increases for all other flood insurance policies was increased from 10 percent to 20 percent. So even though owner-occupied properties were spared the large, mandatory increases, they could still get hit with significantly higher premiums.\n\nBut the greatest impact may come when homeowners decide to sell.\n\nAfter Oct. 1, the government plans to strip away any perceived subsidy when older, low-elevation homes in high-risk areas change hands. Rates will rise exponentially for some properties.\n\nSarasota insurance agent Keith MacFarlane recently ran the numbers on a property his sister bought on Casey Key that is three feet below the elevation where floodwaters are expected every 100 years.\n\nProperties below the 100-year flood level are considered most at risk. All new construction must be above that level.\n\nMacFarlane's sister pays $1,500 annually, but that would jump to $6,600 for the next owner under the \u201cfull risk rate.\u201d Lower-elevation homes would see an even larger rate jump.\n\nThe new rates also will be charged to older, low-lying homes that are shifted into high hazard zones when federal flood maps are revised, a process that is underway in Sarasota and Manatee counties.\n\nThe Manatee map revision is expected to add 9,040 properties to high-risk zones, where owners are required to carry flood insurance if they have a mortgage. Sarasota County does not have precise figures yet.\n\n\u201cIt's going to eliminate a lot of potential buyers,\u201d MacFarlane said.\n\nAt the heart of the recent flood insurance changes is a long-simmering debate over whether federal policy is heedlessly encouraging development too close to the water.\n\nCoastal development has significant economic benefits that could be diminished without affordable flood insurance. Residents of older communities built along the water also will struggle with affordability issues.\n\nBut many believe cheap flood insurance encourages development that is environmentally harmful and economically unwise.\n\nSupporters of the rate increases say they are long overdue.\n\n\u201cThe subsidies are a problem,\u201d said R.J. Lehmann, a senior fellow with the Washington D.C.-based R Street Institute, a free-market think tank that has advocated for flood insurance reforms.\n\nCheap flood insurance puts a burden on the federal government to bail out the program after a major catastrophe, Lehmann said. It also sends the wrong signal about the risks of living near water.\n\n\u201cThere are risks associated and those risks should be charged,\u201d he said.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania business professor Erwann Michel-Kerjan said higher rates are inevitable if lawmakers want the program to be totally self-sufficient, but there is a legitimate policy debate over whether it should be.\n\nMichel-Kerjan has advised top federal officials on the issue.\n\n\u201cMy question back to the White House and Congress was 'What do you want the program to do?' \u201d he said.\n\nSome wonder whether there's a difference between bailing out the flood insurance program and giving people money through other disaster relief programs. Rate increases could lead more people to drop flood insurance, increasing the need for Federal Emergency Management Agency aid after a disaster.\n\nOne solution might be means-tested subsidies to help poorer people afford flood insurance, Michel-Kerjan said. Subsidies also could be targeted to help certain waterfront businesses, such as the fishing industry.\n\nLehmann supports the idea under the right conditions.\n\nThere's also the worry that places such as Cortez could lose their charm if older homes are torn down because they are too costly to insure.\n\nMany Cortez properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which allows them to maintain flood insurance discounts. But not Pat Potts' whimsically decorated home, with its funky lawn art and stained-glass window hangings.\n\nPotts lives in a 1,240-square-foot wood-frame bungalow near the Cortez fishing docks. The 71-year-old retiree pays nearly $4,000 each year for property insurance, including $1,421 for flood coverage.\n\nPotts' insurance payments on the home \u2014 built in 1961 at ground level, well below the 100-year flood height \u2014 are roughly equal to her mortgage. She has never had a claim in 29 years of ownership.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be a real hardship for people on fixed incomes,\u201d said Potts, who lives with her husband on roughly $23,000 in Social Security and pension payments.\n\nUnder pressure from property owners concerned about the rate hikes, the U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to delay some provisions of Biggert-Waters. The Senate is debating the issue.\n\nBanyas followed his family into the fishing business, spending years on the water before seizing the opportunity to buy the old processing plant.\n\nThe former owner was considering turning the building into an art gallery. Banyas wanted to preserve the traditional use.\n\nOn a recent morning, tanned and tattooed fishermen pushed off from the docks in search of thread herring for the Killer Bait brand. Workers in the open air plant enjoyed a view of mangrove islands in Sarasota Bay as they moved frozen bait onto shipping pallets.\n\nBanyas also owns a waterfront restaurant and boat building business. He was quoted a price of $22,000 for flood insurance on the restaurant and decided to go without. He may do the same with the fish plant once the mortgage is paid off.\n\nIt would be a gamble, but many property owners may have no other choice.\n\n\u201cEverybody's pretty much rooted in around here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just try to make ends meet as everything goes up around them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fishing boats still arrive nearly every afternoon at the weathered docks behind the old seafood processing plant.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-BC38ABDB-0F7E-4669-BC70-D9E0A14F7246-pubSH"}, "og": {"site_name": "HeraldTribune.com", "description": "The fishing boats still arrive nearly every afternoon at the weathered docks behind the old seafood processing plant.", "title": "Waterfront worries with flood insurance rates poised to rise", "url": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20130907/ARTICLE/130909689", "image": "http://G52-SHweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SH&Date=20130907&Category=ARTICLE&ArtNo=130909689&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20130907, "fb": {"app_id": 131646103569058}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-130909689-pubSH"}}, "keywords": "MANATEE COUNTY (FL),  EEK (AK),  MANOKOTAK (AK),  Social Issue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e1a\"", "article_summary": "Such disasters \u2014 and the private sector's retreat from the flood insurance market \u2014 led to passage of the National Flood Insurance Act in 1968.\nA series of major flood events over the last decade sent the National Flood Insurance Program deep into debt, and Congress responded by demanding more money from policyholders.\nHe was quoted a price of $22,000 for flood insurance on the restaurant and decided to go without.\nCheap flood insurance puts a burden on the federal government to bail out the program after a major catastrophe, Lehmann said.\nMany Cortez properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which allows them to maintain flood insurance discounts."}
