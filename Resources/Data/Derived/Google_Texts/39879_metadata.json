LuvLuv, YouTube/screenshot\n\nA Canadian couple on vacation in Hawaii was hit with a $1 million hospital bill after a pregnant wife gave birth nine weeks early, and a pre-existing condition prevented her traveler\u2019s insurance from covering the stay.\n\nWhen Jennifer Huculak-Kimmel and her husband Darren consulted with their doctor before planning a trip to Hawaii last year, they had been reassured everything was in order. But two days after arriving, Huculak-Kimmel\u2019s water broke. She was airlifted to Oahu, where she spent the next six weeks on bed rest and eventually delivered her baby girl Reece via emergency C-section. It was only after the couple got home that they realized Blue Cross was charging them $950,000.\n\n\u201cWe are unable to provide coverage for any medical expenses incurred for Ms. Huculak's baby,\u201d read a letter sent to the couple from Blue Cross. \u201cPlease note that Ms. Huculak's travel policy expired on Nov. 9, 2013.\u201d\n\nWhile Huculak maintains she only had minor bleeding from a bladder infection during her pregnancy and was otherwise fit to travel \u2014 as confirmed by her doctor prior to leaving \u2014 Blue Cross claimed the condition was pre-existing, invalidating coverage for Reece\u2019s two-month hospital stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. Huculak\u2019s pregnancy had been deemed \u201chigh-risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes you sick to your stomach,\u201d she told CTV Saskatoon. \u201cWho can pay a million-dollar medical bill? Who can afford that?\u201d\n\nNowhere in the Blue Cross pamphlet was there any fine print mentioning pre-existing conditions, Huculak claims. Had she known of the qualifications, she wouldn\u2019t have gone on the trip. Now, the couple must decide whether they want to fight Blue Cross, declare bankruptcy, or just wait to see how the whole thing shakes out.\n\nHuculak\u2019s specialist in Saskatchewan has written a letter to Blue Cross explaining that the pre-existing condition did not lead to her early labor. However, her coverage was still denied. At this time, the couple says they\u2019re overwhelmed with support but currently aren\u2019t taking private donations. Huculak urges people to take extra precautions if they plan on making a similar trip.\n\n\u201cIt's a very sad situation to be in,\u201d she said, \u201cand people need to be aware that insurance companies will deny you if they have anything they can go on.\u201d\n\nIf there is any bright side, it\u2019s that 11-month-old Reece is living a healthy life, despite the financial battle that will likely ensue well past her first birthday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "million, dollar, baby, pre, existing, condition, prevents, coverage, new, moms, pricey, hospital", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A controversy over a pre-existing condition could end up taking everything from one set of new parents.", "title": "Canadian Woman Gives Birth In Hawaii, Hit With $1M Hospital Bill [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/million-dollar-baby-pre-existing-condition-prevents-coverage-new-moms-pricey-hospital-311554", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/20/hospital-bill.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A controversy over a pre-existing condition could end up taking everything from one set of new parents.", "title": "Canadian Woman Gives Birth In Hawaii, Hit With $1M Hospital Bill [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/million-dollar-baby-pre-existing-condition-prevents-coverage-new-moms-pricey-hospital-311554", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/20/hospital-bill.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/20/hospital-bill.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-20T12:23:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T12:23:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A controversy over a pre-existing condition could end up taking everything from one set of new parents."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf79\"", "article_summary": "A controversy over a pre-existing condition could end up taking everything from one set of new parents.\nHuculak\u2019s specialist in Saskatchewan has written a letter to Blue Cross explaining that the pre-existing condition did not lead to her early labor.\nWho can afford that?\u201dNowhere in the Blue Cross pamphlet was there any fine print mentioning pre-existing conditions, Huculak claims.\nIt was only after the couple got home that they realized Blue Cross was charging them $950,000.\n\u201cWe are unable to provide coverage for any medical expenses incurred for Ms. Huculak's baby,\u201d read a letter sent to the couple from Blue Cross."}
