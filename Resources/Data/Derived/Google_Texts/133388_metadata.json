One conservative operative called the remarks \"dazzling.\"\n\n\"EPA is attempting an unconstitutional trifecta: usurping the prerogatives of the States, Congress and the Federal Courts \u2014 all at once,\" Tribe insisted. \"Burning the Constitution should not become part of our national energy policy.\"\n\nThe testimony, which was first reported Monday by the New York Times, came only days before the former Obama ally is to deliver an oral argument on behalf of Peabody Energy \u2014 the nation's largest coal producer \u2014 in a federal court case brought to block legislation seeking to force states to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThe main source of those emissions is coal-fired power plants, which Tribe insists can operate within the parameters of the Clean Air Act if states adopt carbon capture and storage technologies.\n\n\"Burning the Constitution is one thing we should not do as part of our national energy policy,\" Tribe repeated.\n\nPrior to joining Peabody, Tribe argued on behalf of former Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case, according to the Times. He also argued in favor of several Obama legislative efforts, including the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the brief, I thought, this is dazzling,\u201d Michael McKenna, a Washington energy lobbyist, told the Times. \u201cAnd the fact that it was written by a guy on the other side made it even better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Ryan Gorman", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "\"Burning the Constitution is one thing we should not do as part of our national energy policy,\" Tribe repeated.", "creator": "GormoJourno", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/lawrence-tribe-and-barack-obama-2015-4", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/55242a78ecad04085dfc827d-506-253/one-of-obamas-harvard-professors-likened-the-presidents-climate-change-policies-to-burning-the-constitution.jpg", "title": "One of Obama's Harvard professors likened the president's climate change policies to 'burning the Constitution'", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Coal, Obama Administration, Ryan Gorman", "description": "\"Burning the Constitution is one thing we should not do as part of our national energy policy,\" Tribe repeated.", "author": "Ryan Gorman", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-07", "sailthru.title": "One of Obama's Harvard professors likened the president's climate change policies to 'burning the Constitution'", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/55242a86ecad04fc5cfc827d-50-50/one-of-obamas-harvard-professors-likened-the-presidents-climate-change-policies-to-burning-the-constitution.jpg", "news_keywords": "Coal, Obama Administration, Ryan Gorman", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/55242a86ecad04fc5cfc827d/one-of-obamas-harvard-professors-likened-the-presidents-climate-change-policies-to-burning-the-constitution.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-04-07", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/ryan-gorman"}, "sailthru.description": "\"Burning the Constitution is one thing we should not do as part of our national energy policy,\" Tribe repeated.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "\"Burning the Constitution is one thing we should not do as part of our national energy policy,\" Tribe repeated.", "title": "One of Obama's Harvard professors likened the president's climate change policies to 'burning the Constitution'", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/lawrence-tribe-and-barack-obama-2015-4", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/55242a78ecad04085dfc827d-1190-625/one-of-obamas-harvard-professors-likened-the-presidents-climate-change-policies-to-burning-the-constitution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "One of Obama's Harvard professors likened the president's climate change policies to 'burning the Constitution'", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/55242a86ecad04fc5cfc827d/one-of-obamas-harvard-professors-likened-the-presidents-climate-change-policies-to-burning-the-constitution.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "article_summary": "\"Burning the Constitution is one thing we should not do as part of our national energy policy,\" Tribe repeated.\nA Harvard professor who taught U.S. President Barack Obama torched his prized pupil last month on Capitol Hill.\nThe 73-year-old Tribe argued that the Environmental Protection Agency is grossly overstepping its boundaries in respect to enforcing the president's doctrine.\nConstitutional scholar Lawrence Tribe, who also served in the Justice Department under Obama, testified last month during a House hearing that the president's climate change policies are similar to \"burning the Constitution.\"\nPrior to joining Peabody, Tribe argued on behalf of former Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 Bush v.
