The transaction requires approval by the Oregon Insurance Division.\n\nAdvantage, which has about 400 employees statewide, is the largest provider of dental services to Oregon Health Plan members. About 340,000 OHP members are assigned to its network. Advantage administers benefits for 300 independent owner-dentists as well as operates 39 of its own clinics.\n\nFounder and President R. Mike Shirtcliff said Advantage simply needed more capital to continue its growth as well as to pay the 100 or so dentists who are retiring and want to cash out their equity stakes. Shirtcliff emphasized that the Oregon operation will continue as-is.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to be the president,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to change here except we\u2019ll have a partner that has more resources.\u201d\n\nDentaQuest is the largest Medicaid dental-benefits administrator in the country and has a presence in 30 states. CEO Steve Pollock said taking the stake in Advantage provides insight into how the company operates in Oregon\u2019s Medicaid system, which he believes will be adopted by other states.\n\n\u201cEvery state we work with is looking at its Medicaid program and trying to figure out how to get a better outcome at an affordable cost.\u201d\n\nShirtcliff said a notice to the Oregon Insurance Division will be filed early next week. Insurance division spokesman Jake Sunderland said the state cannot comment while the Advantage-DentaQuest approval is under review, a process that could take two months to a year.\n\nShirtcliff said he first made contact with DentaQuest two years ago when he spoke at a conference of the Medicaid Services Dental Association.\n\n\u201cWhat we realized was we have like philosophies,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody in the country is interested in how Oregon\u2019s doing the Affordable Care Act and the accountable care organizations.\u201d\n\nAdvantage was started in 1994 by a group of dentists in the Roseburg area and focused on serving rural Oregon. Shirtcliff said Advantage still wants independent dentists to have a stake in the company and is looking to recruit new, younger dentists.\n\n\u201cThis will give us the resources to do that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7860,\n\nkmclaughlin@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Redmond-based Advantage Dental announced Friday that it intends to sell a majority stake in the company to DentaQuest of Boston.
