Asa Hutchinson\u2019s proposal for a Medicaid expansion program to replace the current program known as the private option. The bills then went to the opposite chambers and sailed through committees.\n\nThe chambers are expected to give final approval Friday to each other\u2019s bills. The governor is expected to sign the legislation into law soon afterward.\n\nHutchinson said in a statement Thursday, \u201cI was pleased by the strength of the vote margin for the passage of the Arkansas Works. The results exceeded our expectations and are a clear indication that a very strong, bipartisan majority supports this policy for Arkansas. This impressive vote is a solid foundation for the funding approval in the fiscal session.\u201d\n\nThat foundation will have to be expanded if the program is to survive, however. Appropriating funding for Arkansas Works during the fiscal session that begins Wednesday will require support from at least 27 of the 35 senators and at least 75 of the 100 House members, meaning some members who voted against the policy must vote for the appropriation to keep Medicaid expansion alive.\n\nAsked about Arkansas Works\u2019 chances in the fiscal session, Senate President Pro Tem Jonathan Dismang, R-Beebe, told reporters that voting on policy and voting on an appropriation are two different things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to have a conversation with those members (who voted no) and see if their intent was to only vote against the policy or if they\u2019re going to attempt to set new policy during the appropriation process,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Arkansas Works, Arkansas would continue to accept federal Medicaid money to pay for private health insurance for low-income Arkansans but would add features, including referral to voluntary work training for unemployed recipients, premiums of up to 2 percent of their income for recipients earning over 100 percent of the federal poverty level, and a requirement that recipients obtain employer-sponsored insurance if an eligible plan is available.\n\nMore than 267,000 Arkansans with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level have obtained government- subsidized private health insurance through the private option since it launched in 2013. The program, an alternative to the expansion of Medicaid rolls envisioned in the federal Affordable Care Act, has divided Republican legislators from the beginning.\n\nPresenting the legislation for Arkansas Works on the Senate floor Thursday, Sen. Jim Hendren, R-Gravette, said ending Medicaid expansion would cost Arkansas\u2019 health-care industry $5 billion over the next five years, jeopardizing rural hospitals, and would create a fairness issue because federal subsidies for health insurance would continue to be available to people earning at least 100 percent of the federal poverty level but would no longer be available to people earning less.\n\n\u201cWhether you support the Affordable Care Act or oppose the Affordable Care Act, that\u2019s not the debate. What is the debate here is the impact on the state of Arkansas,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, said he was concerned about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the national debt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running up a trillion dollars of debt for our children and grandchildren,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Scott Flippo, R-Bull Shoals, acknowledged that ending Medicaid expansion in Arkansas would not have a major impact on the national debt, but he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start somewhere.\u201d\n\nPresenting matching legislation in the House, Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, said other, richer states such as California and New York are accepting federal money for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWhat I ask my colleagues is, can you please, please, please not put (fixing) the entire U.S. debt on the little old state of Arkansas?\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Bob Ballinger, R-Hindsville, said he did not want to commit the state to a program negotiated with the federal government at a time when a change of administration at the federal level is less than a year away.\n\n\u201cWho knows what kind of flexibility we\u2019ll have come Jan. 20? If we\u2019re going to put together a long-term health plan for Arkansas, let\u2019s not do it now when we have universally, at least on my side of the aisle, universal hatred of Obamacare,\u201d Ballinger said.\n\nVoting against Arkansas Works in the Senate were Sens.
