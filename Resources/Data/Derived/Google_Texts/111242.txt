The Senate overwhelmingly rejected an amendment offered by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) last week that would have suspended visas to the U.S. from “high risk” countries until new enhanced security processes are in place.

Paul’s amendment would have designated 33 countries as “high risk” and placed moratoriums on refugee resettlement and visa issuance to nationals from those countries until the Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence certify and new processes to identify security risks.

The 33 countries included: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia,Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Yemen, and the Palestinian Territories.

The bill would also have required a 30-day security review of immigrants seeking to enter the U.S., even if the traveler was from a country participating in the Visa Waiver Program.

Paul, who is a Republican candidate for president, argued that senators who “truly” wanted to “defend our country” should vote for his amendment — which he sought to attach to last week’s Obamacare repeal effort.

“We spend hundreds of billions of dollars defending our country, and yet we cannot really truly defend our country unless we defend our border,” he said on the Senate floor Thursday.

“My bill would place pause on issuing Visas to countries that are at a high risk for exporting terrorists to us. My bill would also say to Visa waiver countries that in order to come and visit, you would have to go through Global Entry, which would require a background check,” he added.

Just 10 senators, all Republicans — including Paul — voted in favor of the legislation Thursday: Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL), Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) — reelection Kirk, Moran, Lee and Shelby are all up for reelection and Vitter is retiring next year.

One senator —Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) — did not vote and 89 senators voted against the proposal.
