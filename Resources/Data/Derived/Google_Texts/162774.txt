Dear Johnnie: I would like to know if the city has a set schedule for the street sweeping service. If I knew the day they were to be in my neighborhood, I would make sure not to park my car on the curb. Thanks for your information. — Beverly

Dear Beverly: The city does have a set schedule for street sweeping — and it's spring, summer and fall.

I learned from Holly Milne that the city tried out a notification system this spring, with notice given via the Times-Call, the city website and social media — shame on me for not knowing that already — and with signs posted along streets 24 hours in advance of sweeping.

"Results of this trial were mixed, and so at this time it is not clear that pre-notification brings significant benefits to the program - especially considering the expense and time required," Milne wrote in an email.

So, Beverly, the best I can do is direct you to every other bit of information the city has about its street-sweeping program, which can be found at bit.ly/sweepinglongmont. That link includes an explanation of limited public notification.
