After visiting the doctor on Friday, \u201cMother Talley,\u201d as she\u2019s sometimes called, told the Associated Press that she still feels healthy.\n\nJeralean Talley, who now resides in Inkster, Mich., was born in Montrose, Ga., in 1899 where she grew up picking cotton and peanuts. It was there in Georgia that she met her husband, Alfred Talley, in 1936 and enjoyed a 52-year marriage before he passed away.\n\nTalley\u2019s record-holding old age is second only to Misao Okawa, a Japanese woman whose 116th birthday just passed in March, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which keeps a record of the validated longest-living people in the world. Okawa attributed her key to living a long life as eating sushi, getting at least eight hours of sleep a night, and learning to relax.\n\nTalley is part of an exclusive group of 300 to 450 people across the world who live to be 110 years old or older. The number of Americans that are living to the age of 100 is steadily growing. The centenarian population has grown 65.8 percent in the past 30 years, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. In the U.S., the demographics of centenarians are considerably different from the overall population.\n\nIn 2010, 82.8 percent of centenarians were female, and an up-and-coming group of 72.2 percent of women is in their nineties. They\u2019re also less diverse, with 82.5 percent of centenarians being Caucasian and 85.7 percent of all centenarians living in urban areas.\n\nTalley listed seven nuggets of advice to WJBK-TV Fox Detroit for people to follow in order to live a longer life.\n\nTalley's Wisdom to Live By:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "americas, oldest, living, person, 115, year, old, jeralean, talley, offers, 7, pieces, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The oldest living American turned 115 years old and has some words of wisdom to share with the rest of us.", "title": "7 Pieces Of Advice From Jeralean Talley, America's Oldest Person", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/americas-oldest-living-person-115-year-old-jeralean-talley-offers-7-pieces-life-advice-284816", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/oldest-person-america-turns-115-years-old.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The oldest living American turned 115 years old and has some words of wisdom to share with the rest of us.", "title": "7 Pieces Of Advice From Jeralean Talley, America's Oldest Person", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/americas-oldest-living-person-115-year-old-jeralean-talley-offers-7-pieces-life-advice-284816", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/oldest-person-america-turns-115-years-old.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/oldest-person-america-turns-115-years-old.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-05-27T16:13:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T16:13:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The oldest living American turned 115 years old and has some words of wisdom to share with the rest of us."}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re also less diverse, with 82.5 percent of centenarians being Caucasian and 85.7 percent of all centenarians living in urban areas.\nJeralean Talley has advice for the rest of the world on making it to her 115th birthday.\nTalley listed seven nuggets of advice to WJBK-TV Fox Detroit for people to follow in order to live a longer life.\nAfter visiting the doctor on Friday, \u201cMother Talley,\u201d as she\u2019s sometimes called, told the Associated Press that she still feels healthy.\nJeralean Talley, who now resides in Inkster, Mich., was born in Montrose, Ga., in 1899 where she grew up picking cotton and peanuts."}
