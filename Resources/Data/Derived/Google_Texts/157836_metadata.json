Some even rely on CraigsList.org to find a farm near them and purchase a bird for the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nRelated: 9 Reasons You\u2019re Paying More for Groceries\n\nWhen you buy a turkey directly from a farm, it\u2019s likely the bird had a more diverse and natural diet, which translates into a more distinct flavor than for those from grocery stores.\n\nThe price of farm-grown turkeys varies from farm to farm but is generally significantly higher than the price of commodity birds. The most common turkeys found in supermarkets such as the broad-breasted turkey can cost around $1 a pound, while the organic or Heritage turkeys can cost as much $5 to $14 a pound.\n\n\u201cWith the expanding market, there is a gap in pricing between turkeys labeled \u2018frozen,\u2019 \u2018fresh\u2019 and \u2018organic,\u2019\u201d Kimmon Williams, a spokeswoman for the National Turkey Federation, told The Fiscal Times.\n\n\u201cThere is no set price for a turkey that is bought directly from a farm, however, I\u2019ve seen them average between $70 and $130 for a 16-pound bird.\u201d\n\nRelated: America\u2019s Favorite Food Just Got a Warning Label\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind when purchasing a turkey straight from the farm is that it is usually under the radar of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the government body that inspects each bird sold in stores nationwide.\n\n\u201cAll turkeys found in retail stores are either inspected by the USDA or by state systems, which have standards equivalent to the federal government,\u201d the USDA notes on its FAQ page. \u201cEach turkey and its internal organs are inspected for evidence of disease.\u201d\n\nOne of the USDA\u2019s goals, through the Food Safety and Inspection Service, is to detect possible contamination of the birds by salmonella, campylobacter and other bacteria.\n\nThe USDA estimates that 240 million turkeys were produced in 2013, all inspected by USDA. Of these, 46 million were eaten at Thanksgiving and 22 million at Christmas.\n\nRelated: Farmers and Consumers Seeing Spike in Food Prices\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear how many fresh-killed turkeys \u2013 which skip the slaughterhouse and as a result often aren\u2019t inspected by USDA \u2013 are produced each year, experts believe these turkeys are nevertheless safer than those inspected by the government.\n\n\u201cBecause of the conditions under which they\u2019re raised, they are inherently healthier birds,\u201d Jo Robinson, founder and director of EatWild, a website on eating healthy wild local food, told The Fiscal Times.\n\n\u201cThey have not been treated with the arsenic-based compound Nitarison,\u201d she added, which is typically used by large-scale production facilities in the first six weeks of a turkey\u2019s 20-week lifespan.\n\nShe also said that commercial turkey producers continue to treat their birds with antibiotics solely to promote their growth. \u201cDo farm-based turkey producers use any of these products? Not to my knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cAn organically produced bird is guaranteed not to have been treated with these drugs, as it is not permitted in the criteria for certification.\u201d\n\nIf you worry about contamination, here is some advice from the USDA to stay safe while eating turkey this Thanksgiving:\n\nBuy your turkey only one to two days before you plan to cook it.\n\nAvoid pre-stuffed turkeys. If not handled properly, harmful bacteria that may be in the stuffing can multiply very quickly. Frozen pre-stuffed turkeys are okay.\n\nCook a frozen pre-stuffed turkey from the frozen state, without thawing it before cooking.\n\nCook a whole turkey to a minimum internal temperature of 165F as measured with a food thermometer.\n\nAlways thoroughly wash your hands, your utensils, your sink, and anything else that comes in contact with raw turkey and its juices.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With local food and farm-to-table movements on the rise, it\u2019s become increasingly tren", "title": "How Safe Is That Farm-to-Table Turkey?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/14/How-Safe-Farm-Table-Turkey", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11122012_turkey_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/14/How-Safe-Farm-Table-Turkey", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11122012_turkey_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With local food and farm-to-table movements on the rise, it\u2019s become increasingly tren", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "With local food and farm-to-table movements on the rise, it\u2019s become increasingly trendy for consumers to bypass supermarkets and buy their turkeys directly from the local farm.\nCook a frozen pre-stuffed turkey from the frozen state, without thawing it before cooking.\nShe also said that commercial turkey producers continue to treat their birds with antibiotics solely to promote their growth.\nCook a whole turkey to a minimum internal temperature of 165F as measured with a food thermometer.\nAlways thoroughly wash your hands, your utensils, your sink, and anything else that comes in contact with raw turkey and its juices."}
