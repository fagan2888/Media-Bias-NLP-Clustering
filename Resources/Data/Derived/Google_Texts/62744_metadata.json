Appearing on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Monday morning, he was outraged that the artist clearly used her performance to convey an anti-police message. Her backup dancers, it appeared, were dressed as members of the Black Panther Party. Fox News offers a detailed explanation of their controversial outfits:\n\nClad in a black leotard with a gold embellished jacket, Beyonc\u00e9 was flanked by dancers who sported afros and black berets, reportedly in reference to the Black Panther Party. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s outfit was also a nod to Michael Jackson.\n\nThe dancers also appeared to make a symbol that paid tribute to Malcolm X.\n\nGiuliani responded to her performance by insisting politics has no place on the football field:\n\n\"Can't you [the Super Bowl organizers] figure out who you're putting on? I mean this is a political position, she's probably going to take advantage of it. You're talking to middle America when you have the Super Bowl, so you can have entertainment. Let's have, you know, decent wholesome entertainment, and not use it as a platform to attack the people who, you know, put their lives at risk to save us.\"\n\nThe controversy actually began a day before Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Super Bowl performance, when she released the music video for her new single, \u201cFormation.\u201d The video appeared to make references to the Black Lives Matter movement and featured a young man who resembled Trayvon Martin, an African-American male killed by George Zimmerman in Florida a few years ago. In 2013, a jury acquitted Zimmerman of any wrongdoing, ruling he had acted in self-defense. The decision resulted in rioting and looting. Similar scenarios played out in Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland, where angry rioters threatened police and torched their cities.\n\nCitizens have no right to act like criminals when a court case doesn\u2019t go their way. Yet, this appears to be exactly the kind of behavior Black Lives Matter encourages. Katie wrote an important piece on the controversial movement last year, equating it to a \u201cracist, violent hate group\u201d that promotes cop killing. She had plenty of evidence to back up her claim.\n\nOne final point: \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Anna Kooiman noted that Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cgot a police escort there\u201d before she saluted the Black Lives Matter movement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Football and politics don't mix..05/27/2016 10:51:22AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Football and politics don't mix.", "title": "After Getting Police Escort, Beyonce Spews Black Lives Matter Message at Super Bowl", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/08/after-getting-police-escort-beyonce-spews-black-lives-matter-message-at-super-bowl-n2116455", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/38/2016-02-08T022144Z_1_LYNXNPEC1702M_RTROPTP_3_NFL-SUPERBOWL.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Football and politics don't mix.", "title": "After Getting Police Escort, Beyonce Spews Black Lives Matter Message at Super Bowl", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/08/after-getting-police-escort-beyonce-spews-black-lives-matter-message-at-super-bowl-n2116455", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/38/2016-02-08T022144Z_1_LYNXNPEC1702M_RTROPTP_3_NFL-SUPERBOWL.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "After Getting Police Escort, Beyonce Spews Black Lives Matter Message at Super Bowl, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Yet, this appears to be exactly the kind of behavior Black Lives Matter encourages.\nOne final point: \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Anna Kooiman noted that Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cgot a police escort there\u201d before she saluted the Black Lives Matter movement.\nYou're talking to middle America when you have the Super Bowl, so you can have entertainment.\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was no fan of the Super Bowl 50 halftime show \u2013 particularly the part where Beyonc\u00e9 showed up.\nAppearing on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Monday morning, he was outraged that the artist clearly used her performance to convey an anti-police message."}
