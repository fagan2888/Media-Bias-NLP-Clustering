The Obama-administration backed education reforms established benchmarks for English and math proficiency.\n\nThe program is supported by $4.35 billion given to states through President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus.\n\nCommon Core State Standards \u201cprovide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn,\u201d the program\u2019s website declares. \u201cThe standards are designed to be robust and relevant to the real world, reflecting the knowledge and skills that our young people need for success in college and careers.\u201d\n\nForty-five states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories and the Department of Defense Education Activity have already adopted the standards.\n\nTexas, Alaska, Nebraska, Minnesota and Virginia are the only hold-out states from the standardization program.\n\nHowever, the program has had its share of opposition from critics who say the testing standards are actually hurting students and schools. Others have taken shots at the ongoing rollout of the state standards.\n\nAccording to Capital New York, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten told the National Education Writers Association in New York: \u201cYou think the Obamacare implementation is bad? The implementation of the Common Core is far worse.\u201d\n\nLana Ajemian, the head of New York\u2019s Parent Teacher Association, told NBC New York that standards have moved far too fast for some students to keep up. \u201cIt\u2019s like the train\u2019s pulling out of the station without everybody on board.\u201d\n\nShe said that her 300,000 group members are launching a campaign for less testing and a slower pace of change for teachers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he finds it \u201cfascinating\u201d that opposition to the Common Core State Standards program is coming from \u201cwhite suburban moms\u201d who are realizing their kid \u201cisn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought they were.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/11/18/education-secretary-white-suburban-moms-realizing-their-child-isnt-as-brilliant-as-they-thought/", "image": {"width": 594, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/178198372.jpg?w=594", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/178198372.jpg?w=594", "height": 405}, "type": "article", "description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he finds it \u201cfascinating\u201d that opposition to the Common Core State Standards program is coming from \u201cwhite suburban moms\u201d who are realizing their kid \u201cisn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought they were.\u201d", "title": "Education Secretary: 'White Suburban Moms' Realizing 'Their Child Isn't As Brilliant As They Thought'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/178198372.jpg?w=594", "description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he finds it \u201cfascinating\u201d that opposition to the Common Core State Standards program is coming from \u201cwhite suburban moms\u201d who are realizing their kid \u201cisn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought they were.\u201d", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Education Secretary: 'White Suburban Moms' Realizing 'Their Child Isn't As Brilliant As They Thought'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "cbs washington, politics, american federation of teachers, common core state standards initiative, education secretary arne duncan, english standards, math standards, national education writers association, obama administration, obamacare, washington post, white suburban moms", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "american federation of teachers, common core state standards initiative, education secretary arne duncan, english standards, math standards, national education writers association, obama administration, obamacare, washington post, white suburban moms"}, "article_summary": "Common Core State Standards \u201cprovide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn,\u201d the program\u2019s website declares.\nOthers have taken shots at the ongoing rollout of the state standards.\nThe Common Core State Standards Initiative is a single set of education criteria for kindergarten through 12th grade students and teachers in English language arts and math.\nHowever, the program has had its share of opposition from critics who say the testing standards are actually hurting students and schools.\nThe program is supported by $4.35 billion given to states through President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus."}
