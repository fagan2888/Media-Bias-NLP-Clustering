Apple\n\nYour date ignoring you from across the table, his eyes fixed on the pool of light in his hands, is one thing. Your doctor affixing his gaze on a shiny new iPad is another. A new study from Northwestern University has shown that doctors who use electronic records interact less with their patients than doctors who rely on old fashioned ink-and-paper files.\n\nElectronic devices have already begun their migration into doctors\u2019 offices. Facilities are doing away with in-patient paperwork and turning to cloud-based systems, which record and store people\u2019s information digitally. Desktop computers fall to mobile devices that doctors can consult in a flash. Information becomes immediately available, just like in civilian life. But now researchers say the drawbacks may be crossing over, too.\n\nNorthwestern experimenters conducted a field study of 100 patient visits at a primary care clinic. Sessions were observed and video recorded to give researchers full advantage of tracking eye gaze. What they found was that doctor-initiated gazes routinely produced patient-met gazes. Yet patient-initiated gazes were not always reciprocated. Subjects would try to get their doctors\u2019 attention, but would be met with gazes drowned in the realm of pixels.\n\nEnid Montague, lead author of the study, argues the time doctors spend with their heads in patient records could be put to better use. \u201cThat\u2019s time that they\u2019re not engaging with the patient,\u201d she told The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Watch. Doctors that use paper files tended to review the patient\u2019s records outside the exam room, Montague added. But she and her colleagues observed that when doctors went digital, they often brought the device into the room and fiddled with it throughout the session.\n\nWhile researchers didn\u2019t observe any slip-ups in protocol, less certain is whether doctors were able to catch the bevy of minute, nonverbal cues patients may have elicited during the exam. Depression and other mental illnesses come with specific patterns of behavior, many of which people choose, for one reason or another, not to express with words \u2014 problematic mostly because the first few minutes of a patient visit are critical, Montague says.\n\nIt\u2019s during this time doctors are asking about recent vacations, new hobbies, love interests, and are generally catching up since the last visit. If a person dodges personal questions and averts his or her gaze, sullenly, the preoccupied doctor could miss a crucial window for further probing. Without that initial trust and rapport, the researchers argue, patients may feel uncomfortable discussing important topics for the rest of the appointment.\n\n\u201cWe can improve the design so that physicians can engage in these other nonverbal communications more effectively,\u201d explained Montague.\n\nPast research suggests the move to electronic housekeeping may be imperfect in other areas, too. One 2013 study outlined several measures that may be counter-productive to care facilities, such as prescription ordering, which, with a one wrong keystroke, could send a batch of medication totally off-route; or \u201calert fatigue,\u201d where doctors lose track of their patients with each up-to-the-minute update they receive. So, the stakes are high.\n\nIn the end, the migration is inevitable. As the Affordable Care Act encourages each facility to immortalize their records from esoteric manila eyesores to backed-up ones and zeroes, patients enjoy the luxury of potentially faster care and greater overall satisfaction. Though Farley believes we are \u201cjust beginning to scratch the surface\u201d of digital records malfunctions, removing human error usually turns out to be a collective good \u2014 that is, assuming the technology doesn\u2019t produce new ones in the process.\n\nSource: Montague E, Osan A.
