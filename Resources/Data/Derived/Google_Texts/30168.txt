To the Editor:

In “Photographers Band Together to Protect Work in ‘Fair Use’ Cases” (Arts pages, Feb. 22), you mention an appeals court’s holding that under “fair use,” a new work does not need to comment directly on the original work, and photographers’ worries that this expands fair use beyond its original bounds.

Fair use has, from its beginnings, never required the use to be a commentary, criticism or parody. While parody and criticism are textbook examples of fair use, they are not the only ones. The statute explicitly includes research and educational uses, which simply use the original without altering or necessarily commenting upon it. Other established fair uses, like making home recordings off the television, do not require any commentary to be lawful.

The complex and intricate rules of copyright law increasingly become a trap for the unwary, now that computers automatically make copies (often just temporarily) of all the data they process, from DVDs to MP3s to web pages. (A reader viewing this letter on nytimes.com is making a reproduction of this copyrighted work.)

Fair use is, among other things, an essential safety valve that prevents the law from making infringers of us all. A handful of cases decided against photographers might at most suggest the need for them to appeal those cases, not rework a fundamental piece of the law that protects millions from unjust liability.
