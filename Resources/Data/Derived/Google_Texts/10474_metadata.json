People say it\u2019s civil liberties, but you\u2019ve got the civil liberties of the people they\u2019re threatening, too.\u201d\n\nPapen hopes it can help many New Mexicans, including her grandson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s schizophrenic and bipolar and there have been times when he would have been eligible for this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him killed. I don\u2019t want the police shooting him, and I don\u2019t want him to shoot somebody else.\u201d\n\nLast year, Albuquerque police officers shot and killed James Boyd, a mentally ill homeless man. The video went viral, and Albuquerque gained national notoreity for its police shootings, with coverage in The New Yorker and Esquire.\n\nChristopher Torres, also mentally ill, was killed by Albuquerque police in 2011. His parents received a $6 million settlement. Since 2010, Albuquerque police have killed 26 people and wounded 40, resulting in taxpayers shelling out $30 million in settlements payments so far, with more cases still to be settled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well-intentioned,\u201d said Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, D-Albuquerque, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have enough services now for people who want help. If you order people to get help, do they go to the head of the line?\u201d\n\nSB53 has been heard in Ortiz y Pino\u2019s Public Affairs Committee three times, and goes to Judiciary next.\n\nJudge Oscar Kazen, a probate court judge in Bexar County, Texas, testified as an expert witness for the bill in committee. \u201cWhat amazes me is that in New Mexico, it\u2019s like we\u2019re dong something new,\u201d he told Watchdog in a phone interview, \u201cand the rest of the country is going, it\u2019s a Model T, not a Prius.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 45 states have AOT laws on the books. Only Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Tennessee do not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that step between inpatient and completely walking out the back door. As opposed to letting them just disappear until the next headline appears,\u201d Kazen said.\n\nBrian Stettin, policy director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, told the committee the AOT program in New York had dramatically reduced both hospitalization and incarceration rates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Stettin told Watchdog. \u201cWe know from the studies that AOT leads to reduction of hospitalization and criminal acts, and people wind up getting treated in jails or prison for mental illness. There is no more expensive form of treatment than hospital care or care in a correctional facility. By reducing those occurrences we\u2019re saving a whole lot more than we\u2019re spending up front.\u201d\n\nSen. Cisco McSorley, D-Albuquerque, thinks New Mexico should spend a lot more up front. \u201cIn other states where they\u2019ve had effective Kendra\u2019s laws instituted, it\u2019s been backed up by tens of millions of dollars,\u201d he told Watchdog. \u201cIn New York it was hundreds of millions. Here we have a bill that has no money attached.\u201d\n\nThe bill as originally filed contained a $3 million appropriation, but the version currently on the table includes only $275,000 to the administrative office of courts for training and data collection, and $200,000 for a university evaluation of program effectiveness, with cost of actual services to be paid from existing sources of behavioral health funding.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s trying to do the right thing,\u201d McSorley said of Papen. \u201cBut we need to do the hard thing.\u201d\n\nBy hard, McSorley means either raising taxes or using money from the permanent fund. He referred to a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal about two decades ago debating the efficacy of permanent funds versus spending as you go.\n\n\u201cTheir conclusion was that in those states that wisely spend the money, you get a much higher return, a bigger bang for the buck than putting money in the permanent fund. But if you talk to anyone in New Mexico, that solution is off the table.\u201d\n\nBills aimed at spending permanent fund money on early childhood education were defeated in past legislative sessions even with Democrats in control of both houses, because some Democrats voted with Republicans to block the proposals. This year, Republicans control the State House of Representatives.\n\nKazen doesn\u2019t think money is a stumbling block. \u201cWe started off with one judge and one case worker chasing down several of the highest utilizers to make sure they kept their doctors appointments and were taking their meds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used existing sources of funding, and we reduced hospitalization between 70 and 80 percent. Ten years later, with evidence that it worked, our county has invested in expanding services.\u201d\n\nRoswell Mayor Dennis Kintigh called the criminal justice system \u201cthe concrete floor beneath the safety net of social services.\u201d\n\n\u201cCatching them in the net is cheaper, diverting them out of the criminal justice system,\u201d Kintigh told Watchdog. \u201cWe incarcerate people who are unwilling to comply with society\u2019s rules. These are individuals who are unable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Assisted Outpatient Treatment Act would authorize judges to order defendants to receive behavioral health services.", "title": "Assisted outpatient treatment saves money and lives", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-09-at-1.20.01-PM-300x271.png", "updated_time": "2015-02-13T13:22:13+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/198778/assisted-outpatient-treatment/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "New Mexico", "tag": "Albuquerque police,assisted outpatient treatment,behavioral health,Brian Stettin,christopher torres,Cisco McSorley,crime,Dennis Kintigh,Draper Water Treatment Plant,Gerald Ortiz y Pino,James Boyd,Mary Kay Papen,mental health,Philip Kazen", "published_time": "2015-02-10T04:00:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-13T13:22:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Assisted Outpatient Treatment Act would authorize judges to order defendants to receive behavioral health services.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-09-at-1.20.01-PM-300x271.png"}, "title": "Assisted outpatient treatment saves money and lives", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The Assisted Outpatient Treatment Act would authorize judges to order defendants to receive behavioral health services."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not forced treatment,\u201d Papen told Watchdog.\nPapen recently filed SB53, the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Act, which would authorize judges to order defendants to receive behavioral health services.\n\u201cIn other states where they\u2019ve had effective Kendra\u2019s laws instituted, it\u2019s been backed up by tens of millions of dollars,\u201d he told Watchdog.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Stettin told Watchdog.\n\u201cBut we need to do the hard thing.\u201dBy hard, McSorley means either raising taxes or using money from the permanent fund."}
