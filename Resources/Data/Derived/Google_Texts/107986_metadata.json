Boarding is not longer a case if drop off and fend for yourself.\n\nTHE desperately homesick boarding student at one of Sydney\u2019s most prestigious private schools picks up the phone and rings her mum, sobbing uncontrollably down the line.\n\nBut mum is hundreds of kilometres away and the only material comfort she can offer her daughter is a soothing word or two of reassurance.\n\nThose running the boarding house at Pymble Ladies\u2019 College have finely tuned antennae for the slightest signs of unhappiness in their young residents.\n\nThe new generation school leaders take no chances with the 125 young people from around the state who are entrusted into their care. No blip in a girl\u2019s behaviour or demeanour is taken lightly.\n\nAlex Gemmell, Olivia O\u2019Conner, Claudia Hammond, Jem Macpherson, Pam Langan and front Molly Garling. Pymble Ladies\u2019 College Boarding students.\n\nAt Pymble in Sydney\u2019s northern suburbs they have teams of psychologists, medical specialists and experts in adolescent behaviour on call.\n\nMedicos provide boarders\u2019 parents with strategies to help their daughters cope with problems \u2014 the girls\u2019 mental health and wellbeing is at the top of the priority list.\n\n\u201cWe have a clinical psychologist on site full-time, an educational psychologist on site at all times and a fantastic team of counsellors and two chaplains who play a significant role,\u201d Director of Boarding Deanne Elliott said.\n\n\u201cAs a team those people might say this child needs an external support system and I have been involved in those conversations.\n\n\u201cFor the next six months the student will have an appointment up the road with an external clinical psychologist who is talking to our clinical psychologist.\u201d\n\nTIME TO BREAK THE SAD TEEN SUICIDE TABOO\n\nEDITORIAL: FACING UP TO A TOUGH REALITY WITH YOUTH SUICIDE\n\nREAD JAYDEN\u2019S TRAGIC STORY\n\nARE YOU OK, MATE? THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH SAVED MY LIFE\n\nMs Elliott was appointed by Pymble six years ago to bring about \u201cculture change\u201d in the boarding community.\n\nOut went any Draconian rule that could leave girls mentally isolated and vulnerable, out went the language of rules of punishment. In came a new philosophy of inclusion in which all issues are open for discussion \u2014 mental health, self harm, and cyber safety high on the list. Meditation lessons are taken and personal wellbeing has become a buzzword.\n\n\u201cWe work through it if there is any hint of mental health or self harm,\u201d Ms Elliott said.\n\n\u201cHomesickness is always a problem and we are living in a fast technological world and have a lot of social and emotional issues that impact on students.\u201d\n\nThe isolation of the bedroom where boarding girls spent hours after school doing preparation and homework has been fixed.\n\nClaudia Hammond, Jem Macpherson, Director of Boarding at Pymble Ladies' College, Deanne Elliott, Pam Langan and Alex Gemmell.\n\nNo one knew what they were doing in their rooms. Now the students spend the time together in the library working with teachers from 6.30pm and 9pm.\n\n\u201cWe are building a community and a stronger culture of personalised education. So each student is treated as a unique individual rather than a set of 40 girls living in a house,\u201d Ms Elliott said.\n\nThe school also counters homesickness and loneliness issues by allowing boarders to adopt a \u201ccity family\u201d.\n\nMs Elliott said: \u201cThe family comes to pick the boarder up after school one day for a milkshake or they may come to sport or to a music performance. Sometimes the city friend has a sleepover in the boarding house.\u201d\n\nIt is a far cry from the days when parents were forced to sit in the car park and wait for their child to finish boarding at the end of term.\n\nParents are now \u201cin and out of the boarding houses all the time\u201d and sometimes stay the night.\n\nIn the case of the sobbing student, Ms Elliott said a parent so far away can easily go into panic mode.\n\n\u201cBut her daughter may get off the phone, have a friend come past and ask her to go for swim and the issue is all over,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBoarding underpins everything at Pymble. Our aim is that every girl flourishes, not just survives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "THE desperately homesick boarding student at one of Sydneys most prestigious private schools picks up the phone and rings her mum, sobbing uncontrollably down the line.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/psychologists-counsellors-and-meditation-are-ready-to-help-at-the-first-sign-that-someone-is-unhappy/news-story/bebcf50790605512f55c5bc940f2af10", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ef6bc20dcfeeea4363f7662bceaa7aef", "type": "article", "description": "THE desperately homesick boarding student at one of Sydney\u2019s most prestigious private schools picks up the phone and rings her mum, sobbing uncontrollably down the line.", "title": "Boarding school culture overhauled"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ef6bc20dcfeeea4363f7662bceaa7aef", "description": "THE desperately homesick boarding student at one of Sydney\u2019s most prestigious private schools picks up the phone and rings her mum, sobbing uncontrollably down the line.", "site": "@dailytelegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Boarding school culture overhauled"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/bebcf50790605512f55c5bc940f2af10?domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"}, "articleid": "bebcf50790605512f55c5bc940f2af10", "keywords": "clinical psychologist, mental health, homesick boarding student, prestigious private schools, private schools picks, generation school leaders, educational psychologist, fast technological world, boarding houses, medical specialists, boarding community, sobbing student, priority list, personalised education, material comfort, adolescent behaviour, Meditation lessons, personal wellbeing, soothing word, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, Boarding Deanne Elliott", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-23T01:07:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T01:15:24.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24c7\"", "article_summary": "Pymble Ladies\u2019 College Boarding students.\nThose running the boarding house at Pymble Ladies\u2019 College have finely tuned antennae for the slightest signs of unhappiness in their young residents.\nClaudia Hammond, Jem Macpherson, Director of Boarding at Pymble Ladies' College, Deanne Elliott, Pam Langan and Alex Gemmell.\nTHE desperately homesick boarding student at one of Sydney\u2019s most prestigious private schools picks up the phone and rings her mum, sobbing uncontrollably down the line.\nIn the case of the sobbing student, Ms Elliott said a parent so far away can easily go into panic mode."}
