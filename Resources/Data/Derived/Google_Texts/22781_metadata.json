For being the difference-maker on Niwot's third consecutive championship team, Fidelak is the 2015 BoCoPreps.com girls track and field Athlete of the Year.\n\n\"It was just such an amazing experience,\" Fidelak said. \"I remember before track started I was a little hesitant about doing it because of my volleyball schedule. But the coaches did such a good job of getting us in the right mindset to go out and win a state championship and I'm really glad I did it.\"\n\nParticularly early in the season, Fidelak missed track practices in order to travel to Windsor to practice with the NORCO Volleyball Club three times a week. But she still found a way to make a splash at state in May.\n\nPacing Niwot to the Class 4A team title, Fidelak placed second in the 100-meter hurdles (15.15), second in the 300-meter hurdles (44.15) and third in the 400-meter dash (56.26). In the 100 hurdles, she was second to sophomore teammate Alexis Carroll by a photo finish. In the 300 hurdles, Fidelak was runner-up to junior teammate Kela Fetters by five hundredths of a second.\n\nAlso winning gold medal, Fidelak anchored Niwot's 800-meter relay team that set a 4A state meet record of 1 minute, 41.13 seconds. She was the only underclassman on the relay, something that may have surprised many in attendance but not Niwot head coach Maurice Henriques.\n\n\"That was kind of the key right there,\" Henriques said. \"We knew when we had our trials at the beginning of the year and she beat Kela in the hurdles and beat Rachel in the 200 that we she was going to be something special. The big thing was to be a freshman at state and to run a bunch of really tough races.\n\n\"I told her before state that she was running three individual races and they were all going to be tough. Her response was, 'Coach, whatever you need me to do, I'm gonna do.' That's how she is. She scored more points than anyone on our team and really, she was a blink away from winning three state titles.\"\n\nIn total, Fidelak accounted for 25.5, or 32 percent, of Niwot's 85 team points.\n\nWhile 2015 was just her first season competing in prep track and field, it was a banner year for both Fidelak and the Niwot Cougars. Given the promise of her three remaining seasons at Niwot High School, Fidelak is looking forward to the future and so are the Cougars.\n\n\"As soon as we stepped off the field with the trophy, it's always been the goal to come back and win it again,\" Fidelak said. \"We're getting a lot of people back with a lot of state experience and we're already looking forward to next year.\"\n\nFollow Brad on Twitter: twitter.com/BradCochi", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-06-06T15:30:31-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-06-07T15:31:42-0600", "byline": "By Brad Cochi", "sailthru.author": "By Brad Cochi  BoCoPreps.com", "description": "Given her prowess as a volleyball player and her commitments to honing that craft, Niwot High School freshman Mackenzie Fidelak nearly didn't come out for track this season.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28266544:view"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Given her prowess as a volleyball player and her commitments to honing that craft, Niwot High School freshman Mackenzie Fidelak nearly didn't come out for track this season.", "title": "Girls track & field: Niwot's Fidelak wins BoCoPreps.com Athlete of the Year"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Given her prowess as a volleyball player and her commitments to honing that craft, Niwot High School freshman Mackenzie Fidelak nearly didn't come out for track this season.", "title": "Girls track & field: Niwot's Fidelak wins BoCoPreps.com Athlete of the Year", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site54/2015/0606/20150606__07PRFIDw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-06T15:30:31-0600", "sailthru.title": "Girls track & field: Niwot's Fidelak wins BoCoPreps.com Athlete of the Year", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-06-06T15:34:54-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder, weld, boulder county, prep sports, broomfield, erie, lafayette, louisville, longmont, colorado, preps"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c8e\"", "article_summary": "For being the difference-maker on Niwot's third consecutive championship team, Fidelak is the 2015 BoCoPreps.com girls track and field Athlete of the Year.\nAt this year's track and field state championships, Fidelak amassed three top-three medals and anchored a record-setting relay to score the lion's share of Niwot's team points at state.\nIn the 300 hurdles, Fidelak was runner-up to junior teammate Kela Fetters by five hundredths of a second.\nBut her track and field coaches, as well as her teammates, sure are glad she did.\nAlso winning gold medal, Fidelak anchored Niwot's 800-meter relay team that set a 4A state meet record of 1 minute, 41.13 seconds."}
