Still, Gruden felt uncertain about how effective Moses would be against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cI was really concerned,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThursday in practice we did some one-on-one drills, offensive line against defensive line, and he looked bad. He looked really bad. He couldn\u2019t redirect and he was sore. And I was talking to the trainers, \u2018There\u2019s no freaking way he\u2019s going to be all right.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 offense played 75 snaps in a 38-24 win over the Philadelphia Eagles to clinch the NFC East last Saturday and Moses played every one of them. There was one play where Moses gave up a sack to Eagles defensive end Fletcher Cox, but the fact that he gutted his way through the painful injury earned praise from Gruden.\n\n\u201cHe just kept getting treatment and we took a look at him in pregame, said he was going to be alright \u2013 still was a little concerned \u2013 and he just went out there and played great,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cOne of his better games that he\u2019s played. [Moses is a] tough guy, and played his butt off and we\u2019re happy for him, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that he went out and battled through a tough injury.\u201d\n\nMoses wasn\u2019t the only one hurting on Saturday. Free safety Dashon Goldson was the only member of the Redskins\u2019 defense to play all 81 snaps \u2014 the most they\u2019ve had to play this season \u2014 despite sustaining a broken rib last week in a win against the Buffalo Bills. Goldson also had undisclosed knee and shoulder injuries.\n\nAs Saturday\u2019s game approached, however, Gruden seemed certain Goldson would play regardless. After all, Goldson has played 97 percent of the team\u2019s defensive snaps this season.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a pretty significant injury for Goldson not to go,\u201d Gruden said last week.\n\nBelow is a list of the full snap counts from last Saturday\u2019s win, with the total number played in parentheses:\n\nOffense: LG Spencer Long (75/75), RG Brandon Scherff (75/75), C Josh LeRibeus (75/75), RT Morgan Moses (75/75), QB Kirk Cousins (75/75), LT Trent Williams (74/75), TE Jordan Reed (66/75), WR Jamison Crowder (62/75), WR Pierre Garcon (54/75), WR DeSean Jackson (52/75), RB Alfred Morris (35/75), RB Pierre Thomas (32/75), OL Tom Compton (24/75), TE Alex Smith (16/75), WR Ryan Grant (14/75), RB Chris Thompson (8/75), FB Darrel Young (6/75), WR Rashad Ross (6/75), OL Ty Nsekhe (1/75).\n\nDefense: FS Dashon Goldson (81/81), DB Kyshoen Jarrett (78/81), ILB Will Compton (76/81), CB Bashaud Breeland (75/81), OLB Ryan Kerrigan (75/81), CB Will Blackmon (70/81), CB Quinton Dunbar (66/81), OLB Preston Smith (63/81), ILB Mason Foster (59/81), DB DeAngelo Hall (55/81), DE Chris Baker (51/81), DE Jason Hatcher (42/81), DE Ricky Jean Francois (30/81), OLB Trent Murphy (21/81), NT Kedric Golston (18/81), NT Terrance Knighton (18/81), SS Jeron Johnson (5/81), ILB Keenan Robinson (5/81), OLB Houston Bates (3/81).\n\nSpecial teams: Deshazor Everett (28/34), Bates (25/34), Johnson (25/34), Young (25/34), Carlos Fields (24/34), Murphy (23/34), Dashaun Phillips (19/34), Golston (13/34), Dustin Hopkins (12/34), Jarrett (12/34), A.
