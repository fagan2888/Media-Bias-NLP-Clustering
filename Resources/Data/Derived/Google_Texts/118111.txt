There’s nothing new about using social media to make a political statement – but that doesn’t mean celebs have stopped having fun with it.

The latest trend on Instagram has celebrities posing while holding up the phrase #GetCovered to support the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare. Vampire Diaries leading lady Nina Dobrev, however, decided to take the whole political selfie thing one step further. This yoga-lover (who’s no stranger to showing off her ridiculous figure on Twitter) shows her support for coverage by stripping down. It’s a topless political statement – which is the best kind, really.

You’ll find the photo on Dobrev’s WhoSay account, as well as her Twitter page… and below:
