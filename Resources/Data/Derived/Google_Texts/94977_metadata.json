At the heart of the case, business rights vs. religious freedom.\n\nAs always, NewsHour contributor Marcia Coyle of \u201cThe National Law Journal\u201d was in the court today.\n\nHow did this case get to the Supreme Court, Marcia?\n\nMARCIA COYLE, \u201cThe National Law Journal\u201d: OK.\n\nWell, Gwen, Title VII is our nation\u2019s major job bias law, and it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race. It actually makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail to reasonably accommodate religious beliefs or practices, unless that would create an undue hardship on the business itself.\n\nA lower federal appellate court here ruled that Abercrombie & Fitch wasn\u2019t liable under Title VII when it failed to hire Samantha Elauf, who is Muslim and wears a head scarf, a hijab, because the appellate court said, an employer can only be liable if the employer receives direct notice from the job applicant or the employee that there is a need for a religious accommodation.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought the appeal to the Supreme Court challenging that rule, and that was the case that the court heard today.\n\nGWEN IFILL: In this case, Abercrombie & Fitch, which kind of caters to the youth market and has a certain look\u2026\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes.\n\nGWEN IFILL: \u2026 said that her hijab, or the way she was dressed for this job interview didn\u2019t match their look that they wanted their employees to have. Did they say at any point that it was because of religion?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: No, Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s lawyer today said that the so-called look policy is a religion-neutral policy, and that she wasn\u2019t hired just because her hijab would violate the look policy.\n\nThe arguments were very spirited today. And I would say that the Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s counsel really bore the brunt of the questioning. It seemed as though more than a majority of justices were skeptical of that argument \u2014 of the company\u2019s argument.\n\nGWEN IFILL: For example?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, here\u2019s the real problem.\n\nThe government believes that the burden should be on the employer, because the employer here \u2014 to take the first step in a job interview, because the employer has superior knowledge, knows the work rules. And if the employer senses, perceives, understands or knows that there could be a religious issue, the employer should just bring it up and start what Congress intended, a dialogue with the job applicant, to see if there was a religious issue, and is there a need for an accommodation?\n\nOtherwise, if you put the burden on the employee or job applicant, as the lower court here did, they\u2019re reluctant to bring religion up in a job interview.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Right.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: An employer can remain silent, perhaps knowing there\u2019s a religious issue, discriminate, and escape liability.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Even Justice Alito, who usually comes down in favor of business in these kinds of cases, was among the skeptical ones today.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: He was. And he\u2019s actually very concerned about religious discrimination in general, and he said \u2014 he really simplified this and said, look, why can\u2019t an employer just say \u2014 for one of the hypotheticals, you have somebody wearing a beard in front of you, why can\u2019t an employer just say during the interview, we have a work policy that excludes beards? Do you have a problem with that?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Yes.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: It doesn\u2019t draw religion into it right away. But it gives \u2014 then the onus shifts to the job applicant to say if he or she does have a problem with it.\n\nGWEN IFILL: I have a very quick question for you, which is, we have had a couple of other religious freedom cases before the court, whether it\u2019s the Hobby Lobby case, whether they have the right to hire people \u2014 to give abortion benefits, or whether it was the \u2014 you mentioned the beard, a Muslim prisoner who had a beard.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes. Yes.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Is this similar or different?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, it\u2019s different because it falls under a particular statute that does make it illegal to fail to reasonably accommodate religious beliefs.\n\nBut the court \u2014 I mean, the law is very clear, and the court, even under the First Amendment and religious freedom, is quite protective of those freedoms. This is an important case. Business is watching it closely, too, because it believes that if it loses here, it\u2019s going to be forced into stereotyping people who apply for jobs in order to avoid liability.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about right now.\n\nThank you, Marcia Coyle, for this, as always.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Gwen.\n\nGWEN IFILL: For more on the two sides of the argument, we turn to Munia Jabbar, a civil rights attorney, formerly of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, and Rae Vann, who is an attorney with the Equal Employment Advisory Council.\n\nMunia Jabbar, what is an employer\u2019s responsibility, in your opinion, in this case?\n\nMUNIA JABBAR, Civil Rights Attorney: An employer\u2019s responsibility is not to bury their head in the stand when they are on notice that a potential employee will need a reasonable accommodation from them to work for them.\n\nSo, for example, in this case, there were supervisors, employees who recognized the young woman\u2019s head scarf as a hijab, and that a hijab is a religious garment. Instead of engaging in a dialogue with her at all, or asking her, do you think you\u2019re going to have any problems doing this job, here is our look policy, they basically decided to avoid the issue altogether and not to extend her a job offer, even though otherwise she seemed to be a good candidate.\n\nGWEN IFILL: And, Rae Vann, in your opinion what is an employee\u2019s or an applicant\u2019s responsibility in a case like this?\n\nRAE VANN, Equal Employment Advisory Council: Well, the applicant in this context has an obligation to put the employer on notice of his or her sincerely held religious belief.\n\nIt would be very problematic, as a practical matter, to impose an obligation on employers, under a broad rule, the type of rule that the EEOC is proposing here, that the employer delve into, try to divine an applicant\u2019s religious beliefs based merely on how he or she presents him or herself at the interview.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you this, Rae Vann. If an applicant was wearing a yarmulke, is that something the employer or the employee should have to mention, if for some reason the employee policy doesn\u2019t allow for head gear?\n\nRAE VANN: I think it\u2019s very dangerous to get into the business of requiring an employer to engage in that conversation.\n\nThe cases like the yarmulke, like the example that Justice Alito provided in court today about the applicant who appears in a nun\u2019s habit, those are not necessarily difficult questions. The more difficult case comes when you have someone, for instance, who appears for a job interview covered with tattoos and is applying for a front-of-the-house position.\n\nThe employer doesn\u2019t wish to hire that person because that is not the image that it wishes to project in that particular position. Under the EEOC\u2019s formulation, the employer would have an obligation to inquire of that person, inquire as to whether or not the display of tattoos is based on a sincerely held religious belief.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask Munia Jabbar about that.\n\nAre we talking about discrimination? Or are we talking about religious freedom? Or does the tattoo example hold up?\n\nMUNIA JABBAR: I think the tattoo example can easily be dealt with, because if an employer is not concerned about the person\u2019s religion, but is instead concerned about the person\u2019s ability to do the job, I would think that the employer would just ask the job candidate, look, I have noticed you have some tattoos, here is our look policy, or these are our policies with respect to front-of-the-house or public interaction jobs. Would you have a problem complying with this in some way?\n\nAnd that could surface the discussion.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you another thing. Here\u2019s a \u2014 is it possible, or conceivable, that someone could be \u2014 appear for any reason in a head scarf and not be religious at all, and it not be a religious item at all?\n\nMUNIA JABBAR: It\u2019s possible, but, again, I think that what would happen in that case is that the employer would ask, well, you know, again, here is our policy. I notice you are wearing a scarf. Would you have a problem complying with the policy for any reason?\n\nAnd the other thing is that I think that it\u2019s naive to think that employers at this point aren\u2019t savvy enough to be able to identify the most common hallmarks of religious grooming. For example, some studies have shown that the general American public, over 90 percent, can recognize a hijab head scarf and how it often looks, covering the hair and the neck, when it is worn.\n\nSo I think that even if the applicant doesn\u2019t give verbal notice, the employer will often still be on notice, because they\u2019re going to see the scarf, and they\u2019re going to recognize it.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Rae Vann, why don\u2019t you reply, respond to that?\n\nRAE VANN: That may well be the case with respect to the yarmulke or even perhaps a hijab or a nun\u2019s habit, but that does not hold water when you talk about body piercings, tattoos, facial hair, hair length.\n\nThose are all personal styles that can be attributed to or be the result of a sincerely held religious belief, or they could be symbols of a style, a style that an individual seeks to display. So, I think that, again, it\u2019s a complex issue, but we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that this is not about Abercrombie & Fitch not wanting to provide workplace reasonable accommodations to applicants or employees or any employer wanting to do that.\n\nIt is what triggers the obligation to engage in the discussion. And we believe that there are numerous practical difficulties associated with requiring employers across the board to simply engage in the discussion based on some assumption or belief.\n\nGWEN IFILL: We will see how the Supreme Court rules.\n\nMunia Jabbar, civil rights attorney, and Rae Vann of the Equal Employment Advisory Council, thank you both very much.\n\nRAE VANN: Thank you.\n\nMUNIA JABBAR: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court is considering a case brought by a young Muslim woman who was not hired for a job at a clothing store after she wore a headscarf to the interview.
