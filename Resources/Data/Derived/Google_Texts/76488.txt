VIENNA (AP) — Everything appears to be running according to plan ahead of this year’s Eurovision Song Contest — except for the weather.

As organizers test stage installations and make other final preparations for Saturday’s event, cold and rain are gripping Vienna. That will reduce the appeal of the numerous open-air public viewing areas set up for the fest.

For the first time, Australia is among the 27 finalists vying for the win. It was given a wild card due to its strong fan base on the 60th anniversary of the contest.

Australian Guy Sebastian is among the candidates given good chances to come first, which would mean the Land from Down Under would also participate next year. But even if that happens, the 2016 contest will remain in Europe.
