But the largest declines were seen among the poor and Latinos, for whom the uninsured rate plummeted from 36% in the summer of 2013 to 23% by the spring of 2014, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\n\nIn its survey of 45,000 U.S. adults, Gallup found that the uninsured rate for Americans over 18 has fallen to 13.4%, the lowest level since the group began tracking the metric in 2008. The previous low point was 14.4% in the third quarter of that year.\n\nThe drop in the ranks of the uninsured marks a significant step toward the President Barack Obama\u2019s goal of universal health insurance coverage in the U.S. and will be welcome news to Democrats heading into the 2014 midterm elections. Campaigning against Obamacare has been central to the GOP\u2019s election-year strategy and Republicans have hammered Democrats over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s initially rocky rollout.\n\nBut the news is unlikely to soften Republican opposition to the law. The GOP-controlled House is already moving forward with a lawsuit against the President over his decision to delay implementation of the so-called employer mandate, a key provision of the law that requires companies with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance. Some in the GOP have accused the President of unilaterally delaying implementation of the measure to avoid hurting Democrats going into the midterm elections.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Data for Democrats to tout ahead of midterm election", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Data for Democrats to tout ahead of midterm elections", "title": "Studies Show Obamacare is Reducing the Ranks of Uninsured", "url": "http://time.com/2976166/obamacare-health-care-reform-affordable-care-act-uninsured/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/obamacare.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/obamacare.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Studies Show Obamacare is Reducing the Ranks of Uninsured", "description": "Data for Democrats to tout ahead of midterm elections", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act. employer mandate, health insurance, uninsured, gop, midterms", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Care Act.
