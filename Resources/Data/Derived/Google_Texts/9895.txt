Millions of Americans have voiced their frustrations over the failed health insurance marketplaces. But in a new parody, word of the impending trainwreck has reached Nazi Germany, and Hitler is far from happy about it.

The hilarious video was created by the American Enterprise Institute’s Steve Hayward and mimics other popular “Hitler’s Reaction” videos made using a scene from the film “Downfall.” But in this particular clip, Hitler has just learned what a monumental failure the roll out of Obamacare’s much-anticipated exchanges has been. And boy is he mad.

“Everyone leave the room except for Axelrod, Jarret, Sebelius and Holder,” subtitles added into the video read.

The murderous Nazi dictator laments having the healthcare legislation bear Obama’s name, and suggests changing it to something that many won’t remember down the line as being a colossal trainwreck — like Bidencare of Hillarycare.

Using a popular comparison by the Obama administration, a general suggests such hiccups are normal — like problems from the rollout of a new Apple product.

But that doesn’t go over too well.

“Will somebody please bring me my 9-iron and check my tee-time at Congressional?” the fictional-Hitler says angrily.
