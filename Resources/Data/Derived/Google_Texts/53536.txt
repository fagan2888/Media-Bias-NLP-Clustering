With the release of its latest phone software this week, Apple took an important step forward in protecting the privacy of its customers by giving them more control over their data.

The company says it will no longer be able to provide information such as photos, messages and calling histories stored on the phones of its customers to law enforcement agencies. That is because Apple will no longer have the ability bypass the passwords of individual users. (The policy also applies to iPads running the company’s IOS 8 software.)



Apple’s new policy change comes months after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant before they can search phones, except in rare circumstances. In that ruling, the court said the individuals’ Fourth Amendment right to privacy ranks higher than the needs of the police. (The editorial board wrote favorably about that ruling.)

Taken together, the new Apple policy and the high court’s decision mean that law enforcement agents will no longer be able to get around a user’s passcode by getting the information directly from Apple. Some might argue that this could make it harder for law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes because many individuals would refuse to give up their codes under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

But law enforcement agencies have always needed to work around uncooperative suspects. In the physical world, they can kick down the door of a house if they have a warrant to search it and the resident won’t let them in. In the case of a locked phone, government investigators with a warrant from a judge could use software to hack the device. Thieves have already figured out ways to unlock iPhones; police with warrants can do the same.
