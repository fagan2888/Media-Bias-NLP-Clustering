Yet I would argue your experience at the car mechanic might be better than the American ER, which is where I work as a 32-year-old physician. Here\u2019s why:\n\nYou end up at the ER in the first place when probably you needed a Midas.\n\n\n\nThe ER, at least in theory, is for the equivalent of needing a major transmission repair, engine block problem\u2014something ominous that needs major attention immediately. And maybe you do have a perforated appendicitis. But chances are your problem, while urgent, is not an emergency.\n\nSo then why end up here versus the primary care equivalent of a Midas for a simple checkup? The answer, we all know, and I\u2019m not blaming you, is that making a doctor\u2019s appointment is a huge pain in the ass. In fact, you may not even have an established primary care doctor and to find one involves a crappy insurance company website, availability worse than banking hours (if they can take you at all), and the unpalatable likelihood that you\u2019ll have to take a full day off of work. The ER\u2014at least on the surface\u2014is a mirage to many of these inconveniences. But then you arrive and\u2026\n\nYour car isn\u2019t the only one in the lot.\n\n\n\nActually there\u2019s 100 here. Or more. We\u2019re starting to see that post-Obamacare, ER visits are going up nationwide. Maybe this seems counterintuitive? Obamacare definitely gives a lot more Americans insurance cards and technically this should mean more health care access. But here\u2019s the issue\u2014those cards aren\u2019t always premium. And we are already in a system where many specialists won\u2019t take sub-premium insurance plans because on those plans, you are seen as not profitable enough. So many insurance-carrying, hard-working people still must go to the ER, often at a public hospital, just to get non-emergent specialty care. So take a number, but when it is finally called, don\u2019t expect highly personal attention because\u2026\n\nWe can\u2019t really look at you right now.\n\nSeriously. My doctor and nurse colleagues have to fight for eye contact with you. I swear we all went into this because we like people and most importantly the idea of healing you is very rewarding. But of the 10, maybe 15 minutes I have with you (don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s 100 people out there, and another 30 in here), I have to type the equivalent of this entire article on you and every other patient I see. How many times did we ask about your allergies? Medication lists? You already gave that info when you walked in the door, but your local car shop probably has a more advanced electronic records system than most hospitals do, and that information doesn\u2019t always import to me, your doctor. \u201cEMRs,\u201d the very PC-sounding acronym for the now required electronic medical record systems (which are required by all hospitals and doctors offices), are almost always like using Windows 95\u2014in 2014\u2014when pretty much everyone else is using a Mac. But let\u2019s say your experience has actually been good, we fixed your issue, and now you ask the entirely reasonable, completely rational question of \u201cHow much will this cost,\u201d and\u2026\n\nWe literally have no idea how much we just charged you.\n\n\n\nEven the most sketch-ball, scheming car mechanic knows how much those brake pads cost. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014and truly in defense of any medical conspiracy you may think is going on at the provider level\u2014we have no freaking clue how much that EKG or X-ray costs you. Partly because, it\u2019s a different price for everyone depending on your plan (might even be \u201cfree\u201d), but also because, we really don\u2019t know, and even our bosses don\u2019t know. Recently a LA Times columnist wrote a brilliant article on the degree of paper trail it took to find out how much a bag of saline cost. Somebody definitely knows. But the lack of transparency is almost the same for me as it is for you. Happily we are taught as medical students and residents to a) never harm you and b) explain to you what you need and what you don\u2019t need, and sometimes I like that the idea of money, when it comes to your life, is not a first-tier consideration in that equation. But let\u2019s not forget the reason you\u2019re here in the first place. You came to the ER because you want service and answers now, not in two weeks\u2026and while I may not know the exact prices, the ER is the dealership mechanic\u2014everything here is more expensive.\n\nThis is a pretty dismal assessment. I will say that I\u2019m proud to be in the specialty of Emergency Medicine because I think, by and large, you car will leave tuned up (so to speak) and we do this as a specialty at more uncompensated rates than any other. But I wish the experience was better; not just in the ER\u2014health care in general. If I can successfully compare a doctor\u2019s visit even loosely to a trip to an auto shop (no offense, Pep Boys!), then there are clearly issues here. It\u2019s your health, not a carburetor.\n\nHow do we solve this? I think the first step, albeit unsexy and untextable, is to be vocal. Much of this I would argue is my responsibility as a physician, not just yours. Doctors and nurses and providers have to take back some control of the patient experience. We feel regulated, not remotely in charge, yet we\u2019re by far the most invested in your health and experience. It frustrates me that I plunged $300K into debt and missed every weekend of my 20s to be a physician, but a \u201csuit\u201d with an online MBA is often deciding what\u2019s best for you.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Film, entertainment, Obamacare, Health", "publicationDate": 201406200945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "news_keywords": "Film, Entertainment, Obamacare, Health", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Code Black: An M.D. on How to Fix Our Emergency Room Crisis", "tags": "entity:product/film,topic:entertainment,Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:lifestyle/health", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "It\u2019s your health, not a carburetor.
