REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/Files\n\n4072089\n\nThe Center for American Progress (CAP) has emerged as a leading liberal think tank. But what role do its corporate donors play in its policy positions?\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles by The Daily Caller News Foundation investigating this question \u2014 and TheDCNF has found that the progressive think tank used its influence and networking to forward corporate agendas.\n\nCAP was founded by former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta in 2003 as an alternative to the conservative Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, and in its relatively short lifespan has gained much notoriety on the Washington, D.C. policy scene.\n\nPodesta has been able to bring on other prominent former Democratic officials, such as Clinton Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner and former White House official Neera Tanden, who now serves as CAP\u2019s president.\n\nThe liberal think tank has been active on virtually every major policy issue in the last decade, including energy and climate policy, as well as pushing federal health-insurance reform through backing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAs progressives, we believe America is a land of boundless opportunity, where people can better themselves, their children, their families, and their communities through education, hard work, and the freedom to climb the ladder of economic mobility,\u201d CAP\u2019s website reads.\n\n\u201cWe believe an open and effective government can champion the common good over narrow self-interest, harness the strength of our diversity, and secure the rights and safety of its people,\u201d the think tank\u2019s bio continues. \u201cAnd we believe our nation must always be a beacon of hope and strength to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nPodesta recently took a position back at the White House as an Obama administration senior adviser. Before he left CAP, the think tank released a list of 58 corporate donors, including Google, General Electric and major insurance companies. The move was supposed to improve the institution\u2019s image, but it was met with intense criticism from the left.\n\n\u201cMr. Podesta, named a senior adviser to President Obama, is not currently a lobbyist and therefore does not have to worry about the Obama administration\u2019s self-imposed ban on hiring lobbyists to administration jobs,\u201d writes The New York Times. \u201cBut he will nonetheless arrive at the White House after having run an organization that has taken millions of dollars in corporate donations in recent years and has its own team of lobbyists who have pushed an agenda that sometimes echoes the interests of these corporate supporters.\u201d\n\nCAP argues, however, that only about $2.7 million of its $42 million budget last came from corporations or foundations run by corporations. And despite the criticisms over supporting their donor\u2019s corporate agenda, CAP argues it is not under corporate influence.\n\n\u201cThe Center for American Progress has always been fiercely independent \u2014 our views are shaped by what we think the best solutions are to improve the lives of all Americans,\u201d said Neera Tanden, CAP\u2019s president. \u201cDonations, be they from individuals or corporations, do not guide or determine our work. Period. Indeed, we have advocated numerous policies that would impinge on corporate interests \u2014 from tax policy to government subsidies; our interests are simply to provide ideas to solve the country\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nWhile they may argue against corporate influence, a favorite talking point of the post-Occupy left, CAP\u2019s policy promotion and lobbying efforts have indeed benefited at least some of its donors. As the NY Times wrote: \u201cThe defense contractor Northrop Grumman gave money to the left-leaning Center for American Progress \u2026 as the nonprofit group at times bemoaned what it called the harmful impact of major reductions in Pentagon spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cPacific Gas and Electric sent in a donation as Mr. Podesta championed government incentives to promote solar energy and other renewable sources that the California company buys more of than nearly any other utility,\u201d the Times added. \u201cThe pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was also a donor because of what it said was the Center for American Progress\u2019s advocacy for patients\u2019 rights \u2014 and just as the debate heated up in Washington over potential cuts to the Medicare program that covers Lilly\u2019s most profitable drugs.\u201d\n\nExhibit One: The Greenwashing of BMW\n\nCAP has billed itself as an independent voice that promotes progressive solutions to complex policy problems. But the disclosure of their corporate donors has called into question the extent of their \u201cindependence\u201d.\n\nBMW of North America has been a member of CAP since 2009. The auto group was having trouble promoting its \u201cgreen\u201d image and turned to the lobbying firm run by former German Foreign Minister and early leader of the German Green Party Joschka Fischer. As it turned out, Fischer\u2019s firm had a strategic partnership with the Albright Stonebridge Group which is run by former Clinton Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and features CAP distinguished fellow and former Clinton Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner. The former EPA chief also served as a climate advisor to President Obama.\n\nBMW brought on Fischer\u2019s firm in 2009 to develop a \u201csustainable and environmentally friendlier business,\u201d reports the German newspaper Der Spiegel. It was likely through Fischer\u2019s connection to Albright Stonebridge that got them in touch with officials from CAP.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before CAP held an event in October 2009 called \u201cDriving the Transformation\u201d about eco-friendly transportation which was used to tout how BMW\u2019s being a leader in terms in being environmentally conscious. The event\u2019s featured speaker was Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the board of management and CEO for the BMW Group.\n\n\u201cReithofer emphasized that BMW is ahead of the clean car curve thanks to its 28 percent reduction in carbon emissions from 1997 to 2008,\u201d reads a summary of the hearing. \u201cFor Reithofer, keeping up with society\u2019s expectations for energy-efficient vehicles is the key to survive in the car industry over the coming years. Clean transportation is both a moral imperative and good for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any good business knows to how diversify,\u201d the summary continued. \u201cReithofer said the world\u2019s \u2018transportation future will require a mix of mobility options,\u2019 including modern combustion engines, efficient diesel, and hybrids. He said that BMW is committed to pushing energy-efficient technology to the next level.\u201d\n\nThe event also featured Fischer, who said that energy-efficient cars are one way the rest of the world can raise their living standards without contributing to global warming. CAP, however, did not disclose in the event\u2019s summary that Fischer had been hired by BMW to promote their sustainability efforts or that he was partnered with Albright Stonebridge \u2014 a CAP donor.\n\nThis was not all CAP did for BMW, however, as the group also wrote articles touting the car company\u2019s efforts to clean up its act and help make eco-friendly vehicles. In August 2011, CAP published a piece entitled \u201cIt\u2019s Easy Being Green: Sustainable Motor Works.\u201d BMW would have already been a member of CAP for about two years by then.\n\nThe article, which reads more like a BMW press release, talks about how BMW was focusing on leading the auto industry in \u201cclean energy\u201d and protecting the environment. CAP also mentioned how BMW\u2019s South Carolina plant which is listed as number three \u201con the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s list of the 20 strongest on-site generation clean power users,\u201d according to CAP.\n\nIt was leaked in 2012 that BMW had been part of CAP\u2019s Business Alliance, which requires members to donate between $25,000 and $100,000 annually. The Business Alliance comes with many perks, including private meetings with CAP policy analysts and top officials and invitations to VIP events with federal officials.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nCAP used its influence and position as a progressive think tank to promote BMW\u2019s green credentials. The liberal think tank is influential in environmental circles as it employs former EPA chief Browner \u2014 who also works at Madeline Albright\u2019s firm.\n\nRegardless of whether or not BMW is genuinely a leader in sustainability, CAP has greatly benefited from its partnership with BMW \u2014 getting donations from the company since 2009. All CAP had to do was promote the company\u2019s environmental agenda.\n\nAnother thing this episode illustrates is the connections between Albright\u2019s lobbying group and CAP. Both Podesta and Albright served under President Clinton and have since appeared at events together. Albright serves on CAP\u2019s Board of Directors and even employs CAP fellows.\n\nFormer EPA chief Browner was a founding principal of the Albright Group, the predecessor to Albright Stonebridge, as well as a founding board member of CAP. Browner currently serves as a senior fellow at CAP and as a senior counselor at Albright Stonebridge.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported that CAP national security fellows Richard Verma and Brian Katulis both also work for Albright Stonebridge. Verma works as a counselor at Albright Stonebridge, working on global trade issues. Katulis works as a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge dealing in international issues.\n\nAn Albright Stonebridge spokesman said \u201cwe regard the Center for American Progress as an important hub of policy development and analysis in Washington, and the Albright Stonebridge Group is proud to lend its support to CAP and contribute to its mission.\u201d\n\nCAP did not respond to requests for comment from TheDCNF.\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
