No need is greater than improving and increasing public transportation, so those who are less fortunate have an easier and more convenient way of meeting their shopping needs.\n\nIt is completely unacceptable that we don\u2019t have seven-day-a-week bus service. Much of the mixed use development the city seeks, and the companies the mayor covets, will be supported by a thriving service industry that operates every day.\n\nI invite the mayor and all aldermen to take a bus to their next meeting at City Hall or to complete your family grocery shopping. Work to make our bus system that barely meets the needs of those who \u201chave\u201d to ride the bus, to one where we exceed residents\u2019 needs and make others \u201cwant\u201d to ride the bus.\n\nA mobile population is one that is happier with their community, is able to work more, and is able to spend more. Certainly if there is money available for theaters, luxury hotels, and high-end condos, then there is money to not only meet the needs of all city residents but also act as an incentive to downtown development.\n\nJoe Costello, Green Bay\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1mrJuk9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "No need is greater than improving and increasing public transportation", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "No need is greater than improving and increasing public transportation", "title": "Time for better bus service in Green Bay", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/07/19/time-better-bus-service-green-bay/12889305/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No need is greater than improving and increasing public transportation", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/13ca1496e9ce6bdfaba745893ed0adcbf659a920/c=746-0-3438-2692&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/07/19/-gpgbrd07-20-2012gazette1a00320120719imggpgnbus.jpg111m1t3fd2.jpg", "title": "Time for better bus service in Green Bay", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "It is completely unacceptable that we don\u2019t have seven-day-a-week bus service.\n(Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media )Buy PhotoNow that the City Council has voted to keep Larsen Green mixed use, they must do what is best for all residents of Green Bay.\nWork to make our bus system that barely meets the needs of those who \u201chave\u201d to ride the bus, to one where we exceed residents\u2019 needs and make others \u201cwant\u201d to ride the bus.\nBuy Photo Green Bay Metro bus in front of Lambeau Field.\nNo need is greater than improving and increasing public transportation, so those who are less fortunate have an easier and more convenient way of meeting their shopping needs."}
