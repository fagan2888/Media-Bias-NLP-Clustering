The charity raises money throughout the year \u2014 especially during the holiday season \u2014 to serve the needs of homeless New Jerseyans, abused and neglected children, people living below the poverty line and the elderly.\n\n\u201cWhile writing a check is of course a generous act, at Investors Bank we often ask ourselves: What can we do beyond?\n\n\u201cFor me, this means going out into the community, speaking with people face-to-face and helping out with the extra work that comes along with fundraising,\u201d Nietzel says.\n\nAnd this time, Nietzel is going it alone.\n\n\u201cThe Greater Newark Holiday Fund is making a difference and I am honored to be associated with this outstanding organization,\u201d he says.\n\nNietzel served as a co-chair of the Holiday Fund in 2012 and helped raise $365,000 \u2014 an 11 percent increase from 2011. Nietzel says he hopes to surpass that number this year.\n\n\u201cAs chair, I plan to be involved in as many facets of the fundraising process as possible \u2014 attending events, making calls and getting out in the community to promote the Greater Newark Holiday Fund\u2019s message of caring.\u201d\n\nNietzel has already secured a $10,000 donation from Investors Bank as the fund celebrates the launch of the 2013 campaign.\n\nThe Greater Newark Holiday Fund, now in its 77th year, distributes its donations among social service agencies in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic and Union counties.\n\n\u201cIt supports a wide array of services to so many people in need,\u201d Nietzel says of the fund. \u201cHowever, it takes a great deal of energy to make an impact \u2014 one that can only be achieved through the support of many.\u201d\n\nDonations can be made by calling (866) 292-HOPE (4673) or going online to holidayfund.org.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n\n\u2022 In tough times, Greater Newark Holiday Fund giving rises 11 percent\n\n\u2022 Hurricane Sandy puts a new burden on social services agencies", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'greater-newark-holiday-fund','holiday-fund-2013'", "title": "Greater Newark Holiday Fund chairman is dedicated to community service", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Greater Newark Holiday Fund chairman is dedicated to community service\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/greater_newark_holiday_fund_2013.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/13736208-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11601974\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-10T15:00:34Z\", \"author\": \"Janelle Griffith | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"greater-newark-holiday-fund\",\"holiday-fund-2013\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/13736208-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@janellefiona", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The Greater Newark Holiday Fund, now in its 77th year, distributes its donations among social service agencies in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic and Union counties"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, December 13, 2013,  4:51 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/greater-newark-holiday-fundjpg-42e8bc93862dfba5.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"janellegriffith\", \"author_nickname\": \"Janelle Griffith | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"9569705\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Greater Newark Holiday Fund, now in its 77th year, distributes its donations among social service agencies in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic and Union counties", "title": "Greater Newark Holiday Fund chairman is dedicated to community service", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/greater_newark_holiday_fund_2013.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, November 10, 2013, 10:00 AM", "article_author": "Janelle Griffith | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "The Greater Newark Holiday Fund, now in its 77th year, distributes its donations among social service agencies in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic and Union counties"}, "article_summary": "Now, he will add to his resume chairman of the 2013 Greater Newark Holiday Fund.\nRELATED COVERAGE:\u2022 In tough times, Greater Newark Holiday Fund giving rises 11 percent\u2022 Hurricane Sandy puts a new burden on social services agencies\n\u201cThe Greater Newark Holiday Fund is making a difference and I am honored to be associated with this outstanding organization,\u201d he says.\nThe Greater Newark Holiday Fund, now in its 77th year, distributes its donations among social service agencies in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic and Union counties.\nNietzel served as a co-chair of the Holiday Fund in 2012 and helped raise $365,000 \u2014 an 11 percent increase from 2011."}
