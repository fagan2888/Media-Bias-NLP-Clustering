Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (including the many new anti-Semitic and just plain bat-guano crazy people who\u2019ve wandered into my life in recent days),\n\nLast night I said on Twitter:\n\n\n\n\n\nForgetting may not be the right word. Though if this was the Soviet Union, teams of fat-fingered bureaucrats would be airbrushing his likeness from all official records.\n\nIn case you\u2019re not up to speed, let\u2019s recap. It\u2019s really a wonderful, feel-good story for the whole family. In the Halbig decision this week, the court ruled that according to a plain reading of the law, only state exchanges are eligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare. As a political and policy matter, this would be the equivalent of throwing a very large mackerel on a house of cards. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily destroy Obamacare, but that would be the way to bet.\n\nAnyway, the liberal response to the decision was really quite fun. They shrieked about how this was a mere \u201ctypo\u201d or \u201cdrafting error\u201d (which is just not true) and tried to make it seem like suggesting otherwise was dishonest madness of the sort reserved for the likes of Dr. Evil\u2019s father and his claims to have invented the question mark. But what I really liked was the panic over \u201cjudicial activism.\u201d E.J. Dionne \u2014 who has no problem with liberal judicial activism that simply invents new rights out of thin air \u2014 called this decision \u201canti-democratic sabotage.\u201d This is funhouse logic. As NR put it in an editorial, \u201cIt\u2019s an odd world in which judges are accused of usurping the role of Congress for ruling that the executive branch must follow the text of a law Congress wrote.\u201d Seriously, who knows what will happen if the courts start adhering to the law as written? That\u2019s like saying the IRS should be politically neutral. Madness!\n\nMoreover, liberals insisted that nobody in their right mind ever believed Congress intended to withhold subsidies on the federal exchange in order to encourage states to create state exchanges.\n\nA couple days ago E.J. Dionne said on the Dianne Rehm Show that \u201cThere is absolutely not a shred of evidence, not a bit, that this was intended as any sort of incentive.\u201d He goes on to say that this rationale was \u201cinvented out of whole cloth.\u201d\n\nAnd on MSNBC Jonathan Gruber told Chris Matthews, \u201cChris, it is unambiguous this is a typo. Literally every single person involved in the crafting of this law has said that it`s a typo, that they had no intention of excluding the federal states. And why would they?\u201d\n\nNo, really: \u201cIt\u2019s just simply a typo, and it\u2019s really criminal that this has even made it as far as it has.\u201d\n\nCriminal!\n\nIf this were a Godzilla movie, it would be around this moment that the government scientist said \u201cA giant reptile from the bottom of the ocean? Please. There\u2019s no such th . . .\u201d at which point a giant scaly foot squishes him.\n\nBecause here\u2019s Gruber giving a presentation in 2012:\n\nGruber: In the law, it says if the states don\u2019t provide them, the federal backstop will. The federal government has been sort of slow in putting out its backstop, I think partly because they want to sort of squeeze the states to do it. I think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this, is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits. But your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So you\u2019re essentially saying to your citizens, you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country. I hope that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges, and that they\u2019ll do it. But you know, once again, the politics can get ugly around this.\n\nNow Michael Cannon \u2014 a heroic opponent of Obamacare and one of the architects of the Halbig suit \u2013 has some kind words for Gruber. And maybe Gruber has an explanation. That wasn\u2019t me! That was my terrorist twin brother Hans! And Cannon is certainly right that this alone doesn\u2019t prove congressional intent, though a quick Nexis search shows that Gruber was called \u201cthe architect\u201d of Obamacare hundreds of times in the mainstream media and no one disputes that he and Zeke Emanuel were intellectual guiding lights of Obamacare. He even wrote a graphic novel on the subject.\n\nIn the world of health-care wonk debates, the emergence of this video reminds me a lot of this classic scene with Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the unraveling of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Since I wrote the above mere minutes ago and since I have no desire to rewrite it lest I diminish the mediocrity of the prose, I\u2019ll just announce that Gruber has an explanation. It was a \u201cspeak-o\u201d \u2014 you know, like a typo but with speech.\n\nWho among us can\u2019t sympathize with that? I\u2019m often paid thousands of dollars to give highly technical presentations based upon my internationally renowned expertise on nuclear power. But then, out of nowhere, I will give a long and detailed explanation about how Trieste belongs to the Italians and basset hounds, not nuclear fission, are the real source of nuclear power. I think everyone can just say \u201cnever mind\u201d and go back to saying conservatives are crazy.\n\nAt least John Walsh put a little effort into his explanation.\n\nIn Vampire News\n\nIf you took great offense of the recent episode of HBO\u2019s True Blood in which two vampires crashed a Ted Cruz fundraiser \u2014 at the Bush Library no less \u2014 and said some bad words about Republicans, I have some advice: Lighten up.\n\nThe other week I wrote about how the standard conservative critique of the popular culture is just a bit too tightly wound. This minor kerfuffle strikes me as a good illustration of my point. For those who don\u2019t watch the show \u2014 i.e. somewhat more than 300 million out of America\u2019s 314 million residents \u2014 True Blood is about a world in which vampires finally \u201ccome out of the coffin\u201d thanks largely to the invention of a synthetic blood substitute \u201cTrue Blood.\u201d\n\nMost of the series takes place in the Louisiana town of Bon Temps, a town infested not only with improbably important vampires and mystical deities, but a small army of nasty southern caricatures living alongside sexually liberated Bohemians that would make Brooklyn hipsters blush. The utterly ridiculous plot lines aren\u2019t important for the purposes of this discussion \u2014 or pretty much for any other purpose. But suffice it to say pretty much every episode involves lots of sex \u2014 often including the homosexual variety \u2014 drugs, profanity, tedious and logically inconsistent speeches about the evils of bigotry, and a hodgepodge of mossy clich\u00e9s about, again, sex, politics, culture, history, and religion wrapped in the candy coating of pretty naked people. Gilligan\u2019s Island was vastly more plausible than True Blood (even accounting for the fact the Howell\u2019s had an extensive wardrobe for a three-hour tour, yet the people who lived on the boat had only one set of clothes apiece).\n\nFor instance, in the offending Ted Cruz episode, the people who shot up the Bush library weren\u2019t the vampires, but Yakuza gangsters with submachine guns (last seen beheading a post-coital yoga swami). My biggest complaint is that none of the vampires have decamped for New York to slaughter the cast of Girls (\u201cI can\u2019t die! I just landed an internship at the Utne Reader!\u201d).\n\nI find the show moderately (probably not the right word) entertaining, but then again I have a soft spot for the vampire genre, not to mention gratuitous sex and violence. That\u2019s just me. I\u2019m not proud of it. But I certainly don\u2019t take the show too seriously, and anyone who does probably isn\u2019t worth taking seriously.\n\nGays Are What Now?\n\nAnd that goes far more for its fans than its foes. The show was intended from the outset to provide running commentary on gay issues. It was never subtle about this. The opening credit sequence shows a sign like you might see outside a small town church or fire station that reads \u201cGod Hates Fangs.\u201d\n\nNow the problem with analogizing homosexuals to vampires is really quite simple: It\u2019s a terribly bigoted analogy! Whenever the show dives into extended comparisons of vampires and gays \u2014 which is often \u2014 I always wonder if the writers realize what they\u2019re saying. If you made the show from an even remotely right-of-center perspective, it would be boycotted by LBGT groups immediately.\n\nAccording to True Blood\u2019s own storyline, vampires have been evil, bigoted, cruel, and murderous for millennia. They have their own secret, manipulative agenda. They control events from dark corners. They quite literally have the power to brainwash people. Not surprisingly, the comparison to vampires is a classic staple of anti-Semitism. Indeed, some argue that Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula was one extended anti-Semitic caricature (a rich, manipulative, blood-sucking rootless cosmopolitan from Eastern Europe with a \u201chooked\u201d nose at a time of high Jewish immigration? Pure coincidence!). A fan of the show might say, \u201cOnly some vampires are evil, bigoted, cruel and murderous. There are nice vampires too.\u201d\n\nOkay, well. First the whole original storyline is about how Bill Compton is different than other vampires because he\u2019s noble and decent, suggesting the other vamps aren\u2019t. Second, try to make that kind of \u201cit\u2019s not all gays\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not all blacks\u201d or (outside of the Middle East, U.N. or, increasingly, MSNBC) \u201cit\u2019s not all Jews\u201d argument without sounding bigoted. Hey, I can\u2019t be anti-vampire, some of my best friends are vampires! And, third, let me explain something else: Shut up.\n\nIt reminds me of when 28 Weeks Later came out and everyone went gaga about how it was an extended anti-war metaphor of the Iraq invasion and the \u201cgreen zone.\u201d Few dwelled on the fact that in that metaphor the enemy \u2014 the zombies \u2014 must be shown no mercy and ruthlessly exterminated. They just thought it was cool that a zombie movie was making such an obvious reference to the war, or something.\n\nCool Is King\n\nAnd that I think is the source of the real problem here. By any objective or commonsense measure, the uptight Republicans slaughtered at the Ted Cruz fundraiser are happier and more productive members of society than virtually every other character in the show. From the sympathetic white-trash werewolves to the corrupt human rabble-rousers, from the vampire aristocrats to the endless string of slatternly young women and men who come and go with regularity, the show focuses on creatures who are, variously, decent-but-doomed, evil, stupid, or morally, spiritually, or intellectually lost.\n\nThe one thing these people have going for them? They are cool \u2014 at least by the glandular, knee-jerk liberal, fashion-forward, standards of the show\u2019s producers and its niche pay-cable audience. In other words, to the extent the show is politically appealing, it is an irrational hot mess (much like the goo vampires turn into when struck with a wooden stake). It\u2019s like it was written for Bill Maher\u2019s studio audience, a group that doesn\u2019t care about real facts or arguments \u2014 they just want to hear how they\u2019re awesome and the people they hate aren\u2019t.\n\nTo them, rich Republican men in bolo ties and rich Republican women in prim pantsuits aren\u2019t cool. And you know what? That\u2019s fine. Indeed, in real life, those Republicans would look at most of the motley characters inhabiting True Blood and see a gaggle of losers. And for the most part, they\u2019d be right.\n\nConservatives need to get over their insecurities about not being cool in the eyes of liberals (and American adults generally could stand to worry about this sort of thing a lot less than they do). Once you start looking for it, it\u2019s amazing how much liberal commentary \u2014 particularly about sex and religion \u2014 boils down to a kind of sneering self-satisfaction that liberals are hip and conservatives are squares (just think about how much \u201canalysis\u201d of Obama has been rooted in the assumption he\u2019s cool).\n\nThis has long been a bugaboo of mine. I wrote about the phenomenon in 1996 for the Wall Street Journal (reprinted here):\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that conservatives want to shed the liberal stereotype that we\u2019re nerds. But in Washington, where public policy is a varsity sport, the nerd gene doesn\u2019t discriminate along ideological lines. I mean, who really thinks Michael Kinsley showed the other kids how to smoke cigarettes out in back of school? Does anyone look at Ira Magaziner and say, \u201cNow, that guy gets picked first for softball\u201d? And yet for some reason the New York Times gets away with calling Washington conservatives the \u201cC-Span and galoshes\u201d crowd. No better recent example of the vogueing of liberalness can be found than the ascension of Michael Lind, a former assistant to William F. Buckley, Heritage Foundation policy gnome, and executive editor of The National Interest. Mr. Lind deserted the Right and subsequently became a darling of the Left for sinking his teeth into the conservative hands that fed him. Rolling Stone christened him \u201cwhat\u2019s hot\u201d after his conversion. Mr. Lind scorned Washington in the pages of The New Yorker as full of \u201cDweeby White Guys.\u201d True enough. But this from the kind of guy who irons his argyle socks while listening to B-sides of Alfred North Whitehead books-on-tape? So what does The New Yorker call him? \u201cA Recovering Dweeby White Guy.\u201d Recovering! They don\u2019t offer this prognosis because he\u2019s canceled his subscription to National Journal in favor of Spin, or because he turned from Brian Lamb to Beavis and Butthead. They say he\u2019s recovering from Dweeby-White-Guyhood simply because he switched his politics.\n\nMoreover, the simple fact is that the popular culture has lots of archetypes that are essentially conservative and cool. Very few male action stars fit the model of how Salon thinks men should behave, what with all the gunplay, mansplaining, and refusal to get the required signatures on the necessary sexual-consent forms. The men of Lone Survivor are certainly cool. Even better, they are cool and have a code of honor. The same goes for the female protagonist of Zero Dark Thirty.\n\nThe point is that cool isn\u2019t monolithic in a diverse and rich culture. For some, Southern Gothic sybaritic crapulence is cool; for others, self-sacrifice and patriotism are cool. And for lots of us, both have their places.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nMy trip to San Francisco and Napa Valley was really great. I have some longer stories to tell about it, but I\u2019ll save them for another time. But here\u2019s a shorter boastful one. First, the Fair Jessica bet me $50 no one would recognize me in San Francisco. Two minutes later, the guy sitting next to her at the bar said \u201cAre you Jonah Goldberg?\u201d But the best was when a nurse or medical tech walked past us when we were sitting outside a taco joint. \u201cI loved Liberal Fascism!\u201d She meant the book, not the phenomenon. An easy mistake in that town.\n\nZo\u00eb/Goldberg Update: She\u2019s great. She ultimately really took to the cageless prison yard atmosphere. She\u2019s going back this weekend (now equipped with a shiv and a lone teardrop tattoo under her left eye) because the Fair Jessica and I are visiting our daughter at sleepaway camp. And, in three weeks, when she\u2019s done we\u2019re all going on a cross-country adventure again. This will be Zo\u00eb\u2019s first trip to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSo I\u2019ll confess, I haven\u2019t really liked the last few G-Files too much (and I get the sense that many of you agree). Sometimes the muse is with you and sometimes it\u2019s just the Couch hurling epithets at you. But I still think a lot of folks misunderstood my point in last week\u2019s G-File.

And, third, let me explain something else: Shut up.\n\nIt reminds me of when 28 Weeks Later came out and everyone went gaga about how it was an extended anti-war metaphor of the Iraq invasion and the \u201cgreen zone.\u201d Few dwelled on the fact that in that metaphor the enemy \u2014 the zombies \u2014 must be shown no mercy and ruthlessly exterminated. They just thought it was cool that a zombie movie was making such an obvious reference to the war, or something.\n\n#page#Cool Is King\n\nAnd that I think is the source of the real problem here. By any objective or commonsense measure, the uptight Republicans slaughtered at the Ted Cruz fundraiser are happier and more productive members of society than virtually every other character in the show. From the sympathetic white-trash werewolves to the corrupt human rabble-rousers, from the vampire aristocrats to the endless string of slatternly young women and men who come and go with regularity, the show focuses on creatures who are, variously, decent-but-doomed, evil, stupid, or morally, spiritually, or intellectually lost.\n\n#ad#The one thing these people have going for them? They are cool \u2014 at least by the glandular, knee-jerk liberal, fashion-forward, standards of the show\u2019s producers and its niche pay-cable audience. In other words, to the extent the show is politically appealing, it is an irrational hot mess (much like the goo vampires turn into when struck with a wooden stake). It\u2019s like it was written for Bill Maher\u2019s studio audience, a group that doesn\u2019t care about real facts or arguments \u2014 they just want to hear how they\u2019re awesome and the people they hate aren\u2019t.\n\nTo them, rich Republican men in bolo ties and rich Republican women in prim pantsuits aren\u2019t cool. And you know what? That\u2019s fine. Indeed, in real life, those Republicans would look at most of the motley characters inhabiting True Blood and see a gaggle of losers. And for the most part, they\u2019d be right.\n\nConservatives need to get over their insecurities about not being cool in the eyes of liberals (and American adults generally could stand to worry about this sort of thing a lot less than they do). Once you start looking for it, it\u2019s amazing how much liberal commentary \u2014 particularly about sex and religion \u2014 boils down to a kind of sneering self-satisfaction that liberals are hip and conservatives are squares (just think about how much \u201canalysis\u201d of Obama has been rooted in the assumption he\u2019s cool).\n\nThis has long been a bugaboo of mine. I wrote about the phenomenon in 1996 for the Wall Street Journal (reprinted here):\n\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that conservatives want to shed the liberal stereotype that we\u2019re nerds. But in Washington, where public policy is a varsity sport, the nerd gene doesn\u2019t discriminate along ideological lines.\n\nI mean, who really thinks Michael Kinsley showed the other kids how to smoke cigarettes out in back of school? Does anyone look at Ira Magaziner and say, \u201cNow, that guy gets picked first for softball\u201d? And yet for some reason the New York Times gets away with calling Washington conservatives the \u201cC-Span and galoshes\u201d crowd.\n\nNo better recent example of the vogueing of liberalness can be found than the ascension of Michael Lind, a former assistant to William F. Buckley, Heritage Foundation policy gnome, and executive editor of The National Interest. Mr. Lind deserted the Right and subsequently became a darling of the Left for sinking his teeth into the conservative hands that fed him.\n\nRolling Stone christened him \u201cwhat\u2019s hot\u201d after his conversion. Mr. Lind scorned Washington in the pages of The New Yorker as full of \u201cDweeby White Guys.\u201d True enough. But this from the kind of guy who irons his argyle socks while listening to B-sides of Alfred North Whitehead books-on-tape? So what does The New Yorker call him? \u201cA Recovering Dweeby White Guy.\u201d\n\nRecovering! They don\u2019t offer this prognosis because he\u2019s canceled his subscription to National Journal in favor of Spin, or because he turned from Brian Lamb to Beavis and Butthead. They say he\u2019s recovering from Dweeby-White-Guyhood simply because he switched his politics.\n\n\nMoreover, the simple fact is that the popular culture has lots of archetypes that are essentially conservative and cool. Very few male action stars fit the model of how Salon thinks men should behave, what with all the gunplay, mansplaining, and refusal to get the required signatures on the necessary sexual-consent forms. The men of Lone Survivor are certainly cool. Even better, they are cool and have a code of honor. The same goes for the female protagonist of Zero Dark Thirty.\n\nThe point is that cool isn\u2019t monolithic in a diverse and rich culture. For some, Southern Gothic sybaritic crapulence is cool; for others, self-sacrifice and patriotism are cool. And for lots of us, both have their places.\n\n#page#Various & Sundry\n\nMy trip to San Francisco and Napa Valley was really great. I have some longer stories to tell about it, but I\u2019ll save them for another time. But here\u2019s a shorter boastful one. First, the Fair Jessica bet me $50 no one would recognize me in San Francisco. Two minutes later, the guy sitting next to her at the bar said \u201cAre you Jonah Goldberg?\u201d But the best was when a nurse or medical tech walked past us when we were sitting outside a taco joint. \u201cI loved Liberal Fascism!\u201d She meant the book, not the phenomenon. An easy mistake in that town.\n\n#ad#Zo\u00eb/Goldberg Update: She\u2019s great. She ultimately really took to the cageless prison yard atmosphere. She\u2019s going back this weekend (now equipped with a shiv and a lone teardrop tattoo under her left eye) because the Fair Jessica and I are visiting our daughter at sleepaway camp. And, in three weeks, when she\u2019s done we\u2019re all going on a cross-country adventure again. This will be Zo\u00eb\u2019s first trip to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSo I\u2019ll confess, I haven\u2019t really liked the last few G-Files too much (and I get the sense that many of you agree). Sometimes the muse is with you and sometimes it\u2019s just the Couch hurling epithets at you. But I still think a lot of folks misunderstood my point in last week\u2019s G-File.

Subscribe\u00a0here\u00a0to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (including the many new anti-Semitic and just plain bat-guano crazy people who\u2019ve wandered into my life in recent days),\n\nLast night I said on Twitter:\n\n\n\nForgetting may not be the right word. Though if this was the Soviet Union, teams of fat-fingered bureaucrats would be airbrushing his likeness from all official records.\n\n#ad#In case you\u2019re not up to speed, let\u2019s recap. It\u2019s really a wonderful, feel-good story for the whole family. In the Halbig decision this week, the court ruled that according to a plain reading of the law, only state exchanges are eligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare. As a political and policy matter, this would be the equivalent of throwing a very large mackerel on a house of cards. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily destroy Obamacare, but that would be the way to bet.\n\nAnyway, the liberal response to the decision was really quite fun. They shrieked about how this was a mere \u201ctypo\u201d or \u201cdrafting error\u201d (which is just not true) and tried to make it seem like suggesting otherwise was dishonest madness of the sort reserved for the likes of\u00a0 Dr. Evil\u2019s father and his claims to have invented the question mark. But what I really liked was the panic over \u201cjudicial activism.\u201d E.J. Dionne \u2014 who has no problem with liberal judicial activism that simply invents new rights out of thin air \u2014 called this decision \u201canti-democratic sabotage.\u201d This is funhouse logic. As NR put it in an editorial, \u201cIt\u2019s an odd world in which judges are accused of usurping the role of Congress for ruling that the executive branch must follow the text of a law Congress wrote.\u201d Seriously, who knows what will happen if the courts start adhering to the law as written? That\u2019s like saying the IRS should be politically neutral. Madness!\n\nMoreover, liberals insisted that nobody in their right mind ever believed Congress intended to withhold subsidies on the federal exchange in order to encourage states to create state exchanges.\n\nA couple days ago E.J. Dionne said on the Dianne Rehm Show that \u201cThere is absolutely not a shred of evidence, not a bit, that this was intended as any sort of incentive.\u201d He goes on to say that this rationale was \u201cinvented out of whole cloth.\u201d\n\nAnd on MSNBC Jonathan Gruber told Chris Matthews, \u201cChris, it is unambiguous this is a typo. Literally every single person involved in the crafting of this law has said that it`s a typo, that they had no intention of excluding the federal states. And why would they?\u201d\n\nNo, really: \u201cIt\u2019s just simply a typo, and it\u2019s really criminal that this has even made it as far as it has.\u201d\n\nCriminal!\n\nIf this were a Godzilla movie, it would be around this moment that the government scientist said \u201cA giant reptile from the bottom of the ocean? Please. There\u2019s no such th . . .\u201d at which point a giant scaly foot squishes him.\n\nBecause here\u2019s Gruber giving a presentation in 2012:\n\n\nGruber: In the law, it says if the states don\u2019t provide them, the federal backstop will. The federal government has been sort of slow in putting out its backstop, I think partly because they want to sort of squeeze the states to do it. \u00a0I think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this, is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits. But your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So you\u2019re essentially saying to your citizens, you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country. I hope that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges, and that they\u2019ll do it. But you know, once again, the politics can get ugly around this.\n\n\nNow Michael Cannon \u2014 a heroic opponent of Obamacare and one of the architects of the Halbig suit \u2013 has some kind words for Gruber. And maybe Gruber has an explanation. That wasn\u2019t me! That was my terrorist twin brother Hans! And Cannon is certainly right that this alone doesn\u2019t prove congressional intent, though a quick Nexis search shows that Gruber was called \u201cthe architect\u201d of Obamacare hundreds of times in the mainstream media and no one disputes that he and Zeke Emanuel were intellectual guiding lights of Obamacare. He even wrote a graphic novel on the subject.\n\nIn the world of health-care wonk debates, the emergence of this video reminds me a lot of this classic scene with Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the unraveling of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n#page#Update: Since I wrote the above mere minutes ago and since I have no desire to rewrite it lest I diminish the mediocrity of the prose, I\u2019ll just announce that Gruber has an explanation. It was a \u201cspeak-o\u201d \u2014 you know, like a typo but with speech.\n\nWho among us can\u2019t sympathize with that? I\u2019m often paid thousands of dollars to give highly technical presentations based upon my internationally renowned expertise on nuclear power. But then, out of nowhere, I will give a long and detailed explanation about how Trieste belongs to the Italians and basset hounds, not nuclear fission, are the real source of nuclear power. I think everyone can just say \u201cnever mind\u201d and go back to saying conservatives are crazy.\n\nAt least John Walsh put a little effort into his explanation.\n\n#ad#In Vampire News\n\nIf you took great offense of the recent episode of HBO\u2019s True Blood in which two vampires crashed a Ted Cruz fundraiser \u2014 at the Bush Library no less \u2014 and said some bad words about Republicans, I have some advice: Lighten up.\n\nThe other week I wrote about how the standard conservative critique of the popular culture is just a bit too tightly wound. This minor kerfuffle strikes me as a good illustration of my point. For those who don\u2019t watch the show \u2014 i.e. somewhat more than 300 million out of America\u2019s 314 million residents \u2014 True Blood is about a world in which vampires finally \u201ccome out of the coffin\u201d thanks largely to the invention of a synthetic blood substitute \u201cTrue Blood.\u201d\n\nMost of the series takes place in the Louisiana town of Bon Temps, a town infested not only with improbably important vampires and mystical deities, but a small army of nasty southern caricatures living alongside sexually liberated Bohemians that would make Brooklyn hipsters blush. The utterly ridiculous plot lines aren\u2019t important for the purposes of this discussion \u2014 or pretty much for any other purpose. But suffice it to say pretty much every episode involves lots of sex \u2014 often including the homosexual variety \u2014 drugs, profanity, tedious and logically inconsistent speeches about the evils of bigotry, and a hodgepodge of mossy clich\u00e9s about, again, sex, politics, culture, history, and religion wrapped in the candy coating of pretty naked people. Gilligan\u2019s Island was vastly more plausible than True Blood (even accounting for the fact the Howell\u2019s had an extensive wardrobe for a three-hour tour, yet the people who lived on the boat had only one set of clothes apiece).\n\nFor instance, in the offending Ted Cruz episode, the people who shot up the Bush library weren\u2019t the vampires, but Yakuza gangsters with submachine guns (last seen beheading a post-coital yoga swami). My biggest complaint is that none of the vampires have decamped for New York to slaughter the cast of Girls (\u201cI can\u2019t die! I just landed an internship at the Utne Reader!\u201d).\n\nI find the show moderately (probably not the right word) entertaining, but then again I have a soft spot for the vampire genre, not to mention gratuitous sex and violence. That\u2019s just me. I\u2019m not proud of it. But I certainly don\u2019t take the show too seriously, and anyone who does probably isn\u2019t worth taking seriously.\n\nGays Are What Now?\n\nAnd that goes far more for its fans than its foes. The show was intended from the outset to provide running commentary on gay issues. It was never subtle about this. The opening credit sequence shows a sign like you might see outside a small town church or fire station that reads \u201cGod Hates Fangs.\u201d\n\nNow the problem with analogizing homosexuals to vampires is really quite simple: It\u2019s a terribly bigoted analogy! Whenever the show dives into extended comparisons of vampires and gays \u2014 which is often \u2014 I always wonder if the writers realize what they\u2019re saying. If you made the show from an even remotely right-of-center perspective, it would be boycotted by LBGT groups immediately.\n\nAccording to True Blood\u2019s own storyline, vampires have been evil, bigoted, cruel, and murderous for millennia. They have their own secret, manipulative agenda. They control events from dark corners. They quite literally have the power to brainwash people. Not surprisingly, the comparison to vampires is a classic staple of anti-Semitism. Indeed, some argue that Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula was one extended anti-Semitic caricature (a rich, manipulative, blood-sucking rootless cosmopolitan from Eastern Europe with a \u201chooked\u201d nose at a time of high Jewish immigration? Pure coincidence!). A fan of the show might say, \u201cOnly some vampires are evil, bigoted, cruel and murderous. There are nice vampires too.\u201d\n\nOkay, well. First the whole original storyline is about how Bill Compton is different than other vampires because he\u2019s noble and decent, suggesting the other vamps aren\u2019t. Second, try to make that kind of \u201cit\u2019s not all gays\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not all blacks\u201d or (outside of the Middle East, U.N. or, increasingly, MSNBC) \u201cit\u2019s not all Jews\u201d argument without sounding bigoted. Hey, I can\u2019t be anti-vampire, some of my best friends are vampires! And, third, let me explain something else: Shut up.\n\nIt reminds me of when 28 Weeks Later came out and everyone went gaga about how it was an extended anti-war metaphor of the Iraq invasion and the \u201cgreen zone.\u201d Few dwelled on the fact that in that metaphor the enemy \u2014 the zombies \u2014 must be shown no mercy and ruthlessly exterminated. They just thought it was cool that a zombie movie was making such an obvious reference to the war, or something.\n\n#page#Cool Is King\n\nAnd that I think is the source of the real problem here.
