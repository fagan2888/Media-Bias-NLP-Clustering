But how will the health care industry adapt to a much larger patient population? What strategies will hospital systems employ to ensure that the newly enrolled can receive the care that they need? How will hospitals adjust to a changing payment structure, moving from fee-for-service to value? And what will the role of ancillary care and outpatient centers mean in this new world of healthcare?\n\n[More Hospital of Tomorrow Forum coverage: usnews.com/hospitaloftomorrow]\n\nIn this break-out session at the U.S. News Hospital of Tomorrow forum, panelists addressed the issues surrounding absorbing the newly insured. Moderated by Joanne Kenen, health editor of Politico, the Wednesday morning panel included Wright L. Lassiter III, CEO of Alameda Health System, Nancy Schlichting, CEO of the Henry Ford Health System, and Richard J. Umbdenstock, President and CEO of the American Hospital Association.\n\nAneesh Chopra, who served as President Obama\u2019s first Chief Technology Officer, began with a few remarks. Chopra feels strongly that \u201cthis is the very best time to be an innovator in the American health system.\u201d In his view, this innovation is possible because of \u201cthe opening of data,\u201d \u201cthe digitization\u201d of that data, and a changing \u201cpayment model.\u201d According to Chopra, the question becomes, \u201cWill the uninsured sign up?\u201d And for those that do, how will hospital systems handle the load?\n\n\u201cMany are currently eligible for coverage but not taking advantage of it,\u201d Umbdenstock noted. \u201cThe reality is that many hospitals because of the impact of uncompensated care have already started to make the changes necessary to work with this otherwise now newly insured population.\u201d Because ultimately, he added, uninsured patients with emergent problems are \u201cthe biggest single financial hit a hospital can take.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefensively, it\u2019s a strategy to lose less money,\u201d Umbdenstock continued. \u201cSo hospitals have not been waiting.\u201d But the reality is that as the newly insured expect and require care, \u201chospitals will not be in a position to provide all the care.\u201d\n\nLassiter spoke to the initiatives Alameda has taken to provide care outside its hospital walls. The \u201cHope Center\u201d is an ambulatory intensive-care unit for \u201cchronically-ill patients with multiple morbidities,\u201d he explained; they represent patients who have repeatedly showed up at the ER for care, or who have had long hospital stays. \u201cWe\u2019re effectively taking them into a cohort that links pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and health professionals,\u201d he said. As a result, Alameda is providing these patients with better care at a much lower cost to their hospital.\n\nBut health care administrators are still grappling with solutions to problem of patients who are not willing to sign up for insurance. Schlichting, of the Henry Ford Health System, thinks that \u201cthey should be handled upfront.\u201d Yet, in a system designed to never turn away an ailing patient, who is handled and who is turned away before payment may be a question of how emergent the problem is.\n\nUltimately, panelists agreed that hospitals must work towards solutions that effectively reduce the number of uninsured patients relying upon emergency room care. In a market with thousands of newly insured, their viability depends on it.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"We all need a small amount of sodium to keep our bodies working properly \u2013 but too much is linked to heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Will the uninsured really sign up for Obamacare?
