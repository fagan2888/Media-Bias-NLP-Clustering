First hand accounts from those stuck outside counted the initial wave of protesters at 70, but the crowd grew into the hundreds.\n\nTrump supporter Walter Krokosz told Breitbart News, \u201cThey were very aggressive. When we were leaving there were a lot of people in cars, Mexican flags hanging out the windows. A guy was doing donuts and the intersection was shut down. We saw people marching through the intersection.\u201d Krokosz is a legal immigrant from Poland and a veteran of the U.S. Army, retired Chief Petty Officer.\n\nTrump supporters outside the rally sang patriotic songs. A group of 8 to 12-year-old kids for Trump called out cheers. One cheer blasted Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe Trump supporters were the peaceful people singing patriotic songs, festive and happy, while the protesters were very angry and high aggression. We were in line sharing stories as Wally gave away pins and shared stories of military service,\u201d rally attendee Terry Krokosz told Breitbart News.\n\nAt least one police car was vandalized, its windshield smashed. A man jumped on top of the vehicle in an effort to cause more damage. Then a group attempted to flip the car, according to CBS News.\n\nA group of seven or eight Free the Nipple protesters showed up. One had \u201cDump Trump\u201d written on her abdomen. They were yelling about equal rights for women.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters swarmed in front of the venue entrance, into the parking lot, and out onto the streets.\n\nReports on local radio 640 KFI from people who were in the middle of the protest controversy said TSA showed up. The radio host announced that protesters were jumping on cop cars and a police report detailed a cop car window being smashed. Another caller reported a protester smashing a car window with a rock and another jabbing someone in the face with a stick.\n\nOne man wearing a \u201cF**k Trump\u201d shirt was antagonizing rally-goers as early as three hours before the event.\n\nAs the final rally attendees were admitted to the venue, a surge of people pressed forward, prompting authorities to shut the gates. As this journalist approached the gates from inside the venue, what sounded like a warning from a stun gun emitted two short buzzes.\n\nThose inside the rally were shielded from the chaos that broke out during Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nOnly one report of a minor injury was relayed on local radio. The host commented on seeing four or five arrests but estimated that there must have been more.\n\nListen to the discussion of this on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anti-Trump Protests Rage, Mexican Flags Fly Outside CA Trump Rally", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Anti-Trump Protests Rage, Mexican Flags Fly Outside CA Trump Rally", "title": "Anti-Trump Protests Rage, Mexican Flags Fly Outside CA Trump Rally - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Costa-Mesa-protest-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-04-29T06:13:41-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/29/anti-trump-protests-rage-mexican-flags-fly-outside-ca-trump-rally/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anti-Trump Protests Rage, Mexican Flags Fly Outside CA Trump Rally", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Costa-Mesa-protest-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Anti-Trump Protests Rage, Mexican Flags Fly Outside CA Trump Rally - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "aggressive, angry, California, Costa Mesa, Donald Trump, Mexican flags, Orange County, protest,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,anti-Trump protests", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-29T00:06:38-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T06:13:41-07:00", "tag": "protest", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Trump supporters outside the rally sang patriotic songs.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThousands of Trump supporters were turned away as the venue reached capacity.\n\u201cThe Trump supporters were the peaceful people singing patriotic songs, festive and happy, while the protesters were very angry and high aggression.\nWhen we were leaving there were a lot of people in cars, Mexican flags hanging out the windows.\nFirst hand accounts from those stuck outside counted the initial wave of protesters at 70, but the crowd grew into the hundreds."}
