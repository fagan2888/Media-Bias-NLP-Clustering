All current Health Republic individual and small group policies remain in full effect through the end of 2015. Members can continue to see plan providers and claims will be paid under plan terms.\n\nThe federal government recently announced it would pay insurance companies only 12.6% of their risk corridor receivable for the 2014 plan year and has created industry-wide concern about when, or if the 2015 risk corridor would be paid.\n\n\u201cSince our inception in 2013, Health Republic designed and priced all our plans in reliance upon the risk sharing guarantees of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The government\u2019s refusal to honor its risk corridor obligations represents a negative financial impact of over $20 million,\u201d said Health Republic president and CEO Dawn Bonder. \u201cThis has placed us in a difficult financial position that could jeopardize our members and partners. As a result, we believe the most ethical step is for Health Republic to refrain from entering the market in 2016 and begin an orderly wind down of business.\u201d\n\nHealth Republic will work with the Oregon Insurance Division (OID) to ensure a smooth transition for members, employers, providers, partners and staff. The company will pay all claims through 2015 and plans to fulfill all financial obligations.\n\nHealth Republic has offered individual and small group insurance statewide, on and off exchange, for 2014 and 2015. Currently the plan serves nearly 15,000 members including employees from over 800 small businesses in Oregon.\n\nHealth Republic advises all individual policy holders to shop for new plans when Open Enrollment begins Nov. 1, 2015.\n\nFor more information on this transition, visit www.healthrepublicinsurance.org/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Republic Insurance of Oregon announced that it will no longer be offering plans in the state of Oregon on or off the state exchange.", "og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "Lake Oswego \u2013 Health Republic Insurance, a non-profit health insurance carrier, announced today that it will not offer small group or \u2026", "title": "Health Republic Insurance withdraws from market in 2016", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Health-Republic-Logo11.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-22T14:38:38+00:00", "url": "http://stateofreform.com/news/industry/exchanges/2015/10/health-republic-insurance-withdraws-from-market-in-2016/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health Republic Insurance of Oregon announced that it will no longer be offering plans in the state of Oregon on or off the state exchange.", "creator": "@StateofReform", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Health-Republic-Logo11.jpg", "title": "Health Republic Insurance withdraws from market in 2016 - State of Reform", "site": "@StateofReform", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 17821687}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/stateofreform/", "section": "Exchanges", "published_time": "2015-10-21T17:17:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T14:38:38+00:00"}, "OBKey": "12RjP7ip2KRyl5dliGRkEQ==", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb450\"", "article_summary": "Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Lake Oswego \u2013 Health Republic Insurance, a non-profit health insurance carrier, announced today that it will not offer small group or individual plans on or off exchange in 2016.\nAll current Health Republic individual and small group policies remain in full effect through the end of 2015.\nHealth Republic has offered individual and small group insurance statewide, on and off exchange, for 2014 and 2015.\nHealth Republic advises all individual policy holders to shop for new plans when Open Enrollment begins Nov. 1, 2015.\nThe government\u2019s refusal to honor its risk corridor obligations represents a negative financial impact of over $20 million,\u201d said Health Republic president and CEO Dawn Bonder."}
