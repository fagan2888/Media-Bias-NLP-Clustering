This, in turn, has provoked a debate over whether the Founders considered complete substitutes to be valid amendments. A recently-republished piece of evidence suggests that they did. The Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause requires that \u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\u201d Because the final version of Obamacare imposed a variety of taxes, it unquestionably was a \u201cBill for raising Revenue.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s taxes, appropriations, and health care regulations did not exist in the House-passed version of H.R. 3590. That incarnation of the bill was only a few pages long and was limited to making minor adjustments to the Internal Revenue Code irrelevant to health care. Under the guise of amendment, the Senate gutted the original language and substituted over 2,000 pages of Obamacare. Some writers argue that complete substitutions were not considered valid amendments during the Founding Era, while others contend that they were. Last year, I undertook a wide-ranging investigation into the subject that will be published within the next few weeks by the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy. The article is summarized at length here. I found that complete substitutions may have been unknown in the British Parliament, one source of the Constitution\u2019s House origination rule. I also found, however, that they were occasionally used in several states between Independence and the time the Constitution was ratified, and that they were considered valid amendments in those states. This year, the Wisconsin Historical Society issued two new volumes of the magisterial Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution. Those volumes cover the debate over the Constitution waged in Maryland from 1787 through the end of 1788. The first of the volumes reprints a pamphlet written in favor of the Constitution by \u201cAristides,\u201d the pen name of jurist Alexander Contee Hanson. Hanson was a respected figure in Maryland, and his pamphlet was read widely both in that state and in Virginia. At one point he addressed the question of whether the Constitutional Convention exceeded its authority on the (substantially false) assumption that the delegates\u2019 commissions had been limited to proposing amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Hanson argued that proposing a substitute was a recognized form of \u201camendment\u201d: Amendment, in parliamentary language, means either addition, or diminution, or striking out the whole, and substituting something in its room. Hanson\u2019s assertion is particularly relevant to the Constitution\u2019s original meaning because his own state legislature is not among those offering contemporaneous evidence of complete substitutions. Hanson was reflecting, in other words, an understanding that extended beyond his own state\u2019s boundaries. Unfortunately for advocates of Obamacare, the validity of complete substitutions as \u201cAmendments\u201d does not resolve the issue of constitutionality. During the Founding Era, even complete substitutes had to be connected to the subject matter of the original bill \u2013 or, in modern language, \u201cgermane\u201d to the original. Otherwise, they were new bills, not valid amendments. For reasons documented in my article, H.R. 3590 as passed by the House qualified constitutionally as a \u201cbill for raising Revenue\u201d (even though it was revenue-neutral) because it amended the tax code. Under Founding-Era rules, all the Senate\u2019s revenue changes were germane to the original, and therefore valid. However, the Senate-added appropriations and regulations were not germane to the subject of revenue. By including them, the Senate exceeded its authority to amend a \u201cbill for raising Revenue.\u201d This means that by the Founders\u2019 understanding of the Origination Clause, those additions were unconstitutional and void.
