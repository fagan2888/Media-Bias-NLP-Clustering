I'm Paul Thornton, and it is Saturday, Jan. 2, 2016. Here's a look back \u2014 to last year! \u2014 at the week in Opinion.\n\nIf The Times' editorial board wants its New Year's wishes to come true, should it even say what they are?\n\nThe question comes to mind reading the editorial board's assessment of its hopes for 2015 (a process it describes as \"sobering\") and reflects on the wishes that didn't come true \u2014 immigration reform, more accessible Supreme Court arguments, high turnout in local elections \u2014 and acknowledges the handful that did.\n\nBut since hope springs eternal \u2014 especially at the start of 2016 \u2014 the editorial board has published its wishes for this year. They range from serious \u2014 closing Guantanamo Bay prison and ending veteran homelessness \u2014 to whimsical, including \"a roster full of Clayton Kershaws\" for the Dodgers, and snow. Here are several more things the editorial board would like to see in 2016:\n\nFaster growth in the U.S. and California economies. As 2014 drew to a close and the national unemployment rate fell below 6%, we saw the first tentative signs that wages were starting to grow. That's a trend worth nurturing, considering how long wages have stagnated for low- and middle-income Americans. A concerted effort by the Legislature and the Los Angeles City Council to make it as easy to start a business here as it is to move to Texas. Pope Francis to give the news media a break by preaching the occasional boring sermon. Rain. Lots of it. An overhaul of the federal tax code that broadens the tax base by winnowing the thicket of tax breaks, allowing lawmakers to lower rates without driving up the deficit. An end to the impasse between Time Warner Cable and other local pay-TV operators that kept Los Angeles Dodgers games off most of their fans' TVs. The Supreme Court to stop hinting and issue a definitive ruling that bans on same-sex marriage violate the Constitution's guarantee of due process of law and equal protection of the laws. Critics of Obamacare to stop trying to repeal the law or render it unworkable through the courts. Instead, Republicans should use their control of Congress to address the act's shortcomings and do more to slow the growth of healthcare costs. One bug that needs fixing right away: the lack of premium subsidies for those who have access to affordable individual policies at work, but not affordable family coverage. It would be especially gratifying \u2014 though probably unlikely \u2014 if Republicans would use their clout in general to govern responsibly rather than to engage in pointless confrontation with the president.

He writes: \"While memories of Hannah remain, like the comfort of lingering smoke from a favorite candle, the year's end will be coaxing us to throw open the windows and clear the air for rebirth and renewal. But I don't want to clear the air. I want to remember. I want to slow it all down and just sit for a while, not moving until I'm ready, not talking about it until I can get the words right.\" L.A. Times\n\nDiana Wagman can't keep it together on New Year's Eve. She writes of never shedding a tear during Linus' monologue on the true meaning of Christmas and crassly making jokes about the disabled Tiny Tim. But come Dec. 31, her tough, unsentimental exterior cracks: \"I am undone by the realization that another year has passed. So many resolutions made and broken. So many things I should have done but didn't. I should have worked harder and complained less. I should have exercised more and eaten less. I should have been a better friend, a better partner and a better mother.\" L.A. Times\n\nThese pictures might add \"become a vegetarian\" to your list of New Year's resolutions. Artist Mishka Henner stitched together publicly available satellite images to create high-resolution pictures that capture how the meat industry alters vast swaths of land. Henner writes: \"When I think of these pictures, I don't just see gigantic farms; I see an attitude toward life and death that exists throughout contemporary culture. These images reflect a blueprint and a horror that lie at the heart of the way we live.\" L.A. Times\n\nCollege kids today really do have a reason to protest \u2014 and tax-averse baby boomers might be a cause. In the 1960s, writes William H. Frey, most college demonstrators actually benefited from the status quo; for today's increasingly diverse student bodies, that's less true. Older baby boomers appear so intent on reducing their tax burdens that they're failing to invest in the educational systems that served them, creating a racial generation gap that must be bridged to avoid a crisis in this country. L.A. Times\n\nThat billowing methane cloud over Porter Ranch is a reminder of how un-sexy fighting climate change can be. Gov. Jerry Brown might get attention and praise for his grand talk about saving the planet, but the natural gas leak in a remote corner of Los Angeles shows that old-fashioned, local vigilance \u2014 like, say, a pipe inspection that could have prevented the Porter Ranch disaster \u2014 is a potent weapon in battling climate change.
