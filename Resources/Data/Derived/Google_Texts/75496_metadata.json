Then three Asian-American kids were brought onstage for a gag mocking them as ethnic stereotypes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like going on a road trip with your fun friend, and halfway to Vegas he pulls over and shoots you in the leg,\u201d Khan said, recalling her reaction to last weekend\u2019s ceremony. \u201cIt was completely shocking and just so unnecessary.\u201d\n\nRock\u2019s skit ignited an outcry from Asian-Americans and others angered by its stereotyping and, more broadly, frustrated by how non-black minorities are portrayed \u2014 or ignored \u2014 by Hollywood, especially movie studios.\n\nThe response also has illuminated the gap between African-Americans, who have made some on-screen gains, and the lagging progress by other minorities, including Asian-American, Latinos and Native Americans.\n\nPhil Yu, who observes Hollywood as part of his Angry Asian Man blog, said he welcomed the #OscarsSoWhite protest against this year\u2019s all-white slate of acting nominees. But, as in years past, Yu said he was struck anew by the greater challenge Asian-Americans face.\n\n\u201cWhen I watch the Oscars as an Asian-American, I think, \u2018It must be kind of nice to be disappointed that there were roles to be overlooked.\u2019 I wonder what that feeling is like, because I can name no Asian-Americans that were in contention,\u201d he said.\n\nThat perception is borne out by a comprehensive study released last month by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nAt least half of all movie, TV or streamed projects from September 2014 to August 2015 lacked even one speaking or named Asian or Asian-American character, the study found. By comparison, 22 percent didn\u2019t include any such roles for black characters. Of lead characters that were minorities in 100-plus movies, nearly 66 percent were black and 6.3 percent were Asian.\n\nIn the U.S. population, African-Americans are a greater percentage, 12.3 percent, to about 5 percent for Asians.\n\nBut Rock\u2019s attack on the industry\u2019s diversity failures was fully black-centric, from one-liners to Black History Month skits. Then came the tuxedoed Asian-American kids, whom Rock presented as the \u201cdedicated, accurate\u201d accounting team that tallied Oscar votes, adding, \u201cIf anybody\u2019s upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone, which was also made by these kids.\u201d\n\nBasketball player Jeremy Lin did just that. \u201cSeriously though, when is this going to change?!? Tired of it being \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cok\u201d to bash Asians,\u201d he posted on his Twitter account.\n\nRock declined a follow-up interview through his publicist. And the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as well as the ceremony\u2019s producers, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRock had company at the Oscars. Presenter Sacha Baron Cohen, in character as Ali G, made a sexually demeaning crack about \u201clittle yellow people.\u201d Despite his pretense of talking about Minions, the cartoon characters, it was considered a slap at Asians.\n\nSuch humor, especially from the host, made the evening\u2019s \u201crelentlessly black and white\u201d take on diversity even more disheartening, said Daniel Mayeda, co-chair of the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition. To an extent, that dual focus parallels the movie industry itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals deeper diversity woes", "author": "Lynn Elber", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals deeper diversity woes", "title": "Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals deeper diversity woes", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/asian_american_jab_at_oscars_reveals_deeper_diversity_woes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/asians-hollywood.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals deeper diversity woes", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/asians-hollywood.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals deeper diversity woes", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals deeper diversity woes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By comparison, 22 percent didn\u2019t include any such roles for black characters.\nOf lead characters that were minorities in 100-plus movies, nearly 66 percent were black and 6.3 percent were Asian.\nThe response also has illuminated the gap between African-Americans, who have made some on-screen gains, and the lagging progress by other minorities, including Asian-American, Latinos and Native Americans.\nBut Rock\u2019s attack on the industry\u2019s diversity failures was fully black-centric, from one-liners to Black History Month skits.\nThen three Asian-American kids were brought onstage for a gag mocking them as ethnic stereotypes."}
