(WIVB) \u2014 New federal guidelines will soon require many restaurants nationwide to post calorie counts for food and drinks on their menus. The menu labeling rule is part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe FDA wants to make you more aware of the calories that you are not only eating, but drinking.\n\nAt Gramma Mora\u2019s- a Mexican restaurant on Hertel Avenue, the message is: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to go out to eat- and it\u2019s even more fun to have a margarita with your meal,\u201d says Owner, Liz Giovino.\n\nCome December, many restaurants nationwide will be required to post calorie counts on their drink lists. It\u2019s something some restaurant go-ers say they plan to ignore.\n\nIrinia Arias from Buffalo says, \u201cI think they put it there for a reason, but i don\u2019t think anybody is really going to pay attention to it.\u201d\n\nThe regulations will apply to all chain restaurants and bars with at least 20 locations. But Giovino doesn\u2019t believe it will impact Buffalo\u2019s restaurant industry.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be people who are watching calories, but when most people go out to eat they are going to realize there are going to be calories they are going to have. You just have to be smart to decide what choices you\u2019re going to have,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth experts say these new requirements will help combat the country\u2019s obesity epidemic by showing just how many calories lurk in your favorite food and drinks.\n\nOwner Charlie Giovino says the impact should be minor, since people who eat out already know they\u2019re indulging.\n\n\u201cIf people are going to go out to dinner and they are going to come to our restaurant, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re really going to be interested in that,\u201d he says.\n\nNew York City began requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus in 2006, and now the rest of the country will soon follow suit.\n\nWhether menu labeling has any effect on health is still an open question; some studies have shown it has no impact. But a 2008 study at Starbucks showed a drop in average calories purchased after calorie content was posted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FDA wants to make you more aware of the calories that you are not only eating, but drinking.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "The FDA wants to make you more aware of the calories that you are not only eating, but drinking.", "title": "New guidelines require calorie count for food and drinks", "url": "http://wivb.com/2015/04/20/new-federal-guidelines-require-restaurants-to-post-calorie-count-for-food-and-drinks/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wine.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA wants to make you more aware of the calories that you are not only eating, but drinking.", "creator": "@news4buffalo", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wine.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "New guidelines require calorie count for food and drinks", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16", "application-name": "wivb.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2015-04-20T22:14:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T22:38:07+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BUFFALO, N.Y.
