He was going to catch passes from Peyton Manning, a dream of his since college.\n\nExcept it hasn\u2019t quite happened like that. Davis hasn\u2019t caught a pass from Manning in three games with his new team. Instead, the veteran tight end has developed impeccable rhythm with quarterback Brock Osweiler, who was thrust into the starting lineup last Sunday at Chicago with Manning sidelined because of foot and rib injuries.\n\nWhen Davis first arrived from San Francisco he spent a lot of time working with the second team as he got acclimated to a new offense, one much different than the 49ers ran. He caught his first pass as a Bronco from Osweiler in a blowout loss against Kansas City two weeks ago. But perhaps the most important first catch came in practice a week earlier on a pass delivered by Osweiler.\n\n\u201cIt was a corner route and it was perfect,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Good route Vernon.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThat might be why Osweiler and Davis, who have played together only two weeks, are already in sync.\n\nOsweiler targeted Davis six times in the Broncos\u2019 17-15 win last Sunday at Chicago, all of them catches for a total of 68 yards.\n\n\u201cSometimes it takes awhile to get on the same page and develop that chemistry with a quarterback,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut with this guy, it\u2019s like we connected from Day One.\u201d\n\nWhen the Broncos acquired Davis via trade, everything was peachy. He was leaving a 2-6 team that was in turmoil and ready to bench its starting quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, to join a 7-0 Broncos team coming off their best win of the season, a 29-10 drubbing of the Packers.\n\nThen things started to go south. The Broncos lost consecutive games and lost Manning to injury. Plus, Davis wasn\u2019t getting a lot of snaps as he adjusted to a new offense.\n\n\u201cEverything that is difficult turns out to be really good,\u201d said Davis, who had played every snap of his career in San Francisco after being drafted sixth overall in 2006. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of being here and I saw it right away. I was like, \u2018Wow, I dreamed of being in a place like this, a system, a coach who understands talent.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid of the timeshare, either. Tight end Owen Daniels began to play his best football upon Davis\u2019 arrival, but the two agreed early on that there would be enough passes to go around, especially with a coach such as Kubiak who likes to emphasis passing to the tight end.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m used to in my career in Coach Kubiak\u2019s offense \u2014 a lot of two-tight end, three-tight end sets,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s been so fun to play in this offense with him. I\u2019m just hoping we continue to do more of it.\u201d\n\nDenver struggled to fill the gaping hole left by the departure of tight end Julius Thomas in the offseason. That\u2019s a big part of the reason general manager John Elway traded for Davis.\n\nDaniels and Davis were the Broncos\u2019 leading receivers against Chicago, providing the weapons Osweiler desperately needed with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders out because of an injury.\n\nDavis believes the best is yet to come. Chemistry, trust and timing should only get better with practice.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Vernon Davis developing speedy chemistry with Brock Osweiler", "title": "Vernon Davis developing speedy chemistry with Brock Osweiler", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/vernon-davis-developing-speedy-chemistry-with-brock-osweiler/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__Vernon-Davisp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__Vernon-Davisp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T14:34:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:41:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSometimes it takes awhile to get on the same page and develop that chemistry with a quarterback,\u201d Davis said.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Good route Vernon.\u2019 \u201cThat might be why Osweiler and Davis, who have played together only two weeks, are already in sync.\nVernon Davis arrived in Denver like an 8-year-old on Christmas morning, eager with anticipation at taking the next step in his career.\nI\u2019m just hoping we continue to do more of it.\u201dDenver struggled to fill the gaping hole left by the departure of tight end Julius Thomas in the offseason.\n\u201cBut with this guy, it\u2019s like we connected from Day One.\u201dWhen the Broncos acquired Davis via trade, everything was peachy."}
