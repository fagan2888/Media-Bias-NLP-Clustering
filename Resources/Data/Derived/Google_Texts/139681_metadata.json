My reluctant response \u2014 \u201cWhen would I do that?\u201d \u2014 was rejoined with \u201cMonday afternoons at 4,\u201d at a friend\u2019s home not three minutes\u2019 walk from my own. I agreed to give it a try.\n\nMy mother had taught me to knit at 15, and I knitted in class throughout college and for a few years thereafter. Then decades passed without my touching a knitting needle. But within two Mondays in the group, I was hooked, not only on knitting but also on crocheting, and I was on my way to becoming a highly productive crafter.\n\nI have made countless afghans, baby blankets, sweaters, vests, shawls, scarves, hats, mittens, caps for newborns and two bedspreads. I take a yarn project with me everywhere, especially when I have to sit still and listen. As I had discovered in college, when my hands are busy, my mind stays focused on the here and now.\n\nIt seems, too, that I\u2019m part of a national resurgence of interest in needle and other handicrafts, and not just among grannies like me. The Craft Yarn Council reports that a third of women ages 25 to 35 now knit or crochet. Even men and schoolchildren are swelling the ranks, among them my friend\u2019s three grandsons, ages 6, 7 and 9.\n\nLast April, the council created a \u201cStitch Away Stress\u201d campaign in honor of National Stress Awareness Month. Dr. Herbert Benson, a pioneer in mind/body medicine and author of \u201cThe Relaxation Response,\u201d says that the repetitive action of needlework can induce a relaxed state like that associated with meditation and yoga. Once you get beyond the initial learning curve, knitting and crocheting can lower heart rate and blood pressure and reduce harmful blood levels of the stress hormone cortisol.\n\nBut unlike meditation, craft activities result in tangible and often useful products that can enhance self-esteem. I keep photos of my singular accomplishments on my cellphone to boost my spirits when needed.\n\nSince the 1990s, the council has surveyed hundreds of thousands of knitters and crocheters, who routinely list stress relief and creative fulfillment as the activities\u2019 main benefits. Among them is the father of a daughter born prematurely who reported that during the baby\u2019s five weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, \u201clearning how to knit preemie hats gave me a sense of purpose during a time that I felt very helpless. It\u2019s a hobby that I\u2019ve stuck with, and it continues to help me cope with stress at work, provide a sense of order in hectic days, and allows my brain time to solve problems.\u201d\n\nKaren Zila Hayes, a life coach in Toronto, conducts knitting therapy programs, including \u201cKnit to Quit\u201d to help smokers give up the habit, and \u201cKnit to Heal\u201d for people coping with health crises, like a cancer diagnosis or a family member\u2019s serious illness. Schools and prisons with craft programs report that they have a calming effect and enhance social skills. And having to follow instructions on complex craft projects can improve children\u2019s math skills.\n\nSome people find that craftwork helps them control their weight. Just as it is challenging to smoke while knitting, when hands are holding needles and hooks, there\u2019s less snacking and mindless eating out of boredom.\n\nI\u2019ve found that my handiwork with yarn has helped my arthritic fingers remain more dexterous as I age. A woman encouraged to try knitting and crocheting after developing an autoimmune disease that caused a lot of hand pain reported on the Craft Yarn Council site that her hands are now less stiff and painful.\n\nBetsan Corkhill, a wellness coach in Bath, England, and author of the book \u201cKnit for Health & Wellness,\u201d established a website, Stitchlinks, to explore the value of what she calls therapeutic knitting. Among her respondents, 54 percent of those who were clinically depressed said that knitting made them feel happy or very happy. In a study of 60 self-selected people with chronic pain, Corkhill and colleagues reported that knitting enabled them to redirect their focus, reducing their awareness of pain. She suggested that the brain can process just so much at once and that activities like knitting and crocheting make it harder for the brain to register pain signals. More of Stitchlinks findings are available at their website.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is research that suggests that crafts like knitting and crocheting may help to stave off a decline in brain function with age. In a 2011 study, researchers led by Dr. Yonas E. Geda, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, interviewed a random sample of 1,321 people ages 70 to 89, most of whom were cognitively normal, about the cognitive activities they engaged in late in life. The study, published in The Journal of Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences, found that those who engaged in crafts like knitting and crocheting had a diminished chance of developing mild cognitive impairment and memory loss.\n\nAlthough it is possible that only people who are cognitively healthy would pursue such activities, those who read newspapers or magazines or played music did not show similar benefits. The researchers speculate that craft activities promote the development of neural pathways in the brain that help to maintain cognitive health.\n\nGiven that sustained social contacts have been shown to support health and longevity, those wishing to maximize the health value of crafts might consider joining a group of like-minded folks. I for one try not to miss a single weekly meeting of my knitting group.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/02/knitting.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The researchers speculate that craft activities promote the development of neural pathways in the brain that help to maintain cognitive health.\nBut unlike meditation, craft activities result in tangible and often useful products that can enhance self-esteem.\nThe Craft Yarn Council reports that a third of women ages 25 to 35 now knit or crochet.\nPerhaps most exciting is research that suggests that crafts like knitting and crocheting may help to stave off a decline in brain function with age.\nAmong her respondents, 54 percent of those who were clinically depressed said that knitting made them feel happy or very happy."}
