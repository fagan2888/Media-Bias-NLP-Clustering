Last week Republican presidential candidate Ted "T-Bone" Cruz complained in New Hampshire that he was uninsured because of Barack Hussein Obama's sinister Affordable Care Act .

A Cruz spokeswoman confirmed the candidate never lost coverage and said he had "believed the family was uninsured" because of information he'd been given by Blue Cross.
