It passed largely along party lines on a vote of 246-181. All but three Democrats opposed the measure.\n\nGroundhog Day comparisons ran abound Tuesday, which coincidentally fell on the Feb. 2 holiday that has become associated with the popular Bill Murray film.\n\nIf it already felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with the do-over for the Iran measure, the Groundhog Day comparisons didn\u2019t stop there. The House also voted once again Tuesday on legislation to repeal ObamaCare in an attempt to override President Obama\u2019s veto.\n\nDemocrats repeatedly seized upon Groundhog Day references during floor debate to mock Republicans for holding more than 60 votes since taking over the House majority in 2011 to undermine the healthcare law.\n\n\u201cHere we go again. And again. And again. How fitting it is that we\u2019re here on Groundhog Day,\u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\n\n\u201cHow appropriate that the House Republican leadership decided to vote again on repealing the Affordable Care Act and defunding Planned Parenthood on Groundhog Day,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).\n\nLike the healthcare law repeal measure, the Obama administration has issued a veto threat of the Iran legislation and warned it would hinder its ability to implement the nuclear accord.\n\n\u201cBy preventing the United States from fulfilling its JCPOA commitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse of a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\u201d the White House said in a Statement of Administration Policy.\n\nThe U.S. and other global powers already began lifting sanctions against Iran\u2019s financial and oil sectors in late January after the United Nations\u2019s nuclear watchdog certified that the country had sufficiently dismantled parts of its nuclear program.\n\nThe Obama administration also issued new sanctions around the same time as punishment for Iran\u2019s recent ballistic missile tests.\n\nThe legislation authored by Rep. Steve Russell (R-Okla.) was originally scheduled in the aftermath of the ballistic missile tests. Had there not been a tardiness problem, the House would have passed the measure before the easing of the sanctions.\n\nRyan lectured lawmakers a week before closing the original vote on the importance of being on time for House proceedings, saying it would \u201chelp with the maintenance of the institution.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), had similarly chastised lawmakers on House rules and decorum \u2014 particularly when it came to the dress code.\n\nBut lawmakers largely didn\u2019t face any consequences for tardiness, even though Boehner lamented it as an \u201congoing problem.\u201d The 15-minute minimum for the first vote in a series usually turned into about 30 minutes as lawmakers ambled across the street from their offices.\n\nAfter nearly three months of letting the pattern continue under his Speakership, Ryan is now enforcing the 15-minute rule.\n\nThe first votes of the two series on Tuesday were both gaveled down after about 20 minutes. The first vote of the week Monday night also wrapped up after 17 minutes.\n\nMore lawmakers appeared to have learned their lesson: Only 79 lawmakers missed Monday night\u2019s vote compared to last month\u2019s 137.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, all but seven lawmakers made it to the House floor.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is enforcing timeliness.", "description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is enforcing timeliness.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is enforcing timeliness.", "title": "House conducts do-over of Iran sanctions vote", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/267970-house-conducts-do-over-of-iran-sanctions-vote", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T18:25:21-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T18:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/267970-house-conducts-do-over-of-iran-sanctions-vote", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-02T18:06-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Iran,Paul Ryan,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-02T18:06:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T18:25:21-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/267970-house-conducts-do-over-of-iran-sanctions-vote", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is enforcing timeliness.", "card": "summary", "title": "House conducts do-over of Iran sanctions vote"}, "dcterms.title": "House conducts do-over of Iran sanctions vote"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf71f\"", "article_summary": "If it already felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with the do-over for the Iran measure, the Groundhog Day comparisons didn\u2019t stop there.\nADVERTISEMENTHouse GOP leaders consequently opted to vacate last month\u2019s vote due to the number of absences and offer members another chance to be on time.\nGroundhog Day comparisons ran abound Tuesday, which coincidentally fell on the Feb. 2 holiday that has become associated with the popular Bill Murray film.\nHow fitting it is that we\u2019re here on Groundhog Day,\u201d said Rep.
