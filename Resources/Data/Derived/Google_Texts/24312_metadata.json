John Kelly, commander of U.S. Southern Command.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have that ability to track these folks,\u201d Kelly said at a Pentagon briefing on Thursday.\n\nRelated: This Lethal Laser Could Take Out ISIS and Other Enemies\n\nKelly said he worries whomever is radicalized enough to leave for Syria would return with greater terrorism skills and motivations.\n\n\u201cI would suspect they\u2019ll get good at, while they\u2019re in Syria, get good at killing and pick up some real job skills in terms of explosives and beheadings and things like that. And everyone\u2019s concerned, of course, if they come home. Because if they went over radicalized one would suspect they\u2019ll come home at least that radicalized.\u201d\n\nThere is no indication of any scheme to attack the United States he said, but Americans \u201ctake for granted\u201d the nation\u2019s functioning legal system, agencies like the FBI and the layers of uncorrupt law enforcement that can monitor and track potential terrorists like in the United States. \u201cA lot of these countries just don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nRelated: 3 Hidden Messages Behind ISIS's Bloody Rampages\n\nKelly said that some of the fighters are recruited and radicalized off the Internet but that there are \u201ca couple of pretty radical mosques\u201d in the region, as well. \u201cA hundred certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, it\u2019s not, but the countries they come from have [a] total inability to deal with it,\u201d he said, naming Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, Surinam and Venezuela, in particular.\n\nWith little military threats to the United States in his region, Kelly is a frequent advocate for helping law enforcement attack the network \u2014 and root causes \u2014 of illegal drug and human trafficking into the United States. People, he said, travel freely and \u201csimply walk across borders\u201d in some cases where there is little to stop them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old story of you gotta watch them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CIA,FBI and people like that do a really good job tracking the networks, but you know it only takes \u2013 look, there\u2019s a lot of people coming and going, it only takes one to cause you problems.\u201d\n\nRelated: Iraqi Forces Have ISIS on the Run in Tikrit\n\nWith those caveats, Kelly\u2019s concern does not reflect \u2018ISIS at the border\u2019 alarmism, rather he casts a watchful eye on the potential trouble of South American, Central American and Caribbean states in tracking returning fighters for themselves. The solution to preventing ISIS from coming through the southern hemisphere will require law enforcement and intelligence partnering with every state in the region, he said.\n\n\u201cThe network that comes up through the isthmus and Mexico that carries anything and everything on it \u2026 the amount of movement is what I think overwhelms our ability \u2013 and the sophistication of the network \u2013 overwhelms our ability to stop everything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think if they get back to some of these countries that I\u2019ve described, it\u2019s pretty easy.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in Defense One.\n\nRead more at Defense One:\n\nPentagon to Launch Hacker Proof Helicopter Drone\n\nSenate Panel Launches Cybersecurity Bill\n\nDon't Blow Up An Effective Iran Bill", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top US commander warns Caribbean and South American countries are unable to track 10", "title": "Why We Have to Worry About ISIS South of the Border", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/13/Why-We-Have-Worry-About-ISIS-South-Border", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01222015_Iraq_Kurds.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/13/Why-We-Have-Worry-About-ISIS-South-Border", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01222015_Iraq_Kurds.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A top US commander warns Caribbean and South American countries are unable to track 10", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf60\"", "article_summary": "A top US commander warns Caribbean and South American countries are unable to track 100 foreign fighters that could return from Syria.\nWith little military threats to the United States in his region, Kelly is a frequent advocate for helping law enforcement attack the network \u2014 and root causes \u2014 of illegal drug and human trafficking into the United States.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have that ability to track these folks,\u201d Kelly said at a Pentagon briefing on Thursday.\nThe solution to preventing ISIS from coming through the southern hemisphere will require law enforcement and intelligence partnering with every state in the region, he said.\nRelated: This Lethal Laser Could Take Out ISIS and Other EnemiesKelly said he worries whomever is radicalized enough to leave for Syria would return with greater terrorism skills and motivations."}
