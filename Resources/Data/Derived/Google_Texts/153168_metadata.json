In theory, however, that is supposed to lower the cost of care to everyone else who is now subsidizing indigent care through higher premiums and higher charges for care.\n\nDoctors are retiring or leaving small practices for larger ones over frustrations with insurers that started before the ACA \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 went into effect, leaving more vacancies in medical office parks.\n\nOther area businesses that provide products or services to health care providers see opportunities if demand increases for surgical devices or other technology used by practitioners, but in the case of medical device manufacturers, they also face added taxes they say will slow growth.\n\nThen there are the same issues that Gainesville shares with the broader economy regarding insurance costs to businesses, consumers who will pay more or less based on their circumstances, and the potential for a healthier, productive workforce.\n\nIn 2011, health care and social assistance establishments accounted for 26 percent of private-sector workers and 36 percent of the payroll in the Gainesville metro area, with 20,774 employees making $1.02 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nUF Health Shands Hospital provides $80 million to $100 million in unreimbursed care out of an annual budget of about $1.1 billion, said Dr. David Guzick, president of UF Health.\n\nFlorida has 3.8 million uninsured people, or 25 percent of the population, including 45,000 in Alachua County.\n\nOn one hand, the cost to care for those people is borne by those who can pay, so the hospital gets paid either way. On the other hand, the care uninsured people receive often costs more since they tend to wait until late into their illnesses to seek emergency treatment that costs more to provide. If more people were insured and received ongoing care earlier, the hospital would save money, Guzick said.\n\n\u201cOur revenues would not change, but our costs would decline,\u201d Guzick said.\n\nIf UF Health were able to save a fraction of those unreimbursed costs, it would invest it back into faculty, equipment, research and construction, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, if it were working, would be better for us, and we hope it will work,\u201d Guzick said.\n\nUF Health has trained counselors to help people who are interested in signing up for insurance through the ACA health care exchange.\n\nThe complexity and requirements of the ACA will challenge small medical practices, causing some doctors to retire or leave small practices for large practices, said Dr. Norman Levy, president of the Alachua County Medical Society. The needed structural changes should result in increased hiring, purchasing and investments in the larger medical operations.\n\nPhysicians already are overwhelmed with insurance company demands that Levy said interfere with their ability to determine the best course of treatment and medications, and the ACA will present similar challenges.\n\nRealtor Beau Beery of Coldwell Banker Commercial M.M. Parrish Realtors said there has been a significant increase in office vacancies in medical parks this year as the shift already has begun.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so riddled with regulations that what they entered the career to do \u2014 which was to help people \u2014 has become so difficult that they don\u2019t want the extra hassle of ownership and the stress of it, so let me just go and help people and get a salary and be done at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nBeery said the property owners face a conundrum. They can convert medical offices \u2014 which have small exam rooms, sinks in every room and Formica countertops \u2014 to general office space, \u201cbut not many general office people want to be in medical parks.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the owners have less income for development or to purchase other assets.\n\n\u201cIt just ripples all over the place,\u201d Beery said.\n\nAmong local businesses that count medical practices among their customers, two of the largest \u2014 RTI Surgical and Exactech \u2014 expect to pay $2 million and $1.6 million respectively this year for the medical device tax to pay for ACA insurance subsidies, money that won\u2019t be available to invest in new employees and product development.\n\nAnother company, AxoGen, has said that business for its surgical products could increase if more of the newly insured received peripheral nerve repair surgery.\n\nRegisterPatient already has benefited from requirements for physicians to adopt electronic medical records.\n\nShadow Health faces conflicting forces on the demand for its software to train nursing students, said Chief Financial Officer Patrick Bizub. Demand for new nurses that is already high could increase as the newly insured seek more care, but insurers have been cutting reimbursement rates while demanding more skills, licensing and educational requirements.\n\nPlus, university systems struggle to recruit qualified educators to expand nursing programs, he said.\n\nFor the broader business community, companies in industries that have not traditionally offered health insurance, such as restaurants and construction companies, are wrestling with staffing and hours since the ACA requires those with 50 or more employees to offer insurance.\n\nIn an October interview, Jim Painter of Painter Masonry said they are holding their employee count to 48 so they can continue to compete with smaller companies when bidding for jobs.\n\nKeith Lynn Hodge, senior agent at Ference Insurance Agency, has been helping small businesses weigh their options.\n\nHodge said businesses that are renewing group insurance plans are seeing smaller rate increases this year \u2014 in the range of 7.5-8.2 percent \u2014 compared with 18-32 percent for this year\u2019s rates. That is more in line with the 6-10 percent annual rate increases he said he has seen over his 17 years in the business.\n\nOther companies are weighing whether it is better to offer insurance or send employees to the exchange, he said. In one case, the exchange would be a better option for an employee who would qualify for a federal subsidy for her and her children, but who would have to pay for 100 percent of the cost of her children\u2019s insurance through the group plan.\n\nAt another company, the owner wants to provide insurance to a valuable employee who would not qualify for a subsidy because of his income but might otherwise move to a larger company that offers insurance.\n\n\u201cHowever they get covered is definitely a good thing,\u201d Hodge said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With such a large health care sector in Gainesville, what effect \u2014 if any \u2014 could the Affordable Care Act have on the local economy?", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-4EB65F52-86CF-4B9D-88D8-532834869DF0-pubGS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Gainesville.com", "description": "With such a large health care sector in Gainesville, what effect \u2014 if any \u2014 could the Affordable Care Act have on the local economy?", "title": "How the Affordable Care Act is affecting Gainesville", "url": "http://www.gainesville.com/article/20131124/ARTICLES/131129760", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/GS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20131124, "fb": {"admins": 100001603422190, "app_id": 191331304228818}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-131129760-pubGS"}}, "keywords": "GAINESVILLE (FL),  Article"}, "article_summary": "With such a large health care sector in Gainesville, what effect \u2014 if any \u2014 could the Affordable Care Act have on the local economy?\nUF Health has trained counselors to help people who are interested in signing up for insurance through the ACA health care exchange.\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, if it were working, would be better for us, and we hope it will work,\u201d Guzick said.\nIn 2011, health care and social assistance establishments accounted for 26 percent of private-sector workers and 36 percent of the payroll in the Gainesville metro area, with 20,774 employees making $1.02 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nIn theory, however, that is supposed to lower the cost of care to everyone else who is now subsidizing indigent care through higher premiums and higher charges for care."}
