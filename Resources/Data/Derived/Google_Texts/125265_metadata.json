Barack Obama\u2019s mischief was methodical.\n\nFour days before the 1966 congressional elections, Johnson, asked about criticism from Richard Nixon, testily responded: \u201cI do not want to get into a debate . . . with a chronic campaigner like Mr. Nixon.\u201d Johnson\u2019s disparagement endeared Nixon to Republican voters, thereby propelling him toward the presidency.\n\nFour days before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, Obama improved Donald Trump\u2019s standing with Republicans by volubly deploring him and cannily placing him in the Republican mainstream: \u201cHe says in more interesting ways what the other [Republican] candidates are saying.\u201d Not exactly.\n\nCertainly not last week when Trump said, \u201cI like the [Obamacare] mandate.\u201d He thereby disparaged one of conservatism\u2019s greatest recent achievements \u2014 persuading five Supreme Court justices that the mandate is not justifiable as a regulation of interstate commerce, so the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause is not an infinitely elastic empowerment of Congress.\n\n[Danielle Allen: The moment of truth: We must stop Trump]\n\nDonald Trump won the Feb. 20 South Carolina GOP primary. Here's how. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump was not saying \u201cwhat the other candidates are saying\u201d when last week he said: \u201cEvery single other [Republican] candidate is going to cut the hell out of your Social Security.\u201d Trump so relishes causing Republican wreckage that he went on to attack House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.). Recalling the Democrats\u2019 2011 ad depicting a Ryan-like figure pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair off a cliff, Trump suggested that the ad was fair commentary on Ryan\u2019s proposed entitlement reforms. Trump\u2019s plan for reforming entitlements probably is to get Mexico to pay for them, after it finances \u201cThe Wall.\u201d\n\nMany South Carolina evangelicals, like those in Iowa, showed, shall we say, Christian forgiveness toward Trump, who boasts of his sexual athleticism, embraces torture and promises to kill terrorists\u2019 families. Or perhaps these remarkable evangelicals think his myriad conversions-of-convenience (his serial adjustments of his \u201cconvictions\u201d in time for this campaign) constitute being \u201cborn again.\u201d This is an interesting interpretation of John 3:7.\n\nAs the Republican Party contemplates putting forward this florid face, the Democratic Party, clinging to Hillary Clinton like a shipwrecked sailor clinging to a spar, celebrates her Nevada achievement. \u2018Twas a famous victory.\n\nTrailing clouds of seediness sufficient already to have convinced 56 percent of Americans that she is neither honest nor trustworthy, Clinton won only 53 percent against an opponent who says that, after seven years of a Democratic presidency, America is a fetid swamp of rising inequality and multiplying injustices. Criticizing Bernie Sanders for criticizing Obama, Clinton promises continuity with an administration that (according to a Gallup poll this month) has convinced 71 percent of likely general election voters that America is on the wrong track.\n\n[Five myths Donald Trump tells about Donald Trump]\n\nHer Nevada triumph was sealed by African Americans, and she evidently plans to erase Sanders by stoking racial insecurities and grievances. If she plans to win the presidency by reassembling and reinvigorating the Obama coalition, she has work to do with another component of it: In three contests now, Sanders has crushed her among 18- to 29-year-olds, voters most of whom are too young to remember either her husband or when she was not an establishment fixture.\n\nThe Republican process of picking Clinton\u2019s opponent already has, before the fourth delegate selection event, pruned the field from 17 to five, with only four \u2014 Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, but not Ben Carson \u2014 with arguable paths to the nomination. Cruz is counting on volunteers wielding smartphones loaded with analytics \u2014 Boss Tweed meets Steve Jobs \u2014 to counter Trump\u2019s surfing on an endless wave of free media. Rubio needs Kasich, the only remaining governor, to wither while waiting for the process to reach states thought to be congenial. When Kasich became the last candidate (other than Jim Gilmore) to enter the race, one of his senior advisers pointed far ahead to Michigan\u2019s March 8 primary. Kasich\u2019s narrow path is: Become the sole center-right alternative, one-on-one with Trump or Cruz in the industrial Midwest, and move from a strong Michigan showing to a March 15 victory in winner-take-all Ohio. Cruz wants protracted campaigns from both Rubio and Kasich. Trump wants to delay the day when he has only one opponent and might learn that his ceiling is approximately what he won in South Carolina \u2014 32.5 percent.\n\n1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Trump captures the nation\u2019s attention on the campaign trail View Photos The Republican presidential candidate focuses on the Super Tuesday state primaries after a win in South Carolina.

He said, \u201cThey cannot believe what they\u2019re finding.\u201d No one has seen his astonishing discoveries \u2014 or his tax filings, which might illuminate unsavory business practices and exaggerations of his wealth.
