Just as concerning is whether more people will think it\u2019s OK to drive under the influence of both marijuana and alcohol together. What effect do these substances have on driving when used together and on their own? A new study sought to find out.\n\nThe study comes out of the University of Iowa, which houses the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS) \u2014 once the world\u2019s largest driving simulator, it comes complete with a full-sized 1996 Chevy Malibu sedan. Inside the simulator, researchers tested how well a small group of people drove under the influence of alcohol and marijuana, both together and individually. \u201cWhat we saw was an additive effect\u2026 when we put them together,\u201d said Tim Brown, associate research scientist at NADS and corresponding author of the study. \u201cYou get what you expect if you take alcohol and cannabis, and merge them together.\u201d\n\nThe study involved 18 participants who drove in the simulator under the influence. When the two drugs were combined, the researchers found participants' abilities to stay in their lanes dropped \u2014 they weaved more. Although, as Brown said, the effects were additive. When used individually, the researchers found marijuana use only led to increased weaving within the drivers\u2019 lanes, which was comparable to the weaving of someone with a 0.08 blood-alcohol content. By comparison, after drinking alcohol, the drivers were not only weaving within their lanes but also leaving their lanes. The speed in which they wove was also more erratic.\n\nEach of the participants was given either a mixed drink with alcohol or juice with an alcohol-rimmed glass and topped with alcohol to mimic the taste and odor. They used a vaporizer to consume the marijuana or a placebo. These methods ensured the participants had a BAC around 0.65 and THC (the psychoactive chemical in marijuana) blood concentrations between 8.2 and 13.1 micrograms per liter.\n\nThe current study, though small, builds on others that have suggested drunk driving could be more dangerous than driving while high \u2014 though neither is safe \u2014 because it tests driving skills while participants were surely under the influence. With the other studies, drivers were tested for drugs following crashes. However, as the authors noted, while a person who is drunk will test positive for alcohol in their system, a person who tests positive for marijuana may not be high at the exact moment. THC can be found in the body for weeks after its effects have worn off.\n\nThese are especially important points to make as policymakers craft laws to regulate marijuana use in states where it\u2019s already legal, as well as states that are considering legalization. While states that have legalized medical marijuana have reported increases in fatal crashes involving drivers who tested positive for marijuana \u2014 Colorado has too \u2014 it\u2019s possible that the drug was still in their system from recent use rather than from using it immediately before getting behind the wheel. After all, traffic fatalities were nearly identical in 2013 and 2014, the years before and after recreational pot began being sold.\n\nSource: Hartman R, Brown T, Milavetz G, et al.
