It has been gradual, they say, prompted by politics and poll findings back to 2010, the year President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act became law and Republicans subsequently made gains in Congress and state capitals. Since then Republicans have spent a good deal of energy attacking the law, its birth control mandate, Planned Parenthood and Democrats\u2019 economic agenda for women.\n\nThe change \u201cis something that we have been talking about for several years,\u201d said Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cI just think the \u2018pro-choice\u2019 language doesn\u2019t really resonate particularly with a lot of young women voters. We\u2019re really trying to focus on, what are the real things you\u2019re going to lose? Sometimes that\u2019s rights. Sometimes that\u2019s economic or access to health care for you or for your kids.\u201d\n\nPro-choice became commonplace after the 1973 Roe ruling, to counter the pro-life label of the anti-abortion movement. The description was seen as having broader appeal than \u201cpro-abortion,\u201d since it fit those who were personally against abortion but opposed any government control over women\u2019s health decisions.\n\n\u201c \u2018Choice\u2019 has been extraordinarily successful as a frame for the abortion-rights side because a lot of Americans may not like the idea of abortion but they definitely agree with the idea of choice,\u201d said Suzanne Staggenborg, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who researches social movements. \u201cAnd they agree that it should be a woman\u2019s choice in consultation with her doctor.\u201d\n\nBut by 2010 some abortion-rights activists began to sense in their outreach to young women, whose support was needed not only for the midterm elections but for the movement\u2019s future as well, that the term pro-choice was virtually meaningless. That was confirmed by postelection polls and focus groups that women\u2019s organizations and Democrats commissioned to understand what went wrong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the findings, according to several people familiar with them: Many young women, when asked whether they were pro-choice or pro-life, said pro-life. Yet they supported the Roe ruling. Explaining the contradiction, Ms. Laguens said these self-described pro-life voters were \u201ctalking about their personal decision-making, for themselves, and not about what they want to push on others.\u201d\n\nBut such results also showed the weakness of the pro-choice label, advocates and pollsters said. Planned Parenthood took the lead, conducting research on public attitudes throughout 2011 and then presenting the findings to allies in various meetings.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was a bit destabilizing when we started,\u201d Ms. Laguens said. When Planned Parenthood produced a YouTube video last year for supporters on the shift to a broader message, one member wrote online: \u201cI\u2019m pro-choice and I won\u2019t be bullied into saying anything different. This is nothing but a retreat and a shame!\u201d\n\nRepresentative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who for 15 years has been a co-chairwoman of the Pro-Choice Caucus in Congress, scoffed at the idea of a name change. \u201cI\u2019ve never worried about it,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily\u2019s List, a political fund-raising organization formed three decades ago to back female candidates who support abortion rights, still says on its website\u2019s home page, \u201cWe ignite change by getting pro-choice Democratic women elected to office.\u201d But its research arm, American Women, like Planned Parenthood, has also done extensive polling and recently produced a \u201ctool kit\u201d for candidates and activists \u2014 customized for each state \u2014 of economic policies for women, including paid leave, higher minimum wage, equal pay for women and men for equivalent work, and birth control coverage. (\u201cBirth control is only a social issue if you\u2019ve never had to pay for it,\u201d advocates often say, to highlight the economic angle.)\n\nThe broadened message from women\u2019s groups coincided with \u2014 and, they say, was hastened by \u2014 Republicans\u2019 actions after taking control of the House and some state legislatures in the 2010 elections. Congressional Republicans sought to defund Planned Parenthood, threatening a government shutdown. Then they began their campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which includes specific benefits for women \u2014 mandated coverage of contraception, mammograms and annual gynecological exams without co-payments; an end to an insurance industry rating system that charged women more than men, and a ban on insurers refusing to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRepublicans singled out the birth control benefit of the Affordable Care Act as a violation of employers\u2019 religious freedom. They proposed \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendments defining life as starting at conception, which would criminalize not only abortion but also some fertility treatments. And they blocked economic proposals like equal pay.\n\n\u201cWhen you really look at the broad scope of all the Republicans\u2019 attacks,\u201d said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List, \u201cit\u2019s clear \u2018women\u2019s health\u2019 is what\u2019s at stake.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140728212449, "twitter": {"description": "In this midterm
