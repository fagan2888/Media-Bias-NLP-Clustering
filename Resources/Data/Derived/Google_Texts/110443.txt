The Jordanian government released a statement Tuesday saying that a “strong, earth-shaking and decisive” response would follow the killing of one of its pilots by the Islamic State group, Reuters reported.

Video uploaded by the Sunni radical terrorist organization on Tuesday showed Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh being burned to death inside a black cage.

Tuesday’s statement by the Jordanian government follows last weeks threat to execute all Islamic State captives held in custody following Mr. al-Kaseasbeh’s death. The pilot’s plane was downed in Syria by Islamic State in December.
