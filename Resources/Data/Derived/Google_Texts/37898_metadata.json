How did this situation come about?\n\nThis was not just the work of the Freedom Caucus or Ted Cruz or one month\u2019s activity. The Republican Party\u2019s capacity for effective self-governance degraded slowly, over the course of a long chain of rhetorical excesses, mental corruptions and philosophical betrayals. Basically, the party abandoned traditional conservatism for right-wing radicalism. Republicans came to see themselves as insurgents and revolutionaries, and every revolution tends toward anarchy and ends up devouring its own.\n\nBy traditional definitions, conservatism stands for intellectual humility, a belief in steady, incremental change, a preference for reform rather than revolution, a respect for hierarchy, precedence, balance and order, and a tone of voice that is prudent, measured and responsible. Conservatives of this disposition can be dull, but they know how to nurture and run institutions. They also see the nation as one organic whole. Citizens may fall into different classes and political factions, but they are still joined by chains of affection that command ultimate loyalty and love.\n\nAll of this has been overturned in dangerous parts of the Republican Party. Over the past 30 years, or at least since Rush Limbaugh came on the scene, the Republican rhetorical tone has grown ever more bombastic, hyperbolic and imbalanced. Public figures are prisoners of their own prose styles, and Republicans from Newt Gingrich through Ben Carson have become addicted to a crisis mentality. Civilization was always on the brink of collapse. Every setback, like the passage of Obamacare, became the ruination of the republic. Comparisons to Nazi Germany became a staple.\n\nThis produced a radical mindset. Conservatives started talking about the Reagan \u201crevolution,\u201d the Gingrich \u201crevolution.\u201d Among people too ill-educated to understand the different spheres, political practitioners adopted the mental habits of the entrepreneur. Everything had to be transformational and disruptive. Hierarchy and authority were equated with injustice. Self-expression became more valued than self-restraint and coalition building. A contempt for politics infested the Republican mind.\n\nPolitics is the process of making decisions amid diverse opinions. It involves conversation, calm deliberation, self-discipline, the capacity to listen to other points of view and balance valid but competing ideas and interests.\n\nBut this new Republican faction regards the messy business of politics as soiled and impure. Compromise is corruption. Inconvenient facts are ignored. Countrymen with different views are regarded as aliens. Political identity became a sort of ethnic identity, and any compromise was regarded as a blood betrayal.\n\nA weird contradictory mentality replaced traditional conservatism. Republican radicals have contempt for politics, but they still believe that transformational political change can rescue the nation. Republicans developed a contempt for Washington and government, but they elected leaders who made the most lavish promises imaginable. Government would be reduced by a quarter! Shutdowns would happen! The nation would be saved by transformational change! As Steven Bilakovics writes in his book Democracy Without Politics, \u201ceven as we expect ever less of democracy we apparently expect ever more from democracy.\u201d\n\nThis anti-political political ethos produced elected leaders of jaw-dropping incompetence. Running a government is a craft, like carpentry. But the new Republican officials did not believe in government and so did not respect its traditions, its disciplines and its craftsmanship. They do not accept the hierarchical structures of authority inherent in political activity.\n\nIn his masterwork, \u201cPolitics as a Vocation,\u201d Max Weber argues that the pre-eminent qualities for a politician are passion, a feeling of responsibility and a sense of proportion. A politician needs warm passion to impel action but a cool sense of responsibility and proportion to make careful decisions in a complex landscape.\n\nIf a politician lacks the quality of detachment \u2014 the ability to let the difficult facts of reality work their way into the mind \u2014 then, Weber argues, the politician ends up striving for the \u201cboastful but entirely empty gesture.\u201d His work \u201cleads nowhere and is senseless.\u201d\n\nWelcome to Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and the Freedom Caucus.\n\nReally, have we ever seen bumbling on this scale, people at once so cynical and so naive, so willfully ignorant in using levers of power to produce some tangible if incremental good? These insurgents can\u2019t even acknowledge democracy\u2019s legitimacy \u2014 if you can\u2019t persuade a majority of your colleagues, maybe you should accept their position. You might be wrong!\n\nPeople who don\u2019t accept democracy will be bad at conversation. They won\u2019t respect tradition, institutions or precedent. These figures are masters at destruction but incompetent at construction.\n\nThese insurgents are incompetent at governing and unwilling to be governed. But they are not a spontaneous growth. It took a thousand small betrayals of conservatism to get to the dysfunction we see all around.\n\nReach David Brooks through nytimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz and Co. are masters of destruction, incompetent at construction.", "og": {"description": "Ted Cruz and Co. are masters of destruction, incompetent at construction.", "title": "David Brooks: How the GOP lost its way", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20151015-david-brooks-how-the-gop-lost-its-way.ece", "image": {"width": 944, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20151015-px4021c.ece/BINARY/original/px4021c", "height": 1280}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-15T17:45:12Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-10-15T17:39:35Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"David Brooks: How the GOP lost its way\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20151015-david-brooks-how-the-gop-lost-its-way.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20151015-px4021c.ece/BINARY/original/px4021c\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2486988\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-15T17:39:35Z\", \"section\": \"Latest Columns\", \"author\": \"DAVID BROOKS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20151015-px4021c.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/px4021c", "publishtime": "2015-10-15T17:39:35Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc395\"", "article_summary": "Basically, the party abandoned traditional conservatism for right-wing radicalism.\nRepublican radicals have contempt for politics, but they still believe that transformational political change can rescue the nation.\nA weird contradictory mentality replaced traditional conservatism.\nRepublicans came to see themselves as insurgents and revolutionaries, and every revolution tends toward anarchy and ends up devouring its own.\nThis was not just the work of the Freedom Caucus or Ted Cruz or one month\u2019s activity."}
