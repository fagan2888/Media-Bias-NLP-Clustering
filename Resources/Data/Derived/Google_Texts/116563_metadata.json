Putnam County has the worst health factors of the sixty-seven Florida counties. It has the third worst health outcomes, which include premature death, low birthweight and poor mental and physcial health. Only Union and Washington counties scored worse for health outcomes.\n\nObesity can lead to coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and liver and gallbladder disease, among other conditions that the report listed. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of cancer, including cancer of lung, esophagus, mouth, throat and kidney, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDr. Anand Kuruvilla is Putnam\u2019s only radiation oncologist. He said he\u2019s not surprised by the county\u2019s low ranking.\n\nHe said he thinks poverty \u2013 43 percent of Putnam\u2019s children are poor compared to a state average of 25 percent \u2013 correlates to the high rates of smoking and obesity, because people in impoverished areas can lack proper education about health, on top of not having insurance.\n\nAccording to the report, 33 percent of Putnam\u2019s residents are obese, compared to the state average of 26 percent. Twenty-seven percent are smokers \u2013 compared to the state average of 18 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a vicious circle: patients can\u2019t come in because they don\u2019t have insurance, there are no doctors to see them, or they can\u2019t afford to pay a doctor,\u201d said Kuruvilla, who is the director of the Cancer Center of Putnam. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to remove that barrier.\u201d\n\nHe said residents can\u2019t get access to health care because they can\u2019t afford health insurance.\n\n\u201cOur level of cancer care here is actually excellent if you have insurance, but if you don\u2019t get in to see me, you\u2019re going to have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to remedy that by at least making it easier by removing barriers to access.\u201d\n\nKuruvilla is president of Putnam First Cancer Fund, a charity that helps Putnam residents receive cancer diagnoses or helps diagnosed patients receive funds for treatment. He said said diagnosing the disease can make a resident more eligible for aid from state agencies.\n\nKuruvilla said that some patients aren\u2019t even eligible for Medicaid. He said there\u2019s no office in Putnam County where someone can apply for Medicaid and receive assistance.\n\nCompounding the problem is that fact that those who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford medical insurance cannot buy insurance on the health care exchanges, because lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere are also no safety-net hospitals available to Putnam county residents, which Kuruvilla said hurts their chances of getting treated if they have no insurance.\n\n\u201cNow how is a patient, who can\u2019t put food on his plate, be expected to reach this place?\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all kind of stacked up against these people. So it\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\nHollister nurse Melissa Callender was surprised when she found out that obesity was an issue in her county.\n\n\u201cObesity is a little surprising because I\u2019m seeing a lot of people with a need of food to eat,\u201d Callender said\n\nCallender also noticed that the lack of health insurance is a problem. She said she was recently working in Palatka with a company that helps get health care to residents and was surprised by how much it costs for residents to have health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little concerning to me because I do have a skill, and I am able to work, and I am able to take care of my family, as opposed to the majority of the people that I see are struggling here in the county,\u201d she said.\n\nOn her days off, Callender goes to nearby impoverished neighborhoods and takes old women out to do their shopping because they can\u2019t afford their own vehicles.\n\n\u201cI definitely think that the (county officials) need to get out in the county,\u201d Callender said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get out and talk to the people.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the rankings list, Alachua County was ranked second healthiest county for overall health factors and No. 1 in clinical care due to how many residents are insured and how many primary care doctors it has.\n\nCEO of Gainesville Medical Centers, Jen Hernandez, wasn\u2019t surprised by Alachua\u2019s high ranking.\n\n\u201cGainesville is the benchmark,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nHernandez said that the reason for high rate of insured residents is because many employers provide health care benefits. She said that Putnam providers could do more outreach to get the community involved in education.\n\nHernandez said that after finding out about the results, she\u2019s interested in helping Putnam County through mobile outreach, which the center does to facilitate health education.\n\nKuruvilla said the state needs to provide tax credits or other means of promoting education in Putnam County, in order to help lower the obesity and smoking rates and help residents get access to health care.\n\n\u201cYou improve the economy, you have to provide jobs, and you have to educate,\u201d Kuruvilla said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WUFT News", "description": "Putnam County was ranked among the top 10 unhealthiest counties in Florida and last in health factors, according to an annual health report.", "title": "Putnam County Ranked Unhealthiest County for Health Factors", "url": "http://www.wuft.org/news/2015/11/24/putnam-county-ranked-unhealthiest-county-for-health-factors/", "image": "http://www.wuft.org/news/files/2015/11/2015-Health-Factors-Florida.png", "type": "article"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd158\"", "article_summary": "The County Health Rankings & Roadmaps report was based on health outcomes and health factors documented by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re trying to remove that barrier.\u201dHe said residents can\u2019t get access to health care because they can\u2019t afford health insurance.\nPutnam County has the worst health factors of the sixty-seven Florida counties.\nHe said there\u2019s no office in Putnam County where someone can apply for Medicaid and receive assistance.\nPutnam County was dubbed the unhealthiest county in Florida for being filled with too many things that make it a struggle for people to stay well, according to an annual health report."}
