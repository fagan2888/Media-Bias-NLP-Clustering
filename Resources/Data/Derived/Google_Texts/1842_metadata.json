Still, if Obama\u2019s broader point was about stability and job security, members of Congress do have an edge over average Americans. The median tenure of a member of Congress is more than 12 years, compared to a median of 4.6 years for \u201cwage and salary workers\u201d tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 4.1 years as of January 2008 and 3.5 years as of 1983. About 29 percent of workers had been at their jobs for 10 years or more as of January 2014, while 33 percent had been with their employer for two years or less.\n\nRelated: U.S. Companies Are Dying Faster Than Ever\u200b\u200b\n\nThe increase in worker tenure in recent decades may actually be a sign of a stagnant, troubled job market, one in which employees have been clinging to their jobs rather than seeking out better opportunities.\n\nEconomists, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen, watch for signs of churn as an indication of the health of the labor market. On that front, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for November, released this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed some encouraging developments. For example, the ratio of quits to total separations including layoffs and retirements \u2014 what market strategist at brokerage Convergex refer to as the \u201ctake this job and shove it indicator\u201d \u2014 rose to 57.4 percent, and the number of people quitting their jobs climbed 6.3 percent over the November 2014 levels.\n\nIf we\u2019re looking at the state of work in the current economy, it\u2019s also worth noting that CEO tenure has increased in recent years, according to a recent study by Equilar. Despite a pickup of merger and acquisition activity and ramped up pressure from activist investors \u2014 trends that might be expected to increase turnover among top executives \u2014 Equilar found that the median tenure of an S&P 500 CEO in 2014 was 6 years, up from 5.2 years in 2005.\n\nRelated: 10 CEOs Who Make Way, Way, WAY More Than Their Workers\u200b\u200b\n\n\u201cThough counterintuitive to some market trends, there is one simple explanation for the rising average: There is a collection of long-standing CEOs at the top of the list,\u201d Equilar\u2019s analysts explained on the company\u2019s blog. \u201cIn 2014, there were 142 CEOs who had served their companies longer than 10 years. Ten years ago, there were only 94 who had such a distinction.\u201d\n\nObama may have been off in using 30 years as a measure, but his basic point still holds: When it comes to job security, Congress has it good compared with average Americans \u2014 and even CEOs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama took a swipe at members of Congress early in his State of the Union sp", "title": "Want Job Security?
