And I don\u2019t understand how anybody would be against it,\u201d said the billionaire magnate. \u201cThey blew up a Russian airplane. He cannot be in love with these people,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for the Ukraine, Trump asked, \u201cwhy are we always doing the work?\u201d Referring to Germany and our European allies who he feels don\u2019t do their fair share concerning global security. It\u2019s a regional problem\u2013and Germany has an economy and a military that should be\u2013in Donald\u2019s view\u2013doing more to work on normalizing the strategic situation there.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to be the policeman of the world. We owe $19 trillion; we have a country that\u2019s going to hell; [and] we have an infrastructure that\u2019s falling apart.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush disagreed, saying there\u2019s a difference between a world policeman and a world leader. He also described Trump\u2019s Syria policy as something akin to a board game.", "article_metadata": {"description": "thoughts?.05/27/2016 4:06:15AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "thoughts?", "title": "Trump: We Cannot Continue To Be The Policeman Of The World.
