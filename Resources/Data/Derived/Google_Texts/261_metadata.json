Chris Christie\u2019s resignation if it turns out he had a hand in the lane closures, Tessaro knew he had to brave the freezing temperatures to join in the protest.\n\n\u201cWe want the answer to why this happened, and if the governor was involved, he should resign,\u201d said Tessaro, 37, a Fort Lee resident and small business owner, who was among the countless motorists stuck in traffic during the closures.\n\n\"The bridge is a part of Fort Lee, it's a part of who we are. But it was used as a weapon against us,\" said Tessaro. \"A lot of my friends and family couldn't get to work. They couldn't get to school.\"\n\nInvestigators are looking into whether the closures were politically motivated -- in retaliation for the Fort Lee mayor's failure to endorse Christie for re-election or for someone else's actions -- or were imposed for financial or other inappropriate reasons.\n\nParticipants in the noon news conference gathered on a bluff overlooking the bridge in Fort Lee, where borough streets were clogged for hours during the morning and evenng rush hours the week of Sept. 9-13, when two out of three local access lanes were ordered diverted to the bridge\u2019s main approach by a Christie-backed official at the Port Authority.\n\nThe group that organized the event, a Democratic-leaning political action committee known as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, created a website: ChristieResign.com where they said 13,000 people had signed an online petition calling for the Republican governor's resignation if it\u2019s revealed that he knew about the closures ahead of time. The New Jersey Working Families Alliance, a labor, environmental and community group, also took part in the event.\n\n\n\nNorth Bergen resident Alex Howard, who was bundled up against the bitter chill during the event at Fort Lee Historic Park, said he and his wife, Eliza, were an hour late for a doctor\u2019s appointment in Englewood Cliffs on the second day of the closures.\n\nHoward, a 67-year-old systems analyst and a registered Democrat, said he was skeptical of the governor\u2019s statements since the scandal arose.\n\n\u201cHe said he fired bridget Kelly without asking her any questions,\u201d said Howard, referring to Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, who was implicated in the closures . \u201cBut then, he says he wants to know what happened. Excuse me? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nChristie told reporters he fired Kelly on Jan. 9, one day after an email publicly surfaced in which she told the former Port Authority official who gave the closure orders, David Wildstein, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" Wildstein, who resigned in December, sent an immediate, two-word reply to Kelly's Aug. 13 email: \"Got it.\"\n\nDuring a news conference when he announced that he had fired Kelly and cut ties with his two-time campaign manager, Bill Stepien, who was also implicated in the closures, Christie apologized for the traffic nightmare and said learning that such trusted aides had hid the closure scheme from him was the biggest disappointment of his political career. Christie has vowed to cooperate with all \"appropriate\" investigations.\n\nOn Monday, a joint committee of the state Senate and Assembly issued another round of subpoenas involving the closures, while the U.S. Attorney's office in Newark and the Port Authority inspector generals' office also continue to probe the matter.\n\nParticipants Robert Duffey, a spokesman for the Working Families Alliance, said that even if Christie did not know about the closures ahead of time, the governor had established \"a culture\" of bullying by his administration.\n\nAnother Fort Lee resident, 55-yera-old Valerie Howard-Fadul, said she was stuck in Fort Lee traffic for more than five hours after coming home from an afternoon appointment with her eye doctor in Manhattan during the evening rush hour on the second day of the lane closures. Fadul did not try to hide her conviction that Christie was behind them\n\n\"He paralyzed our town, he paralyzed the people here,\" she said. \"This is a total abuse of power.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Timeline of Port Authority's George Washington Bridge controversy\n\n\u2022 Complete coverage of bridge scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "chris-christie, fort-lee, gwb-closure, port-authority-ny-nj, news", "title": "Protesters near George Washington Bridge call for Christie to resign if he knew of lane closure plans", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Protesters near George Washington Bridge call for Christie to resign if he knew of lane closure plans\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/02/protesters_rally_near_george_washington_bridge_call_for_christie_to_resign_if_he_knew_of_closure_pla.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14257292-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12178578\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-11T18:23:12Z\", \"author\": \"Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"chris-christie\",\"fort-lee\",\"gwb-closure\",\"port-authority-ny-nj\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14257292-large.jpg", "description": "Members of a Democratic-leaning national organization joined with residents of northern New Jersey who were stuck in traffic during September's George Washington Bridge lane closure debacle to call on Gov.
