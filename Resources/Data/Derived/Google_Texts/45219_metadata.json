Children in that situation would continue receiving coverage under the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nState lawmakers took up the issue because the federal government reauthorized transitional Medicaid payments late last year. Congress had repealed the temporary coverage as part of the 2010 health care overhaul, which required states to expand Medicaid to the working poor, thus making the transitional payments unnecessary.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court struck down mandatory Medicaid expansion through Obamacare in a June 2012 ruling. Since then, states have had the option to accept program expansion. Idaho and several other states have hesitated, judging it too risky to assume new spending obligations in the absence of assured support in the future from the federal government.\n\nThe Idaho Department of Health and Welfare sees Transitional Medicaid as a boon for workers who might need a little help as their household budgets grow.\n\n\u201cThis program is designed to promote participants finding work without the fear of losing Medicaid coverage immediately after finding employment,\u201d department staffer Julie Hammon told the House Health and Welfare Committee.\n\nShe projected at least 2,700 Idahoans will receive transitional Medicaid payments each year. With the proposed expansion, the department expects the payments to cost $9.7 million annually. The state general fund will pay $2.83 million of that tab, and the federal government will pay the rest.\n\nThe committee approved the proposal on a nearly unanimous tally. Only Rep. Brandon Hixon, R-Nampa, dissented. He told IdahoReporter.com after the meeting he didn\u2019t agree with the program paying benefits to workers who earn higher levels of income.\n\nCommittee Vice Chair Kelley Packer, R-McCammon, praised the plan as an exit from poverty.\n\n\u201cTo have any way of being able to improve your circumstances without being penalized is a positive step forward,\u201d Packer said.\n\nThe panel \u2014 and the state as a whole \u2014 might not have had much say in the decision to reauthorize the entitlement payments. The federal government requires states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid to offer the coverage. A DHW spokesman couldn\u2019t tell IdahoReporter.com what penalties the federal government might impose if the state didn\u2019t approve the plan.\n\nThe state\u2019s portion of the Medicaid budget could grow by more than $12 million in 2017, a 2.4 percent increase above this year. If lawmakers approve Republican Gov. Butch Otter\u2019s budget, Idaho would pay more than $514 million out of the general fund for Medicaid.\n\nThe program\u2019s total Idaho cost, including state, dedicated and federal funds, would reach more than $2.21 billion in 2017 if legislators accept the Otter budget. That would represent a 5.3 percent spending hike for the program above the 2016 appropriation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The proposal, which still needs a Senate hearing and approval to take effect, will add more than $9.7 million to Medicaid\u2019s ever-growing budget.", "title": "Panel approves nearly $10 million boost for Transitional Medicaid - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/01/Packer-narrow.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/254641/panel-approves-nearly-10-million-boost-transitional-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "medicaid,ObamaCare", "published_time": "2016-01-21T13:14:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dustin.hurst"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The proposal, which still needs a Senate hearing and approval to take effect, will add more than $9.7 million to Medicaid\u2019s ever-growing budget.", "title": "Panel approves nearly $10 million boost for Transitional Medicaid - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/01/Packer-narrow.jpg"}, "creator": "@DustinHurst", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The proposal, which still needs a Senate hearing and approval to take effect, will add more than $9.7 million to Medicaid\u2019s ever-growing budget."}, "article_summary": "She projected at least 2,700 Idahoans will receive transitional Medicaid payments each year.\nState lawmakers took up the issue because the federal government reauthorized transitional Medicaid payments late last year.\nThe arrangement is dubbed Transitional Medicaid and allows workers who earn too much to qualify for Idaho\u2019s Medicaid program to continue receiving health services under the plan for up to a year.\nThe Idaho Department of Health and Welfare sees Transitional Medicaid as a boon for workers who might need a little help as their household budgets grow.\nButch Otter\u2019s budget, Idaho would pay more than $514 million out of the general fund for Medicaid."}
