The order remains in effect pending final disposition of the plantiffs\u2019 petition to have their case reviewed.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case \u2014 Zubik v. Burwell \u2014 include David A. Zubik, the bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh; Lawrence T. Persico, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Erie; Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh; and several other charities and schools that come under the jurisdiction of those two dioceses. The respondents are Sylvia Mathews Burwell, in her capacity as secretary of Health and Human Services, et al.\n\nThe order read, in part:\n\n[The] respondents are enjoined from enforcing against the applicants the challenged provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related regulations pending final disposition of their petition for certiorari [review of the case].\n\nThe order was not a victory for the plaintiffs, however, but only what amounts to a \u201ctime out,\u201d since it did not permanently relieve them from providing the contraceptive coverage. It continued,\n\nNothing in this interim order affects the ability of the applicants\u2019 or their organizations\u2019 employees to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives. Nor does this order preclude the Government from relying on the information provided by the applicants, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage under the Act.\n\nAs the Christian Post noted in a June 30 article, Zubik v. Burwell \u201cis one of dozens of lawsuits from groups across the nation seeking exemption from the controversial HHS preventive services mandate.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported that a three-judge panel from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiffs in February, arguing that the current mandate requirement that they submit a self-certification form requesting exemption did not represent an undue burden on their religious practices. The ruling stated, \u201cAs Judge Posner has explained, this is not a situation where the self-certification form enables the provision of the very contraceptive services that the appellees find sinful.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s argument, therefore, was that since all the charity has to do is fill out a form passing the burden of coverage over to their insurers, the charity was not being forced to violate its conscience by doing anything sinful. However, people of faith generally believe that complicity with sinful actions is as troublesome as committing the sinful acts themselves, particularly since the school\u2019s or charities\u2019 insurance premiums are indirectly used to pay for the contraceptive services.\n\nThe ruling continued:\n\nFederal law, rather than any involvement by the appellees in filling out or submitting the self-certification form, creates the obligation of the insurance issuers and third-party administrators to provide coverage for contraceptive services.\n\nHaving been denied relief by the Third Circuit Court, the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court for review of the case (a writ of certiorari). On April 15, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito recalled and stayed the circuit court\u2019s decision. This, in effect, allowed the Supreme Court to further review Zubik v. Burwell, which is still pending.\n\nThe June 29 Supreme Court order first denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari, as submitted to Alito, who, in turn, referred it to the High Court. But it then enjoined (prohibited) HHS from enforcing the challenged contraceptive mandate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and related regulations pending final disposition of their petition.\n\nThe order, therefore, is neither a clear-cut victory nor defeat for either side, but basically a pause until things are sorted out and a final decision is made. It even concludes: \u201cThis order should not be construed as an expression of the Court\u2019s views on the merits [of the case].\u201d\n\nAs for how the Supreme Court will eventually rule in the case of Zubik v. Burwell, past ruling may provide some clues. In a 5-4 decision last year, on June 30, 2014, the Court ruled that even some for-profit companies can cite religious convictions to opt out of the contraception mandate that would have required all businesses to provide free contraceptives to their employees. That ruling was issued in favor of two family-held companies \u2014 Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties.\n\nShortly after that ruling, on July 3, 2014, the Court gave Wheaton College in Illinois temporary emergency relief from the mandate while the Christian college\u2019s suit against the \u201cAffordable Healthcare Act\u201d rule is pending in the courts.\n\nThough not related to the issue of contraceptive coverage, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in the case of King v. Burwell effectively rewrote the Affordable Care Act in a manner that guaranteed that ObamaCare will survive. This is troubling for those institutions which seek to defend themselves from the Act\u2019s intrusiveness.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nObamacare\u2019s Best Allies: The Courts and the Republicans\n\nRoberts Twists the Constitution ...
