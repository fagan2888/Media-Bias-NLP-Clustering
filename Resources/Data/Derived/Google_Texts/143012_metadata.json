According to recently breaking reports, blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly of Mississippi crossed all bounds of propriety by entering the nursing home room of the wife of Senator Thad Cochran (R-Mississippi) and photographing her for use in a political story.\n\nA Pearl man who runs a political blog is accused of sneaking into a nursing home where U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s wife is bedridden and photographing her, then posting the image in a video political \u201chit piece\u201d on the internet. Madison Police arrested Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28, of Pearl on Friday night on a charge of exploitation of a vulnerable adult. He\u2019s being held on a $100,000 bond.\n\nThe police investigating the case put out a press release on the subject today.\n\nThe Madison Police Department received information on May 15th, 2014 concerning the possible exploitation of a vulnerable adult resident at Catherine\u2019s Village located at 200 Dominican Drive in the City of Madison. As a result of the investigation, it was determined that Clayton Thomas Kelly \u2013 age 28 \u2013 of 3127 Greenfield Road Pearl, Ms had illegally and improperly obtained an image of a vulnerable adult resident without their consent for his own benefit. Clayton Kelly\u2019s bond is set at $100,000.00 and he is currently being held at the Madison County Detention Center. The matter remains under investigation by the Madison Police Department.\n\nKelly\u2019s blog is found here, but the political \u201chit piece\u201d in question has since been removed.\n\nIt is important to note at this point that if there is no evidence suggesting that Kelly is in any way involved with the campaign of Chris McDaniel, currently in a heated primary battle with Senator Cochran, this shouldn\u2019t affect the race. He seems to be an ardent supporter of McDaniel, as indicated by some previous blog posts (here and here) and photos, but that can be said of many people. Elected officials and candidates are, by definition, ultimately responsibile for not only their own actions, but those of their paid and/or appointed staff. But no candidate can control the irrational actions of deranged fans any more than Jodie Foster can be said to be responsible for the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut is there more to the story? In an update from the Clarion-Ledger, Senator Cochran\u2019s camp is raising an interesting question.\n\nU.S. Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s campaign is questioning how Chris McDaniel\u2019s campaign manager, state Sen. Melanie Sojourner, apparently knew about Clayton Kelly\u2019s arrest before news of him allegedly sneaking into Rose Cochran\u2019s nursing home room and taking photos broke. Cochran campaign spokesman Jordan Russell said Sojourner left a voice mail message for Cochran campaign manager Kirk Sims at about 7:45 a.m. on Saturday, offering condolences over Kelly\u2019s alleged actions and assurance McDaniel\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t condone it. Russell said Sojourner indicated she had been concerned over the incident since Friday night. Kelly was arrested Friday night. Police issued a press release about Kelly\u2019s arrest late Friday night, but it and early news reports did not mention Rose Cochran, only a brief statement about his charge of exploitation of a vulnerable adult. A Clarion-Ledger article posted online at 9:24 a.m. broke the news about a connection between the arrest and the Cochrans.\n\nThis same article was later updated with a response from the McDaniel campaign:\n\n\u201cThe McDaniel campaign found out about the break in when a local political blog posted about it at 11:40 p.m. last night. Senator McDaniel has denounced the break-in and called Senator Cochran to extend his condolences. It is unconscionable for the Cochran campaign and the liberal media to use the act of a sick individual to lob despicable accusations.\u201d\n\nThe information still missing at the time of this posting is precisely which \u201clocal political blog\u201d posted the information (with the Name of Cochran\u2019s wife, I assume), since the local media didn\u2019t have that detail until the next morning. The missing piece here \u2013 and this is purely speculation at this point \u2013 could be that the \u201clocal blog\u201d in question was, in fact, Kelly\u2019s blog. Since everyone seems to agree that the information had been posted there, and then removed, I suppose that\u2019s possible. Of course, it would require a bit of luck on the part of McDaniel\u2019s campaign manager to have just managed to catch the post on the blog between the time it was published and then pulled, but given the tendency of campaign workers to constantly monitor Google alerts for anything mentioning their opponent\u2019s name, it\u2019s not beyond the realm of the possible. (See Update below.)\n\nIf this claim about the phone message and its timing turns out to be true, it adds an entirely new element to the story, but we still need to hear from Sojourner, who isn\u2019t commenting on it yet. If she did, in fact, know about this before the police released any details, including the identity of Cochran\u2019s wife, somebody has some explaining to do and McDaniel will have to be on top of this immediately.\n\nBut either way it pans out, Kelly may serve as yet another important example and negative role model for citizen journalists. No matter what your motivation or desire to get into the mix of the political battlefield, there are boundaries which simply can not be crossed. I have no idea what would possess someone to think that invading the privacy of an elderly, bedridden woman suffering from dementia would be useful or a good idea in any way, but it appears that Mr. Kelly is about to learn a very expensive lesson on the subject.\n\nSome similar sentiments from Doug Mataconis:\n\nIn the often combative history of American politics, I\u2019ve got to say I don\u2019t recall seeing anything quite like this. And while it was obviously not officially tied to the McDaniel campaign, it certainly seems to be a measure of the extent to which political debate in this country has descended into the gutter. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd summed it up well on Twitter this morning: Politics should never become so rabid that crazy supporters do what happened to Sen. Cochran's wife. \u2014 Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) May 17, 2014\n\nWay over the line, whether the McDaniel campaign was involved or not.\n\nUPDATE: (Jazz) The local blogger reporting on this story is saying that the offending video / pictures were posted either \u201ctwo weeks ago\u201d or April 26th, depending who you ask, so if that\u2019s the case, the McDaniel camp couldn\u2019t have found it in the way I surmised. Curiouser and curiouser, to quote one fable.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Foul play", "title": "Blogger arrested for sneaking into Thad Cochran\u2019s wife\u2019s nursing home room", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/17/blogger-arrested-for-sneaking-into-thad-cochrans-wifes-nursing-home-room/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T21:31:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-18T12:28:28+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, bloggers, Chris McDaniel, crime, Mississippi, Senate 2014, Thad Cochran,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Senator McDaniel has denounced the break-in and called Senator Cochran to extend his condolences.\nCochran campaign spokesman Jordan Russell said Sojourner left a voice mail message for Cochran campaign manager Kirk Sims at about 7:45 a.m. on Saturday, offering condolences over Kelly\u2019s alleged actions and assurance McDaniel\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t condone it.\nU.S. Sen.
