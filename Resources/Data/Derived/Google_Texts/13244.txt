SOLDEU-EL TARTER, Andorra — Hampered by a fractured left knee, Lindsey Vonn managed to extend her overall World Cup lead by placing 13th in an alpine combined event Sunday, while Marie-Michele Gagnon of Canada took the win.

Wearing braces on both knees, the Ski Club Vail product led the competition after the super-G portion but posted only the 23rd time in the slalom run to finish 1.93 seconds behind Gagnon.

Vonn’s main rival for the overall title, Lara Gut of Switzerland, straddled a gate in the slalom and didn’t finish, allowing the four-time champion to extend her lead to 28 points.

“Yesterday, I thought I wouldn’t be able to ski today,” Vonn said. “But there was a small chance, and I believed in it. With this mind-set, a lot is possible. I am a fighter. Many think it’s just drama, but that’s nonsense. I have pain, but I can fight. I always give everything.”

Vonn crashed in Saturday’s super-G race after catching a spot of soft snow. She was brought down the hill on a rescue sled and underwent tests in a hospital.

Initially, she said she had suffered a “hairline fracture,” but after an additional test Sunday evening, Vonn wrote on Facebook that “the MRI shows a pretty substantial fracture in my tibia plateau. MCL looks decent as well as the rest of my knee. Now I will talk to my trainers and make a plan.”

Hours before Sunday’s race, Vonn posted a short video, showing how she had excess fluid removed from her knee.

“Drained my knee a few times and it’s feeling a little better. Going to go up on the hill and see how it feels,” she wrote.

Vonn inspected the course for the first leg and made one run on the warm-up course before deciding to actually start. She trailed the leader at the time, American teammate Laurenne Ross, by 0.36 seconds halfway down the course but won by more than a half-second on Ross with a strong finish.

Vonn screamed for joy after finishing, holding both arms and ski poles up in the air while waving to the spectators.
