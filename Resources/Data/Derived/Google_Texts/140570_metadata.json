John McCain of Arizona or Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have become regular targets of criticism from grass-roots and tea party activists.\n\nBut the Madison Project and the Senate Conservatives Fund announced this month that they are backing Milton Wolf, a tea-party-aligned activist and former Washington Times columnist, in his bid to knock off Mr. Roberts, who is seeking his fourth term in November.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Tea Party Voices\n\nThe Club for Growth, which also has taken sides in some Republican primaries, is staying on the sidelines for now and says it is watching the race develop.\n\n\u201cOver the past few decades, he has unfortunately become the quintessential career politician, failing to thwart the unprecedented growth of government when it really counted,\u201d the Madison Project said. \u201cNo degree of election-year foxhole conversions to voting conservative can compensate for the vacuum of a principled voice that has been missing in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nMatt Hoskins, spokesman for the Senate Conservative Fund, said Mr. Roberts has simply logged too much time inside the Capital Beltway.\n\n\u201cSen. Roberts has done some good things, but after more than 20 years in Washington it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two groups also have endorsed businessman Matt Bevin\u2019s attempt to oust Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky and \u2014 along with the Club for Growth \u2014 backed state Sen. Chris McDaniel\u2019s attempt to topple six-term Sen. Thad Cochran in Mississippi.\n\nFrustration over shutdown\n\nThe growing frustration with Mr. McConnell and Mr. Cochran reached a boiling point this year when they voted to reopen the federal government \u2014 a move that torpedoed Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s no-holds-barred effort to defund Obamacare.\n\nMr. Roberts, though, opposed the deal and has voted in lock step with the far right of his party on a variety of issues this year.\n\nHe voted against the $60 billion bill for Superstorm Sandy aid, which critics said contained billions of dollars for projects that were unrelated to the relief effort.\n\nHe has voted against raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and voted against tighter gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.\n\nHe also opposed the immigration deal that Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, pushed through the Senate and that included an \u201cearned\u201d pathway to citizenship.\n\n\u201cOn the surface, Roberts looks like a decent target,\u201d said Burdett Loomis, a professor of political science at the University of Kansas. \u201cBut over the last decade, and especially the past few years, Roberts has courted the far-right, tea party Republicans in Kansas, both through an increasingly conservative voting record and an aggressive public relations stance, such as his call for [Health and Human Services] Secretary Sebelius\u2019 resignation.\u201d\n\nMr. Loomis said, \u201cRoberts is receiving substantial support from almost all Kansas Republicans. I don\u2019t see much of an opening at all for Wolf, even if some outside groups may give him some assistance.\u201d\n\nVulnerable incumbents\n\nJennifer Duffy, of the Cook Political Report, said there is room for Mr. Wolf to outflank Mr. Roberts on the right. \u201cThese days, I don\u2019t think any Republican incumbent can take a primary challenge lightly, and Roberts is no exception,\u201d she said.\n\nAl Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said Mr. Roberts\u2018 86 percent lifetime rating with his group is \u201csatisfactory\u201d and enough to win its support in the Republican primary.\n\n\u201cSome of our friends out there are getting a bit out of hand,\u201d Mr. Cardenas said. \u201cMy sense is it\u2019s people who have more of a personal agenda than political agenda.\u201d\n\nHe also likened the attacks against Mr. Roberts to the attempts to cast Sen. John Cornyn as a liberal ahead of his re-election effort in Texas.\n\n\u201cHow can anyone primary him and call him a liberal? It is a joke, and it detracts from the credibility of the [tea party] movement,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan on supporting John Cornyn and Pat Roberts.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts is ranked as the fifth most conservative member of the Senate in the most recent breakdown from Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation.\n\nElection-year shifts?\n\nMr. Roberts\u2018 opponents say voters shouldn\u2019t be fooled by his voting record this year and point out that he ranked much lower on Heritage Action\u2019s 2012 list, with a score of 65 percent.\n\nThey also accuse him of adopting the same strategy that Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, employed during his re-election fight, running to the right during the campaign only to return to his moderate ways after he won another six-year term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that some of these incumbents are not liberals or even moderates,\u201d Daniel Horowitz, the group\u2019s policy director, said on they website. \u201cBut they are not conservatives either. They are a ruling class of special-interest career politicians who pursue personal power as an ends to itself. When it suits their need to cast some conservative votes, they will do so. But when they need to placate the special interests, they will jump in head first. They certainly will never put their careers on the line to fight for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pat Roberts has amassed one of the most conservative records in the Senate, so it was a surprise to many analysts this year when a Republican primary challenger vowed to run to the three-term senator's right.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Pat Roberts has amassed one of the most conservative records in the Senate, so it was a surprise to many analysts this year when a Republican primary challenger vowed to run to the three-term senator\u2019s right.", "title": "Tea party targets conservative Sen.
