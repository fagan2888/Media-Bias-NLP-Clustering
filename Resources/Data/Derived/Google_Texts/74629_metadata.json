Pot-brownie judging. Pipes. Vaporizers. Rolling papers. And, oh, by the way, there\u2019s also a county fair taking place.\n\nBut excuse the Denver County Fair organizers for making hay with marijuana while public interest is high.\n\nOrganizers said Tuesday that the fair\u2019s \u201cPot Pavilion\u201d will now occupy an entire floor of the National Western Complex during the event, which runs Aug. 1-3.\n\n\u201cOriginally, the pot pavilion was going to take just half of the third floor,\u201d said fair director Dana Cain. \u201cBut the response has just been enormous. We\u2019re having to turn away sponsors.\u201d\n\nThere will be no actual cannabis on the premises. Plant, bud and brownie judging will take place at an off-site licensed facility, then shown via video at the pot pavilion. But sponsors and vendors will be showing and selling smoking accessories. Entrance to the third floor will be restricted to people ages 21 and over.\n\nDenver-based OpenVape, a maker of vapor pens, is paying $10,000 for a major sponsorship of the pot pavilion. Edibles manufacturer Medically Correct is in for $5,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be part of the first pot pavilion,\u201d said Bob Eschino, co-founder of Medically Correct. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the pie-eating contests.\u201d\n\nPrizes will be given for fastest joint-rolling \u2014 using oregano in place of weed. Pot pavilion sponsor Medically Correct will be arranging shuttle rides to nearby dispensaries and recreational stores.\n\nThe pot pavilion\u2019s $19.95 poster \u2014 an image of a cherry pie with a crust cut-out resembling a marijuana leaf \u2014 is outselling the fair\u2019s main poster tenfold.\n\nCain noted that creating the pot pavilion took some give and take with the fair\u2019s landlord, the National Western Stock Show.\n\n\u201cWith the stock show folks, some of them are fairly conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew they\u2019d have some concerns. But we got all our ducks in a row. There\u2019s no pot, and everything takes place on a separate floor.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver County Fair putting high emphasis on \u201cPot Pavilion\u201d", "title": "Denver County Fair putting high emphasis on \u201cPot Pavilion\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/08/denver-county-fair-putting-high-emphasis-on-pot-pavilion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140408__denver-county-fair-2011p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140408__denver-county-fair-2011p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-08T12:32:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:04:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf54a\"", "article_summary": "Denver-based OpenVape, a maker of vapor pens, is paying $10,000 for a major sponsorship of the pot pavilion.\nPot pavilion sponsor Medically Correct will be arranging shuttle rides to nearby dispensaries and recreational stores.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be part of the first pot pavilion,\u201d said Bob Eschino, co-founder of Medically Correct.\n\u201cOriginally, the pot pavilion was going to take just half of the third floor,\u201d said fair director Dana Cain.\nPlant, bud and brownie judging will take place at an off-site licensed facility, then shown via video at the pot pavilion."}
