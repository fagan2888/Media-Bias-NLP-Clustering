His interview with Ezra Klein from last week is here.\n\n*****\n\nThe sustained opposition to the Affordable Care Act and the government shutdown have demonstrated the considerable power that the Tea Party retains among congressional Republicans, even as its support among voters has slipped. Tea-Party conservatives justify their views based on conservative principles. For example, they contend that the ACA is a symptom of a government grown so big that it encroaches on Americans\u2019 freedoms.\n\nBut if Tea Partyism is just conservatism, why don\u2019t all congressional conservatives embrace the Tea Party\u2019s approach to politics and public policy? Why does John Boehner, speaker of the House, often appear reluctant to embrace Tea Party tactics? Why did John McCain call congressional Tea Partiers \u201cwacko birds\u201d a while back? Why did Bob Dole say neither he nor Ronald Reagan would feel comfortable in today\u2019s Republican Party?\n\nMy new book on the Tea Party, co-authored with Matthew Barreto, seeks to better understand the Tea Party\u2019s motivations. We find that the Tea Party is driven by far more than garden-variety conservatism.\n\nWe argue that the Tea Party is better understood as a reactionary conservative force. It prefers the sorts of dramatic changes that threaten the stability traditional conservatives usually seek to preserve. Reactionary conservatives fear losing their way of life amid social change. To preserve their group\u2019s social prestige, they\u2019re willing to undermine long-established norms and institutions. Furthermore, reactionary conservatives are more likely to subscribe to conspiracy theories as a means of explaining the perceived erosion of their dominance. Reactionary conservatives will, therefore, claim that their \u201cenemies\u201d are destroying their way of life. Compromise is commensurate with defeat, not political expediency.\n\nThe difference between traditional and reaction conservatism is evident in an analysis that Barreto and I did of 42 Tea-Party websites in 15 states, alongside content from the website of a traditional conservative publication, the National Review. We found that the vast majority of National Review content emphasized core postwar conservative beliefs: small government, an emphasis on values, and strong national defense. Only five percent of the National Review\u2019s content focused upon conspiratorial themes. On the Tea-Party websites, only 30 percent of the content concentrated on postwar conservative beliefs. However, 33 percent of the content here was conspiratorial.\n\nIn our survey research, a list experiment also revealed how Tea Party conservatives think differently than other conservatives. We randomly divided survey respondents into two groups and asked them how many of a list of statements \u2014 but not which statements \u2014 they agreed with. The only thing that differed across the two groups was whether the list of statements included the proposition that \u201cObama is destroying the country.\u201d The results showed a striking divergence: 71 percent of Tea-Party conservatives agreed with this statement but six percent of non-Tea Party conservatives did.\n\nWe also explored the roots of identification with the Tea Party. We found that, even after controlling a host of factors \u2014 including ideology and attitudes toward African-Americans \u2014 Tea Party identifiers were more common among those believing that Obama actively promotes socialism. This again suggests motives more akin to reactionary conservatism.\n\nThe rift between Tea Party conservatives and others conservatives is one that challenges the Republican Party and potentially imperils the American economy if the debt ceiling is not raised. Although House Republicans rode a Tea Party wave to victory in 2010, Tea Party candidates arguably cost Republicans at least four Senate seats. In 2012, Republicans lost eight House seats, and two possible seats in the Senate.\n\nAn open question is whether the Republican Party will ultimately emulate William Buckley\u2019s handiwork from the 1960s. When Robert Welch and his John Birch Society continued to allege that establishment conservatives were in cahoots with the Soviet Union, Buckley essentially ejected them from the conservative movement. To his mind, the movement would cease to survive if burdened with the baggage of Welch\u2019s rhetoric. Buckley\u2019s move ultimately paid off. It set the stage for the success of a conservative movement that has been a force in American politics for almost 50 years.\n\nThe question is whether the conservative movement of today will remember that lesson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why Tea Party conservatives are not your ordinary conservatives.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Why Tea Party conservatives are not your ordinary conservatives.", "title": "\u201cThe Tea Party is better understood as a reactionary conservative force.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2013/10/08/the-tea-party-is-better-understood-as-a-reactionary-conservative-force/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2013/10/08/the-tea-party-is-better-understood-as-a-reactionary-conservative-force/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Tea Party, conservative, shutdown,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Tea Party, conservative, shutdown,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe170d\"", "article_summary": "We argue that the Tea Party is better understood as a reactionary conservative force.\nAlthough House Republicans rode a Tea Party wave to victory in 2010, Tea Party candidates arguably cost Republicans at least four Senate seats.\nMy new book on the Tea Party, co-authored with Matthew Barreto, seeks to better understand the Tea Party\u2019s motivations.\nIn our survey research, a list experiment also revealed how Tea Party conservatives think differently than other conservatives.\nThe rift between Tea Party conservatives and others conservatives is one that challenges the Republican Party and potentially imperils the American economy if the debt ceiling is not raised."}
