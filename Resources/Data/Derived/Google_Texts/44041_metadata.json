He added TrueChoices would be \u201copen for business for the major medical piece in line directly with the way that the federal exchange works\u201d for those who don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy as well.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s benefit advisors are also available \u201cas an education conduit between open enrollment periods now to get folks ready for the 2016 period.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In order to take advantage of the new, March 15-April 30 period, individuals\u00a0must report initial awareness of the penalty this tax season.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Overdrive", "og": {"site_name": "Overdrive", "description": "In order to take advantage of the new, March 15-April 30 period, individuals\u00a0must report initial awareness of the penalty this tax season.", "title": "Paying the Obamacare penalty this tax season?
