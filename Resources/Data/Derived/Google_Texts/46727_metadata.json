We couldn\u2019t live without it, but we may also take it for granted. In fact, 44 percent of Bexar County residents do not have access to broadband and 7.3 percent still use a dial up modem connection according to the latest Esri survey of electronics and internet use.To bring the Internet to more residents, the San Antonio Public library has created Connect at Central \u2013 a 12,800 square foot technology space at the downtown central library where residents can access the web on new desktops, laptops, and tablets with almost no wait time. The city has also upgraded Internet access in 13 other branch libraries so they could handle more computers and Wi-Fi devices. The improvements were funded by a grant of $1.5 million from the Federal Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, or BTOP, which was part of the 2009 stimulus package designed to bring broadband technology to communities without Internet access. San Antonio has gradually been upgrading their library infrastructure for the last three years. The last piece, Connect at Central, had its official grand opening Thursday.\u201cWe are excited that the library continues to play a role in addressing the digital divide,\u201d San Antonio Public Library Director Ramiro S. Salazar said. \u201cAs you know, many households cannot afford to provide access to high-speed internet so the library plays an important role in doing that and supporting such things as people registering for the Affordable Care Act.\u201dMayor Julian Castro says the upgrades are necessary to help San Antonians gain knowledge in the digital age.\u201cToday libraries are about books but they are also about technology,\u201d said Mayor Julian Castro. \u201cAnd Connect at Central strikes at the heart by providing a full multimedia experience and the possibility for wireless and digital learning here at the central library.\u201dConnect at Central adds a substantial amount of new hardware to the library: 100 new Apple desktops as well as 15 laptops and 20 Google Nexus 7 tablets available for checkout. Those entering the tech space are greeted by a \u201ctechnology test drive\u201d area where they can get comfortable using tablets and browse 36,000 digital items on a big touch screen referred to as the \u201coverdrive media station.\u201d Additionally, the free Wi-Fi has been upgraded to a gigabit connection which the city claims parallels Google Fiber.The teen services department received 18 new iMac desktops, new furniture, and a \u201cMediascape\u201d area where teens can display two laptop screens side by side on monitors and easily share files for collaborative learning. The computers are equipped with iMovie and other media programs. Additionally, the computers enable new educational programs such as News Know-How in which journalists from around the country teach teens how to use media and judge news validity. For adult education, the upgraded training center is fully stocked with desktops where the community can access a variety of job training classes. This includes general computer use, writing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, gaining interview skills, and preparing for standard college tests like the LSAT or G.R.E. They also teach how to use library databases and give users 1-on-1 assistance finding databases or downloading ebooks. While the library offered some of these services previously, they were formerly in a hands-off lecture format. \u201cTo me, training is the part that is most exciting,\u201d Reference Department Manager Dianna Morganti said. \u201cIt\u2019s a need we saw in our community.\u201dLearning about new technologies at the library may also be much less intimidating than the local electronics store. Library Assistant Director Kathy Donellan sees the library as a great place to learn new devices because of the comfortable environment.\u201cOne of the great things about the library environment and introducing people to technology is it\u2019s a really trusted resource for information. If someone comes in and they have never used a computer before, they feel comfortable asking for help and getting assistance,\u201d Donellan said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SiliconHills", "title": "Connect at Central Gives More San Antonian\u2019s Web Access - SiliconHills", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.SILICONHILLSNEWS.COM/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Teen-area-300x179.jpg", "url": "http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2013/10/25/connect-at-central-gives-more-san-antonians-web-access/", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0ba\"", "article_summary": "The city has also upgraded Internet access in 13 other branch libraries so they could handle more computers and Wi-Fi devices.\nbyBy ANDREW MOOREReporter with Silicon Hills NewsBroadband Internet access is not something new to the tech world.\nFor adult education, the upgraded training center is fully stocked with desktops where the community can access a variety of job training classes.\nSan Antonio has gradually been upgrading their library infrastructure for the last three years.\nThe last piece, Connect at Central, had its official grand opening Thursday.\u201cWe are excited that the library continues to play a role in addressing the digital divide,\u201d San Antonio Public Library Director Ramiro S.
