The organization\u2019s \u201clocal governing meeting notes\u201d page\u2019s most recent post is April 23rd. The Virginia \u201cTea Party Patriots\u201d web site says the Floyd group was \u201clast active 397 days ago.\u201d\n\nThe last post on the Floyd Tea Party web site is a collection of news cartoons and, ironically, the posting of each violates copyrights held by the cartoonists or their employers.\n\nThe nearby New River Valley tea party hasn\u2019t updated its web site since March 19 and that post was only the third of the year. Two only two other items for 2013 were posted in early January.\n\n\u201cThe tea party is barely a blip on the national radar,\u201d writes Bill Sher of The Week. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nThe tea party planned to use the just-completed August recess of Congress to mount a national protest campaign against immigration reform but it never really materialized because the people who really run the so-called \u201cgrassroots\u201d group are the billionaire Koch brothers and they support immigration.\n\nSo the effort fizzled and some feel that the tea party is dying along with it.\n\nNot quite. The tea party is not dead but it is a far cry from what it used to be and merely a bitter memory to those who once feared it would become a potent political power. The uproar over the targeting of the tea party and other conservative groups by the IRS kept it in the news for a while this year but that has largely faded.\n\nThe Floyd tea party tried to sideline the county\u2019s new comprehensive plan with loud, but baseless, claims that it was the puppet of some vague United Nations agenda but nobody in the county government listed to their hysteria.\n\nEfforts to derail the Sustain Floyd movement fell flat as well.\n\n\u201cThe Tea Party movement is dead. It\u2019s gone,\u201d says Chris Littleton, cofounder of the Ohio Liberty Council, a statewide coalition of Tea Party groups in Ohio. \u201cI think largely the Tea Party is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nLittleton\u2019s comment was not made recently. He said it in early 2012 in a prediction that the tea party\u2019s choices for the Republican presidential nomination had little chance at winning. He was right. Every tea party candidate for President fell by the wayside n the primaries and the inclusion of tea party favorite Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate didn\u2019t mean a thing to voter. They lost.\n\nTea party leaders claim the problem lies with what they call the failure of Republican leadership to listen to their demands. A Pew Research poll released a few days ago says 71 percent of American voters who support the tea party are unhappy with the GOP leadership and want change.\n\nThere\u2019s a big problem with that poll. Those who support the tea party represent only a very small portion of the voter population. A poll by Rasmussen Reports in January found that only eight percent of likely American voters are members of the tea party.\n\nThe demise of tea party influence may best be expressed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who was once a poster child for the party.\n\nThe threat of a tea party-backed primary challenge used to scare Republicans but when the tea baggers threatened to mount a primary challenge against Ryan because he supports immigration reform he just shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it all and I am used to this kind of political activity,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt does not surprise me; it doesn\u2019t really affect me.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nGoogle\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Hill Blue", "description": "With Ken Cuccinelli, their favorite son candidate for governor going down in flames, it\u2019s little wonder the so-called \u201ctea party patriots\u201d are keeping a low profile in Virginia lately.
