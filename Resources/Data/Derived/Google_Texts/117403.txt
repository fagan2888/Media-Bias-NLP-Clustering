World class professional eater Randy Santel knew exactly what he was getting into when he decided on his career path: a lot of calories from unhealthy food sources. As Santel explains, he didn’t get into competitive eating to hurt himself.

However, by consuming one meal a day that consists of more than 7,000 calories, that’s exactly what he’s doing. To help preserve his health, Santel has taken appropriate steps, including an adequate amount of exercise and fiber supplements to make sure he’s getting essential vitamins.

“We follow Randy Santel — world-class professional eater and proud owner of FoodChallenges.com — during his month-long European tour where he takes on a new food challenge every day,” the Munchies video description reads. “In London, Randy dominates Meat Liquor’s Triple Chilli Challenge in a matter of minutes; then, he travels to seaside town Portsmouth to devour the Wicked Waffle challenge. But behind the gastro glory and YouTube fame, the life of a pro eater can be a lonely one.”

Although most nutritionists actually recommend a cheat meal once in a while, competitive eaters like Santel take the idea of a cheat meal to the extreme. Not only is he consuming upward of 8,000 calories from fried foods loaded with sugar and salt, but he’s also doing so in one sitting at his fastest pace.

Time will only tell if Santel’s profession is causing any long-term health side effects.
