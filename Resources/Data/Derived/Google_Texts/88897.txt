From Iowa, to New Hampshire, and now in South Carolina.

20-year-old Garrett O'Daniel has followed presidential hopeful and Texan Ted Cruz to Spartanburg.

"After hearing so many speeches and rallies if I didn't have a vote before now it's definitely going to Ted," O’Daniel said.

It's about the message.

"I will go to congress and I will repeal every word of Obamacare,” said Cruz. "I look forward to nominating and confirming someone to replace Scalia on the US Supreme Court."

A message that may be resonating well with voters in the state.

"What can you do to keep people accountable because the culture in Washington is disgusting," asked one Cruz supporter.

A national poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal now calling Cruz the frontrunner.

Cruz said, "We don’t work for lobbyists, stand and fight for them."

But while Cruz may be up now nationally, rival Donald Trump still has a healthy lead in the latest South Carolina polls.
