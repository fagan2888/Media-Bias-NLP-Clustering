Rick Sacra was transported to The Nebraska Medical Center Friday, after contracting the Ebola virus while treating patients in West Africa.\n\nOn whether he\u2019s turned a corner:\n\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s too soon to say at this point. We\u2019re encouraged by his progress, but we also have to remember that he\u2019s still very sick.\u201d --Hewlett\n\n\u201cThis disease, the Ebola virus, is something that can have phases. He can start out and improve and then later have some medical complications. It\u2019s far too early to relax and say we\u2019re out of the woods, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen.\u201d -- Phil Smith\n\n\u201cWe really have to take this day by day. We\u2019re monitoring him as we would with any sick patient, our critical care parameters, checking viral signs and watching him. We have to keep in mind that although he has a disease like Ebola, he also is a patient and we as healthcare providers treat sick patients every day. So we\u2019re doing the same things for him that we would for any other sick patient.\u201d -- Angela Hewlett\n\nOn the personal side:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in his room for several hours every day, and he\u2019s a very fine person. Very humanistic. He\u2019s got a good sense of humor and we\u2019ve chatted about a number of things.\u201d -- Smith\n\n\u201cHe said he was from Massachusetts and he\u2019s a Red Sox fan. I said I have bad news for you, I\u2019m a Yankees fan. He said \u2018uh oh, this could be tough!\u2019\u201d -- Smith\n\nMore on his treatment:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s virtually the same strain. And I\u2019ve been on the phone with people from Emory every day and people who have treated Ebola every day. The professional community has been very helpful. Dr. Hewlett had a conversation with some physicians in Liberia and they\u2019ve all been able to share bits of information that are very helpful.\u201d -- Smith\n\n\u201cAs with any patient we\u2019re taking into account other concerns, not just his medical care. His spiritual and non-tangible issues when we take care of patients who are this ill. And I think talking to his family and going back and forth with them has been helpful and we\u2019ll continue to encourage him to do this.\u201d -- Hewlett", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Nebraska Medical Center doctors caring for an Ebola virus patient said Sunday they\u2019ve seen positive signs but his chances for recovery still are uncertain.", "title": "Doctors say Ebola patient is making progress", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/doctors-say-ebola-patient-is-making-progress/article_f1cbd932-36d3-11e4-8555-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/c7/9c732d90-36d4-11e4-a3b5-001a4bcf6878/540ccc1a7229b.image.jpg?resize=1170%2C780", "height": 780}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "description": "Nebraska Medical Center doctors caring for an Ebola virus patient said Sunday they\u2019ve seen positive signs but his chances for recovery still are uncertain."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c5a\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re monitoring him as we would with any sick patient, our critical care parameters, checking viral signs and watching him.\nAnd I\u2019ve been on the phone with people from Emory every day and people who have treated Ebola every day.\nRick Sacra was transported to The Nebraska Medical Center Friday, after contracting the Ebola virus while treating patients in West Africa.\nWe have to keep in mind that although he has a disease like Ebola, he also is a patient and we as healthcare providers treat sick patients every day.\nWe\u2019re encouraged by his progress, but we also have to remember that he\u2019s still very sick.\u201d --Hewlett\u201cThis disease, the Ebola virus, is something that can have phases."}
