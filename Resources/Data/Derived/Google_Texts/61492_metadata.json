(Where else?) \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a politically correct war. We need to grow up. We need to mature. If you\u2019re going to have rules for war, you should just have a rule that says no war. Other than that, we have to win. Our life depends on it,\u201d he added.\n\nOf course, as a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, the U.S. is bound by international standards during war, although it\u2019s not as if that has always stopped us. Beyond the brazen disregard for international law, however, what\u2019s most notable about Carson\u2019s remarks is his fixation on \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d This hardly separates Carson from his fellow conservatives, many of whom are committed to the narrative that we live in an age of censorship and fear, enforced by the agents of a politically correct reign of terror.\n\nTurn on your television, read a newspaper, or read the comments at Breitbart.com, however, and you\u2019ll find that \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d (i.e., Islamophobic, homophobic, sexist, racist, etc.) speech remains as prevalent as ever. As Oliver Burkeman argues, conservatives really take issue not with constraints on such speech, but with a changing society in which one is liable to encounter objections to bigoted utterances.\n\nStill, Carson\u2019s nascent 2016 bid seems to be as much a campaign against political correctness as it is an effort in opposition to Hillary Clinton or his prospective Republican rivals \u2014 let alone an affirmative campaign about his vision for the country. Appearing on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d after the Southern Poverty Law Center briefly included him on a list of right-wing extremists, Carson proclaimed that political correctness is \u201cdestroying our nation,\u201d imperiling the constitutional framework laid by America\u2019s founders.\n\nCarson sees himself as a fearless champion of that framework, a lonely prophet of moral truth and reason amid a culture of obfuscation and politically correct hysteria \u2014 hence his apparent conviction, despite never having sought nor held political office, that his is a necessary voice in the 2016 presidential contest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The neurosurgeon-turned-presidential hopeful seems to be running against an idea as anything else", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s bizarre obsession with \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d: What his crusade is really about", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The neurosurgeon-turned-presidential hopeful seems to be running against an idea as anything else", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s bizarre obsession with \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d: What his crusade is really about", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/17/ben_carsons_bizarre_obsession_with_political_correctness_what_his_crusade_is_really_about/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/ben_carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The neurosurgeon-turned-presidential hopeful seems to be running against an idea as anything else", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s bizarre obsession with \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d: What his crusade is really about", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/ben_carson.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Ben Carson, Conservatives, geneva convention, GOP 2016, michael brown, political correctness, war crimes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfc8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a politically correct war.\nIf you\u2019re going to have rules for war, you should just have a rule that says no war.\nAppearing on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d after the Southern Poverty Law Center briefly included him on a list of right-wing extremists, Carson proclaimed that political correctness is \u201cdestroying our nation,\u201d imperiling the constitutional framework laid by America\u2019s founders.\nStill, Carson\u2019s nascent 2016 bid seems to be as much a campaign against political correctness as it is an effort in opposition to Hillary Clinton or his prospective Republican rivals \u2014 let alone an affirmative campaign about his vision for the country.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Ben Carson, Conservatives, geneva convention, GOP 2016, michael brown, political correctness, war crimes, Politics NewsBen Carson, the neurosurgeon-turned-conservative rabble-rouser and potential 2016 presidential candidate,made headlinesover the holiday weekend after he declared, as any good authoritarian would, that there should be no rules governing America\u2019s wartime conduct."}
