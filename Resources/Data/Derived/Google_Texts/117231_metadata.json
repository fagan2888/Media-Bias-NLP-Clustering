For those who are already starting to plan the entire year's journeys, the winter season offers endless of opportunities for adventures. Although traversing the National Parks is an activity often reserved for the summer, the stark contrast of snow and cold is also a breathtaking sight for tourists. Another plus: the parks are usually not as crowded in the winter months as they are in warm weather.\n\n\"You get these completely white-coated trees,\" Yellowstone National Park spokeswoman Sandy Snell-Dobert told Travel and Leisure. \"It looks like Christmas gone wild.\"\n\nYellowstone National Park (Wyoming, Montana and Idaho)\n\nOne of the most celebrated parks in the country, Yellowstone National Park is just as awe-inspiring in the winter as it is any other time of the year as the jagged sights of the park are blanketed by powder white snow. Tourists can enjoy the quiet of the park at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, which is only accessible via a snowcoach. From frozen waterfalls to the famed geysers, the Yellowstone National Park is a different experience in its off-peak months.\n\nEverglades National Park (Florida)\n\nWhile snow and ice invade much of the country, the December to April months spell the driest season for Florida's premiere park. It's the best time to visit Everglades as the sunny weather is pleasant and means less mosquitoes and bugs preying on tourists. The dry climate also increases the likelihood to see alligators and other wildlife in the watering holes.\n\nBryce Canyon National Park (Utah)\n\nThe reddish spikes of limestone in Bryce Canyon National Park is striking enough on a regular day, but it's even more spectacular snow-capped. The Travel and Leisure report recommended going on a ranger-led full moon snowshoe hike or setting a trip for premiere star-gazing opportunity in the solitude of the vast Utah park.\n\nArches National Park (Utah)\n\nAnother Utah treasure that's a must-visit in wintertime is the Arches National Park, which boasts a stunning landscape with snow-topped red boulders stretch over the horizon. According to a report from Wilderness.org, the snow could render some of the trails impassable, so proper planning and coordination is necessary when stopping by this National Park during the colder months.\n\nDenali National Park (Alaska)\n\nSnow isn't an uncommon sight at Denali National Park, but as harsh and unforgiving winter descends in the region in October, there are undeniable upsides waiting for travelers. Those seeking solitude will find it here as the peaceful landscapes offers a quiet escape during winter. According to Wilderness.org, there are snowshoe walks, skiing and dog sledding in the park, as well as a chance to spot the famous aurora borealis if you're lucky.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The life of a traveler is all-year-round.
