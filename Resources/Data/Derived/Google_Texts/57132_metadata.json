Well, the filming is, at least. We still have 13 episodes left to watch this season, thankfully. The cast took to social media on Dec. 18 and got super sentimental about their last day of filming.\n\nWrapped on #Haven5 What an amazing, life changing, educational ride it's been. Love this gang, words can't express it, so I'll quit tryin \u2014 Adam (Edge) Copeland (@EdgeRatedR) December 19, 2014\n\nHeading in now for bittersweet day 151 of #Haven5 who knew I'd gain a new family when I came on board as that shaggy Viking \"cleaner\" \u2014 Adam (Edge) Copeland (@EdgeRatedR) December 18, 2014\n\nHe's clearly in mourning. What a journey how lucky am I? \u201c@TheLucasBryant: last day. holy moly. such love. #Haven5 pic.twitter.com/ja59IHo9ka\u201d \u2014 Emily Rose (@EmilyroseLA) December 19, 2014\n\nLast day of school on #Haven5. Proud of how far @EdgeRatedR has come as an actor!

He's starring in an upcoming four-episode arc. His character will apparently have the power to affect the town of Haven in a big way.\n\nThis week @Christian4Peeps & I got to work with @WilliamShatner kinda crazy for two nerdy kids from Orangeville. Bill's a class act #Haven5 \u2014 Adam (Edge) Copeland (@EdgeRatedR) December 18, 2014\n\nMissing my #Haven5 family already. \u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) December 17, 2014\n\n\n\nIn the midseason finale, we said goodbye to Mara and hello to a whole new world of Troubles. Duke, who was given some very strange Troubles by Mara, exploded upon her exit. Black tears poured out of him and rained down on the townspeople, one by one.\n\nThis happened just as a dark, heavy and ominous cloud came rolling in. Whatever's about to happen to Haven doesn't look good.\n\nThe promo shows tons of explosions, likely a side effect of these new Troubles from Duke.\n\n\n\n\"Haven\" will return sometime in 2015.\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n\u00a9 2015 Fashion & Style.com All rights reserved.
