Gerhart\u2019s spokesman, Chance McElhaney, says the concern now is the money that was left over.\n\nHe says the lawsuit is based on where the federal government stands compared to other creditors when it comes to the money. Gerhart says the feds believe they should be paid first. \u201cThe federal government has taken the position that they have a super priority ahead of all other creditors,\u201d McElhaney explains. \u201cThe insurance commissioner\u2026believes otherwise, that they are not the super creditor, vis-a-vis all other creditors.\u201d\n\nMcElhaney says the money would first go to the guarantee associations that paid the medical claims, but ultimately the state could end up on the hook if not paid from the liquidation funds. \u201cIt would be a direct impact of 20 million dollars to the State of Iowa \u2014 about 40 million to state of Nebraska \u2014 for 60 million total,\u201d McElhaney says.\n\nThe federal government is claiming it is not subject to the authority of the Iowa district court, which would force the proceedings into federal court. McElhaney says a court hearing has not yet been set.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over the way\u2026", "title": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner files suit over CoOpportunity liquidation funds", "url": "http://www.radioiowa.com/2016/05/04/iowa-insurance-commissioner-files-suit-over-coopportunity-liquidation-funds/", "image": {"width": 224, "identifier": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nick-Gerhart.jpg", "height": 286}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-04T13:59:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T13:59:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The federal government is claiming it is not subject to the authority of the Iowa district court, which would force the proceedings into federal court.\nIowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over the way millions of dollars are divided up from the liquidated CoOportunity insurance exchange.\n\u201cIt would be a direct impact of 20 million dollars to the State of Iowa \u2014 about 40 million to state of Nebraska \u2014 for 60 million total,\u201d McElhaney says.\n\u201cThe federal government has taken the position that they have a super priority ahead of all other creditors,\u201d McElhaney explains.\nHe says the lawsuit is based on where the federal government stands compared to other creditors when it comes to the money."}
