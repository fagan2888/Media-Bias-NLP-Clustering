Earlier this fall, he became the first sitting President to visit a federal prison; he\u2019s also taken ground-breaking steps toward clean energy requirements to go with what was previously his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In 2014, Future dropped his tepidly received sophomore album, Honest, and the brutal Monster.\n\nSubscribe to XXL on\n\nListen to Lil Bibby Feat.
