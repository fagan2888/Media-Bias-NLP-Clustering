She became the first state-level surgeon general in the country and, at the conclusion of her terms, returned to the Henry Ford Health System, where she is now an executive in charge of community-level wellness initiatives.\n\nToday, her programs are making progress in improving Detroit\u2019s high infant mortality rate, preventing unintended pregnancies, combating obesity and boosting fruit and vegetable consumption among low-income school children.\n\nWisdom, 58, is the recipient of this year\u2019s Eleanor Josaitis Unsung Hero Award, sponsored by the Detroit Free Press and the Metropolitan Affairs Coalition.\n\n\u201cShe has the ability to make quick, decisive decisions that comes from her experience as an emergency department physician,\u201d said Robert Riney, chief operating officer for the Henry Ford Health System, \u201cbut she also has the patience to understand how you have to navigate through the political process when you\u2019re trying to really create policy or financial infrastructure for an initiative.\u201d\n\nAs Henry Ford\u2019s senior vice president of community health and equity and the chief wellness and diversity officer, Wisdom is focused on improving the many \u201csocial determinants\u201d of health among metro Detroit residents, such as access to nutritional foods and to prenatal care for expectant mothers.\n\nOne of her programs aimed at eliminating race and class inequities in health care last month won the national Equity of Care Award from the American Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cThere are many social determinants of health that are outside of the medical arena,\u201d Wisdom explained in an interview from her office at Henry Ford\u2019s Detroit headquarters. \u201cThat means we can have the finest highest-quality medical care, but if we don\u2019t help people with jobs and transportation and access to healthy foods, then we\u2019re not going to have the outcomes that we need to see.\u201d\n\nShe is extremely passionate about lowering the infant mortality rate in Detroit, where an average of 200 babies a year were once dying before their first birthday, a rate that rivaled that of some third-world countries.\n\nWisdom convened a regional infant mortality task force, which led to the creation of the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network alliance between metro Detroit hospitals and health care providers. This alliance aims to help expectant mothers from Detroit\u2019s most underserved neighborhoods.\n\nPreliminary data show that there were no infant deaths among the first 200 babies born between 2012 and 2013 whose mothers enrolled in the alliance network.\n\nWisdom grew up in Groton, Conn., where her father was an architectural engineer who helped design the USS Nautilus, the world\u2019s first nuclear-powered submarine. She was one of the few black girls in her school and dreamed of becoming a doctor, despite the advice of a school guidance counselor who had warned that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a Negro doctor. No such thing as a woman doctor, you should choose a profession in keeping with your race,\u201d she recalled.\n\nUndeterred, she went on to college at the University of Pennsylvania and later to medical school at the University of Michigan. But it was in Henry Ford\u2019s emergency rooms in New Center and Dearborn that Wisdom encountered the sort of health problems that became the focus of her later work. This included preventable blindness and amputations from Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\u201cWhere I really received a major education was in that emergency department,\u201d Wisdom said.\n\nIn 2003, she was tapped by then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm for the new position of Michigan surgeon general. Until that time, no state had its own surgeon general. She served until the end of the Granholm administration in December 2010.\n\n\u201cI accepted the challenge and felt very honored and privileged to serve in that post and to continue to drive change at the state level on many of the same initiatives \u2014 chronic diseases, childhood obesity reduction, infant mortality, teen pregnancy prevention \u2014 that I cared about here in the (Henry Ford) system,\u201d Wisdom said.\n\nAs surgeon general, Wisdom launched public health initiatives to combat obesity, childhood lead poisoning, unintended teen pregnancies and to reduce smoking. She gave more than 400 speeches across the state and advocated for the 2004 increase to the tobacco tax.\n\nShe helped start Generation with Promise, an initiative that educates students from low-income families in Detroit and Macomb County about boosting their fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity.\n\nWisdom was recruited back to Henry Ford at the end of her time as surgeon general. She brought the Generation with Promise initiative with her, which now serves more than 20,800 individuals a year, or twice as many as in 2012.\n\n\u201cBeyond all of her clinical and administrative skills, it\u2019s her personal passion for equity of care, for eliminating disparities and for health and prevention that are probably her greatest gifts,\u201d Riney said.\n\nIn February 2012, President Barack Obama appointed Wisdom to be a member of the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion and Integrative and Public Health \u2014 a creation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGov. Rick Snyder did not continue Michigan\u2019s surgeon general position when his administration took office, \u201cbut I\u2019m still hopeful that he will consider it at some point,\u201d Wisdom said.\n\n\u201cThis is about the health of communities and is a nonpartisan issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all should care about the health of our young people, our seniors, our community, because a healthier community drives a healthier economy.\u201d\n\nContact JC Reindl: jcreindl@freepress.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1Jd2uRR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Changes begins in the community, she said, in road to wellness", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "description": "Changes begins in the community, she said, in road to wellness", "title": "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom: Focus on healthier Detroit", "url": "http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/08/22/kimberlydawn-wisdom-eleanor-josaitis-award/32214153/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/freep.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Changes begins in the community, she said, in road to wellness", "title": "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom: Focus on healthier Detroit", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abedf679ed8721f2b73ad337be67b5d51196b716/c=428-0-2223-1795&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/22/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635758732006117564-KimberlydawnWisdom-081415-SG04.JPG", "creator": "@freep", "site": "@freep", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600072714", "fb": {"app_id": 185931034751252}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "shining light, kimberlydawn wisdom, eleanor josaitis award, Henry Ford Hospital"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbce1\"", "article_summary": "She encountered nearly every possible injury and ailment during her decades as an emergency department doctor with the Henry Ford Health System.\n(Photo: Salwan Georges Detroit Free Press)Buy PhotoA week in a Detroit hospital emergency room can be an education.\nKimberly P.
