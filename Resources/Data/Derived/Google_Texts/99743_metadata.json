March, is there a deadline?\n\nObama: The end of March, absolutely, yes it is.\n\nFallon: Because a lot of young people watch our show. Would you like to tell me \u2014 why would they \u2014 because a lot people don\u2019t have the money to spend on this.\n\nObama: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, young people can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they are 26. But once they hit 26, they\u2019re on their own and a lot of young people think they are invincible. But the truth is, young people are knuckleheads, you know? They\u2019re the ones who are cooking for the first time and slice their finger open. They\u2019re dancing on the bar stool. They\u2019re, you know.\n\nFallon: Young people. Yea, yea, yea, yea. I would never do both of those things just last summer. No, no, no.\n\nObama: But while young people think they\u2019re invincible, they\u2019re not. You know, life happens. And as a mother, and I know there are a lot of moms out there who worry that their kids are going to, you know, have a a terrible accident, get a bad diagnosis and they won\u2019t have health care. And before they couldn\u2019t get it because they couldn\u2019t afford it. And now young people can get insurance for as little as $50 a month, less than the cost of gym shoes. And, you know, for the moms and dads who are out there worried about their kids, we want you to encourage your kids to sign up for that peace of mind that we all look for.\n\nFallon: Healthcare.gov is the website if you haven\u2019t read about it in the news or anything. Yea, you know what it is. It\u2019s up and running.\n\nObama: It\u2019s working!\n\nFallon: It\u2019s working now. It\u2019s so much better when it\u2019s working.\n\nObama: It helps. That helps.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Michelle Obama appeared on \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon\" Thursday to sell Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Michelle Obama appeared on \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon\" Thursday to sell Obamacare:    Fallon: While you're here, I have to talk to you -- I want to talk to you about the Affordable Care A", "title": "Michelle Obama sells Obamacare: \u2018Young people are knuckleheads\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/21/michelle-obama-sells-obamacare-young-people-are-knuckleheads/", "image": {"width": 815, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-e1392978430937.png", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama: 'Young people are knuckleheads'", "title": "Michelle Obama sells Obamacare: \u2018Young people are knuckleheads\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/21/michelle-obama-sells-obamacare-young-people-are-knuckleheads/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-e1392978430937.png"}, "creator": "@Jamie_Weinstein", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-21 05:39:45", "sailthru.title": "Michelle Obama sells Obamacare: 'Young people are knuckleheads'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "jimmy-fallon,michelle-obama,jamie-weinstein", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jimmy fallon,michelle obama", "sailthru.description": "Michelle Obama appeared on \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon\" Thursday to sell Obamacare:    Fallon: While you're here, I have to talk to you -- I want to talk to you about the Affordable Care A", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-e1392978430937.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd167c\"", "article_summary": "Yea, yea, yea, yea.\nObama: But while young people think they\u2019re invincible, they\u2019re not.\nObama: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, young people can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they are 26.\nBut once they hit 26, they\u2019re on their own and a lot of young people think they are invincible.\nBut the truth is, young people are knuckleheads, you know?"}
