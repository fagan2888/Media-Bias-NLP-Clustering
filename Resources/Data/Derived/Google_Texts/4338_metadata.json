TV providers up there are in the midst of creating \u201cpick-and-pay\u201d options for viewers. Starting Dec. 1, after subscribing to a basic service package, they will be able to select individual channels they want access to.\n\nAnd \u2014 ta-dah! \u2014 they won\u2019t get or pay for the ones they don\u2019t want to watch.\n\nThis advancement has received very little media coverage in the United States, but it might be the greatest innovation in communication since smoke signals.\n\nOur household can watch 433 channels on cable, but the monthly bill is rapidly approaching four figures. I watch ESPN, but not E!, EWIN, ENCORE, ENCORE Classic, or Esquire. Food Network is good, but not FX, FXX, FYI or Fuse.\n\nThe transition, which had been mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), is being made in two stages. As of March 1, TV providers had to offer a basic package, mostly comprised of Canadian and U.S. networks, education and public service channels. Cost of this is mandated at $25 per month \u2014 or less.\n\nIf they wish, Canadians can add small bundles of channels \u2014 10 or less \u2014 to the basic service. Picking single channels will be possible after Dec. 1, but the price is yet undetermined.\n\nAccording to the Access Communications Company in Regina, Saskatchewan, which is just down the road from Moose Jaw, its current rates for TV are:\n\n\u2022 $19.95 per month for the \u201cbasic,\u201d or what it calls the \u201cskinny\u201d package. If coupled with Internet service, that price is reduced by $10.\n\n\u2022 $17.95 per month for the 10-channel sports package plus one other package.\n\nIn other words, for $38 per month, I would be in Video Valhalla.\n\n(Yes, the U.S. dollar is worth 25 percent more than theirs, but figuring that out would make my head hurt.)\n\nAccording to the CRTC, \u201cCanadians can choose the TV service that meets their needs, realities and budgets.\u201d\n\nWhat a novel approach.\n\nThe head of the commission, Jean-Pierre Blais, says the move \u201creflects what we\u2019ve heard from Canadians who have expressed frustration that to access a particular channel they had to pay for a station they didn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nOf course, we Yanks have expressed the same \u201cfrustrations\u201d to our own Federal Communications Commission and even to our elected officials in Washington. But at present, our pols seem more interested in telling airlines how big the seats in their airplanes must be than addressing the TV issue.\n\nCould it be that the TV lobbyists are funneling more campaign money to the congressmen than the airline people are?\n\nThe big news from Canada might be that \u201cpick-and-pay\u201d is very possible from a technological standpoint. All we have heard south of Canada\u2019s southern border is how difficult and expensive it would be for the cable/satellite companies to provide such an option.\n\nSo, we can hit the \u201cmute\u201d button on that excuse.\n\nOur FCC and providers should adopt a Canada-like model. As they say up north, it is \u201ca-boot time.\u201d\n\nDick Hilker (dhilker529@aol.com) is a retired Denver suburban newspaper editor and columnist.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hilker: In Canada, doing TV right", "title": "Hilker: In Canada, doing TV right", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/11/hilker-in-canada-doing-tv-right/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160311__DP_NGPS_Export20160313_Z00_OP13C_HILKERp1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160311__DP_NGPS_Export20160313_Z00_OP13C_HILKERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-11T13:38:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:39:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TV providers up there are in the midst of creating \u201cpick-and-pay\u201d options for viewers.\nAccording to the CRTC, \u201cCanadians can choose the TV service that meets their needs, realities and budgets.\u201dWhat a novel approach.\nAs of March 1, TV providers had to offer a basic package, mostly comprised of Canadian and U.S. networks, education and public service channels.\nStarting Dec. 1, after subscribing to a basic service package, they will be able to select individual channels they want access to.\nIf they wish, Canadians can add small bundles of channels \u2014 10 or less \u2014 to the basic service."}
