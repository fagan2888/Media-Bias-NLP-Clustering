Premiums have already been set for 2016, but if those other companies suddenly get an influx of new customers\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ll find in the course of 2016 if the premium dollars we collect are enough to pay for the claims that we receive,\u201d said Chambers.\n\nIf those premiums aren\u2019t high enough to cover all the new clients, then the cost will come back to you.\n\nOpen enrollment begins November 1 and in order to have coverage on the first day of the new year, you must enroll by December 15.\n\nCoventry will continue offering private health insurance plans to Kansans, however those plans will not be eligible for the government tax credit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With another open enrollment period just ten days away, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company and Coventry Health Care of Kansas Inc. are backing out.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411759231", "og": {"site_name": "KSNT News", "description": "With another open enrollment period just ten days away, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company and Coventry Health Care of Kansas Inc. are backing out.", "title": "Thousands of Kansans forced to find new health insurance", "url": "http://ksnt.com/2015/10/21/thousands-of-kansans-forced-to-find-new-health-insurance/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvksnt.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/5e27672c586346f6a157e94abc4cee74.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With another open enrollment period just ten days away, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company and Coventry Health Care of Kansas Inc. are backing out.", "title": "Thousands of Kansans forced to find new health insurance", "image": {"src": "https://lintvksnt.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/5e27672c586346f6a157e94abc4cee74.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@KSNTNews", "site": "KSNTNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Coventry, Kansas Insurance Department, Mary Beth Chambers, Clark Schultz, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company and Coventry Health Care of Kansas Inc, Affordable Care Act, Health Insurance Marketplace, Health Insurance Exchange, Kansas Health Insurance, Health Insurance Open Enrollment, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City, Blue Cross Blue Shield Kansas Solutions, United Healthcare of the Midwest, Kansas Insurance Commissioner", "msapplication-tooltip": "Topeka Kansas News and Weather", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.ksnt", "fb": {"pages": 227750827236117}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://ksnt.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/831e03df9b59ab65cec42b7c872ab61c?s=16", "application-name": "KSNT News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kansas-First-News/227750827236117?ref=hl", "published_time": "2015-10-22T00:42:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-23T17:06:35+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "RypGo1rfT1e_G4mHaYQDlee48U-BLsurDmYtfpKr3I0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb217\"", "article_summary": "Coventry will continue offering private health insurance plans to Kansans, however those plans will not be eligible for the government tax credit.\nTOPEKA (KSNT) \u2014 45,000 Kansans are now faced with a search for a new health insurance provider.\nThis comes after two key providers decided to drop out of the health insurance exchange, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, starting next year.\nWith another open enrollment period just 10 days away, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company and Coventry Health Care of Kansas Inc. are backing out.\n\u201cWe knew what providers were going to be providing policies on the exchange and them pulling out, doing it so last minute, it has caused us concerns,\u201d said Clark Schultz, a spokesman for the Kansas Insurance Department."}
