She always saw a serious, no-nonsense ballplayer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his game face,\u201d she said. \u201cFans don\u2019t really get to see the real Todd very often.\u201d\n\nBut the softer side of Todd Helton emerged Monday afternoon when the icon of the Rockies\u2019 franchise formally announced his retirement from Major League Baseball before the Rockies hosted the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to be your first baseman for the last 17 years,\u201d the 40-year-old Helton said at a jam-packed suite at Coors Field. \u201cI have grown from a man, to a husband and into a father. We have seen the good times and the bad. It\u2019s been a pleasure to share all of that with you.\u201d\n\nIt was clear that Helton was talking, not just to the assembled Rockies players, coaches and staff members, but to his legions of fans.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got to the big leagues 17 years ago, I had an energy and a passion that was great,\u201d said Helton, who first announced to The Denver Post on Saturday that he was retiring at the end of this season. \u201cI\u2019m excited to have that same passion as I start a new phase of my life.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but Helton, who has been playing baseball since he was 5, will have a hard time letting go of the game of his life. He teared up several times, and his voice broke as he said good-bye. Among those in attendance was Matt Holliday, the current Cardinals outfielder who helped the Rockies and Helton reach the World Series in 2007.\n\n\u201cHe was an elite player for a long time,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Hall of Famer to me.\u201d\n\nHelton \u2014 who started at first base and hit fifth against the Cardinals \u2014 was joined at the podium by Christy and his daughters: Tierney, 11, and Gentry, 4.\n\nHelton thanked many people, from original Rockies owner Jerry McMorris to former manager Clint Hurdle, who now leads the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nHelton praised Rockies fans, breaking into his Tennessee drawl when he said,\u201dY\u2019all have been a model of consistency.\u201d\n\nHelton joked, too, wondering how the women displaying the \u201cTodd Helton, No. 17\u201d sign in center field managed to hold up the banner night after night. He choked up when he talked about what he\u2019s leaving behind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss walking out of the tunnel at night, walking past Charlotte (Johnson, who is in charge of the gate through which the players leave), saying good night, trying to figure out how I\u2019m going to get a hit the next day or how we\u2019re going to win a game the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s going to be the hardest.\u201d\n\nHe also said he will miss working in the batting cage, where he honed his craft. He entered Monday\u2019s game with a .317 career batting average, a .415 on-base percentage, 2,505 career hits, 367 home runs and 586 doubles (16th all time). His career average is the eighth-highest for any player since 1946 (minimum 5,000 at-bats).\n\nAfter Monday night\u2019s game against the Cardinals, Helton has just 11 games remaining in his career. Asked what he would like to do in the remaining games, he joked, \u201cI\u2019d like to hit about 40 more home runs.\u201d\n\nAsked about the possibility of being inducted into the Hall of Fame, Helton said: \u201cObviously it\u2019s an honor to be even considered in that discussion, but that\u2019s for a later date.\u201d\n\nHelton, who has had his share of injuries in his 17-year career \u2014 including a chronic lower-back problem that plagued him for the last decade \u2014 carries the reputation as a warrior. He touched on that when asked what advice he would give to young players coming into the majors.\n\n\u201cTom Probst (the former team trainer and current director of medical operations) pulled me aside my rookie year and said: \u2018Todd, you can be one of two players. You can be the guy that shows up and complains about being hurt, or you can go out and play.\u2019 That always stuck with me.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Todd Helton: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to be your first baseman\u201d", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Todd Helton: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to be your first baseman\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/16/rockies-todd-helton-its-been-an-honor-to-be-your-first-baseman/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__todd-helton-rockies-retirement-091613p1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__todd-helton-rockies-retirement-091613p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T15:15:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:28:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacf4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to be your first baseman for the last 17 years,\u201d the 40-year-old Helton said at a jam-packed suite at Coors Field.\nHelton praised Rockies fans, breaking into his Tennessee drawl when he said,\u201dY\u2019all have been a model of consistency.\u201dHelton joked, too, wondering how the women displaying the \u201cTodd Helton, No.\n17\u201d sign in center field managed to hold up the banner night after night.\nChristy Helton has looked up at the giant scoreboard at Coors Field countless times and viewed the image of her husband.\nAmong those in attendance was Matt Holliday, the current Cardinals outfielder who helped the Rockies and Helton reach the World Series in 2007."}
