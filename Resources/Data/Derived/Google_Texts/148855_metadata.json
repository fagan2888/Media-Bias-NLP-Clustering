Friedman, The New York Times, discusses how oil is prompting a geopolitical shift in Middle East power structures.\n\nRouhani's call is in line with his preference for a greater public say on strategic matters, traditionally vested with Khamenei.\n\nLast month, Rouhani presented a \"cautious, tight\" budget in response to falling oil prices, which have fallen to just above $50 a barrel. Iran's budget ending March 2015 is based on a price of a $100 a barrel.\n\n\n\nProposed spending for that same budget was 6 percent above the previous year, but this was a cut in real terms due to inflation of 20 percent. The government hopes to meet the deficit through more efficient taxation and non-oil exports.\n\n\n\n\"As the enforcer of our constitution, I would like, even for once, to see conditions ripe to implement a tenet of the common law calling for major issues - economic, social, political and cultural - to be put to public referendum rather than parliamentary vote,\" the president said to applause.\n\n\n\n\"Some 36 years have passed now and this article has not been enforced even once.\"\n\n\n\nRouhani appealed to the economists for solutions on how to improve the state's handling of subsidies, taxes, debt and the financial system.\n\n\n\nHe also suggested he supported a resolution passed by parliament in December to tax organizations overseen by Khamenei and the armed forces, an unusual move by the legislature to regulate areas dominated by the most powerful figures in the country.\n\n\n\n\"We are trying to tax everyone across the board, but as soon as we touch this or that institution, they make such a stink about it,\" Rouhani said, apparently referring to the resolution, which has been opposed by Islamic hardliners.\n\n\n\n\"Of course this government will do what it deems in people's interest,\" he said. He added without elaborating: \"Just be aware that in some cases, the domestic political lobby is very strong, very strong, more than you think.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for curbs on the state's involvement in business and an end to international isolation to bolster the economy.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Iran's president called for an end to state involvement in the economy and an end to the country's isolation.", "title": "We can't be isolated and grow too: Iran's Rouhani", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/04/irans-rouhani-urges-end-to-isolation-calls-for-reform.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/23/102026059-hassan-rouhani.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iran's president called for an end to state involvement in the economy and an end to the country's isolation.", "title": "Iran's Rouhani urges end to isolation, calls for reform", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/04/irans-rouhani-urges-end-to-isolation-calls-for-reform.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/23/102026059-hassan-rouhani.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "World Economy, Politics, Nuclear Energy, Middle East Turmoil, World Economy, Oil and Gas, Energy, Iran, United States, France, United Kingdom, Germany, United Nations, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-01-04T17:04:50-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "World Economy", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T17:05:12-0500", "tag": "United Nations"}, "pageNodeId": 102308011, "news_keywords": "iran nuclear talks, iran economy, nuclear deal, catastrophe, its knees"}, "article_summary": "Last month, Rouhani presented a \"cautious, tight\" budget in response to falling oil prices, which have fallen to just above $50 a barrel.\nHe added without elaborating: \"Just be aware that in some cases, the domestic political lobby is very strong, very strong, more than you think.\"\nThomas L.
