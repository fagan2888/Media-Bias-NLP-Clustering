There\u2019s no question about that. We have a horrendous tax structure.It\u2019s too complex,\u201d Carson told the convention. \u201cNobody can comply with it and it\u2019s unfair. We need something that is equally fair across the spectrum for everybody and that means either a flat tax or a fair tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that whatever we come up with, it needs to eliminate the IRS,\u201d added Dr. Carson.\n\nIn another speech to the Tea Party convention, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) received a standing ovation when he reiterated his call to \u201cabolish the IRS\u201d and move to a simple flat tax.\n\n\u201cThere are 110,000 employees at the IRS. We need to padlock that building and put all 110,000 IRS agents on our southern border,\u201d added the Texas senator, who is also considered a potential contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. \u201cI say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about it for a minute \u2014 suppose you\u2019ve spent weeks crossing the hot, hot land going through the desert sun, swimming the Rio Grande, and the first thing you see is 110,000 IRS agents,\u201d he continued as laughter filled the room. \u201cYou\u2019ll turn around and go home too.\u201d\n\nDr. Carson and Sen. Cruz spoke during the second day of the South Carolina Tea Party event, which is sold out.\n\nThe three-day convention, which will carry into Monday, features major conservative leaders and activists.\n\nBetween 1,100 and 1,200 people are expected to attend the event, now in its fourth year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016: Dr. Ben Carson Says IRS Should Be Eliminated", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "2016: Dr. Ben Carson Says IRS Should Be Eliminated", "title": "2016: Dr. Ben Carson Says IRS Should Be Eliminated - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/ben-carson-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/18/2016-dr-ben-carson-says-irs-should-be-eliminated/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2016: Dr. Ben Carson Says IRS Should Be Eliminated", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/ben-carson-afp.jpg", "title": "2016: Dr. Ben Carson Says IRS Should Be Eliminated - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, 2016 presidential race, Carson, Cruz, irs, Obama,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, IRS,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Obama", "published_time": "2015-01-18T17:21:08-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,IRS"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8d1\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, earned cheers at the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention on Sunday when he said that the IRS should be eliminated.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll turn around and go home too.\u201dDr. Carson and Sen.
