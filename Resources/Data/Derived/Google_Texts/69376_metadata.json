The plan brings together Wellmark\u2019s insurance options with UnityPoint\u2019s physicians and Hy-Vee\u2019s retail services as part of the companies\u2019 coordination of customer care.\n\n\u201cWhen you can keep health care local, people do better and it lowers costs,\u201d said Laura Jackson, Wellmark\u2019s executive vice president for health care innovation and business development.\n\nWellmark customers will be able to choose from Bronze, Silver and Gold level Affordable Care Act-compliant health care plans.\n\nThose who purchase Blue Rewards products will have access to Wellmark\u2019s entire statewide physician and hospital network but will have lower out-of-pocket costs when they select a UnityPoint Health-associated provider or hospital and fill prescriptions at Hy-Vee pharmacies.\n\nJackson said the premiums customers pay on these insurance plans will be lower than some of the other plans and products available.\n\nWellmark, headquartered in Des Moines, is the state\u2019s largest insurer, paying benefits claims to more than 2 million people in Iowa and South Dakota. UnityPoint Health, the country\u2019s 13th largest health system, operates hospitals in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.\n\nWest Des Moines-based Hy-Vee operates 237 retail stores and recorded $8 billion in sales in 2013.\n\nIn a phone call with The Gazette on Friday, leaders from the three organizations said this type of collaboration is the first of its kind in Iowa and possibly the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together for a few years and spoke with consultants who gave us some exposure to what other markets are trying. No one has really done this with companies that have as large of footprints \u2014 it\u2019s unique to the rest of the country,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThe goal of this new option is to encourage healthy behaviors by integrating Wellmark\u2019s insurance plans with UnityPoint\u2019s medical home model and Hy-Vee\u2019s retail services, including its pharmacy, wellness and dietitian services.\n\nThe medical home concept is a more patient-friendly and cost-effective strategy that centers on better care coordination through a team-based approach. UnityPoint\u2019s Corridor\u2019s clinics are undergoing their medical-home designations and the health system plans to have its Corridor clinics certified by 2015.\n\nKevin Vermeer, UnityPoint Health\u2019s executive vice president and chief strategy officer, said the health system has worked with several providers outside of UnityPoint to improve care coordination, but Hy-Vee is the first retailer with which it has teamed.\n\nPhysicians will be able to work with pharmacists and dietitians to coordinate patients\u2019 health care, he said.\n\n\u201cWe believe our approach, a coordinated care model, will be enhanced through this collaboration,\u201d Vermeer added.\n\nSheila Laing, senior vice president of Health and Wellness Solutions for Hy-Vee, agreed, noting that the companies want consumers to have access to affordable and convenient health care.\n\nPending regulatory approval, with which Jackson said she doesn\u2019t anticipate any problems, individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase the Blue Rewards option during the 2015 open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 15, and Oct. 1 respectively.\n\nAdditional product information will be available before the 2015 open enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to evolving this product,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will change over time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Starting in the fall of 2015, a new partnership among three of the state's largest companies will add a new twist to health insurance.Wellmark Blue Cross and Bl", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "Starting in the fall of 2015, a new partnership among three of the state's largest companies will add a new twist to health insurance.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/new-insurance-option-coming-to-iowa-in-2015-20140628", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20140628/ARTICLE/140629706/EP/1/4/EP-140629706.jpg", "article": {"section": "News"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/new-insurance-option-coming-to-iowa-in-2015-20140628", "description": "Starting in the fall of 2015, a new partnership among three of the state's largest companies will add a new twist to health insurance.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "New Insurance option coming to Iowa in 2015"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-06-27T20:14:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_news", "pubDate": "2014-06-28T13:00:00-05:00", "title": "New Insurance option coming to Iowa in 2015"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23c8\"", "article_summary": "Wellmark customers will be able to choose from Bronze, Silver and Gold level Affordable Care Act-compliant health care plans.\nUnityPoint Health, the country\u2019s 13th largest health system, operates hospitals in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.\nWellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Hy-Vee and UnityPoint Health announced Blue Rewards on Saturday.\nPhysicians will be able to work with pharmacists and dietitians to coordinate patients\u2019 health care, he said.\n\u201cWhen you can keep health care local, people do better and it lowers costs,\u201d said Laura Jackson, Wellmark\u2019s executive vice president for health care innovation and business development."}
