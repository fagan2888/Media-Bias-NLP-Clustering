(Photo: iPhone photo by Nicquel Terry)\n\nAchieving the title of Miss New Jersey 2013 didn\u2019t come easy for Cara McCollum.\n\nThere were people who doubted her ability to win and she was up against women who were both beautiful and more experienced than she was in pageants.\n\nStill, McCollum said she maintained her confidence, was true to herself, and ultimately won the crown.\n\nThis was the story she shared with a group of young girls on Wednesday at the Asbury Park Board of Education office. The group, all participants in the Eloquent Charismatic Orators, sat fully attentive in bright pink T-shirts as McCollum offered advice on becoming a successful woman.\n\n\u201cYou truly can do whatever you want to do, you can be whatever you want to be,\u201d said McCollum, a 23-year-old old student at Princeton University. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter unless you believe that.\u201d\n\nAsbury Park community center faces uncertain future\n\nThe Eloquent Charismatic Orators is an organization led by Angela Ahbez-Anderson, a former school board member, to build self confidence, critical thinking and leadership skills in girls ages 10 to 18. Most of the girls are from Asbury Park and Neptune. The group will hold its own pageant for the girls in July.\n\nMcCollum talked to the Eloquent Charismatic Orators about finding their passion in life, making positive first impressions, speaking clearly and overcoming people who may discourage them.\n\nShe also discussed her journey from growing up in a small town in Arkansas to traveling the country and speaking to young girls.\n\n\u201cYou have to find the individual thing that you like best about yourself and you\u2019ve got to hold on to that because people are going to try and take it away,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cGrowing up as a young woman, it\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nAnd it also takes more than beauty to make it, she said.\n\n\u201cYou gotta find something about yourself that\u2019s more than just your looks,\u201d McCollum said.\n\nAngelica Binot, an eighth grader at Neptune Middle School, said she was inspired by McCollum\u2019s speech on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have someone closer to my age tell me something and to mentor me,\u201d Binot said.\n\nSCHOOL SCOOP\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in our families and at school?
