Photo: Glenn Hunt\n\nAs the Brisbane Roar prepared to kick off its 10th A-League season at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday, the club's boss was predicting a massive year for the reigning champions.\n\nAnd he hoped the club would soon have a south-east Queensland rival when Football Federation Australia decides, as expected, to expand from 10 to 12 teams in time for the next television deal at the end of season 2016-17.\n\nSpeaking at the team's training session at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday, Roar general manager Sean Dobson said the signs for the club's upcoming season were good.\n\nRoar boss Sean Dobson expects an average crowd of 18,000 at Suncorp Stadium this year.\n\n\"We finished last year on 8112 members and we were at 11,400 or 11,500 this morning, and that's huge and a record for the club,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're looking at an 18,000 [attendance] average as our internal target. The forecast is a little bit higher but I think 18's about right.\"\n\nThat was helped along by the drawing power of Melbourne City, featuring Spanish World Cup star David Villa, who will be in town on November 8, and the fact that big-drawers Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory would play twice at Suncorp Stadium in 2014-15.\n\nThomas ?Broich trains with his Roar teammates ahead of their opening A-League match at Suncorp Stadium.

Ipswich, there's a difference; in Logan there's probably not that difference.\"\n\nDobson said the disastrous off-field performance of the Clive Palmer-owned Gold Coast United should not prevent another team setting up a base in Australia's largest non-capital city.\n\nBut he said he thought Wollongong, south of Sydney, would be the next A-League cab off the rank.\n\n\"The population of Wollongong are doing all the right things,\" Dobson said.\n\n\"Six or seven thousand for the All-Stars and the Young Socceroos, the FFA Cup game down there, once again, with six or seven thousand people.\n\n\"It's consistent support and it's a rocking little stadium and a great football culture \u2013 they've got history and they've got roots.\"\n\nOn the field, Dobson said he expected big things from Mike Mulvey's side in 2014-15.\n\n\"Third place is average, top two is where we want to be and anything less we'll take a good hard look at ourselves,\" he said.\n\nAnd the chances of another \"Orange Sunday\" \u2013 a fourth home grand final in five years?\n\n\"Mate, we'd take them every year if we could,\" Dobson said.\n\nThe Brisbane Roar starts its A-League season against Adelaide United at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
