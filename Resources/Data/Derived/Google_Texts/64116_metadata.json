Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) is remaining silent about his allegation that House GOP leadership misled him in order to get him to switch sides in a key vote that allowed the party to bring the so-called cromnibus, $1.1 trillion, 1,774-page spending bill to the floor of the House so leadership could pass it.\n\nBut several others\u2013including three U.S. House members\u2013tell Breitbart News that it was Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who made the promise. McCarthy\u2019s office went on record with Breitbart News to vigorously deny that.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe nature of what happened is complicated. But it\u2019s a very serious charge for a Congressman to allege that party leadership misled him. So it\u2019s odd that Stutzman won\u2019t defend that charge publicly in either interviews or further statements.\n\nEspecially since a series of interviews with major players on both sides of the argument\u2013and the actual video on C-SPAN\u2013suggest there is in fact an element of truth to what Stutzman said. But since Stutzman won\u2019t back it up again in public, and McCarthy\u2019s office is now on the record here specifically denying it, it\u2019s really Stutzman\u2019s word against McCarthy\u2019s.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened the day of the cromnibus vote:\n\nHouse members were voting on the rule, a technical vote that simply allows the actual bill to come to the floor for a vote. After the 15 minutes of voting was up, C-SPAN reported a whopping 264 members still hadn\u2019t voted. At that point, the total was 95 yeas and 76 nays. All the yeas were Republicans.\n\nMore than 10 minutes later\u2013the vote was held open for an abnormally long time\u201334 members still hadn\u2019t voted. By then, there were 201 yeas and 200 nays\u201314 of which were Republicans and 186 of which were Democrats.\n\nLeaders scrambled on the floor for another five minutes\u2013now more than half an hour into a 15-minute vote. At that point, the nays had it with 214 members voting against. Eighteen of the nays were Republicans, 196 of them were Democrats. All the 212 yea votes were Republicans.\n\nIf the cromnibus bill had died on the rule, it would have been a brutal defeat of Boehner\u2013an indictment of his failure to lead\u2013as it\u2019s extraordinarily rare that legislation ever dies on a rule vote.\n\nSo Boehner\u2019s leadership team jumped into action, with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California leading the charge. GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) chipped in. Boehner himself worked members, too. The goal was to flip at least two of the 18 Republican nay votes. Eventually Team Boehner convinced two of the Republicans who had voted against the rule to switch their votes to supporting the rule, bringing the dead deal back to life.\n\nRep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-MI) was the first Republican to switch. His situation is unique.\n\nIn an interview with the Detroit News, Bentivolio said Boehner told him: \u201cKerry, you have to change your vote.\u201d\n\nBentivolio lost a GOP primary this past August to Republican Dave Trott after a tumultuous first term in Congress. The departing member is a former reindeer farmer who used to dress up as Santa Claus. After the vote switch, Boehner ally and House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX)\u2013who provided the material support necessary to pass the bill procedurally\u2013told him \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Santa.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Bentivolio replied, according to Roll Call, asking Sessions to make sure his staff members get jobs after he leaves Congress.\n\nWith Bentivolio\u2019s vote switched, the measure was tied 213-213.\n\nSince the Democrats wouldn\u2019t budge, leadership needed one more vote to be switched out of the remaining 17 Republicans holding the line: Stutzman and Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI), Michele Bachmann (R-MN), Dave Brat (R-VA), Mo Brooks (R-AL), Paul Broun (R-GA), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Tim Huelskamp (R-KS), Steve King (R-IA), Walter Jones (R-NC), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Raul Labrador (R-ID), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Steve Stockman (R-TX), Bill Posey (R-FL), and Matt Salmon (R-AZ).\n\nStutzman says he switched his vote on the floor because House GOP leadership\u2013although he doesn\u2019t name anyone\u2013promised him that if the rule passed, the cromnibus would be replaced by a short-term spending measure. This Continuing Resolution (CR) would last until early next year when the newly elected GOP majority in the Senate takes over.\n\n\u201cEarlier today, I supported the Rule because I was informed by Leadership that the CROmnibus was dead and a short term CR would take its place,\u201d Stutzman said in the statement issued the night of the vote, after the final passage of the cromnibus. \u201cI was very surprised and even more disappointed to see the CROmnibus back on the floor. The American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nStutzman may not have been leadership\u2019s first choice. One member of the House who spoke on condition of anonymity told Breitbart News that McMorris Rodgers specifically targeted Labrador and other members\u2013but they wouldn\u2019t shift their votes. \u201cI saw Cathy McMorris Rodgers in animated discussions,\u201d that member said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d\n\nThat member also said McCarthy was speaking with several of the members. \u201cI saw Kevin McCarthy talking with people,\u201d that member said, noting that he didn\u2019t personally witness the conversation between McCarthy and Stutzman.\n\nAnother member, however, did witness a conversation between McCarthy and Stutzman.\n\n\u201cI saw Kevin talking with Marlin, yes,\u201d that House member said when reached by phone.\n\nNone of the members, staff, or key sources who Breitbart News spoke with would speak on the record, and none of them personally heard the conversation between Stutzman and McCarthy.\n\nBut the member who saw the conversation said that after Stutzman\u2019s conversation with McCarthy, Stutzman approached a group of conservative members including this member and announced to the group the promise that McCarthy had supposedly made to him.\n\n\u201cHe told quite a few folks around there about the conversation,\u201d that member said when Breitbart News reached the member by phone, noting that Stutzman specifically told the group of conservatives that McCarthy made that promise about swapping the cromnibus with a short term CR. This member added that while most of the other members didn\u2019t believe McCarthy\u2019s promise, Stutzman did.\n\nThe first member, who said he was aware of the conversation between McCarthy and Stutzman but didn\u2019t personally witness it, said the gravity of voting against a rule can\u2019t be understated\u2013and that it\u2019s essentially a no-confidence vote in Boehner.\n\n\u201cIf you vote no on a rule, House leadership considers that the worst vote you can make,\u201d that member said, \u201cThey want to shut out the voices of the rank and file members. If you\u2019re not a part of the club that negotiated the deal you don\u2019t have a seat at the table. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nThe other member added that this is normal behavior by GOP leadership and that conservatives conference-wide have grown wary of trusting Boehner and his team.\n\n\u201cThis is a pattern of deception,\u201d the member said. \u201cThis is par for the course. They said they\u2019re against Obamacare and against executive amnesty, but then they went and funded it anyway.\u201d\n\nA third member, reached by phone, confirmed the details of what the other two said but declined to be quoted, even anonymously. Several key congressional staffers confirmed the details, too, and another Capitol Hill source who regularly communicates directly with members told Breitbart News that McCarthy supposedly made the same promise to other members.\n\n\u201cI heard that McCarthy said that to Stutzman but also to other members,\u201d that source said. \u201cThe most interesting thing is McCarthy doesn\u2019t have that power. If I was a member, and McCarthy told me that, I would have asked him to grab Boehner for me and have him tell me that.\u201d\n\nA senior aide to McCarthy said that not only did McCarthy not say this to Stutzman\u2013or anyone else\u2013during their conversation on the floor, but no member of leadership or the whip team told him the cromnibus would be replaced. \u201cAt no time during the rule vote was that communicated to any member by either the leadership team or the whip team,\u201d the McCarthy aide said.\n\nStutzman\u2019s spokesman John Stapleton\u2013who when presented with questions for this new story refused interviews or further comments and again declined to confirm or deny any more details for Breitbart News\u2013says the congressman won\u2019t talk further in public about this. Stapleton also said that no one who personally heard the conversation between McCarthy and Stutzman has come forward yet; it\u2019s Stutzman\u2019s word versus McCarthy\u2019s, at least for now.\n\nPreviously, GOP leadership issued through aides carefully worded denials of what Stutzman alleged\u2013saying specifically that Boehner didn\u2019t speak with Stutzman.\n\n\u201cA GOP leadership aide said Stutzman\u2019s account was incorrect and that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) never spoke to him about the bill,\u201d The Hill\u2019s Scott Wong wrote last week, quoting the GOP aide as saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn aide to House speaker John Boehner says he made no such pledge,\u201d the National Review\u2019s Joel Gehrke wrote on Thursday afternoon just before 3 p.m., right after the House recessed for several hours while Boehner, Scalise, and McCarthy worked GOP members to get the votes necessary to pass the cromnibus bill.\n\nGehrke\u2019s piece mirror\u2019s what Stutzman would say in his statement after the cromnibus passed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing from two sources, including one Republican lawmaker, that Representative Marlin Stutzman (R., Ind.) provided one of the final, decisive votes needed to clear a crucial procedural hurdle because House leadership promised to pull the cromnibus and replace it with a short-term continuing resolution that would push the entire funding debate into next year,\u201d Gehrke wrote.\n\nIn those pieces, however, nobody had alleged Boehner was the one who made the promise. McCarthy is the leadership official who did in fact speak with Stutzman on the floor, and seems to have convinced him to switch his vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
