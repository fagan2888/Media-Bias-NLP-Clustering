Bernie Sanders of Vermont are vying with each to show who would be tougher in reining in prescription drug prices and fostering increase industry competition, while some Republicans including frontrunner Donald Trump have criticized drug companies for gouging consumers.\n\n\u201cA 10 percent increase every year is the definition of an unsustainable trend,\u201d John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, said on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s the fastest rising part of the health care market basket and it\u2019s putting unsustainable pressure on health care finance generally. From a political standpoint, it\u2019s pretty presumptuous to raise prices that aggressively in the face of criticism across the board\u2026.\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re daring Congress to act.\u201d\n\nRelated: Drug Company Profits Soar as Taxpayers Foot the Bill\n\nPfizer alone hiked U.S. prices for over 100 drugs on January 1, some by as much as 20 percent, according to statistics compiled by global information services company Wolters Kluwer. Pfizer confirmed a 9.4 percent increase for the pain drug Lyrica, which generated $2.3 billion in U.S. sales in 2014; a 12.9 percent increase for erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, which had 2014 sales of $1.1 billion; and a 5 percent increase for Ibrance, a breast cancer drug launched last year at a list price of $9,850 per month, or $118,200 per year, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nPfizer also announced plans last November for a $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan Plc in order to substantially slash its U.S. tax bill. The merger would be the largest corporate \u201cinversion\u201d ever, saving the company billions of dollars.\n\nAmong other notable prescription drug price hikes, according to published reports:\n\nVanda Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a new drug for treating a sleep disorder in blind people called Hetlioz by 10 percent, to $148,000 a year.\n\nRelated: Wonder Drugs Blow a $1 Billion Hole in VA\u2019s Budget\n\nAmgen increased the anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel by 8 percent in late December, on the heels of an 8 percent increase in September and a 10 percent hike last May. Enbrel costs about $704 a week for a typical dose for treating rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHorizon Pharma increased prices for five of its drugs by 9 percent to 9.9 percent, including ActImmune, a treatment for hereditary diseases, while Eli Lily boosted the price of Trulicity, a drug for Type 2 diabetes, by 8 percent.\n\nPfizer and other major drug companies defend their drug pricing practices \u2013 arguing that substantial funds must be invested in research and promoting new drugs. They also note that manufacturers frequently provide generous discounts or rebates to consumers or government agencies that purchase drugs in large quantities such as Medicaid, Medicare and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nHowever, critics say that prescription drug prices are running rampant, especially the relatively new biologic drugs such as Sovaldi and Harvoni, which can cost as much as $1,000 a pill retail to treat the potentially deadly virus hepatitis C. At the same time, many other lesser biologic drugs gaining in popularity have shot up dramatically in price in recent years.\n\nRelated: Cash-Strapped VA May Start Rationing Some Treatments\n\nThe average retail cost of a year\u2019s worth of just one of those drugs was $53,384 \u2013 or more than the median U.S. household income. In 2014, U.S. prescription drug spending rose by 12.2 percent, surging from a growth rate of just 2.4 percent in 2013, according to Department of Health and Human Services figures.\n\nLast month, the leaders of a Senate committee condemned four companies for aggressively increasing prices for prescription drugs and for exploiting a system lacking in competition. An investigation by the Senate Special Committee on Aging focused on Turing Pharmaceuticals, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Retrophin Inc. and Rodelis Therapeutics.\n\nTuring and its former CEO, Martin Shkreli, first prompted public outrage last fall following reports that the company had increased by more than 5,000 percent the price of Daraprim (non-biologic), a 62-year-old drug used to treat a life-threatening infection, boosting it from $13.50 to $750 per pill.\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nValeant, a Canadian company, has come under investigation by several members of Congress for its drug pricing strategy. Two drugs sold by Valeant to treat cancer-related skin conditions increased in price by about 1,700 percent over the last six years. Turing and Valeant have received subpoenas from U.S. federal prosecutors seeking information about drug pricing and other policies.\n\nIt should be noted that Valeant was one of the few companies that has not raised its prices since September, according to The Wall Street Journal. A spokesperson told the newspaper that changes in the company\u2019s product lineup have made pricing a smaller part of its expected sales growth.\n\n\u201cUnder intense public scrutiny, yes, Valeant didn\u2019t raise its prices,\u201d Rother said. \u201cBut you have the feeling they\u2019re just delaying until things calm down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.", "title": "Ignoring Warnings, Drug Companies Hike Prices By 10 Percent", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/11/Ignoring-Warnings-Drug-Companies-Hike-Prices-10-Percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222010_Pills_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/11/Ignoring-Warnings-Drug-Companies-Hike-Prices-10-Percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222010_Pills_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last month, the leaders of a Senate committee condemned four companies for aggressively increasing prices for prescription drugs and for exploiting a system lacking in competition.\nPfizer and other major drug companies defend their drug pricing practices \u2013 arguing that substantial funds must be invested in research and promoting new drugs.\nAmong other notable prescription drug price hikes, according to published reports:Vanda Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a new drug for treating a sleep disorder in blind people called Hetlioz by 10 percent, to $148,000 a year.\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen.
