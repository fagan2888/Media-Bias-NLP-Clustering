But what\u2019s driving the surge in call volume remains somewhat of a mystery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a national trend, and people are trying to dissect it,\u201d said Dr. Paul D. Biddinger, vice chairman for emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoston EMS said it has seen a 26 percent rise in calls over the past decade, from about 95,500 in 2005 to about 120,000 in 2014. The agency said that the increase has driven a rise in response times.\n\n\u201cThe call volume is way up. It\u2019s a very, very busy system,\u201d said James Orsino, union president of the EMS division of the Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association.\n\nHe said it\u2019s unclear why the calls are going up. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to pin down,\u201d he said.\n\nBoston EMS said it, too, did not have \u201ca verified cause for the rise in demand.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s chief, James Hooley, said the agency has been able to manage the additional workload, but is closely monitoring the call volume rise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf call volume keeps going up, there could come a time where we become more concerned, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re there yet,\u201d said Hooley.\n\nIncreased call volume has been seen in other cities around the country, including Washington, D.C., San Jose, Denver, and Los Angeles, according to experts and news reports. Hooley said he had heard of rising calls numbers in New York and Philadelphia, too.\n\nIn several of those cities, the increased volume has also been blamed, at least in part, for rising response times.\n\nThe Globe spoke to more than two dozen experts \u2014 including national and local medical researchers, doctors, emergency room directors, ambulance company executives, fire and EMS trade association leaders, and public health officials \u2014 all of whom said they were not aware of any definitive research that had pinned down why calls for ambulances had risen.\n\n\u201cFrom everyone I\u2019ve talked to, it\u2019s a bit of a mystery, and that\u2019s definitely concerning to us,\u201d said James L. Robinson, president of the International Association of EMS Chiefs.\n\nThe specialists suggested that a number of factors could be involved, probably in combination with each other.\n\nTwo of the more common reasons given were growth in the overall population, and increases in how long people live.\n\n\u201cPeople are living longer and longer and they [at older ages in particular] require more medical care,\u201d said Ken Willette, manager of the public fire protection division at the National Fire Protection Association.\n\nDr. Howard Mell, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians and medical director of EMS for Iredell County, North Carolina, said he believes a key reason for increased calls for ambulances is shrinking access to basic medical services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re overloading the emergency departments with conditions that could have been prevented,\u201d said Mell.\n\nPeople can suddenly find themselves in need of care because they had not made more routine doctor\u2019s visits, for various reasons. Many primary care physicians are unable to see patients for months, or cannot accept new ones, due to a nationwide shortage of such doctors, he said. Patients cannot always take time away from obligations like work. Out-of-pocket costs have risen as employers and insurers have cut coverage and the general cost of health care has risen.\n\nWhile a primary care doctor may be hard to see, emergency rooms are open all the time, he said.\n\n\u201cAmbulances and emergency departments are the safety net, and we are always here,\u201d said Mell.\n\nSome experts said that with more people now covered due to health insurance reform several years ago in Massachusetts and more recently under the Affordable Care Act, there may be fewer people who are scared off by the cost of an ambulance ride.\n\nOther possible causes of rising ambulance use included shifting cultural attitudes among patients.\n\nPeople may be simply less tentative than they once were about calling 911, experts said.\n\n\u201cBefore they may have driven themselves, but now people are more comfortable calling 911,\u201d said Willette.\n\nAnother expert suggested that people may call ambulances in an effort to skip the emergency department waiting room.\n\n\u201cWhen you come in by ambulance, you usually go to the head of the line,\u201d said Alan Sager, a health policy and management professor at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\nBiddinger said he would not be surprised if patients, more so than in the past, are being extra cautious about their health.\n\n\u201cI think people when they have a medical condition they think could be serious ... they may be more likely to want to have an evaluation to rule out the most serious possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may be more likely to do that than they used to be.\u201d\n\nDr. Scott Goldberg, director of emergency medical services at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, said the kind of care EMS offers fits our increasingly on-demand lifestyle.\n\n\u201cWe have these highly-trained, highly-skilled professionals who are available at the punch of a button 24 hours a day 7 days a week, 365 days a year to come to your house and provide medical care, so it makes sense,\u201d that more people are calling, he said.\n\nThe recent opioid crisis could be a small factor in some places, but it does not come close to explaining the surge in call volume, experts said.\n\nTim Wilson, a spokesman for the fire and EMS department in Washington D.C., said officials there are looking into possible reasons behind a rise in call volume there.\n\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t figured it out yet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn San Jose, officials investigated a rise in response times there and found numerous factors at play, including a rise in call volume. But the review did not delve into what had caused call volume to rise\n\nRon Cunningham, a spokesman for American Medical Response, a national private ambulance company, said the firm has seen a rise in demand in certain areas of the country. Officials there looked at internal data after the Globe inquired about the rises, but they were unable to identify any clear trend, he said.\n\n\u201cWe all know transports have risen in certain areas of the country, but ... identifying the why is not easy,\u201d said Cunningham.\n\nOfficials warn that, in addition to straining emergency medical services, the rising call volume could have financial impacts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning to us,\u201d said Robinson of the International Association of EMS Chiefs. \u201cAnd it should be concerning to the citizens of the United States because it drives up the cost of health care for everyone in our country.\u201d\n\nHe and other experts said that data is already routinely collected that could be used to answer the question, but it\u2019s not being analyzed.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of academic resources looking at it, and there\u2019s no real policy advocate for EMS\u201d to push for such research, Robinson said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1401640854", "eomportal-id": 386194, "description": "Boston and some other cities around the country have seen a significant increase in the number of 911 calls for medical help.
