Re: “Obama’s clumsy take on school testing,” Nov. 8 editorial.

As a high-school student in Jefferson County Public Schools, I have had experience with PARCC and other standardized tests. Because the responsibility of the test results fall on the teacher, the test becomes more about how good your teacher is at test-preparation and teaching the material they predict will be on the test. Students get their scores months later, with no opportunity to learn the material they have missed. The purpose of standardized tests should be a learning moment for the student. Standardized testing provides no benefit to students, as they can’t review their own mistakes, it takes away from classroom instruction time, and it puts more stress on teachers and students.
