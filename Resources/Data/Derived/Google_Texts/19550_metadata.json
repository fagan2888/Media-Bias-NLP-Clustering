These are devastating conditions which undermine normal brain and neurological functioning. Until this time all treatment for these conditions has simply focused on maintaining those afflicted with as little pain and as slow a course in disease progression as possible. New research points to the exciting possibility that lasers might be able to be used to actually cure these brain diseases.\n\nAt this crucial time in American history with the most dramatic changes ever in health care legislation this is significant. Until this time baby boomers have been justifiably concerned that if they or loved ones were hit with these serious brain diseases all they could anticipate from orthodox medicine was painful maintenance therapy as we have been seeing in psychiatry for decades. There have however been aggressive attempts to deal with brain diseases with natural interventions as reported upon by EmaxHealth reporter Deborah Mitchell.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is placing an emphasis on outcomes rather than procedures, and this will push clinicians and researchers alike to search for interventions which offer more than just maintenance therapy in order to justify their incomes. Laser treatments for these brain diseases offers hope towards a realization of the goal of searching for cures for these brain diseases.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is an irreversible and progressive brain disease\n\nThe National Institute on Aging has written that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is an irreversible and progressive brain disease which slowly results in the destruction of memory and the ability to think. Over time the progression of this disease even leads to an undermining of the ability to carry out even simple tasks.\n\nSymptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s generally appear after age 60. It has been estimated that about 5.1 million Americans may suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is the most common cause of dementia seen in older people. Reporting on how difficult treatment has been for this condition EmaxHealth reporter Deborah Mitchell has reviewed concerns that Alzheimer\u2019s Patients may be given drugs that cancel each other.\n\n\n\nParkinson's disease is a serious motor system disorder\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke offers a good discussion about Parkinson's disease (PD). This disease is part of a group of conditions which are called motor system disorders, and result from the loss of brain cells which produce dopamine. There are four primary symptoms of PD which are very troubling:\n\n1: Trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face\n\n2: Rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk\n\n3: Bradykinesia, or slowness of movement\n\n4: Postural instability, or impaired balance and coordination.\n\nAdvertisement: Content below.

PD usually hits people over 50 years old. A progression of this disease leads to an increase in shaking, or tremors, and a disruption with daily activities. Depression may also set in along with problems talking and sleep disorders. Reporting on how treatment for this disorder has also been very difficult, EmaxHealth reporter Armen Hareyan has reviewed how Parkinson Disease medications can induce uncontrollable sleepiness. There has however been some innovative attempts to treat PD, with EmaxHealth reporter Ruzanna Harutyunyan writing on findings that low level light therapy improves Parkinson's symptoms.\n\n\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is usually fatal\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke also offers a good discussion of\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). This is a very rare, degenerative brain disorder which is usually fatal. About 200 cases of CJD are seen in the United States every year, with one person in a million being afflicted worldwide. This disease strikes later in life at about 60 years old and generally runs a rapid course. At first memory loss and behavioral changes are seen, to be followed by serious mental deterioration, weakness, blindness and coma.\n\nLaser treatment may be able to cure these brain diseases\n\nNature Photonics has reviewed research dealing with multiphoton absorption in amyloid protein fibres. What this means is that lasers might lead to cures for these brain diseases. Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, working together with researchers at the Polish Wroclaw University of Technology, have made a discovery which could lead to the curing of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with photo therapy.\n\nThis research is discussed in a Chalmers University of Technology news release. The researchers have discovered that it is possible to make distinctions between aggregations of the proteins, which are believed to cause the diseases, from the the normal functioning proteins in the body, with the use of a multi-photon laser technique.\n\nThese diseases occur when amyloid beta protein become aggregated in large amounts and they than begin to inhibit proper cellular processes. The goal with this proposed laser treatment is to detect and remove the abnormal aggregates. If these abnormal aggregates are removed we should see cures.\n\nI have personally witnessed the devastation associated with these brain diseases. The individual pain and suffering leads to horrible personal and financial problems for the families of those who are afflicted with these diseases. Until now cures for these diseases which destroy the human brain seemed elusive. This is the first time it has been suggested lasers might offer a cure for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This is a very promising breakthrough which should be investigated further.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the baby boom generation ages there are deepening concerns about the rise in the number of cases of brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
