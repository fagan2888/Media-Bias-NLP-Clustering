When I was 5, I\u2019d wake up in the middle of night and run to my parents\u2019 room in horror. I saw life as claustrophobic. I was stuck inside of life. It was a tight box. I didn\u2019t like that there was only one way out \u2013 death \u2013 and that I had no choice in this grand exit.\n\nAs I grew older, I tried to see the positive aspects of my fear. Maybe life cannot be appreciated if its temporary nature is not contemplated. No joy without pain! No yum without yuck! Plus, dying off is the respectable and courteous thing to do, you know? How else would there be enough room?\n\nI quickly found that rationalizing was junk. I could not get myself to think better of dying. Death sucked and was scary and contemplating that airtight ending \u2013 that closing of the curtains \u2013 made me batshit crazy.\n\nSo when I was 27, I decided to explore this fear a little more \u2013 if possible, demystify it in order to try to free myself. I researched and discovered a volunteer position called an end-of-life doula. An end-of-life doula is someone who is trained to comfort and support someone who is dying. In other words, just as a birth doula accompanies a baby into this world, an end-of-life doula accompanies a person out of this world. I wanted to become one. I\u2019d supply someone with much-needed companionship while he\u2019d allow me to witness his decline, his soul letting go, his journey into nothingness. I\u2019d see there was nothing to be frightened of, after all. It\u2019d be mutually beneficial.\n\nI was accepted into the program, attended an eight-week course, and prepared to meet an elderly man who read Herman Wouk books and spoke of Nietzsche. Instead, in autumn of 2009, I got Jethro.\n\n* * *\n\nJethro lived at a long-term care facility for people who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The nursing home is a nondescript red-brick building that gets lost among the flashy boutiques and hip bistros of New York\u2019s Lower East Side. While 20-somethings sat at sidewalk tables sipping cold beers, not even 100 feet away through glass doors there were nurses doling out Dixie cups filled with pills; residents with distended stomachs that pulled taut their T-shirts; people bleary-eyed and restless, donning fireproof bibs in the cramped Plexiglas smoking room.\n\nI spotted Jethro as he propelled himself toward me in a wheelchair. The first thing I noticed was his age \u2013 about 50 \u2013 and that it was not what I thought of as a Dying Age. The second thing I noticed was his nose; it was a nose that said, \u201chi\u201d before the rest of him had a chance. He wore old jeans, a blue faded shirt and a skeptical look. \u201cWhy you smiling?\u201d he said, coming to a stop by my feet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I said. I hadn\u2019t even realized I was smiling. \u201cI guess I\u2019m trying to be friendly.\u201d I squatted down so that we were face to face. \u201cDid it work?\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t what one would call especially welcoming, but I was immediately attracted to his raw curiosity. \u201cWhy you nodding?\u201d he continued, smacking his lips.\n\nI also had not realized I was nodding. I was nervous. My body must have been trying to deliver all sorts of diplomatic messages on my behalf. \u201cI guess I\u2019m trying to be agreeable,\u201d I said. \u201cDid it work?\u201d\n\nThat first day, I stood next to him in the hall for an hour. We watched the nurses run around \u2013 change diapers, give showers and deliver food. Meanwhile, I was getting myself ready for the intense stuff, the end-of-life-talk stuff. I told myself I was prepared for him to flip his shit. I could be calm and hold space for him as he shouted \u201cWhy? Why? Why?\u201d into the sky and threw his can of Ensure against the wall. I\u2019d read Kubler-Ross\u2019 \u201cOn Death and Dying.\u201d I\u2019d read \u201cHow We Die\u201d by Sherwin Nuland. I knew how it was supposed to go.\n\nHe turned to me, finally ready to talk. OK, here goes. I leaned in. I waited. Finally, he opened his mouth: \u201cYou\u2019re a white girl, you can get money whenever you want.\u201d\n\nNot exactly the heart-to-heart I was expecting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d Then he rolled himself back into his room.\n\nDuring the next couple of visits, we stared at the nurses\u2019 station, the TV, and at each other without much to say. I wanted to say to him, \u201cSeriously, tick tock dude. It\u2019s about time we get all Tuesdays-with-Morrie up in here,\u201d but I wasn\u2019t going to be pushy. Per end-of-life doula protocol, I let him lead.\n\nI still didn\u2019t know much about him, but it was clear that he enjoyed giving me a hard time. He often told me I was getting fat and that my hair was messy. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do your hair?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you leave the house, you\u2019re supposed to do your hair.\u201d\n\nMy hair was in a conventional bun. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a bun?\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s messy.\u201d\n\nI refused to change my hair, even though I was concerned about the guilt I might feel if mine was the last hairdo he saw and one that he\u2019d retain, etched into the back of his eyelids, for all of eternity.\n\nThen one day, about three months in, he told me that he was leaving. He said he was going to pack up and get his own apartment. \u201cThe next time you come, I\u2019ll be gone,\u201d he said.\n\nI wondered if that was code: \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d as in, \u201cI\u2019m checking out of my earthly body. Laters, my human brethren!\u201d In my doula class, I had learned from my teacher Amy, a veteran hospice social worker, that people who are about to die often speak about traveling somewhere. She\u2019d recounted umpteen examples: There was the guy who wouldn\u2019t stop talking about packing his suitcases, the woman who worried there wouldn\u2019t be a parking spot, the old man who wanted to make sure he was the only one on the bus, the woman who kept asking about departure times and on and on and on.\n\nSo I braced myself for his death.\n\nIt was happening sooner than I expected, but you just never know with this stuff.\n\nThe next time I came to visit, I was anxious. We still hadn\u2019t made sense of his impending end. I walked slowly down the hall, hoping his name would still be on the placard near his room number. When I reached it, I peeked around the doorframe to see if he was still there. And there he was with the TV roaring. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me leave,\u201d he said, calmly.\n\nI\u2019d read the signs wrong. By leave, he\u2019d actually meant what he\u2019d said: He wanted to get the hell out of that nursing home.\n\nOver and over again in the coming months, I braced myself for his death, but he still didn\u2019t die. Braced myself. He still didn\u2019t die. I found out he had cancer, too. And he still didn\u2019t die.\n\nTo break the monotony, one day I brought a deck of cards. I dealt a hand and we started playing blackjack. It didn\u2019t matter who won, I realized what he really loved was the trash talk. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat your ass, Jethro.\u201d He seriously couldn\u2019t get enough. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cCRAZY! You think you gonna win!?\u201d His favorite was when I called him a jerk. \u201cAsshole\u201d put him into laughing convulsions. I saw that partly we sustain who we are from the feedback we get from those around us, it validates our identities. Apparently, he loved being seen as feisty and mischievous, which is something that\u2019s hard to maintain as a wheelchair-bound patient. I was able to give him back a piece of himself and little did I realize at the time, he was also introducing me to a new side of myself. Each visit onward, I made an effort to slip in a \u201cjerk\u201d at least once.\n\nMeanwhile, several more months passed and we still didn\u2019t speak about The Issue, but he\u2019d slowly opened up and we\u2019d started talking about other things. I learned that he was from the South and came to New York as a small boy. He had a daughter. He didn\u2019t know her age. He didn\u2019t know his own age. His illness had given him early onset dementia. He hadn\u2019t been in touch with any of his family for years. His favorite job was when he was a sanitation worker in the Bronx. He loved to play basketball. He wished he could walk again, go to the movies and have popcorn on his lap again, have an apartment he could call his own again. He went to jail several times. He got into brawls and had scars, making those memories tangible on his arms. He did drugs. He didn\u2019t tell me which kind. Each time I visited, we watched \u201cAll My Children\u201d from his hospital bed or from his wheelchair. He had a crush on Erica Kane, better known as Susan Lucci and for being such a loyal viewer, he was incongruously unperturbed when the show went off the air. We filled the void with Wendy Williams.\n\nWhen I told people that I was an end-of-life doula, that I visited Jethro, they\u2019d say, \u201cWow, you\u2019re such a good person.\u201d And I wondered if I actually was or if it was just pleasurable to be seen that way. After all, part of doing this was an experiment for my own benefit. My intentions weren\u2019t pure and saintly. Yet going there to see him made me feel like a good person and I thought, maybe that\u2019s beneficial too. Maybe it helps if we can see ourselves as good people \u2013 maybe that makes us better people. It feels good to be good. It\u2019s like how sometimes just smiling, despite a bad mood, can make you feel happier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I hoped my job as an end-of-life doula would help me understand death.
