(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)</p>\n\nState Supreme Court justices, having unanimously and publicly opined that the judicial system should be above politics, now face the first political decision of their new eight-year terms. That is choosing someone to serve as Tennessee attorney general for the next eight years. For two of the justices \u2014 Connie Clark and Gary Wade \u2014 this is not a new experience. They voted back in 2006 to give the job to Bob Cooper, and politics was less a consideration then.\n\nTennessee is the only state in the union that grants, in its state constitution, a Supreme Court the right to pick the attorney general. Other states are much more overtly political, in most cases leaving selection of an AG to a popular vote. A few let the governor appoint; Maine has an AG chosen by the state Legislature.\n\nClark and Wade initially were appointed by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, as was new Chief Justice Sharon Lee. The other justices who will vote on a new AG \u2014 first-termers Jeff Bivins and Holly Kirby \u2014 are appointees of Republican Gov. Bill Haslam. During the retention election campaign, Lee declared that she would work with Bivins and Kirby in selecting a new AG \u2014 a public statement widely interpreted as saying she would go along with whoever the Republican appointees wanted.\n\nAfter the three Democrats won new terms with about 56 percent of the vote, Cooper declared he wants another term now that voters in general have \u201csent a clear message \u2026 that they want an independent, nonpartisan judicial branch.\u201d For that, he says, he\u2019s the man.\n\nWell, maybe. And one might suspect that Cooper \u2014 who is politically as well as legally astute \u2014 may well have reason to believe three of the five justices are inclined in his favor. Otherwise, he might step aside gracefully. Given Lee\u2019s statements, that would imply a Republican willing to back him.\n\nBut there are multiple political considerations in the justices\u2019 decision.\n\nMost importantly, the justices must consider already uneasy relations with the Legislature\u2019s Republican supermajority. Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey led the crusade to oust the three Democratic justices. The Legislature sets a budget for court operations and otherwise has a great deal of authority over what the judicial branch can or cannot do.\n\nReappointing Cooper could be considered a gesture of defiance or a stand for independence of the judiciary. It\u2019s worth noting that Haslam and other establishment Republicans \u2014 House Speaker Beth Harwell, for example \u2014 deliberately avoided taking a position in the retention election.\n\nIn that campaign, Cooper was deemed a liberal Democrat and thus deserving of ouster by Ramsey and the Tennessee Forum, the lead in-state group pushing for rejection of the three justices. Their central premise was that Cooper had failed to join 28 other state attorneys general \u2014 almost all of them Republicans elected by popular vote \u2014 in attacking the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCooper contended that there was no point in becoming the 29th attorney general to file a lawsuit against Obamacare and he saved the state thousands of dollars by not joining the effort.\n\nThen there\u2019s the consideration of those seeking to replace Cooper and their political connections. The long list of Republicans considering applying range from Senate Minority Leader Mark Norris and Sen. Doug Overbey to Bill Young, a Ramsey political friend now serving as director of the Administrative Office of the Courts \u2014 a position filled by Supreme Court appointment. Perhaps the most overtly political prospect is Tom Lawless, a former Davidson County Republican chairman who says Cooper\u2019s failure to file an anti-Obamacare lawsuit was \u201cvery wrong\u201d and indicative of a need for a \u201cchange of perspective\u201d in the attorney general position.\n\nThe five men and women who elect an attorney general can choose an identifiable Democrat or an identifiable Republican. Wade says political affiliation makes \u201cabsolutely\u201d no difference, emphasizing in a recent interview that he speaks only for himself \u2014 and that he thinks Cooper has done a good job.\n\nBut, of course, partisan affiliation does make a difference. Virtually all of the names circulated in the upcoming selection are quite qualified to serve. It\u2019s just a matter of how the five-person electorate figures which applicant is in their best political interest.\n\nTom Humphrey, retired Nashville bureau chief, may be reached at tomhumphrey3@aol.com.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Tom Humphrey: Justices must make political decision on AG", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/opinion/columnists/tom-humphrey/tom-humphrey-justices-must-make-political-decision-on-ag-ep-568717979-354382531.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/attorney-general-bob-cooper_1407791419718_7330514_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 456}, "type": "article", "description": "State Supreme Court justices, having unanimously and publicly opined that the judicial system should be above politics, now face the first political decision of their new eight-year terms.
