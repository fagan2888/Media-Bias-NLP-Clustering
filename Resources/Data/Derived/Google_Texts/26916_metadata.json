Park Assist allows cars to self-parallel park, and already exists in many Ford and GM models.\n\nRELATED: THE HIGH-TECH FUTURE OF CARS\n\nRear Cross Traffic Alerts stop a car before it backs into a building or pedestrian. Active Lane Keeping is a new technology that uses cameras to read the yellow lines and keep the car in its lane \u2013 while Lane Departure Warning beeps when a driver drifts. GM already offers most of these \u201cembedded real time\u201d technologies as part of its Super Cruise package in its Cadillac XTS and ATS models.\n\nAccording to Bill Visnic, an auto industry analyst at Edmunds, the Mercedes S class and the Infinity Q50 offer similar packages, but he places GM in the lead among the Big Three carmakers. \u201cThey are fully engaged in the luxury market, and any big innovation usually starts in the luxury market and trickles down from there. Plus they have a dedicated innovation department.\u201d\n\nCONSUMER ENGAGEMENT\n\nConsumers are increasingly getting on board. Last year, 40 percent of car buyers were interested in semi-autonomous features, such as emergency braking and steering, and 32 percent were interested in automatic park assist, according to the 2013 U.S. Automotive Emerging Technologies Study released last month by J.D. Power and Associates.\n\nRELATED: A SELF-DRIVING CAR IN YOUR GARAGE IN 10 YEARS\n\nExperts predict the first fully AV cars to hit the road by 2020, but even those will have a human component. The system will operate somewhat like an airplane\u2019s autopilot, with a human driver able to override the computer or go hands free at will.\n\nAnd the auto manufacturers aren\u2019t the only ones that are road-testing the technology. The Google Car, a converted Prius, is the poster-droid for the industry. Google claims to have road tested it over 500,000 miles in California and Nevada, where the company has pushed for legislation allowing for such trials. And a team from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) has spent seven years on its AV, a converted Cadillac SRX.\n\nMAKING THE ROADS SAFER\n\nCompetition has intensified in the last two years, says Dan Gage, of the Auto Alliance, an industry lobby that represents 11 automakers. As tech egos swell and recede, along with market share \u2013 depending on who is first and best in class \u2013 this race has a revolutionary common goal. If they succeed, lives will be saved.\n\n\u201cWe want to make cars that don\u2019t crash,\u201d says Dan Flores, a GM spokesman. That may sound outlandish, but Flores says the industry moved into what he calls \u201cactive safety technology\u201d twenty years ago with the advent of anti-lock brakes.\n\nThat\u2019s a lofty goal, and one that\u2019s still far off. Though Google may have driven 500,000 miles, the current rate is a fatal car crash every 100 million miles. \u201cThat\u2019s not even even a data point yet,\u201d says Richard Wallace, of the Center for Automotive Research. \u201cIt\u2019s got to work in every environment, from driveway to parking lot, and we\u2019re far from that. Camera-based systems don\u2019t work at all in the snow, and they don\u2019t work that well at night.\u201d\n\nRELATED: THE ROBOT REVOLUTION: YOUR JOB MAY BE NEXT\n\nRaj Rajkumar, who is heading up the CMU team, agrees that his next challenge is to get his car to work in heavy weather and in tunnels where there is no GPS. He admits that even with most of his systems in place, humans will need to be at the wheel for the next ten years. His concern is that humans are, well, human.\n\n\u201cWe get distracted, and 90 percent of accidents happen because of human error,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce people trust the technology, it will be safer if the human is not in the loop.\u201d\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a research fellow at the Stanford Law and Engineering schools, isn\u2019t as certain. \u201cNobody knows how safe these vehicles are, how safe they need to be, and how you go about measuring and demonstrating that.\u201d\n\nHe agrees that human error is responsible for 30,000 traffic fatalities and accidents that injure over a million people each year. \u201cBut even if self-driving cars are ten times better than that, people are still going to be upset.\u201d It could also be a legal nightmare for manufacturers and insurers. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should bet against technology,\u201d says Smith, \u201cbut it will be gradual.\u201d\n\nOBSTACLES EXIST\n\nA major barrier to taking AVs mainstream is the cost, says Wallace, who estimates that an AV will eventually start at $150,000. \u201cThe biggest hurdle is bringing the price point down, so it\u2019s feasible on a mass scale. Then you have to get the regulatory regime to catch up.\u201d\n\nTrouble is, states have different rules when it comes to AVs and there is no federal AV legislation at all. There\u2019s also the issue of infrastructure. In a perfect world, the cars aren\u2019t just self-driving but communicating with the environment, and one another, to keep a safe distance.\n\nTraffic lights and caution signs would issue advance warnings as code. But when the federal government can\u2019t even agree on spending deals to repair degrading bridges and tunnels, it may be unreasonable to expect such an investment.\n\nWallace doesn\u2019t see that as an issue. Although smart traffic signals would have to be installed \u2013 a process already underway in many cities, including Pittsburgh \u2013 he believes most of the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure conversation can happen via the existing cell phone network.\n\n\u201cThe federal government won\u2019t have to build anything,\u201d he says. \u201cVerizon already built it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Self-driving cars \u2013 the stuff of science fiction for decades \u2013 will be here within the decade, but several of their key features are already on sale in today\u2019s new vehicles.", "title": "Self-Driving Cars Aren\u2019t Here Yet \u2013 But Their Parts Are", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/24/Self-Driving-Cars-Aren-t-Here-Yet-Their-Parts-Are", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09232013_Google_Self_Driving_Car.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/24/Self-Driving-Cars-Aren-t-Here-Yet-Their-Parts-Are", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09232013_Google_Self_Driving_Car.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Self-driving cars \u2013 the stuff of science fiction for decades \u2013 will be here within the decade, but several of their key features are already on sale in today\u2019s new vehicles.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Self-driving cars \u2013 the stuff of science fiction for decades \u2013 will be here within the decade, but several of their key features are already on sale in today\u2019s new vehicles.\n\u201cBut even if self-driving cars are ten times better than that, people are still going to be upset.\u201d It could also be a legal nightmare for manufacturers and insurers.\nIn a perfect world, the cars aren\u2019t just self-driving but communicating with the environment, and one another, to keep a safe distance.\nRELATED: A SELF-DRIVING CAR IN YOUR GARAGE IN 10 YEARSExperts predict the first fully AV cars to hit the road by 2020, but even those will have a human component.\n\u201cWe want to make cars that don\u2019t crash,\u201d says Dan Flores, a GM spokesman."}
