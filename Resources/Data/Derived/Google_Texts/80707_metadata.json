The company is raising money to replace the original red, white and blue neon lights on the theater's marquee with LED strips of the same colors. ( Quentin Young / Longmont Times-Call )\n\nEditor's note: This article stated, based on the best information available at publication, that the building was the city's first movie theater when it opened in 1939 as The Fox Theatre. Subsequent reporting has indicated that two movie theaters in Longmont \u2014 the Odeon Theater and Isis Theater, both on Main Street \u2014 predate the Fox.\n\nOne of the greatest moments for downtown Longmont came on Dec. 5, 1939.\n\nOn that day the city got its first movie theater, The Fox Theatre. The facade of the Art Deco building, at 513 Main St., was book-ended by columns of vertical glass blocks and the marquee was topped with a cascade design, a popular feature for theaters at the time. The marquee that night announced a comedy from that season, \"The Housekeeper's Daughter,\" starring Joan Bennett and Adolphe Menjou.\n\nA detail of the building that visitors couldn't miss were the bright neon lights that striped the cascade at of the top of the marquee and trimmed its letterboard.\n\nToday the theater is called the Longmont Performing Arts Center, and it's where Longmont Theatre Company, the facility's owner since 1990, produces its plays. The original fa\u00e7ade is largely intact. But the neon stripes, which once helped highlight the building as the center of the downtown solar system, haven't worked in a long time.\n\n\"It's hasn't been lit up in probably 15 years,\" Steve Carver, LTC's president said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is marking the building's 75th anniversary with a campaign to restore the marquee lights. It has partnered with Longmont Downtown Development Authority and the Longmont Community Foundation to launch a capital campaign to raise $18,000. The money would be used to replace the original neon lights with energy efficient, flexible LED strips. The state-of-the-art strips cost more than neon up front but are expected to pay for themselves in energy savings. The theater plans to use the original colors - \"liquid fire\" red, white and blue.\n\nThe campaign has raised about 30 percent of the full amount so far, and Carver expects to have the total raised and the lights installed sometime next year -- at least by the start of the 2015-2016 season, he said.\n\nPaul Gentile, LTC's treasurer, said the project will affect the whole community by enhancing the look of Main Street.\n\n\"I think it's the crown jewel of downtown,\" he said.\n\nCarver added: \"And that's what it was meant to be.\"\n\nThe campaign, in fact, grew out of a conversation started by leaders at the LDDA, which \"has been a very strong supporter\" of it, Carver said.\n\nHe sees the project as a contribution to a larger program of elevating downtown Longmont as an arts hub, an effort that includes the recent designation of the area as an arts district, the creation of new artist studios, and recent collaborations among local galleries and arts organizations.\n\n\"It's an investment in the building, and it's an investment in downtown,\" Carver said.\n\nGentile added that the project is also tied to the LTC's effort to raise its profile and better use its facility. The company recently bought a digital projector, for example, and might want to host a film series at the theater, he said.\n\nIn 1960 Richard Klein bought the theater and covered the Art Deco fa\u00e7ade with a modern one. His daughter, Connie Lehman, wife of former Times-Call publisher Ed Lehman, managed the Trojan Theatre, as it was then called, until it closed in 1986. The LTC bought it in 1990 and stripped away the aluminum Trojan front.\n\n\"Luckily for us they put it over the original design,\" Carver said.\n\nThe Trojan emblem and a marquee letter board from that era still adorn the theater on its alley side.\n\nDonations for the LED lights may be sent to LTC, P.O. Box 573, Longmont, CO 80502; or made through the theater's website, longmonttheatre.org; or given at a show, such as \"Toonful Christmas,\" the theater's current production, which runs through Dec. 20.\n\nQuentin Young: 303-473-1109, quentin@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/qpyoungnews", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27136119/longmont-theaters-name-new-lights", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1214/20141214__15TCALTCw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Quentin Young \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "One of the greatest moments for downtown Longmont came on Dec. 5, 1939.\n\n\nOn that day the city got its first movie theater, The Fox Theatre.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27136119:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-14T16:07:07-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27136119/longmont-theaters-name-new-lights", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1214/20141214__15TCALTCw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One of the greatest moments for downtown Longmont came on Dec. 5, 1939.\n\n\nOn that day the city got its first movie theater, The Fox Theatre.", "title": "Longmont theater's name in new lights"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "One of the greatest moments for downtown Longmont came on Dec. 5, 1939.\n\n\nOn that day the city got its first movie theater, The Fox Theatre.", "title": "Longmont theater's name in new lights", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27136119/longmont-theaters-name-new-lights", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1214/20141214__15TCALTCw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-14T16:07:07-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Longmont theater's name in new lights", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1214/20141214__15TCALTCw~2.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-12-20T11:41:00-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-14T16:07:07-0700", "byline": "By Quentin YoungTimes-Call", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-12-14T16:08:24-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde66a\"", "article_summary": "Longmont Theatre Company marks building's 75th with campaign to restore facadeSteve Carver, president of the Longmont Theatre Company, shows examples of strips of flexible LED lights at the Longmont Performing Arts Center in downtown Longmont last week.\nIt has partnered with Longmont Downtown Development Authority and the Longmont Community Foundation to launch a capital campaign to raise $18,000.\nToday the theater is called the Longmont Performing Arts Center, and it's where Longmont Theatre Company, the facility's owner since 1990, produces its plays.\nSubsequent reporting has indicated that two movie theaters in Longmont \u2014 the Odeon Theater and Isis Theater, both on Main Street \u2014 predate the Fox.\nOne of the greatest moments for downtown Longmont came on Dec. 5, 1939."}
