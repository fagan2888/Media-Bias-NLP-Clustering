State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., No. 13-CV-01643-PAB-CBS, 2014 WL 6478046 (D. Colo. Nov. 19, 2014).\n\nDistrict of Colorado holds that insured has no duty to hire own adjuster in order to receive payment, and denies insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on bad faith claims even where coverage claim was arguably \u201cdebatable\u201d and insureds may have caused delay.\n\nIn June and July of 2012, the Waldo Canyon Fire caused extensive property damage in Colorado. On June 23, 2012, Plaintiffs J. Bruce and Diane Norman were directed to evacuate their Colorado Springs home. The Normans returned on July 5, 2012 and reported heavy smoke damage and some melting to their insurer, State Farm. Five days later, State Farm inspected the Norman\u2019s home, finding light smoke damage and a smoke smell in the house, along with limited fire damage. State Farm issued the Normans an advance of approximately $87,000 for cleaning costs.\n\nAfter various additional fire-related issues with the home came to light, the Normans retained public adjuster Troy Payne of Loss Analytics (the \u201cpublic adjuster\u201d), who in turn retained industrial hygienist SJR Environmental Consulting (\u201cSJR\u201d). SJR inspected and tested the Normans\u2019 home, issued a report that found ash and char present throughout the house and soot residue present inside the furnace and air ducts, and recommended cleaning throughout the home. Upon receipt of SJR\u2019s invoice, State Farm contacted Mrs. Norman, who said that she would be meeting with the public adjuster in the near future to review the scope of repairs the Normans wished to pursue. State Farm left the Normans\u2019 claim open and asked Mrs. Norman to \u201csubmit any pending concerns for review.\u201d\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Loss Analytics provided State Farm with a proof of loss estimate of $809,949.23. After repeated requests from State Farm regarding information on the scope of repairs, on March 22, 2013, State Farm received from Loss Analytics a disc that included the complete itemized estimate of damages. On March 27, 2013, State Farm informed Mr. Payne that State Farm was retaining its own engineer and industrial hygienist to inspect the Normans\u2019 home. The next month, Engineering Systems Inc. (\u201cESI\u201d), an engineering firm hired by State Farm, and Forensic Analytical Consulting Services (\u201cFACS\u201d), an industrial hygienist firm hired by State Farm, conducted an inspection of the Normans\u2019 home. On April 26, 2013, ESI issued its report. Noting some damage, FACS\u2019 report recommended cleaning/restoration of areas with visible smoke impact and cleaning of surfaces with \u201c \u2018uncommon\u2019 prevalence of combustion products,\u201d which included furnishings/contents/fixtures, flooring/baseboards/door thresholds, windows, the attic, and the exterior.\n\nOn May 9, 2013, State Farm reviewed the ESI and FACS reports. On May 16, 2013, State Farm contacted Mr. Payne requesting information regarding completed repairs at the Normans\u2019 home, and in turn met with the Normans and Mr. Payne to discuss the Normans\u2019 claim. On May 29, 2013, State Farm contacted Mrs. Norman and confirmed that it was completing its estimate of repairs for known items, but would keep the claim open for any unknown items. State Farm also requested copies of receipts referred to in the proof of loss. On May 31, 2013, State Farm informed the Normans that it declined to accept the entire proof of loss, but sent the Normans $85,574.43 (the \u201cMay 2013 payment\u201d) as compensation for \u201ccovered damages as outlined in the enclosed building estimate and contents inventory.\u201d\n\nThe Normans filed a claim alleging, among other counts, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 10\u20133\u20131115 and \u00a7 10\u20133\u20131116. State Farm moved for summary judgment with respect to the both Normans\u2019 common law bad faith claim and their statutory claim.\n\nUnder Colorado common law, a \u201cspecial duty is imposed upon an insurer to deal in good faith with an insured.\u201d To show bad faith in a first-party claim, like this one, the insured must prove (1) that the insurer acted \u201cunreasonably under the circumstances\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe insurer either knowingly or recklessly disregarded the validity of the insured\u2019s claim.\u201d Under common law bad faith principles, Colorado courts traditionally find that it is reasonable for an insurer to challenge claims that are \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d However, \u201cfair debatability is not a threshold inquiry that is outcome determinative as a matter of law, nor is it both the beginning and the end of the analysis in a bad faith case.\u201d\n\nAn insurer\u2019s claims handling decisions \u201cmust be evaluated based on the information before the insurer at the time of that decision,\u201d and is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury. In Colorado, the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (\u201cUCSPA\u201d), Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 10\u20133\u20131104(1)(h) is designed to regulate the conduct of the insurance industry and, while it does not establish a standard of care or actionable tort, it may be used as valid, but not conclusive, evidence of industry standards.\n\nThe Normans claimed that State Farm\u2019s conduct was unreasonable in two relevant respects. First, the Normans claim that State Farm \u201cdenied and/or delayed investigating and paying the full damages that were present at the inception of the claim in July 2012. The second aspect of the Normans\u2019 common law bad faith claim was State Farm\u2019s refusal to pay SJR\u2019s invoice for its inspection and testing of the Normans\u2019 home.\n\nState Farm argued that it reasonably evaluated the Normans\u2019 claim, timely making the first payment and, upon receipt of further information from the Normans, timely made additional inspections and payments. The insurer argued that any delay in making the May 2013 payment was attributable to the actions of the Normans and their public adjuster. The Normans responded that, regardless of whether a public adjuster intervened, State Farm was obligated to conduct a reasonable inspection and prepare a fair and accurate estimate, but failed to do so.\n\nThe court rejected any argument that an insured must retain its own adjuster in order to secure the complete payment of a claim. Because an insured is not required to retain its own adjuster, a reasonable juror could also conclude that it is unreasonable for an insurer to compel an insured to hire an adjuster to recover amounts due under a policy by offering less than what is ultimately recovered. Further, the court found that there was evidence that State Farm\u2019s additional inspections should not or could not have been conducted earlier in the claims handling process. Because the Normans\u2019 home was in substantially the same condition in July 2012 as it was in April 2013, engineering and industrial hygienist inspections conducted earlier in the claims handling process would have revealed the same information upon which State Farm based its May 2013 payment, which in turn could have led to an earlier payment of the additional $85,574.43. Moreover, the court found that there was an issue of material fact vis-\u00e0-vis State Farm\u2019s argument that the Normans failed to timely provide to State Farm documents it requested or a scope of repairs. Further, the court found that a reasonable juror could find that State Farm\u2019s failure to conduct a reasonable investigation caused the Normans to incur the expense of retaining SJR and, as a result, that State Farm's decision not to pay the SJR invoice was made in bad faith.\n\nWith respect to whether State Farm knowingly or recklessly disregarded the validity of the Normans\u2019 claim, the court found that, among other evidence, as early as December 17, 2012, State Farm knew that SJR also recommended extensive rehabilitation and cleaning of the home. As such, the court found that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that State Farm was aware of or recklessly disregarded the possibility that the Normans\u2019 claim was not entirely satisfied by the July/August 2012 payment.\n\nMoving to the Normans\u2019 statutory claim, the court noted that the burden of proof is \u201cless onerous\u201d on plaintiffs compared to the common law claim. Because the statutory claim appeared to be based on the same aspects of State Farm\u2019s conduct that were held to constitute a plausible claim for common law bad faith, the court rejected State Farm\u2019s motion as to the statutory claim as well.\n\nFinally, the court rejected State Farm\u2019s argument that an expert would be required to determine the reasonableness of an insurer\u2019s conduct. The failure to reasonably investigate the full extent of the damage to the Normans\u2019 home was held to be within the common understanding of an ordinary juror. Further, the Colorado UCSPA would serve to provide relevant guidance concerning the industry standards applicable to the dispute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/district-of-colorado-insureds-have-no-o-36595/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jdsupra.com/showThumbnail.aspx?img=13376_50.jpg&size=og", "site_name": "JD Supra", "title": "District of Colorado: Insureds Have No Obligation To Hire Public Adjusters To Recover Amounts Due Under A Policy  | JD Supra"}, "twitter": {"description": "Norman v.
