Debevoise & Plimpton LLP is representing American Securities and P2. The buyers are receiving financing from Barclays plc (LON: BARC) and Keybanc Capital Markets (NYSE: KEY).

A rapidly rising global population has been driving demand for agriculture suppliers because farmers need better equipment to help manage their fields. For more on agriculture M&A trends, see Agriculture Acquirers Feed on Crop Protection.
