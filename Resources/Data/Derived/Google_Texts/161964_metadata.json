So if Dorsey does not like the \"anchor baby\" principle, he should direct his anger at the people who ratified the 14th Amendment.The Supreme Court has nothing to do with it.\n\nSince Dorsey is a factory worker, I would bet that his real problem with freer immigration policy is the increased competition there would be for jobs such as his. But an economic protectionism mindset like that only enhances the protected person's sense of entitlement. So if Dorsey's real objection to freer immigration policy is his objection to job competition, he should be forthright about it instead of attacking the actions of people who are only trying to improve their place in life.\n\n\u2014 Peter Wilson Stiefel, Iowa City\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/04/05/dorseys-anger-misguided/7331477/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Guest columnist Russell Dorsey blames the U.S. Supreme Court for the \u201canchor baby\u201d problem, but the 14th Amendment to the Constitution states that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\u201d.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Guest columnist Russell Dorsey blames the U.S. Supreme Court for the \u201canchor baby\u201d problem, but the 14th Amendment to the Constitution states that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\u201d.", "title": "Letter to the editor: Dorsey's anger is misdirected", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/04/05/dorseys-anger-misguided/7331477/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Guest columnist Russell Dorsey blames the U.S. Supreme Court for the \u201canchor baby\u201d problem, but the 14th Amendment to the Constitution states that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\u201d.", "title": "Letter to the editor: Dorsey's anger is misdirected", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de66cc51292bade4af62454b1311fa199db347a7/c=173-0-1126-953&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/United States", "gci-categories": "Geography/United States", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Letter to the editor: Dorsey's anger is misdirected", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7adc4e486abb2c9fe2e904d81f089f366b09aaf/c=68-0-782-953/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6bab382170dab3fb99d5abf6178f6a22626c879/c=173-0-1126-953/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0a60b66c15a51b6006c56d3b4f22cd2039d13ec/c=47-0-1314-953/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09af6e6cb7b6f0f8d5d6e77edb4e38e7d6b54268/c=0-32-1470-861&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-04T23:18:53.270000-05:00", "shorthed": "Letter to the editor: Dorsey's anger is misdirected", "articleid": 7331477, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2558aeb1cdceb32ce468046dc326f5a5ed25f02a/c=0-32-1470-861/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bc9215fc7c0786d9809db45f3f4184a883a64f0a/c=126-0-659-953/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/04/04/dmrdc5-6eoko94p9i0e0ccv11woriginal.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "So if Dorsey's real objection to freer immigration policy is his objection to job competition, he should be forthright about it instead of attacking the actions of people who are only trying to improve their place in life.\nSince Dorsey is a factory worker, I would bet that his real problem with freer immigration policy is the increased competition there would be for jobs such as his.\nSo if Dorsey does not like the \"anchor baby\" principle, he should direct his anger at the people who ratified the 14th Amendment.The Supreme Court has nothing to do with it.\nBut an economic protectionism mindset like that only enhances the protected person's sense of entitlement.\n\u2014 Peter Wilson Stiefel, Iowa CityRead or Share this story: http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/04/05/dorseys-anger-misguided/7331477/"}
