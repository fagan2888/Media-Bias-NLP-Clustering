In addition to allowing citizens to grow, buy and sell weed, the government will also set forth on its mission to grow its own fields of marijuana, which will then be harvested, taxed and sold in neighborhood pharmacies.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the theory.\n\nBut growing weed takes a while. Cultivating fields of it, figuring out how to keep the fields safe from poachers, harvesting vast amounts of cannabis, packaging it, taxing it, distributing it and selling it take even longer.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nLong story short: Uruguay\u2019s government is not going to be producing much of its own cannabis any time soon. So, where is the official stash going to come from in the meantime?\n\nMaybe Canada.\n\nAccording to senior-ranking officials in the ruling Broad Front Party, including Sen. Lucia Topolansky, who\u2019s also Uruguay\u2019s first lady, Canadian medical marijuana producers could provide this tiny Latin American nation with a stopgap until it figures out how to grow and harvest its own crop.\n\n\u201cTo start with, we will have to buy cannabis,\u201d Topolansky said in an interview last week. \u201cI think that we\u2019re going to buy it from Canada, because that\u2019s where the best quality is.\u201d\n\nTo be clear: This is still just an idea. Neither country has announced a deal to ship pot from Vancouver to Montevideo. A spokeswoman for Health Canada wrote by email, \u201cThere are currently no plans to encourage the export of cannabis to Uruguay or any other country.\u201d\n\nBut could it happen?\n\nWell, it\u2019s complicated. Let\u2019s take a look at four key questions.\n\n\n\n1. Does Canada have weed to sell?\n\nIn short: Yes, but not a whole lot \u2014 yet.\n\nUnder Canada\u2019s latest medical marijuana laws, there are about 10 companies currently licensed to grow pot. Marc Wayne, president of Toronto-based Bedrocan Canada Inc., one of the biggest suppliers, said the companies are struggling to meet demand inside Canada.\n\nThe Canadian law governing medical marijuana has a provision that allows the government to issue export licenses to growers. However, the authorities will not start issuing export licenses until they\u2019re satisfied Canadians have access to all the pot they need.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any export to Uruguay, or anyone else, any time soon,\u201d Wayne said.\n\n\n\n2. Is marijuana import and export economically feasible?\n\nIn short: Probably not, at least not from Canada to Uruguay.\n\nThe Uruguayan government has announced a lofty goal to sell cannabis at $1 a gram. That\u2019s the price point at which it will be competitive against the black market, national drug czar Julio Calzada has said.\n\nOn the streets of Montevideo, poor quality pot, most of it from Paraguay or Brazil, currently sells at about $100 for 25 grams, or about $4 a gram, according to research by Insight Crime.\n\nIn Canada, weed is much more expensive than that. Currently, a gram of medical pot sells for a minimum of about 7.60 Canadian dollars a gram (about $6.80), said Steve Thomas, general manager of the Whistler Medical Marijuana Co. His company\u2019s cannabis, which is grown organically, sells for about CA$10 a gram (about $8.95).\n\nOnce the cost of shipping and jumping through regulatory hurdles is taken into account, it probably wouldn\u2019t make sense to export to a country like Uruguay, where disposable income is low compared with more developed countries, Thomas said.\n\nHe said his company is certainly eyeing the export market, but he\u2019s looking at countries with higher incomes, such as the Czech Republic or Israel, as possible targets for growth.\n\n3. Is shipping marijuana actually legal?\n\nIn short: Kinda.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy answer to this. Two shipping lawyers GlobalPost contacted both explained that shipping marijuana is illegal under different United Nations conventions on transporting narcotics. But one company, Dutch-owned Bedrocan, is already shipping cannabis as a pharmaceutical.\n\nThe Canadian government has given permission to Bedrocan BV in the Netherlands to ship cannabis, via a government agency, to its Canadian counterpart, Bedrocan Canada Inc. The shipments have also been approved by the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in Vienna, said Tjalling Erkelens, the owner of Bedrocan BV. The UN body approves a certain amount of narcotics for each of its member countries to import and produce based on INCB estimates of need. (The INCB didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment sent Wednesday.)\n\nAny company in Canada hoping to export cannabis to Uruguay would need permission from both countries\u2019 governments, as well as approval from the INCB for Uruguay to import cannabis, Erkelens said, adding that the INCB has already said it\u2019s not happy with Uruguay\u2019s marijuana \u201cexperiment.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. How would the pot get to Uruguay, and would the US intervene?\n\nIn short: Probably via a small boat, and probably not.\n\nFirst, logistics: If Canada\u2019s growers were to export weed to Uruguay, they\u2019d likely use converted fishing boats or smaller vessels rather than big container ships, according to Craig H. Allen, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law who specializes in shipping law.\n\nThat\u2019s important because a smaller boat would have to stop at least once on the way south to refuel, Allen said. And that means Uruguay and Canada would need the cooperation of a third country, probably a Caribbean island nation, he added.\n\nLanding a vessel full of cannabis at a US port would almost certainly result in seizure of the vessel, said Tina Loverdou, a lecturer in shipping and insurance law at Queen Mary, University of London. That could pose a problem for a boat that hit bad weather or other trouble on the voyage south.\n\n\u201cIf the ship was in major danger and needed refuge, the third country might say \u2018you can\u2019t enter my territorial waters,\u2019\u201d Loverdou said.\n\nIf the shipment was legally sanctioned by both Canada and Uruguay, the legal experts say it would be unlikely for the United States or other countries to intervene if the ship stayed in international waters.\n\nAs for quality: Keeping weed fresh over long distances isn\u2019t a problem, said Mark Kleiman, public policy and marijuana expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. Even newly harvested cannabis would stay fresh over a weeklong journey south, he said.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThere\u2019s a legal framework out there to ship cannabis from Canada to Uruguay.\n\nTheoretically, licensed Canadian pot producers could get to the point where they have enough excess weed to sell it south. But the economics would probably get in the way, with companies having to jump through legal hoops, only to export a product to a country at far higher prices than the weed already available there.\n\nKleiman, the UCLA professor, said it\u2019s much more likely that Uruguay ramps up its own production long before the international pot trade grows into a viable model.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Agriculture just needs to put up a greenhouse today,\u201d he said. \u201cMarijuana is a cheap and easy crop to produce.\u201d\n\nThis article was published by GlobalPost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While it waits for weed to grow, the South American country could turn to Canadian pot producers to kickstart its newly legalized marijuana industry, top lawmakers \u2014 including the first lady \u2014 tell GlobalPost.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Will Carless", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "While it waits for weed to grow, the South American country could turn to Canadian pot producers to kickstart its newly legalized marijuana industry, top lawmakers \u2014 including the first lady \u2014 tell GlobalPost.", "title": "Uruguay May Import Marijuana From Canada", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/exclusive-uruguay-may-import-marijuana-canada/187233/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120413_Uruguay_4x3-690x516.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-07T11:47:14-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While it waits for weed to grow, the South American country could turn to Canadian pot producers to kickstart its newly legalized marijuana industry, top lawmakers \u2014 including the first lady \u2014 tell GlobalPost.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120413_Uruguay_4x3.jpg", "title": "Uruguay May Import Marijuana From Canada", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Uruguay", "published_time": "2014-03-22T05:00:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-07T11:47:14-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd379f\"", "article_summary": "Uruguay May Import Marijuana From CanadaWhile it waits for weed to grow, the South American country could turn to Canadian pot producers to kickstart its newly legalized marijuana industry.\nTwo shipping lawyers GlobalPost contacted both explained that shipping marijuana is illegal under different United Nations conventions on transporting narcotics.\nAny company in Canada hoping to export cannabis to Uruguay would need permission from both countries\u2019 governments, as well as approval from the INCB for Uruguay to import cannabis, Erkelens said, adding that the INCB has already said it\u2019s not happy with Uruguay\u2019s marijuana \u201cexperiment.\u201d4.\nIn conclusion:There\u2019s a legal framework out there to ship cannabis from Canada to Uruguay.\nAnd that means Uruguay and Canada would need the cooperation of a third country, probably a Caribbean island nation, he added."}
