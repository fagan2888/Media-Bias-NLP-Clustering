Instead, he took up freelance editing and proofreading.\n\n\u201cI received my doctorate nine years ago. Folks with a lot of experience part-timing are seen as washed up or stale. I realized I was never going to move up.\u201d\n\nFruscione, along with nine other educators from across the nation, wrote an open letter to the Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hours division urging the new director to \u201copen an investigation into the labor practices of our colleges and universities in the employment of contingent faculty, including adjunct instructors and full-time contact faculty outside the tenure-track.\u201d\n\nAbout two thirds of college professors today are hired on a part-time basis, work on semester-long contracts and are prevented from earning tenure, the letter points out.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the adjunct professors\u2019 online petition has garnered more than 1,400 signatories, vastly exceeding the group\u2019s initial goal of 500 signatures by Sept. 30.\n\nPart-time professors have faced a lack of job security or wage fairness for years, Fruscione says, but now is the time to act because the Wage and Hours division\u2019s newly minted director, David Weil, was himself an economics professor at Boston University.\n\n\u201cOur basic mission at Wage and Hour is pretty simple: making sure people get a fair day\u2019s wage for a hard day\u2019s work,\u201d Weil told The Boston Globe in June shortly after his highly contentious confirmation hearings. \u201cThe difficulty is the workplace has changed dramatically in the last 20 years, and figuring out how we really make sure that happens has become a more and more complicated thing to accomplish.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Part-time faculty copes with economic hardships, lack of university support\n\nThe Wage and Labor office did not immediately return a request for comment about whether or not the office was aware of the petition and if it planned to respond.\n\nAdvocates hope more people will pay attention to what they see as unfair practices once they realize how low wages and part-time contracts can adversely affect students. So far, Fruscione says he\u2019s been \u201cvery pleased with the diverse field of signees,\u201d which includes full-time professors as well as part-time ones, but not yet any signatories who identify themselves as university administrators.\n\nLess time to focus on students\n\nFruscione says his meager part-time salary forced him to work at more than one school at once. His timely daily commute prevented him from spending as much time as he would like on his students.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less time to have person-to-person office hours,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more students and it\u2019s less time to give meaningful feedback on student writing. It also prevents any kind of mentoring down the road.\u201d\n\nSamey Lee, a global cultural studies major and labor activist at Point Park University in Pittsburgh, says the unfair treatment of adjunct professors \u2014 who often have no say in the trajectory of academic curricula \u2014 has hurt her education.\n\nShe says adjunct professors sometimes only have time to meet with students immediately before or after class because they are often not on campus. \u201cWe would meet in Starbucks or the park across the street [from the classroom] because he didn\u2019t have an office,\u201d she says about one of her adjunct professors. \u201cIt mad it hard for me to build a relationship with my professor.\u201d\n\nLee and other students at Point Park have passed out buttons reading \u201cI support adjuncts\u201d across campus.\n\n\u201cA petition alone is not going to make these changes, but I think that\u2019s a really good first step,\u201d she says.\n\nAlex Harris, a senior double majoring in journalism and sustainability studies at the University of Florida, says she\u2019s a \u201cbig fan\u201d of adjunct professors and is concerned that they are being exploited for financial purposes.\n\n\u201cUniversities seem to be skimping a little bit by choosing to rely heavily on adjuncts not because they are professionally better for the students but because it\u2019s cheaper,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s dishonest for schools to do.\u201d\n\nBut Harris points out that the responsibility also falls on adjuncts to properly plan their careers.\n\n\u201cThe people who have figured out how to work the system use adjunct teaching as a supplement to what they do,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you can be a full-time professional and as a supplement, teach a class. That seems to be the better way to do it.\u201d\n\nMelissa Miller, a senior international affairs major at George Washington University, says part-time professors asking for higher salaries are often justified.\n\nIf they\u2019re starting out as adjunct but eventually want to be full-time, then it makes more sense for them to want higher pay so they don\u2019t need the second or third job outside of teaching,\u201d she says.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t fire all of us\u2019\n\nAnn Kottner, another part-time professor, says her frustrations with unfair work practices have led her to speak out, even if it puts her job in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cI kind of have a \u2018bring it on attitude\u2019 at this point,\u201d Kottner, 54, says. \u201cI\u2019m at an age now where I don\u2019t care. I feel like this is an issue that somebody has to stand up for and many of us have suffered the consequences of speaking out. The more of us who speak out, the harder it is to fire us. You can\u2019t fire all of us.\u201d\n\nKottner has held part-time employment at York College/City University of New York and New Jersey City University. She says she\u2019s always had to teach courses at least two schools simultaneously. She recently obtained health insurance through President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act because her status as a part-time teacher means she doesn\u2019t qualify for health insurance like full-time professors do.\n\nRELATED: Professors read mean reviews of themselves, results are predictably hilarious\n\n\u201cThe bad thing about teaching right now is that if you are a non-tenured professor you almost have to have some other kind of other support to be able to do it,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? Kottner says she hopes that the Department of Labor will make recommendations to colleges and universities on how to treat adjuncts \u201cmore fairly\u201d in pay and benefits.\n\nBut she also hopes we\u2019ll see an influx of professors hired on the tenure track where they\u2019ll eventually have job security and won\u2019t have to worry about being not hired back at the end of each semester.\n\nDecades ago, adjuncts were a minority of professors who taught because they had experience in a specific industry that could be valuable to students, according to Kottner. But she says that today, adjuncts serve as a fallback for universities financially unable to pay full-time professors\u2019 heftier salaries and cover their benefits.\n\n\u201cThis was not what any of us signed up for,\u201d Kottner says. \u201cWe planned academic careers. We thought that we would have a good middle class life. We love what we do and that should not be taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nJustin Peligri is a rising senior at George Washington University", "article_metadata": {"description": "About two thirds of college professors today are hired on a part-time basis, work on semester-long contracts and are prevented from earning tenure.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY College", "description": "About two thirds of college professors today are hired on a part-time basis, work on semester-long contracts and are prevented from earning tenure.", "title": "Underpaid and overworked: Adjunct professors share their stories", "url": "http://college.usatoday.com/2014/07/17/underpaid-and-overworked-adjunct-professors-share-their-stories/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "https://usatcollege.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/178493509.jpg?w=1200", "height": 667}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://usatcollege.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/178493509.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@usatodaycollege", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@USATODAYcollege"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Preparing students for tomorrow with USA TODAY", "fb": {"app_id": 579265242172778}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://college.usatoday.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/cb5ff476e47c64282057d860609ea4bb?s=16", "application-name": "USA TODAY College", "keywords": "voices from campus, adjunct, class, justin peligri, professors, teaching", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/usatodaycollege", "published_time": "2014-07-17T15:32:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-17T18:21:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdc4\"", "article_summary": "As of Thursday morning, the adjunct professors\u2019 online petition has garnered more than 1,400 signatories, vastly exceeding the group\u2019s initial goal of 500 signatures by Sept. 30.\n\u201cWe would meet in Starbucks or the park across the street [from the classroom] because he didn\u2019t have an office,\u201d she says about one of her adjunct professors.\nShe says adjunct professors sometimes only have time to meet with students immediately before or after class because they are often not on campus.\nBut she says that today, adjuncts serve as a fallback for universities financially unable to pay full-time professors\u2019 heftier salaries and cover their benefits.\nFormer adjunct professor Joseph Fruscione quit his part-time job teaching in the English department at George Washington University this spring."}
