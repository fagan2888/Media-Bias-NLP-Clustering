Without passage of the act, the definition of the small group market would have increased to include employers with 51 to 100 workers.\n\nBusinesses of fewer than 50 employees have their own special rules requiring specific types of coverage with a higher cost to employers. Expanding the definition of a small business could have increased premiums for employees at larger companies as much as 18 percent, according to an estimate from consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\n\nIllinois will maintain the definition of the small group market to employers with 1 to 50 employees, according to a memo the insurance department released Friday.\n\nThe state endorsed the change to Obamacare \"because it retains state flexibility to set appropriate limits for the small group health insurance market and ensures stable small group markets that reflect the unique characteristics and dynamics of Illinois,\" the memo said.\n\nBut due to the late timing of the change, premium rates that are effective Jan. 1 have already been determined, the memo said. Insurance companies may submit revisions to their small group rates for the quarter beginning April 1.\n\nRich Fahn, an insurance broker in Northbrook, said businesses with 51 to 100 employees will be relieved because small group rates were higher and health plans were more restrictive.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state's largest health insurer, said it supports a narrow definition of small business to preserve choice and benefit options for employers with 51 to 100 full-time workers.\n\nasachdev@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ameetsachdev", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare small-business fix could keep some premiums from rising", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The Illinois Department of Insurance is encouraging health insurance companies to update their small-business premiums as quickly as possible after an important change to Obamacare last week.", "title": "Obamacare small-business fix could keep some premiums from rising", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-small-business-insurance-1013-biz-20151012-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561be4e4/turbine/ct-small-business-insurance-1013-biz-20151012", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, small business, health insurance", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84685172", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-10-12", "Description": "The Illinois Department of Insurance is encouraging health insurance companies to update their small-business premiums after federal bill.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, small business, health insurance"}, "article_summary": "The Illinois Department of Insurance is encouraging health insurance companies to update their small-business premiums as quickly as possible after an important change to Obamacare last week.\nInsurance companies may submit revisions to their small group rates for the quarter beginning April 1.\nWithout passage of the act, the definition of the small group market would have increased to include employers with 51 to 100 workers.\nThe state endorsed the change to Obamacare \"because it retains state flexibility to set appropriate limits for the small group health insurance market and ensures stable small group markets that reflect the unique characteristics and dynamics of Illinois,\" the memo said.\nPresident Barack Obama signed a bill Wednesday night that makes a fix in the definition of a small business that could prevent premiums for 3 million people from going up next year."}
