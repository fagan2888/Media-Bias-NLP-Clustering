In reality, if you truly want to eat healthy, you need to stop thinking in terms of bad synthetic food versus good, natural food and start thinking more in terms of a balanced diet.\n\nChemicals are the building blocks of life, and even something as \u201cnatural\u201d as a banana is comprised of scores of chemicals. As demonstrated in a recent video from ASAP Science, chemicals are not only inescapable, but they are also not always bad. For example, the cyanide in apple seeds is the same as the cyanide in some pesticides, with one key difference: quantity. As the adage goes: The poison is in the dose, and this counts for everything that we put inside of our bodies.\n\nThe idea that synthetic chemicals are worse than those that occur naturally is a second common food misconception. And, although there are many examples when this is true, that isn\u2019t always the case. Think of how many wild fruits, such as hemlock and wolfsbane, could kill you if eaten. It\u2019s better to look at each chemical individually than to simply label all man-made chemicals as bad and all natural chemicals as good.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be easy to conclude that a fruit is closer to its natural origins than, say, French fries, to label either as \u201cwholly natural\u201d would be incorrect. Thousands of years of human farming have drastically changed so many of our fruits and vegetables from their \u201cnatural\u201d state. For example, natural carrots are bright purple, natural watermelon contains only 1.9 percent sugar, and natural corn is about 1,000 times smaller than what you would have on the grill during a summer BBQ.\n\nThe best way to ensure that you\u2019re actually eating healthy is to not pay as much mind to food labels and start doing your own research.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "clean, living, not, chemical, free, natural, foods, contain, chemicals, and, ingredients, are", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If you're trying to only eat food without chemicals, you might as well starve because there aren't any.", "title": "Why Chemical-Free Food Is A Complete Lie", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/clean-living-not-chemical-free-natural-foods-contain-chemicals-and-ingredients-are-343446", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/16/clean-living-not-chemical-free-natural-foods-contain-chemicals-and-ingredients-are.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you're trying to only eat food without chemicals, you might as well starve because there aren't any.", "title": "Why Chemical-Free Food Is A Complete Lie", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/clean-living-not-chemical-free-natural-foods-contain-chemicals-and-ingredients-are-343446", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/16/clean-living-not-chemical-free-natural-foods-contain-chemicals-and-ingredients-are.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/16/clean-living-not-chemical-free-natural-foods-contain-chemicals-and-ingredients-are.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-07-16T16:35:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T16:35:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "If you're trying to only eat food without chemicals, you might as well starve because there aren't any."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s better to look at each chemical individually than to simply label all man-made chemicals as bad and all natural chemicals as good.\nThe idea that synthetic chemicals are worse than those that occur naturally is a second common food misconception.\nChemicals are the building blocks of life, and even something as \u201cnatural\u201d as a banana is comprised of scores of chemicals.\nIn reality, if you truly want to eat healthy, you need to stop thinking in terms of bad synthetic food versus good, natural food and start thinking more in terms of a balanced diet.\nAs demonstrated in a recent video from ASAP Science, chemicals are not only inescapable, but they are also not always bad."}
