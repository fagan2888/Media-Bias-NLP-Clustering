Q: Why soak dried beans before you cook them?

A: First off, the freshness of your beans makes more of a difference in cooking time than how long you soak them will, or if you soak them at all — although soaking them does help them cook more evenly.

Really old dried beans will take a much longer time to soften, and even then, the texture will be off.

Adelle Davis’ 1947 book, “Let’s Cook It Right,” encourages us to cook beans in the same water that they’ve been soaked in, so as to not throw away the nutrients that leach into the water. All these years later, there are lots of conflicting studies about how many nutrients are actually lost during the soaking process, including from a camp of folks who think beans are more nutritious after soaking because they lose their phytic acid, which can reduce the body’s ability to absorb nutrients.

Some dried beans, including red kidney beans, release potentially toxic substances into the water when soaking, so it’s definitely a good idea to drain them. And all beans lose some gas-producing sugars when soaked.

The studies I looked at found that the amount of nutrients lost during soaking is negligible, and the loss of gas-producing sugars is worth throwing out the water.

The truth is that eating beans more regularly will allow your digestive system to get used to all that extra fiber — especially the billions of bacteria that call your intestines home.
