â€” A Wendell woman was arrested Friday on three counts of misdemeanor child abuse.

Lakeisha Sheri Wells, 35, of 7152 Outrigger Drive, is accused of pulling out a 15-year-old child's hair and scratching the child on the left arm and left chest.

According to a search warrant, a 14-year-old child had red marks on the right arm and black bruising on the left side of the face.

Wells was being held at the Wake County Detention Center Sunday under a $2,000 bond.
