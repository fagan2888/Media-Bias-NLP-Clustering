As far as we know, such a thing isn\u2019t in the works, but we got one step closer today, as the power couple released the first of a three-part trailer for their upcoming HBO \u201cOn the Run\u201d concert special.\n\nDubbed \u201cBang Bang,\u201d the sultry black and white clip opens with the two primping before heading out into the desert. It\u2019s a \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d homage, set to Ennio Murricone\u2019s \u201cIl Vizio di Uccidere,\u201d where guns are drawn (to shoot out mailboxes) and quick meals at roadside diners are the main attraction. But if there was any doubt that these two mean business, it comes towards the end, as they leave the restaurant. Jay takes the moment to stub out his cigar into a patron\u2019s hamburger \u2013 one of his bigger disses in recent memory.\n\nHBO\u2019s \u201cOn the Run\u201d special premiers this Saturday, September 20.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The hip-hop power couple released the first of a three-part short film ahead of their HBO concert special.", "title": "Watch Beyonce and Jay Z Go On the Run in \u2018Bang Bang\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/09/15/beyonce-jay-z-bang-bang-part-1/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EN640_0915be_G_20140915100056.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Watch Beyonce and Jay Z Go On the Run in \u2018Bang Bang\u2019", "description": "The hip-hop power couple released the first of a three-part short film ahead of their HBO concert special.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Mike Ayers", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "The hip-hop power couple released the first of a three-part short film ahead of their HBO concert special.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-09-15T14:30:29-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/09/15/beyonce-jay-z-bang-bang-part-1/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-83403", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The hip-hop power couple released the first of a three-part short film ahead of their HBO concert special.", "title": "Watch Beyonce and Jay Z Go On the Run in \u2018Bang Bang\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/09/15/beyonce-jay-z-bang-bang-part-1/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EN640_0915be_G_20140915100056.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-83403", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-15T14:14:49-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa6e\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s go ahead and say that the entire world would lovingly embrace a full-length movie starring Beyonce and Jay Z.\nDubbed \u201cBang Bang,\u201d the sultry black and white clip opens with the two primping before heading out into the desert.\nJay takes the moment to stub out his cigar into a patron\u2019s hamburger \u2013 one of his bigger disses in recent memory.\nBut if there was any doubt that these two mean business, it comes towards the end, as they leave the restaurant.\nHBO\u2019s \u201cOn the Run\u201d special premiers this Saturday, September 20."}
