Ball opened the season as the Broncos\u2019 starting running back but an appendectomy in training camp and the strained groin has set him back. He has just 172 yards rushing on 3.1 yards per carry.\n\nThere is a decent chance Ball will return to play next week at St. Louis.\n\nRonnie Hillman will be the Broncos\u2019 starting running back against the Raiders. The question is who will be his primary backup. Juwan Thompson, an undrafted rookie, has been the Broncos\u2019 No. 2 back the previous four games but second-year player C.J. Anderson was the most effective back last week at New England.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "C.J.
