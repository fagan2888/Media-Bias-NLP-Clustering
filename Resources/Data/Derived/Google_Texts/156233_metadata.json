The incident happened at 10:30 a.m. on the west side of Bethoud Pass.\n\nThe 200-foot slide on a 38-degree angle was estimated at 150 to 180 feet wide and more than 10 feet deep.\n\n\u201cA snowboarder entered first and stopped on a rock outcrop to watch the skier,\u201d the report stated. \u201cSkier was caught and carried but arrested half way down the path. Skier deployed airbag.\u201d\n\nAvalanches are common this time of year in the Colorado high country. The Boulder-based center had reports for five slides Saturday and at least two Sunday. Colorado leads the nation in avalanche deaths with 259 since 1950. Second is Alaska with 141, according to the center. Colorado\u2019s high number is largely attributable to the recreational accessibility of the state\u2019s mountains, officials have said.\n\nThere have been five avalanche-related deaths in Colorado since Nov. 21.\n\nThe last was on Jan. 7 southeast of the Vail Ski Area. Tony Seibert, the 24-year-old grandson of Vail co-founder Peter Seibert Sr., was killed on a backcountry skiing trip. Three others were injured in the slide.\n\nAvalanche danger remains \u201cconsiderable\u201d in Vail and Summit County, the Front Front Range and Sawatch mountains, according to the Avalanche information center. The danger is rated as \u201cmoderate\u201d in the Steamboat and Flat Tops area of northern Colorado, the northern San Juan Mountains in southern Colorado, as well as the Aspen, Gunnison and Grand Mesa areas.\n\nThe Avalanche Information Center urged backcountry travelers to be aware of their surroundings and exercise caution.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Skier survives Berthoud Pass avalanche he triggered", "title": "Skier survives Berthoud Pass avalanche he triggered", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/19/skier-survives-berthoud-pass-avalanche-he-triggered/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T21:34:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-19T21:34:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A skier survived an avalanche he triggered Saturday morning on Berthoud Pass in Grand County, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said.\nThe Avalanche Information Center urged backcountry travelers to be aware of their surroundings and exercise caution.\nAvalanche danger remains \u201cconsiderable\u201d in Vail and Summit County, the Front Front Range and Sawatch mountains, according to the Avalanche information center.\n\u201cA snowboarder entered first and stopped on a rock outcrop to watch the skier,\u201d the report stated.\nHe deployed his air bag and was not seriously injured, according to the report, which did not cite the skier\u2019s name."}
