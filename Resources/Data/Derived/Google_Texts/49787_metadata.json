So if facing seventh-ranked LSU and Heisman Trophy favorite Leonard Fournette wasn\u2019t bad enough, now the Gamecocks have to do it in Tiger Stadium, which for this first-time visitor easily ranks among the most physically imposing home fields in all conference, if not the nation.\n\nAnd yet, this trip is very different from many road games, where so many opponents relish the opportunity to rub the Head Ball Coach\u2019s nose in it for perpetrated offenses real or imagined over the course of his career. Louisiana well knows what it\u2019s like to be displaced by a natural disaster, having moved its 2005 home opener against Arizona State to Tempe, Ariz., due to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and the next season postponing another game due to another storm. As luck of the schedule would have it, USC relocated this game to the one school which can most understand what the Gamecocks are going through now.\n\nThat appreciation is evident all over Baton Rouge. \u201cOur home is your home,\u201d the sign at the airport read. \u201cGeaux Gamecocks\u201d flashes on some electronic billboards around town, and other messages of support are evident on business marquees. Palmetto State and USC banners flew on a flagpole high above Tiger Stadium, where a virtual South Carolina state flag fluttered on video boards in the hours before the game. When people here find out you\u2019re from South Carolina, you get a \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d followed by a look of concern.\n\nThis was supposed to be USC\u2019s home game, and LSU has added a few touches to maintain that spirit. LSU\u2019s United Airlines charter plane flew to Columbia to pick up the Gamecocks on Friday, and is scheduled to bring them home Saturday after the game \u2014 an act of charity, to be sure, but likely also one of practicality since the aircraft was already booked for what was supposed to be an LSU road trip.\n\nThe USC equipment staff arrived at Tiger Stadium to a barbecue spread. The seat-assignment placards in the press box were those used at USC, and read \u201cWelcome to Williams-Brice Stadium (Tiger Stadium edition).\u201d The LSU band will play USC\u2019s fight song and alma mater, there will be a moment of silence honoring flood victims, and the Gamecocks are scheduled to run onto the field first to a video introduction \u2014 which might even be \u201c2001,\u201d given that we heard a snippet of that anthem over the sound system in the hours before the game.\n\nThe LSU folks have been incredibly accommodating in every way, even dropping off media credentials and parking pass to USC beat writers at their respective hotels. Tigers athletic director Joe Alleva is an old friend of Steve Spurrier\u2019s going back to their days at Duke, and that relationship is perhaps another reason why the Tigers are pulling out all the stops (save repainting the field, which Alleva says they couldn\u2019t do because of a home game next week against Florida). The cynic would add that LSU really has nothing to lose by being overly hospitable, given the Gamecocks are 19-point underdogs. Would they be doing the same for, say, Alabama?\n\nIn this situation it really doesn\u2019t matter. From a football perspective, this unexpected trip to the banks of the Mississippi River only heightens the degree of difficulty in a Gamecocks season which is in serious danger of becoming Spurrier\u2019s first losing campaign at USC. Drop this one, and South Carolina is 0-4 in conference play for the first time since Lou Holtz went 0-11 in 1999, and has to win four of its final six \u2014 a stretch which includes three top-11 opponents \u2014 to salvage bowl eligibility.\n\nGiven the opponent, that\u2019s a reality the Gamecocks seem likely to face leaving Baton Rouge. But reality also includes Columbia still lacking clean drinking water as the city continues to grapple with repairing a breach in the canal which supplies much of the water to the city. Reality is more rain Saturday in Columbia, and more flood warnings in the Midlands, and further overnight curfews. Safe to say, police officers around Columbia continue to have their hands full, and didn\u2019t need to be managing game-day traffic around Williams-Brice Stadium.\n\nSo here we are in Tiger Stadium, in a situation which feels welcoming, to be certain, but also a little odd. LSU didn\u2019t sell some of the upper-deck areas of Tiger Stadium for this unexpected home game, and Alleva on local radio Friday sounded pained that only 38,000 tickets in the 102,321-seat edifice had been sold. USC will receive the revenue from this game after LSU deducts its expenses, and that net amount will certainly be lower than expected now that the crowd in this facility will seem more like that of a spring game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cover our expenses, they\u2019ll still get money, but it\u2019s nowhere close to what I was hoping we could give them,\u201d Alleva told Baton Rouge\u2019s 104.5-FM. LSU has been banging the drum for ticket sales, even enlisting Spurrier for a commercial which aired in Louisiana. But with so many fans evidently having made other plans, it\u2019s proving a tough sell. Three hours before the game, parking lots around Tiger Stadium were half-empty at best.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Spur of the Moment: Palmetto State flags at Tiger Stadium, and other bits of home on the road, Blogs, \r\nBlogssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nSpur of the Moment, \r\nSpur of the Moment, flood,Gamecocks,LSU Tigers,SEC football", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 You knew this would be a different type of road trip when you stepped off the plane at the airport serving Louisiana\u2019s capital city, and were greeted by a welcome sign in garnet and black.", "title": "Spur of the Moment: Palmetto State flags at Tiger Stadium, and other bits of home on the road", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151010/151019898/spur-of-the-moment-palmetto-state-flags-at-tiger-stadium-and-other-bits-of-home-on-the-road", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC0309/151019898/AR/0/AR-151019898.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC0309/151019898/AR/0/AR-151019898.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 You knew this would be a different type of road trip when you stepped off the plane at the airport serving Louisiana\u2019s capital city, and were greeted by a welcome sign in garnet and black.", "title": "Spur of the Moment: Palmetto State flags at Tiger Stadium, and other bits of home on the road", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC0309/151019898/AR/0/AR-151019898.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151019898}}, "keywords": "Spur of the Moment: Palmetto State flags at Tiger Stadium, and other bits of home on the road , Blogs, \r\nBlogssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nSpur of the Moment, \r\nSpur of the Moment, flood,Gamecocks,LSU Tigers,SEC football", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T14:01:41Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-10T14:01:00Z", "author": "David Caraviello"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 You knew this would be a different type of road trip when you stepped off the plane at the airport serving Louisiana\u2019s capital city, and were greeted by a welcome sign in garnet and black."}, "article_summary": "So here we are in Tiger Stadium, in a situation which feels welcoming, to be certain, but also a little odd.\nPalmetto State and USC banners flew on a flagpole high above Tiger Stadium, where a virtual South Carolina state flag fluttered on video boards in the hours before the game.\nThree hours before the game, parking lots around Tiger Stadium were half-empty at best.\nWhen people here find out you\u2019re from South Carolina, you get a \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d followed by a look of concern.\nThe USC equipment staff arrived at Tiger Stadium to a barbecue spread."}
