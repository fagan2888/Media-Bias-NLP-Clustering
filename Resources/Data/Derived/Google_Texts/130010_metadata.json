Cunningham, an assistant professor at Rollins School of Public Health and author of the new study, said in a press release that the review comes in response to the current lack of sufficient research on the subject. \"Although trends in the prevalence of obesity are well documented, there is surprisingly little known about new cases of childhood obesity,\" she explained. \u201cExamining incidence may provide insight into the nature of the epidemic, the critically vulnerable ages, and the groups who are at greater risk for obesity.\"\n\nTo investigate the link between kindergarten weight and childhood obesity risk, the researchers analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study \u2014 a cohort put together in the late 1990s to assess a variety of health factors in young kids. Using weight classification from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the team determined that 12 percent of the kids entered kindergarten obese and 14 percent entered overweight. They found that, by 8th grade, these children were four times as likely to have developed childhood obesity.\n\nPreventing Childhood Obesity\n\nAccording to official estimates, childhood obesity now affects more than a third of U.S. children and adolescents. The disorder, which raises the risk of developing complications like cancer and diabetes later in life, typically arises from a combination of genetic factors and overeating.\n\nThe new study is the latest in a growing series of attempts to highlight the importance of early obesity prevention. In another paper from last year, researchers from Dokkyo Medical University found that children who undergo so-called adiposity rebound \u2014 or, whose body mass index (BMI) begins to rise \u2014 before 4 years of age are significantly more likely to be overweight and have unhealthy blood pressure by age 12 compared to children who reach this developmental \u201cturning point\u201d around age 6. Taken together, these results show an alarming risk factor of early metabolic syndrome.\n\nCunningham hopes that the new study will help parents as well as health officials combat the incidence of the taxing and often stigmatizing disorder. \"Our findings uncovered several important points by examining incidence over time,\" she said. \"We have evidence that certain factors established before birth and during the first five years are important. Obesity-prevention efforts focused on children who are overweight by 5 years old may be a way to target children susceptible to becoming obese later in life.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kindergarten weight, risk of developing childhood obesity, kindergarten overweight, kindergarten obesity, adiposity rebound", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Overweight kindergartners are four times as likely to develop childhood obesity and other complications by 8th grade.", "title": "Use Kindergarten Weight To Predict Your Child's Risk Of Becoming Obese", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kindergarten-weight-predicts-your-kids-risk-developing-childhood-obesity-8th-grade-268172", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/29/kid-eating-chocolate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Overweight kindergartners are four times as likely to develop childhood obesity and other complications by 8th grade.", "title": "Use Kindergarten Weight To Predict Your Child's Risk Of Becoming Obese", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kindergarten-weight-predicts-your-kids-risk-developing-childhood-obesity-8th-grade-268172", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/29/kid-eating-chocolate.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/29/kid-eating-chocolate.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-29T17:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T17:00:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Overweight kindergartners are four times as likely to develop childhood obesity and other complications by 8th grade."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc1d\"", "article_summary": "\"Although trends in the prevalence of obesity are well documented, there is surprisingly little known about new cases of childhood obesity,\" she explained.\nPreventing Childhood ObesityAccording to official estimates, childhood obesity now affects more than a third of U.S. children and adolescents.\nThey found that, by 8th grade, these children were four times as likely to have developed childhood obesity.\nTo investigate the link between kindergarten weight and childhood obesity risk, the researchers analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study \u2014 a cohort put together in the late 1990s to assess a variety of health factors in young kids.\n\u201cExamining incidence may provide insight into the nature of the epidemic, the critically vulnerable ages, and the groups who are at greater risk for obesity.\""}
