The second would have shielded people who refused to engage in art or speech they disagree with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of discussion here today about where do we draw the line between the First Amendment \u2014 freedom of speech, freedom of religion \u2014 and discrimination,\u201d said Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt, R-Colorado Springs, who sponsored the latter bill, which failed by a 9-2 vote.\n\n\u201cI say we should draw the line between government-compelled speech.\u201d\n\nKlingenschmitt\u2019s bill was motivated by civil rights complaints against two metro Denver bakers \u2014 one who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, and another who refused to decorate a cake that she thought demeaned gays.\n\nDave Montez, executive director of the gay rights advocacy group One Colorado, said the bill created a loophole for discrimination \u201cbased on who they are, not what they buy.\u201d Laws don\u2019t tell bakers or other businesses what products to sell, but that they must treat all customers equally, he said.\n\nBefore his bill blocking government interference in religious practices failed 7-4, Rep. Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, told the committee he agreed that discrimination is unjustifiable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unfortunate that we\u2019ve had discrimination in this country all the way back to the Jim Crow laws,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst kind of discrimination, though, is when the government is the discriminator.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Legislative committee kills 2 discrimination bills opposed by gays", "title": "Legislative committee kills 2 discrimination bills opposed by gays", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/09/legislative-committee-kills-2-discrimination-bills-opposed-by-gays/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T19:06:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T19:06:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde22\"", "article_summary": "A Colorado legislative committee on Monday killed a pair of bills aimed at barring religious discrimination, which opponents said would have created state-sanctioned discrimination against gays.\nBefore his bill blocking government interference in religious practices failed 7-4, Rep.
