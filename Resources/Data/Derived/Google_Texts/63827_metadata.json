When she heard about the robbery at the Vermont Federal Credit Union in town Friday afternoon she was more than a little surprised.\n\n\u201cNothing happens here and to have the same thing happen in two weeks it's nuts,\u201d LaMonda said.\n\nPolice say this man walked into the bank on Panton Road and demanded cash. After a teller gave him money, he drove away in a gray four door sedan heading south on Panton road towards West Main Street.\n\n\u201cHe had a head start on us and we were on pretty much all the major streets covering all the traffic in and out of town but by that time, I think the individual may had already gone,\u201d said Vergennes Police Chief George Merkel.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the People's Bank on Maple Street in Vergennes was hit. That time, the criminal had a knife. Police haven't determined if there is a connection.\n\n\u201cWe don't know at this time, there are some similarities but at this point we're not sure,\u201d Merkel said.\n\nThe recent string of bank robberies makes LaMonda, who often works nights, nervous.\n\n\u201cI think personally it's because of the drugs and if they get away with it once they're going to try doing it again, again and again until they get caught and eventually they do,\u201d LaMonda said.\n\nIf you have any information on these crimes, contact Vergennes Police at 877-1152.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 22:27:58 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Rachel Karcz", "og": {"site_name": "WPTZ", "description": "Vergennes police are investigating their second bank robbery in two weeks following a spike in robberies in the area.", "title": "Police investigate second bank robbery in two weeks", "url": "http://www.wptz.com/news/police-investigate-second-bank-robbery-in-two-weeks/32059886", "image": "http://www.wptz.com/image/view/-/32060566/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/pfqnka/-/img-Police-investigate-second-bank-robbery-this-month.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wptz.com/news/police-investigate-second-bank-robbery-in-two-weeks/32059886", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wptz://content/article/32059886", "iphone": "wptz://content/article/32059886", "googleplay": "wptz://content/article/32059886"}, "name": {"ipad": "wptz", "iphone": "wptz", "googleplay": "wptz"}}, "site": "@WPTZ", "card": "app"}, "description": "Vergennes police are investigating their second bank robbery in two weeks following a spike in robberies in the area.", "al": {"android": {"url": "wptz://content/article/32059886", "app_name": "wptz"}, "ios": {"url": "wptz://content/article/32059886", "app_name": "wptz"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 100717450266}, "keywords": "local plattsburgh news, breaking burlington news, live vermont alerts", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/RachelKarczWPTZ?fref=ts"}, "news_keywords": "local plattsburgh news, breaking burlington news, live vermont alerts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0db\"", "article_summary": "Vergennes police are investigating their second bank robbery in two weeks following a spike in robberies in the area.\nPolice say this man walked into the bank on Panton Road and demanded cash.\nThe recent string of bank robberies makes LaMonda, who often works nights, nervous.\nAfter a teller gave him money, he drove away in a gray four door sedan heading south on Panton road towards West Main Street.\nJust two weeks ago, the People's Bank on Maple Street in Vergennes was hit."}
