John McCain is hitting back at Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, for criticizing his hawkish rivals Saturday at New Hampshire\u2019s Republican Leadership Summit.\n\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. McCain, Arizona Republican, said Monday on Fox News, The Hill reported. \u201cHe has displayed this kind of naivet\u00e9 since he came to the Senate.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain\u2019s comments come after Mr. Paul argued that war hawks within the Republican Party are no different from President Obama\u2019s administration on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a group of folks in our party who would have troops in six countries right now, maybe more,\u201d Mr. Paul told hundreds of supporters Saturday at the pre-primary event in Nashua. \u201cThis is something, if you watch closely, that will separate me from many other Republicans. The other Republicans will criticize Hillary Clinton and the president for their foreign policy, but they would have done the same thing \u2014 just 10 times over.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain on Monday criticized his colleague for previously advocating for cuts in defense spending and foreign aid, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sort of changing now as he\u2019s seen [the Islamic State] succeed. \u2026 He\u2019s more aligned with Barack Obama\u2019s national security policy than certainly any Republican than I know,\u201d Mr. McCain argued.\n\nMr. Paul said Saturday that he supports \u201cmilitary action\u201d against the Islamic State, Politico reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
