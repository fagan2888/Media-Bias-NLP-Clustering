Most of her life depends on regular treatments at Wake Nephrology\u2019s dialysis center in Raleigh.\n\n\u201cI've been coming to dialysis for 8 years presently. I'm on the transplant list,\u201d said Harris.\n\nDr. Michael Casey works with Wake Nephrology which operates 16 dialysis clinics in Wake, Harnett and Johnson counties \u2013 serving about 800 patients.\n\nCasey said about 85 percent of the patients of his clinics are on Medicare. That limits the profit providers can make from dialysis. Casey says Wake Nephrology gets about a 3 to 4 percent profit margin from Medicare patients.\n\nDialysis centers could see cuts\n\nThat forces a hard decision on providers, one that Casey said most patients are not aware of.\n\n\u201dA lot of our clinics are just barely breaking even,\u201d he said. If they were to start losing money, they may be forced to close. Casey says the rural clinics with a lower patient population could be the first to go. Facilities may also have to cut back on staff positions and certain service, like overnight dialysis.\n\n\u201cIt's just a very difficult thing because these are the sickest of the sick and they require a lot of resources and services,\u201d said Casey.\n\nHarris believes she'll always be able to get her services at the north Raleigh clinic, but she is concerned for others who might have to travel further for treatments.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-09-05 18:43:00", "description": "Looming Medicare cuts could forces some low-margin providers out of business, making care inconvenient or inaccessible.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2013-09-05 18:44:01", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=12855840|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Looming Medicare cuts could forces some low-margin providers out of business, making care inconvenient or inaccessible.", "title": "Medicare cuts threaten rural dialysis centers :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/medicare-cuts-threaten-rural-dialysis-centers/12855840/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2013/09/05/12855844/12855844-1378420977-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-05T18:43:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Looming Medicare cuts could forces some low-margin providers out of business, making care inconvenient or inaccessible.", "title": "Medicare cuts threaten rural dialysis centers :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/medicare-cuts-threaten-rural-dialysis-centers/12855840/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2013/09/05/12855844/34966-HT-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda07b\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Michael Casey works with Wake Nephrology which operates 16 dialysis clinics in Wake, Harnett and Johnson counties \u2013 serving about 800 patients.\nDialysis centers could see cutsThat forces a hard decision on providers, one that Casey said most patients are not aware of.\nCasey says Wake Nephrology gets about a 3 to 4 percent profit margin from Medicare patients.\nMost of her life depends on regular treatments at Wake Nephrology\u2019s dialysis center in Raleigh.\nThat limits the profit providers can make from dialysis."}
