Joseph Cain.\n\nThe outdoors-savvy members of the Priest Lake Search and Rescue are no exception.\n\nMore than 80 PLSR volunteers and officers from state Fish and Game, federal Border Patrol and county sheriff\u2019s agencies assembled at Priest Lake State Park recently for two days of winter rescue and survival training.\n\n\u201cEverybody here is volunteering their time,\u201d including the instructors from the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school, said Mike Nielsen, PLSR commander.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about being ready to go beyond roads to help someone in an emergency.\u201d\n\nBetter cell phone coverage in recent years has boosted self rescues by friends or families, cutting down on official calls for search and rescues, Nielsen said.\n\nNevertheless, PLSR, which is used throughout Bonner County, expects to be called into action about 10 times a year.\n\n\u201cIt takes us about a half an hour to mobilize,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cWe run any conditions day or night. But almost all of our missions are at night. Mom doesn\u2019t call the sheriff until daddy\u2019s not home and it\u2019s dark outside.\n\n\u201cMost of our missions are for snowmobilers and we have an elite team of expert riders that lead that group. We also have 37 people qualified in ropes rescue to go in and rescue a climber. When you need that expertise, there\u2019s no substitute for it.\u201d\n\nSome of the 200 volunteers in PLSR are trained in rescuing hapless people who break through the ice on a lake. Some are equipped with ATVs and power boats while others are geared up with kayaks and backpacks to come to the aid of lost or injured people on land or water.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve rescued a lot of skiers and snowboarders who go out of bounds from Schweitzer and get lost,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cThere have been so many, we know where they\u2019re likely to be. We send a group in at the bottom and wait for them to come out to us.\u201d\n\nPLSR volunteers range in age from 12 to 78. Some are fit enough to climb the highest peaks in the Selkirks. Others are trained in setting up command posts and logistics support.\n\nTrevor Low, an eighth grader from Priest River, was attending the winter survival training with his mother and grandmother, Karen Dingerson - all of whom were camping out in the snow.\n\n\u201cTrevor put out the word before Christmas and his gifts were gear he needed to take this course,\u201d Dingerson said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know he has this training when he heads out snowmobiling with his father.\u201d\n\nPLSR is a non-profit group that works for the Sheriff, Nielsen said. Members use their own gear and raise money for group essentials such as command center and radios. Priest Lake State Parks donates facilities for the weekend winter training.\n\n\u201cThe counties could never afford these kinds of groups if volunteers didn\u2019t provide their own gear and support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get no tax dollars. Our budget is based solely on what people, organizations and businesses give us.\u201d\n\nA new $60,000 radio system with GPS transmitters was purchased largely from fundraisers organized over several years by Priest Lake businesses.\n\n\u201cThis system links into other systems and allows the command post to monitor the location and movements of each rescuer as they move in the field,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\nBut high-tech gear is no substitute for first-aid training, survival skills, a knife and insight into improvisation.\n\n\u201cThis winter survival training is actually a motivator for people to join PLSR,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cFairchild provides 15 experts from the survival school. The Air Force instructors are premier. They\u2019re the cream of the cream among U.S. forces.\u201d\n\nStanding in the snow with his group of eight students, Sgt. Cain said their day would be devoted to learning skills boiled down under five needs of survival: treating injury, personal protection such as fire and shelter, signaling, sustenance and recovery.\n\n\u201cEach situation is different and you must prioritize the needs,\u201d Cain said.\n\n\u201cOf course, an injury may need to be stabilized first. Shelter and fire may take a higher priority than food. You might regret not stomping out a signal first thing if a plane flies by while you\u2019re making a shelter.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake is not stepping back and thinking through things, and then prioritizing.\n\n\u201cSurvival can be as simple as having an extra set of dry clothes and remembering to put them on.\u201d\n\nThe training focused on ways to neutralize nasty weather.\n\nStudents learned that making a fire with wet wood can be incredibly difficult without viable tinder.\n\n\u201cAfter this session, you may never hit the trail without a container of cotton balls coated with Vaseline,\u201d an instructor said.\n\n\u201cSome people think it\u2019s the Vaseline that burns, but it\u2019s the cotton fibers. The petroleum jelly just prolongs the flame like paraffin in a candle.\u201d\n\nHe pinched the cotton ball numerous times to pull out tufts of coated fiber until it accumulated at least five times more surface area than the original cotton ball. \u201cMake it hairy and fibrous before you light it\u201d with a match, lighter, flint or other source, he said.\n\nFire starter was the difference between a flame and no flame in the damp conditions for many of the students.\n\nThey all shared notes on selecting the best knife for survival situations. One woman pointed out that she carries temporary fillings in her first aid kit after a miserable experience on camping trip.\n\n\u201cI really like these aluminum or titanium canteen cups that are big enough to slip over a Nalgene bottle for packing,\u201d Cain said. \u201cYou should have something you can put on a fire to melt snow or boil water. Plastic doesn\u2019t work too well over a fire.\u201d\n\nJimmy Driver of Bonners Ferry was taking the course with his wife, Leah. They both joined PLSR four years ago.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of winter camping, so there\u2019s nothing so far that I\u2019d call real new to us,\u201d he said early in the session. \u201cBut the survival school instructors are real cool and they break it down into easy-to-remember steps. It\u2019s really useful stuff.\u201d\n\nSaid Sgt. Cain: \u201cThe main point to remember in an emergency situation - don\u2019t just die. Look around. Tap your will to survive.\u201d\n\n____\n\nThe original story can be found on The Spokesman-Review\u2019s website: http://bit.ly/1BXzLMT\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The winter survival clinic conjured up visions from Jack London's classic short story, To Build a Fire, as students labored to create life-saving warmth near the damp, snowy shores of Priest Lake.", "Author": "RICH LANDERS", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The winter survival clinic conjured up visions from Jack London\u2019s classic short story, To Build a Fire, as students labored to create life-saving warmth near the damp, snowy shores of Priest Lake.", "title": "Air Force winter survival pros  show how it\u2019s done", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/air-force-winter-survival-pros-show-how-its-done/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/05/2182212ca20e20056d0f6a706700129e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/05/2182212ca20e20056d0f6a706700129e.jpg", "title": "Air Force winter survival pros  show how it\u2019s done", "description": "The winter survival clinic conjured up visions from Jack London's classic short story, To Build a Fire, as students labored to create life-saving warmth near the damp, snowy shores of Priest Lake.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis winter survival training is actually a motivator for people to join PLSR,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\u201cEverybody here is volunteering their time,\u201d including the instructors from the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school, said Mike Nielsen, PLSR commander.\nPRIEST LAKE, Idaho (AP) - The winter survival clinic conjured up visions from Jack London\u2019s classic short story, To Build a Fire, as students labored to create life-saving warmth near the damp, snowy shores of Priest Lake.\nBut high-tech gear is no substitute for first-aid training, survival skills, a knife and insight into improvisation.\n\u201cTake the extra time to set yourself up for success,\u201d the Fairchild Air Force Base survival instructor said."}
