We watch the children grow over the years and witness the president and first lady\u2019s* relationship matures over time as well.\n\nPresidencies are emblematic of an era. They come to represent a feeling that will forever exist in the national subconscious. So as we enter the final year of the Obama presidency, it\u2019s time to take a mental snapshot of this place and time in American history before we move on to embrace or simply tolerate the next family to occupy the White House.\n\nRecently, the Obamas gave us a reason to take that mental snapshot when they celebrated their final Valentine\u2019s Day as the country\u2019s first couple with a charming exchange on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
