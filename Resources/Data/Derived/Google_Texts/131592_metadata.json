He seems like a nice man. He smells like cigarettes because he smokes all the time but a lot of people do that.\n\nBut he\u2019s also a coward. He has a side to him that\u2019s brazen. He can say things like Ted Cruz is Lucifer in the flesh. But it\u2019s easy to confuse bravery with brazenness.\n\nRelated: The Left and the morality of the moment\n\nBoehner made the decision to fight Obamacare and talked a lot of talk. But a lot of RNC donors stopped giving money to the RNC. So Boehner told GOP staff to stand down and let Obamacare pass, even though most in the GOP knew it was going to be a disaster. It almost seemed like Boehner himself wanted Obamacare.\n\nAnd how many people know that when the Tea Party came to D.C. members of Boehner\u2019s senior staff were making inbreeding and \u201cDeliverance\u201d jokes about Tea Party members? And think of all the photos we\u2019ve seen of Boehner \u201cyucking\u201d it up with Obama.\n\nBut this guy calls his own party member, who is running for president, the devil in the flesh?\n\nRemember when John Boehner said he was going to fight Obama\u2019s illegal immigration stance? He said he would fight it tooth and nail. And then he gave him $2.5 billion to not enforce immigration laws. But Ted Cruz is Lucifer in the flesh.\n\nIt seems he wants to erase his past as a Republican. Is he upset with Cruz because Cruz was the one who exposed why Boehner really resigned?", "article_metadata": {"description": "He has a side to him that\u2019s brazen.
