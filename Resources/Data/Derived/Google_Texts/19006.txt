No one was off limits in Jimmy Fallon’s latest monologue

Late night host Jimmy Fallon delivered a spot on monologue Tuesday night, tackling everything from President Obama’s China trip to Sen. Ted Cruz’s comments on net neutrality.

“Texas Senator Ted Cruz tweeted that, ‘Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the internet,'” Fallon said. “While Ted Cruz continues to be the Taylor Swift of not getting over Obamacare.”

Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett also took some heat from Fallon. He heard that she had been called, “the Obama whisperer.”

Fallon confirmed this title and jokingly added, “Not surprisingly, the [Vice President Joe] Biden whisperer is actually Cesar Milan.”

The host also snuck in a quick jab at Fox News’ Megyn Kelly for her unfortunate name slip-up with Mike Huckabee.
