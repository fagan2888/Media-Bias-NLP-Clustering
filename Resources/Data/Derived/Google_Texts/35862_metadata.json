These figures hovered just under 80% and just under 90%, respectively.\n\nThe findings were worse for mental healthcare specifically -- the proportion of distressed adults who had seen a mental health professional in the past year fell during that time, from about 42% to 34%.\n\n\"This may be due to a number of factors, such as an increasing trend in obtaining mental health care from primary care providers or an increasing shortage of mental health professionals,\" Cohen and Zammitti wrote. \"Exploring these hypotheses requires further analysis, using more detail than NHIS provides.\"\n\nIn this study, serious psychological distress was measured on the Kessler 6 nonspecific distress scale, which asks about the frequency of six symptoms, including nervousness and hopelessness, in the past month. Patients meeting this definition were about 3%-4% of the weighted sample during the analysis period.\n\nThe fall in the rate of uninsured in this population corresponded with an increase in private insurance coverage during that time, from 30% to 38%. Rates of public coverage remained relatively constant, they reported.\n\nCost-related barriers to care appear not to be an explanation for the decline in mental healthcare provision. The researchers found that many measures associated with not receiving care or delaying services due to cost fell during this period for patients with serious psychological distress.\n\nIn the first 9 months of 2015, fewer patients said they had forgone mental healthcare because of cost in the past year, and they were more able to afford necessary medical care and prescription drugs at the end of the study period.\n\nDespite these improvements, disparities remain, Cohen and Zammitti wrote.\n\nAlthough the percentage of uninsured had fallen to 19.5% among this group, this was still half again greater than the 12% of patients without distress who remained uninsured.\n\nAnd about a quarter of patients with distress still reported being unable to pay for necessary medical care in the last year compared with only about 6% of those without the condition.\n\n\"It is possible that improved access does not necessarily lead to a successful treatment for serious psychological distress,\" they wrote. \"It is also possible that those who still have distress are increasingly those with poor access.\"\n\nThe researchers disclosed no financial relationships with industry.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kristina  Fiore", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/GeneralPsychiatry/57691", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/57xxx/57691.jpg", "description": "But fewer had contact with a mental health professional", "card": "Summary", "title": "Distressed Patients Gain Insurance Coverage"}, "dc.date.issued": "2016-05-04 10:30:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,psychiatry,publichealthpolicy,generalpsychiatry,healthpolicy,publichealth,generalprimarycare,generalprofessionalissues,nursing,nursing,theguptaguide", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-04 10:30:00", "sailthru.title": "Distressed Patients Gain Insurance Coverage", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "But fewer had contact with a mental health professional", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-05 10:05:00", "date": "2016-05-04 10:30:00", "sailthru.description": "But fewer had contact with a mental health professional", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/GeneralPsychiatry/57691", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/57xxx/57691.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "But fewer had contact with a mental health professional", "title": "Distressed Patients Gain Insurance Coverage"}, "sailthru.featured": 1, "dc.date": "2016-05-04 10:30:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "psychiatry,Other,primarycare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/57xxx/57691.jpg"}, "article_summary": "More patients with serious psychological distress had insurance coverage following the Affordable Care Act, but that didn't change whether they'd seen a healthcare professional recently, researchers reported.\n\"It is possible that improved access does not necessarily lead to a successful treatment for serious psychological distress,\" they wrote.\nThe researchers found that many measures associated with not receiving care or delaying services due to cost fell during this period for patients with serious psychological distress.\n\"This may be due to a number of factors, such as an increasing trend in obtaining mental health care from primary care providers or an increasing shortage of mental health professionals,\" Cohen and Zammitti wrote.\nThe findings were worse for mental healthcare specifically -- the proportion of distressed adults who had seen a mental health professional in the past year fell during that time, from about 42% to 34%."}
