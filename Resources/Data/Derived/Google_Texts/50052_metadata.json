Frankly, the consumers, the patients have put up with stuff that they never would put up with in anything else. Think about the bills that you get from either hospitals or insurance companies. One of the twelve disruptors in my book is actually exactly that. Thou shalt always send a patient a believable, understandable bill for services rendered in matter that clearly states what was done, what it cost, and what the patient owes, regardless of who is paying the bill. That\u2019s not too much to ask.\u201d\n\nHe also said that medical providers and insurance companies need to stop standing in the way of change.\n\n\u201cOther people are paying for it, so at the end of the day, hospitals and insurers get to fight about who is going to get the majority of it. If people were paying for it directly, it would be different. Secondly, we\u2019ve never had good data and we don\u2019t share data. I would argue that, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 51/49 or 49/51, but both the insurers and the hospitals have to get over themselves.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he thinks the demand for change will force the system to be more open and competitive.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that needs to happen is transparency. You ought to know who you\u2019re going to, what it\u2019s going to cost, what the deductible is going to be. One of the good things that\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from Obamacare or whatever, is deductibles are increasing, so people are thinking about it differently.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Klasko, the CEO and President of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health, discusses his new book, We Can Fix It.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/05/18/jefferson-ceo-calls-for-more-transparency-in-medicine/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/doctor-patient-generic.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/doctor-patient-generic.jpg?w=625", "height": 469}, "type": "article", "description": "Stephen Klasko, the CEO and President of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health, discusses his new book, We Can Fix It.", "title": "Jefferson CEO Calls For More Transparency In Medicine"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/doctor-patient-generic.jpg?w=625", "description": "Stephen Klasko, the CEO and President of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health, discusses his new book, We Can Fix It.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jefferson CEO Calls For More Transparency In Medicine"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "talk radio 1210 wpht, chris stigall, affordable care act, obamacare, stephen klasko, jefferson health, thomas jefferson university, we can fix it, healthcare", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "Talk Radio 1210 WPHT, Chris Stigall, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Stephen Klasko, Jefferson Health, Thomas Jefferson University, We Can Fix It, Healthcare"}, "article_summary": "One of the good things that\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from Obamacare or whatever, is deductibles are increasing, so people are thinking about it differently.\u201d\nYou ought to know who you\u2019re going to, what it\u2019s going to cost, what the deductible is going to be.\n\u201cWe do a great job as doctors but we\u2019ve never thought we have to also think about it as consumers.\n\u201cOne of the things that needs to happen is transparency.\nFrankly, the consumers, the patients have put up with stuff that they never would put up with in anything else."}
