W.W. Reynolds Co., a Boulder-based commercial real estate firm, has purchased the former Savers thrift store building in south Boulder for $4.635 million, though no future plans for the space have been revealed publicly.

Boulder County property records show that W.W. Reynolds Co. purchased the 40,000-square-foot building at 695 S. Broadway through a company called 1916 LLC on May 6.

Officials with the company did not respond to Daily Camera phone messages or emails on Friday.

According to city of Boulder spokesman Nick Grossman, no planning applications have been submitted for the building.

W.W. Reynolds also owns the nearby 181,634-square-foot, King Soopers-anchored Table Mesa Shopping Center at Table Mesa Drive and Broadway. Plans for the large shopping center include improving landscaping, lighting, signage and adding outdoor play areas for children. A Walgreens is also planned for the center.

The site at 695 S. Broadway had been occupied by the Savers thrift store, a Dollar Tree, a laundromat and a costume shop until last fall.

At the time, tenants said they were under the impression that Whole Foods Market purchased the building, but those rumors proved to be unfounded.

"We do not have any plans to open a store in this location," said Heather Larrabee, a Whole Foods spokeswoman. I'm not sure how the rumor got started ... I am unsure what grocer or business is going in there."

Savers had operated in the building since 1997. Before that, it was an Albertsons grocery store.

W.W. Reynolds purchased the building from a group of six owners, including the Joyce Family Charitable Trust.
