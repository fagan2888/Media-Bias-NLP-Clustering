It depends on how they go about doing it. \u2026 The devil is in the details,\u201d said Aaron Parker, president of the nonprofit Metropolitan Interfaith Council on Affordable Housing, one of the parties in a federal fair-housing complaint against the state of Minnesota.\n\nState law requires cities to plan for their fair share of regional affordable housing. The Met Council, the regional planning body whose members are appointed by the governor, is facing the once-in-a-decade process armed with new U.S. census data. This time, the agency says, it will change its allotment formula and open the process more to the public.\n\nThe allocation numbers are not mandates, but they help set regional planning priorities and resource distribution.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that [the process] will create a foundation for transparency,\u201d said Libby Starling, the Met Council\u2019s manager of regional policy and research. \u201cWe are also likely to change how it\u2019s done for no other reason than there is better data available to do it.\u201d\n\nAn affordable-housing allocation was last computed in 2006, for 2010 to 2020. The complex formula looked at household growth forecasts, then was adjusted for three factors \u2014 the ratio of low-wage jobs vs. low-wage workers, a community\u2019s existing affordable-housing stock, and access to transit. The new formula is likely to still weigh the first two in some way, Starling said.\n\nThe allocation issue has been so contentious that last fall, the two most racially diverse cities in Minnesota, Brooklyn Park and Brooklyn Center, joined by Richfield and the Interfaith Council, filed federal fair-housing complaints against the state.\n\nThose complaints allege that the state\u2019s housing and planning policies have illegally piled more poor people into already impoverished areas and perpetuated racial segregation in the Twin Cities. Leaders of Brooklyn Park and Brooklyn Center, whose populations are both 50 percent minority, say they were given high allocations for affordable housing even though they have ample amounts of it, while whiter, more affluent suburbs got lower targets.\n\nThey also have argued that the Met Council has the authority to hold back money for parks, water, sewer and transportation projects if cities don\u2019t meet housing goals, and should do so more often.\n\nThe complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A Met Council spokeswoman said that the agency was informed late last week that a HUD decision is pending.\n\nNew process applauded\n\nBrooklyn Park and Interfaith Council leaders have applauded the revamped allocation process, including the new public-comment period.\n\n\u201cWhen people take a look at some of the stuff we were presenting them, those actions open people\u2019s eyes up,\u201d said Brooklyn Park Mayor Jeff Lunde. \u201cWe felt like we are on the outside always trying to add our input.\u201d\n\nA house or apartment is considered affordable if a family of four with an income of $64,000 can live there. About 63 percent of Brooklyn Park\u2019s housing is classified as affordable. That number is 81 percent in Brooklyn Center, compared to the greater Twin Cities area, which has about 53 percent affordable housing.\n\nAccording to the Met Council allocation formula generated in 2006, Brooklyn Park needs 1,494 more affordable-housing units by the year 2020, while Brooklyn Center needs 163. Edina and Mendota Heights \u2014 two cities with much less affordable housing \u2014 need 211 and 43 more units, the formula said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to see the Met Council follow a modified approach to engagement related to the affordable-housing allocation formula,\u201d Brooklyn Park City Manager Jamie Verbrugge said in a written statement. \u201cWe\u2019re fully supportive of broader outreach on issues of regional significance and look forward to participating in the discussion.\u201d\n\nToo much affordable housing lowers a city\u2019s tax base. Brooklyn Park\u2019s tax capacity per capita is about 50 percent of that of peer cities due to a combination of lower home values and less commercial and industrial development, according to city staff.\n\nInterfaith Council activists also see the Met Council\u2019s reallocation work as a positive step.\n\n\u201cI am cautiously optimistic that this [HUD complaint] filing at least got some people\u2019s attention,\u201d the council\u2019s Parker said.\n\nBrooklyn Park, Brooklyn Center, Richfield and the Interfaith Council are relying partly on the research of University of Minnesota Law Prof. Myron Orfield to shape their arguments. He and Michael Allen, an attorney from Washington, D.C., represent the cities and the Interfaith Council in the HUD complaint.\n\nThe problem with housing\n\nNot only do more affluent suburbs generally get lower affordable-housing targets, they also seem to do less to meet those targets with little rebuke from the state, critics say.\n\nStarling said cities are assigned housing performance scores that are factored into how federal and regional resources are allotted. The Met Council\u2019s control over housing is much more tenuous than its ability to structure and manage transportation, she said.\n\n\u201cAll our transportation is owned by the public sector,\u201d Starling said. \u201cThis is not true in housing. The overwhelming majority of housing is privately owned and privately developed. Nearly all the decisions in the housing world are private-market decisions.\u201d\n\nStill, the regional planning agency has an interest in housing. \u201cEven though housing is not a metropolitan system, there are a lot of intersections of housing policy with the work of the council,\u201d Starling said.\n\nNo one is truly meeting the need, all agree. Of the 51,000 affordable-housing units needed from 2010 to 2020, less than 3,000 were built in the first three years of the decade.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough resources,\u201d Starling said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The delicate task of reallocating how much affordable housing each Twin Cities city and suburb should provide won't be easy.", "title": "Where to put affordable housing?
