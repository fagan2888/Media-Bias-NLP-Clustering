The assessment was a necessary task if KRMC wanted to maintain its nonprofit status with the IRS.\n\n\n\nThe county was required to do one for all of the county, as well as a community health improvement plan. The first was completed three years ago. The second assessment began last Monday with the hiring of Pinnacle Prevention, a consulting firm that specializes in preparing community health assessments.\n\n\n\n\"This was so badly needed,\" said Williams of that first assessment. \"We never took a look at it before.\" The report was completed in 2013. It involved primary and secondary data, from the Centers for Disease Control, for example, as well as accident and trauma statistics from the Arizona Department of Transportation. The big element that year, as will be the case again this year beginning in May, was a public survey.\n\n\n\nThe 2013 survey took health care professionals off guard. While they considered the county's \"off the charts\" high smoking rate as the No. 1 health concern - and correlating \"off the charts\" lung cancer rates, as Williams described it - the public considered drug addiction the issue most in need of addressing.\n\n\n\n\"They looked at social issues and we looked at true health issues,\" said Williams. On one key fact they all agreed: Mohave County could certainly be healthier.\n\n\n\nAnother fact, said Williams, is that representatives from more than 50 entities got involved in the process early on, and nearly all of them remain involved and enthused.\n\n\n\nThe process is ongoing and the assessment looks at a multitude of health indicators, said Williams. She remains a huge supporter.\n\n\n\n\"The vision, I have to say, is beautiful,\" she said.\" This isn't just an assessment. The next phase is a health improvement plan.\"\n\n\n\nTo get there, Williams and Patty Mead, director of the county's health department, helped establish a series of task forces to focus on five key issues that cropped up during the last assessment.\n\n\n\n\u0095 Substance abuse - including tobacco\n\n\n\n\u0095 Mental health\n\n\n\n\u0095 Access to affordable health care\n\n\n\n\u0095 Economic conditions\n\n\n\n\u0095 Youth risk\n\n\n\nWhile KRMC and the Mohave County Department of Public Health lead the effort, the assessment is largely driven by the public through the task forces, which are filled with residents and members of the community.\n\n\n\nWilliams made it clear the task forces are autonomous and they receive no input from either KRMC or the county health department.\n\n\n\n\"They have literally signed a commitment to lead,\" she said. \"And to develop goals and objectives. That work began in November.\n\n\n\n\"We're not trying to save the world and we know we're not going to solve all the problems,\" said Williams.\n\n\n\nWhat they are doing is putting the right people on the right task force. Those involved in youth issues, for example come from the school districts, the Arizona Youth Partnership, Mohave Mental Health and boys and girls clubs.\n\n\n\nThe collaboration, said Williams, represents the \"biggest benefit\" to the effort. \"We learn about each other,\" she said. \"We know we have limited resources and so we collaborate so we don't have two groups trying to do the same thing competing for the same grants.\"\n\n\n\nThe new assessment must be completed by June and it will be used as a guide for another three years.\n\n\n\nPlanning is a never-ending, always evolving task, said Williams, but there is a sense of urgency to develop \"reasonable and achievable\" goals and objectives. \"However, we're dealing with issues so big, they're not within anyone's real control\" she said. \"Making a dent is not a simple thing to do and we have a lot of issues.\n\n\n\nWilliams also said it will be difficult to improve the county's overall health because so many of the problems are due to personal choices. Smoking, drinking to excess, abusing drugs.\n\n\n\n\"And so we need to look at what we can control,\" said Williams. \"Is there urgency? Yes, because people are dying. There are a lot of things we can do. Better communication, for sure. We can help get resources or leverage the resources we have. This isn't an effort where we just talk. What we really have is many very caring people trying to help.\"\n\n\n\nWilliams said she hopes the public focuses on health issues during this assessment, if only as it regards smoking and the \"devastating impact\" the habit has on society, not just smokers. Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer, she said. \"I don't want to lessen the community's perspectives. I think in general there are facts to consider on the social side, but we're talking about true health issues. We're not just talking about health care, though. We're talking about our quality of life. We're talking health - physical, emotional and spiritual.\"\n\n\n\nRelated Stories: \u0095 Smoking, other lifestyle choices key to Mohave County's poor health\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "News and Information in Mohave County including Kingman, Golden Valley, Chloride, Dolan Springs, Arizona, AZ", "GENERATOR": "1up!
