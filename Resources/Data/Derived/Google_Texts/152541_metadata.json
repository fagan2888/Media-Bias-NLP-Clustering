But there is no evidence of that. Annual Census surveys show the percentage of uninsured Americans in 2010, when the ACA became law, was 16.3 percent. It dropped to 15.7 percent in 2011 and 15.4 percent in 2012. Gallup surveys show the percentage of uninsured Americans hit a five-year low in the first two months of this year.\n\nThe former Alaska governor gave the closing speech Saturday evening at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, a three-day affair hosted annually by the American Conservative Union. Palin brought the confab to a \u201crousing finish,\u201d as the conservative Newsmax put it, attacking both Democrats and establishment Republicans.\n\nThe 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee saved some of her sharpest barbs (beginning at about the 22 minute mark) for the man, President Obama, who defeated her and her running mate, John McCain, six years ago.\n\nPalin, March 8: This is the guy who promised to provide for the sick, but there are more uninsured today than when Obama began all of this.\n\nIt is too early to determine the full impact of the ACA, but the fact is that the percentage of uninsured Americans has been on the decline since the law took effect \u2014 and, conversely, the percentage of the insured has increased. Congressional budget experts project that the law will reduce the number of the uninsured by 13 million by the end of this year.\n\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s annual Current Population Survey shows 16.3 percent of Americans were without health insurance in 2010, when the law took effect. Since then, the rate has fallen to 15.7 percent in 2011 and 15.4 percent in 2012. (The raw numbers have gone down, too, from 50 million uninsured in 2010 to 48 million in 2012.)\n\nAs for the state of the \u201cuninsured today,\u201d which was Palin\u2019s time frame, Gallup regularly conducts a survey called the Well-Being Index of more than 28,000 Americans. On March 10, Gallup issued a press release on its latest survey that carried the headline, \u201cU.S. Uninsured Rate Continues to Fall.\u201d The survey, which covered Jan. 2 to Feb. 28, shows the percentage of uninsured Americans hit a new five-year low at 15.9 percent, down from 17.1 percent in the final quarter of 2013.\n\nBy the end of 2014, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the law will reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million people. The report (see table B2) says there will be 25 million fewer uninsured Americans in 2024 because of the law.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion and the subsidized (and nonsubsidized) policies sold on the health care exchanges did not take effect until January of this year, and there isn\u2019t any good data yet on how many uninsured Americans have gained coverage through the exchanges. We have written that the law\u2019s supporters have overstated the effect of the exchanges in covering the previously uninsured. But there\u2019s no doubt that the Medicaid expansion and the exchanges will extend coverage to millions of uninsured. And other provisions have already helped Americans gain coverage. For example, the provision that allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until age 26 took effect Sept. 23, 2010, extending insurance to about 3.1 million young people who otherwise would not have been covered.\n\nThe evidence simply does not support Palin\u2019s claim that \u201cthere are more uninsured today than when Obama began all of this.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: CPAC 2014 Speakers CPAC 2014 Speakers\n\n1 of 25 Ted Cruz U.S. Senator (R-Texas) Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-03-11 17:56:00 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "title": "There's No Evidence To Hold Up Some Of Sarah Palin's Obamacare Claims", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/sarah-palin-obamacare_n_4937279.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1670051/images/o-SARAH-PALIN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1670051/images/o-SARAH-PALIN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "There's No Evidence To Hold Up Some Of Sarah Palin's Obamacare Claims"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-10 17:56:00 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4937279", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,sarah palin cpac,2014 cpac,sarah palin affordable care act,Conservative Political Action Conference,sarah palin obamacare,sarah palin,cpac 2014", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "video,sarah palin cpac,2014 cpac,sarah palin affordable care act,Conservative Political Action Conference,sarah palin obamacare,sarah palin,cpac 2014", "published_time": "2014-03-10 17:56:00 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-03-10 17:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "(The raw numbers have gone down, too, from 50 million uninsured in 2010 to 48 million in 2012.)\nGallup surveys show the percentage of uninsured Americans hit a five-year low in the first two months of this year.\nAnnual Census surveys show the percentage of uninsured Americans in 2010, when the ACA became law, was 16.3 percent.\nSarah Palin told her fellow conservatives at CPAC that \u201cthere are more uninsured today than when Obama began all of this,\u201d referring to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe report (see table B2) says there will be 25 million fewer uninsured Americans in 2024 because of the law."}
