The Irvins were neighbors of Sommer, who went overboard earlier this month during a cruise.\n\nFamily and friends of a missing Charleston woman who went overboard during a cruise off the coast of Cuba earlier this month gathered Sunday for a memorial service in her honor.\n\nChacha\u2019s Mexican Grill on Folly Road on James Island was overflowing with Kaylyn Rose Sommer\u2019s loved ones. The walls were lined with photos and a slideshow of images played on a large screen in front of the restaurant. It ended with the quote, \u201cgone but not forgotten.\u201d\n\nSommer, a 24-year-old mother, was on a Norwegian Pearl cruise from Miami to Cozumel when she went overboard Nov. 12. It is believed she went overboard from a height of more than 80 feet above the water while the cruise ship was underway, according to the Coast Guard, which responded to search for her.\n\nThat search was suspended a couple of days later after Coast Guard crews covered 1,378 square nautical miles looking for Sommer. The FBI continues to investigate Sommer\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI felt like they were going to find her because I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Evelyn Irvin, a neighbor who frequently baby-sat for Sommer.\n\nIrvin, her boyfriend Trevor Brown and her sister Rebecca Irvin lit lanterns to release Sunday night for Sommer. They described her as being like an older sister to them and friendly to everyone she met.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the kind of people where you only have to know them for a week and you\u2019re (considered) family,\u201d Rebecca Irvin said of Sommer and her husband. \u201cEveryone who knew her loved her.\u201d\n\nShe added that Sommer and her husband were married on the same cruise the year before and that they were celebrating their first anniversary.\n\nReach Melissa Boughton at 843-937-5594 or at Twitter.com/mboughtonPC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Memorial service held on James Island for Charleston woman who went overboard on cruise, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Coast Guard,Kaylyn Rose Sommer,memorial service,Norwegian Cruise Lines", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Family and friends of a missing Charleston woman who went overboard during a cruise off the coast of Cuba earlier this month gathered Sunday for a memorial service in her honor.", "title": "Memorial service held on James Island for Charleston woman who went overboard on cruise", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151129/151129309/memorial-service-held-on-james-island-for-charleston-woman-who-went-overboard-on-cruise", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151129/PC16/151129309/AR/0/AR-151129309.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151129/PC16/151129309/AR/0/AR-151129309.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Family and friends of a missing Charleston woman who went overboard during a cruise off the coast of Cuba earlier this month gathered Sunday for a memorial service in her honor.", "title": "Memorial service held on James Island for Charleston woman who went overboard on cruise", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151129/PC16/151129309/AR/0/AR-151129309.jpg?201511292034", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151129309}}, "keywords": "Memorial service held on James Island for Charleston woman who went overboard on cruise , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Coast Guard,Kaylyn Rose Sommer,memorial service,Norwegian Cruise Lines", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T20:24:35Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-29T20:34:00Z", "author": "Melissa Boughton"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Family and friends of a missing Charleston woman who went overboard during a cruise off the coast of Cuba earlier this month gathered Sunday for a memorial service in her honor."}, "article_summary": "Family and friends of a missing Charleston woman who went overboard during a cruise off the coast of Cuba earlier this month gathered Sunday for a memorial service in her honor.\nThe Irvins were neighbors of Sommer, who went overboard earlier this month during a cruise.\nIrvin, her boyfriend Trevor Brown and her sister Rebecca Irvin lit lanterns to release Sunday night for Sommer.\nTrevor Brown and sisters Rebecca and Evelyn Irvin lit lanterns Sunday night for Kaylyn Rose Sommer at a memorial on James Island.\nIt ended with the quote, \u201cgone but not forgotten.\u201dSommer, a 24-year-old mother, was on a Norwegian Pearl cruise from Miami to Cozumel when she went overboard Nov. 12."}
