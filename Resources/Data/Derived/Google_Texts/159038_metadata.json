She does not believe that while we are working towards comprehensive immigration reform we should make people wait, like the families you are talking about. Which is why she thinks it\u2019s so important to extend the Affordable Care Act to people who are living and working here, regardless of immigration status, regardless of citizenship status\u2026\u201d\n\nOn his Twitter feed, illegal immigration foe and GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of misplaced priorities.\n\nDo you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2016\n\nSeparately, in a campaign debate in Miami sponsored by Univision and the Washington Post, Hillary Clinton expressed her opposition to deporting children or family members who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Obamacare premiums have increased about nine percent over 2015, although in some states they jumped as much as 40 percent, The Hill reported. Depending on their income, many consumers are eligible for taxpayer subsidies that partially defray the premium costs, however.\n\nSo Hillary is now offering Obamacare to illegals, 2b paid by voters with kids in schools, ailing parents etc. Unwise https://t.co/9cE7jO5ax5 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 19, 2016\n\n\u201cAmerican taxpayers pay roughly $5,000 per year for each person enrolled in Obamacare. So the addition of only 10 million current illegals to Obamacare would cost taxpayers at least $50 billion per year, or $500 billion over 10 years\u2026,\u201d Breitbart News claimed.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d broken promise, Obamacare was supposed to result in a typical family saving about $2,500 a year in health insurance premiums. Instead, many consumers have been hit with higher co-pays and deductibles, plus limited provider networks in addition to significant premium hikes.\n\nIn a Columbus, Ohio, town hall earlier this month that was nationally televised by CNN, an Obama voter and Clinton leaner told the former Secretary of State that her health insurance premiums had skyrocketed under Obamacare. \u201cI would like to vote Democratic,\u201d the questioner said. \u201c[B]ut it\u2019s cost me a lot of money. And I\u2019m wondering if Democrats really realize how difficult it\u2019s been on working-class Americans to finance Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s answer, in part (see clip below), is that the woman should shop around more on the Healthcare.gov exchange for a better plan.\n\nReacting to the news that Obamacare enrollment has increased only 8.5 percent year over year, respected healthcare analyst Robert Laszewski observed that \u201cObamacare has been very helpful to those on Medicaid and those with the lowest incomes on the insurance exchanges. But if you are solidly in the working and middle-class in this country individual health insurance on the state and federal exchanges is anything but affordable.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton: \"My mom thinks it's important to extend obamacare to illegal aliens.\" [Video] I just found\u2026 https://t.co/OHZMJ9Cv9V \u2014 Patty Perrin (@PattyPerrin) March 20, 2016\n\nIllegal immigrants may already be receiving Obamacare benefits. \u201c[A] bombshell report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee found that the healthcare law doled out an estimated $750 million in taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies to some 500,000 people of unverified immigration status,\u201d U.S. Congresswoman Diane Black wrote at TheBlaze website, adding that Obama administration opposed a bill passe dwith bipartisan support in the Hosue that would require both income and citizenship status prior to Obamcare subsidy disbursements.\n\nIn the January 2016 Democratic debate from South Carolina, Hillary Clinton and rival Bernie Sanders sparred over healthcare reform, i.e., Hillarycare vs. Berniecare, with the Vermont Senator pushing for a Medicare-for-all plan that he claims will be far more cost effective than the status quo.\n\nSanders, who voted for the Obamacare one-size-fits-all law, claimed that he improved upon it while it was working its way through Congress (and ultimately passed on a straight party-line vote), but that he has long been a supporter of universal healthcare, which FDR and Truman also favored. He acknowledged that even with Obamacare, 29 million Americans still lack healthcare and that medical costs are still through the roof.\n\nDo you agree with Hillary Clinton via her daughter Chelsea that illegal immigrants should become eligible for Obamacare?\n\n[Photo by John Locher/AP]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton, the presidential front-runner for the Democrats, is strongly in favor of extending Obamacare health insurance coverage to illegal immigrants,", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Hillary Clinton, the presidential front-runner for the Democrats, is strongly in favor of extending Obamacare health insurance coverage to illegal immigrants,", "title": "Chelsea Clinton Says Hillary Clinton Wants Obamacare For Illegal Aliens [Video]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2907196/chelsea-clinton-says-hillary-clinton-wants-obamacare-for-illegal-aliens-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chelsea-Clinton-AP_828920763305-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-20T12:02:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T14:44:11+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chelsea-Clinton-AP_828920763305-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-03-20T12:02:02+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,chelsea clinton,hillary clinton,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chelsea-Clinton-AP_828920763305-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hillary Clinton, the presidential front-runner for the Democrats, is strongly in favor of extending Obamacare health insurance coverage to illegal immigrants,"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7686\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton, the presidential front-runner for the Democrats, is strongly in favor of extending Obamacare health insurance coverage to illegal immigrants, daughter Chelsea Clinton has revealed.\nDo you agree with Hillary Clinton via her daughter Chelsea that illegal immigrants should become eligible for Obamacare?\nDuring a recent campaign event in Salt Lake City, Chelsea responded (see video below) to a Hillary Clinton supporter\u2019s inquiry about expanding Obamacare, a.k.a.\nDo you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants?\nSo Hillary is now offering Obamacare to illegals, 2b paid by voters with kids in schools, ailing parents etc."}
