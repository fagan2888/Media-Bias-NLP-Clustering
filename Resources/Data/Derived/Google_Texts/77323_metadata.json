She had waived extradition in Florida before being returned to Kansas.\n\nMcLinn is to make her first appearance in Douglas County District Court before Judge Paula Martin on Monday afternoon.\n\nShe is being represented by defense attorney Carl Cornwell.\n\nDouglas County authorities have said they believe McLinn acted alone in Sasko\u2019s death.\n\nThe case has attracted widespread media attention, including from outlets as far away as New York City.\n\nMcLinn was reported missing from the Lawrence home she shared with the 52-year-old Sasko, her former boss, on Jan. 17. Both she and Sasko had last been seen Jan. 14.\n\nLawrence police officers were asked to check on McLinn by family members in Topeka on Jan. 17. Police went to Sasko\u2019s home at 2905 W. 26th in Lawrence late that night. Officers weren\u2019t able to locate McLinn or Sasko\u2019s Nissan Altima at the residence, but they did find Sasko\u2019s body inside the home.\n\nSasko was reported to have died as a result of \u201ctraumatic injuries\u201d and that a \u201cbladed object\u201d had been used to kill him.\n\nDouglas County officials later said Sasko was unconscious at the time he was killed.\n\nAn intense search for McLinn, which lasted a week, came to an end the night of Jan. 25 when she was found sleeping in the back seat of Sasko\u2019s car in the visitor\u2019s center parking lot at Everglades National Park in south Florida.\n\nDuring the weeklong search, McLinn wasn\u2019t listed in public reports as a suspect in Sasko\u2019s death. However, after she was taken into custody and questioned by Douglas County authorities, she was charged with first-degree murder.\n\nOfficials have said McLinn was in possession of two knives, two guns, an ax and hashish at the time she was taken into custody in Everglades National Park. Officials said a knife believed to have been used to kill Sasko was recovered.\n\nMcLinn was in federal and later state custody in Florida from late the night of Jan. 25 until she waived extradition Thursday in Miami-Dade court, allowing her to be returned to Kansas.\n\nMcLinn, a 2012 graduate of Topeka High School, had worked for Sasko at one of the three CiCi\u2019s pizza restaurants he owned. Two of the restaurants were in Topeka and the other in Lawrence.\n\nDouglas County authorities haven\u2019t stated the nature of the relationship between Sasko and McLinn. However, Sasko\u2019s relatives have said he let McLinn move into his Lawrence home in 2012 while she was having personal problems.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Phil Anderson", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Sarah Gonzalez-McLinn, the 19-year-old Topeka native who has been charged with first-degree murder in the brutal death of local pizza restaurant owner Hal Sasko in January at his Lawrence home, was booked into the Douglas County Jail on Saturday morning.", "title": "McLinn held on $1 million bond in Lawrence", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-02-01/mclinn-held-1-million-bond-lawrence", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/mclinn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Sarah Gonzalez-McLinn, the 19-year-old Topeka native who has been charged with first-degree murder in the brutal death of local pizza restaurant owner Hal Sasko in January at his Lawrence home, was booked into the Douglas County Jail on Saturday morning.Douglas County officials in Lawrence said McLinn\u2019s bond had been set at $1 million.McLinn was booked into jail around 9 a.m., jail officials said.
