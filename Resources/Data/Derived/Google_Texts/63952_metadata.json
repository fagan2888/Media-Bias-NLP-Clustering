I think that people have been cut enough.\u201d\n\nBoth thoughts come from Jim Justice, billionaire coal and farming executive, owner of The Greenbrier resort and a Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nThe ideas are also, alas, in conflict, a point Justice recognizes.\n\n\u201cThe same question just reverberates over and over and over,\u201d Justice said in an interview this week. \u201cWhere\u2019s the money going to come from? Where\u2019s the money going to come from? And, really and truly, if all we keep doing is coming to the same place, the money isn\u2019t going to come.\u201d\n\nJustice, for now, doesn\u2019t have answers to that reverberating question. He said he\u2019ll lay out a jobs plan in about 60 days.\n\nJustice\u2019s campaign, to date, is about selling himself as a man of big ideas, a guy who knows how to get things done and bring new revenue to West Virginia.\n\nThe source of that revenue is still to be announced, but Justice stresses his successes in the past.\n\nHe brought The Greenbrier out of bankruptcy.\n\nHe\u2019s won nearly 1,000 games coaching high school basketball, while never cutting a player.\n\nHe\u2019s a seven-time national corn-growing champion and is among the biggest farm owners east of the Mississippi.\n\n\u201cHow does that happen? It doesn\u2019t happen just falling off a log guys, and sure, I have done it, and I do have big ideas,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWhether you believe it or don\u2019t believe it, I can do it, I\u2019ve got the ideas and I\u2019ve got the passion and I\u2019ve got the ability to lead the people.\u201d\n\nJustice\u2019s campaign website contains no discussion of issues at all.\n\nUntil he announced his run for governor last spring, no one was even sure what party he belonged to. He said he\u2019s been thinking about running for office for years and that no one from the state Democratic Party approached him to run.\n\nHis campaign has stressed his personal biography over policy discussions.\n\nThere is, for instance, an agriculture answer that can help provide big jobs in West Virginia, Justice said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have an ag guy that understands it, and then recruits ag input and here we go,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy can\u2019t West Virginia be known for some sort of crop or harvest, Justice asked, like Napa Valley is for wine? Why can\u2019t we grow the world\u2019s greatest tomatoes?\n\n\u201cI mean, it sounds bizarre, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the kind of thinker I am, guys. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nAnother personal asset Justice said he would bring to the Governor\u2019s Office \u2014 anybody will take his call.\n\n\u201cIf Jim Justice calls them up and says, \u2018Charlie, it\u2019s Jim, and Charlie, I want to tell you about West Virginia,\u2019\u201d Justice said. \u201cWell, Charlie will listen to Jim. Now, he may not do what Jim says to, but he\u2019ll at least give us a fair shake.\u201d\n\nJustice\u2019s most recent campaign ad echoes his call for an \u201cag guy\u201d in office, but in the other industry he specializes in.\n\n\u201cWe need a coal man running this state,\u201d the ad says.\n\nHe said he sees a \u201creal possibility\u201d of coal jobs coming back in large numbers, despite recent industry forecasts that a coal boom is not around the corner.\n\n\u201cAnybody would be a fool to not think that coal is really struggling and we may never see coal in the presence that we saw in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to just lay down and say it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nJustice denies the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s documentation that would give one concern, and I don\u2019t think you should ignore that,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I think there\u2019s an awful lot of research that still should be done.\n\n\u201cI surely wouldn\u2019t sit here and say I am a believer in global warming, but I wouldn\u2019t sit here and say that I am not concerned.\u201d\n\nBut he also stressed the importance of a diversified economy and said he\u2019d support President Barack Obama\u2019s POWER Plus plan, a multi-billion dollar proposal \u2014 with little support in the Republican-led Congress \u2014 to help coalfield communities move toward new industries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say take the money,\u201d Justice said, before hedging. \u201cDoes that mean that we transition away from coal \u2014 you know, we say we\u2019re going to move away from coal and everything? I think that\u2019s a real mistake.\u201d\n\nAsked about Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which has brought health coverage to more than 170,000 West Virginians, Justice gave hesitant approval.\n\n\u201cWe have improved the lives of a whole lot of people in West Virginia, we really have, and, from that standpoint, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the things that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve got to see and we\u2019ve got to give them a fair chance to play out.\u201d\n\nJustice pushed back against recent stories about his unpaid tax liabilities, payment disputes that brought on lawsuits and mine safety and reclamation fines.\n\nThe stories are fair, Justice said, but fail to tell the full story. It would be far easier, he said, to simply declare bankruptcy and walk away from his less-profitable companies than to pay his obligations.\n\n\u201cJust bankrupt those companies and life\u2019s good and you just move on,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that have been an easy fix? That isn\u2019t what we did. That\u2019s what a lot of people are doing.\u201d\n\nHis recent tax debts in McDowell and Wyoming counties, which have been almost entirely paid off, were carried over from the Russian coal company Mechel. Justice had bought the mines from Mechel early this year, after selling the mines to the Russian company in 2009.\n\nHe used colorful metaphors to explain the debts.\n\nWhile some people may change socks (or their focus) once or twice a day, Justice has dozens of companies and has to change his socks (his focus) constantly throughout the day.\n\nSometimes, he said, his socks will get mixed up or a business will fall behind on a debt.\n\n\u201cIf you focus on that fact that \u2014 \u2018Did you see Justice? He had a green sock and a blue sock. Doesn\u2019t he have any sense at all?\u2019 \u201d Justice said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes, and I\u2019m the guy who can handle 500 pairs of socks in a day.\u201d\n\nTo combat the negative press about him, Justice brought with him, to the interview, a large framed photograph.\n\nThe picture, about three feet across and two feet high, hangs in Justice\u2019s office. It shows him wading through a Raleigh County creek, fly rod in hand, mossy rocks and blooming rhododendrons covering the banks.\n\nJustice said he donated the land to the Nature Conservancy, to keep it from being mined.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me guys. That\u2019s me right there. That\u2019s me in West Virginia. Me caring about the environment,\u201d Justice said. How can that be the same guy who\u2019s fallen behind on environmental reclamation efforts and mine safety violations, Justice asked. \u201cHow could that guy, if he cared and he did that, be the guy that\u2019s sometimes portrayed in not a very good way?\u201d\n\nReach David Gutman at david.gutman@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5119 or follow @davidlgutman on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Justice stresses big ideas over specifics in campaign", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151104/GZ01/151109764/AR/0/AR-151109764.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20151104/GZ01/151109764/1419", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151104/GZ01/151109764/AR/0/AR-151109764.jpg"}, "title": "Justice stresses big ideas over specifics in campaign", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 466107013410205}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9f7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf Jim Justice calls them up and says, \u2018Charlie, it\u2019s Jim, and Charlie, I want to tell you about West Virginia,\u2019\u201d Justice said.\nIt doesn\u2019t happen just falling off a log guys, and sure, I have done it, and I do have big ideas,\u201d Justice said.\nThere is, for instance, an agriculture answer that can help provide big jobs in West Virginia, Justice said.\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate and Greenbrier resort owner Jim Justice speaks with editors in the Charleston Gazette-Mail newsroom on Tuesday.\nJustice\u2019s campaign, to date, is about selling himself as a man of big ideas, a guy who knows how to get things done and bring new revenue to West Virginia."}
