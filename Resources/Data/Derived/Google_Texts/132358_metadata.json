As our nation debates the future of the ACA and health care in general, Free and Charitable Clinics remain an important part of the safety net and continue to provide affordable care to those who need it most.\u201d\n\n\u200bThe April 9 clinic will be held at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas with patient appointment hours from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\n\nThe Dallas C.A.R.E. Clinic is being held during the month of April, which is also National Minority Health Month. The theme for 2016 is \u201cAccelerating Health Equity for the Nation\u201d with the goal of raising awareness of the health disparities that continue to affect racial and ethnic minorities and accelerating health equity, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Minority Health.\n\n\u201cAddressing health equity is an important issue for our organization and our clinics across the country who are providing much needed care to a wide variety of ethnicities,\u201d Lamoureux said. \u201cThe Dallas C.A.R.E. Clinic event will provide culturally compassionate and competent health care while addressing the needs of all racial and ethnic minorities, from having translators on the appointment scheduling phone line and at the clinic event to providing specific and important information and resources to participants.\u201d\n\n\u200bBoth medical and non-medical volunteers are needed to participate in the Dallas C.A.R.E. Clinic. Information on the event and how to register is available here.\n\nThe C.A.R.E. Clinics are paid for through sponsorships and individual donations.\n\nThe NAFC is encouraging donations to help make this and future C.A.R.E. Clinics possible; donations can be made here.\n\n(\u00a92016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.
