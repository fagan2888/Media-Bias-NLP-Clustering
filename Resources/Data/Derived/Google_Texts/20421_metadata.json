Which is why it\u2019s not surprising to hear the states with more abortion restrictions also report more maternal deaths.\n\nSince 2011, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Kansas have implemented 14 abortion restrictions \u2014 the most of any other state. Arkansas and Indiana were tied for the second-most restriction, while Florida, Arizona, and Alabama were tied for third. And out of all 50 states, it was the ones with more restrictions that also had higher, well, everything: maternal deaths, uninsured rates, infant and child death rates, teen drug and alcohol abuse, as well as lower preventive care and cancer screening rates.\n\n\"This report exposes the flimsy claims of politicians who have been shutting down women's health care providers under the patently false pretext of protecting women's health,\" Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told the NY Daily News. \"It clearly demonstrates how women and families have suffered as politicians put their ideological agenda before the real needs of their constituents.\"\n\nDespite these findings, states continue to pass laws that don\u2019t just shame women for considering an abortion, but it makes access to these services downright difficult, even impossible. Though the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act was introduced to Congress in November 2013, it\u2019s only had its first hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in July, the Daily News reported.\n\nAnd despite these findings, that forcing reproductive ideals onto women ultimately hurts their and their baby\u2019s health, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday that Texas could start to enforce abortion restrictions, which will ultimately cause a majority of the state\u2019s facilities to shut down. I guess what they say is true: Everything is bigger in Texas, including their ignorance on the effects of such laws.\n\nThese restrictions are categorized as a health care crisis \u2014 and when you consider what open access to both services and education surrounding women\u2019s and reproductive health, it\u2019s categorized rightfully so. Unfortunately, laws like this are only projected to get worse. ThinkProgress reported it\u2019s referred to as the \u201cTargeted Regulation of Abortion Providers,\u201d or TRAP, and \u201cthese laws have particularly taken root in Southern states, where an estimated 8.6 million women of reproductive age may soon be left with just 12 abortion clinics across five states.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, when women are restricted access to reproductive services, like abortions and birth control, they\u2019re twice as likely to get an abortion by any means necessary, hence a rise in maternal deaths. A study published in Reviews in Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers found every year, across the world, 42 million women with unintended pregnancies choose abortion with nearly half of those procedures \u2014 that\u2019s 20 million \u2014 being unsafe. Researchers cited the World Health Organization when they deemed unsafe abortion as the easiest way to prevent maternal mortality.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? \u201cPreventing unintended pregnancy, providing better access to health care, and liberalizing abortion laws to allow services to be openly provided can reduce the rate of abortion-related morbidity and mortality,\u201d researchers suggested.\n\nAlso, more female-to-female support systems and intervention programs, please.\n\nSource: Burns B, Dennis A, Douglas-Durham E.
