Who would leave this here?\u201d Militello told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m a big Yankee fan. What are the chances of this happening?\u201d\n\nDrew Weber had dined at the restaurant earlier, it\u2019s one of his favorite spots. He\u2019s a New York businessman and also owns the Lowell Spinners, a thriving Red Sox Class A minor league team in Massachusetts.\n\nBig league teams often reward executives throughout their organization with World Series rings. The Red Sox haven\u2019t put a value on these pieces of jewelry \u2014 the rings they presented for winning the 2004 crown were worth about $30,000.\n\nWeber said this was the first time he\u2019d worn the ring outside.\n\n\u201cI went looking around my apartment and started having palpitations. Sweat was pouring off my forehead,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI\u2019m looking at my finger and it\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nHoping against hope, Weber called Luke\u2019s after midnight. Militello answered the phone and said, yep, he had the ring.\n\n\u201cBut this being Yankees-Red Sox, I started razzing him. I told him he wasn\u2019t getting it so easily. I was playing with him, a lot,\u201d Militello said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lost Red Sox title ring returned by Yankees fan", "author": "Ben Walker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lost Red Sox title ring returned by Yankees fan", "title": "Lost Red Sox title ring returned by Yankees fan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/27/lost_red_sox_title_ring_returned_by_yankees_fan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/red-sox-tale-of-the-ring-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lost Red Sox title ring returned by Yankees fan", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/red-sox-tale-of-the-ring-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Lost Red Sox title ring returned by Yankees fan", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Lost Red Sox title ring returned by Yankees fan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A lost Red Sox World Series ring is back on the finger of its owner, thanks to a nifty pickup by an ardent New York Yankees fan.\nThe Red Sox haven\u2019t put a value on these pieces of jewelry \u2014 the rings they presented for winning the 2004 crown were worth about $30,000.\nHe\u2019s a New York businessman and also owns the Lowell Spinners, a thriving Red Sox Class A minor league team in Massachusetts.\nWho would leave this here?\u201d Militello told The Associated Press.\nIt was the real thing, with diamonds and sapphires and rubies, set in 14-carat white gold, with the Red Sox emblem, a Boston Strong logo and an image of the team\u2019s bearded ballplayers."}
