They may not be tapping their most valuable resource: their network.\n\nSeven in 10 human resource professionals say that employee referrals are their best resource for finding candidates \u2013 but only 7 percent of candidates consider them a top source, according to a new report from the research firm Future Workplace and the career networking site Beyond.com.\n\nRelated: The 25 Best Jobs in America\n\nRich Milgram, the founder of Beyond, recommends that candidates expand their network by attending industry conferences, meeting former colleagues for lunch, and making connections online. \u201cA strong application coupled with quality referrals will provide job seekers with an advantage in the hiring process,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cYou should constantly be exploring new ways to nurture and expand your referral network, and it may be even easier than you think.\u201d\n\nBuilding your network beyond your current company is key, since it\u2019s easier to land a job externally than to make a move within your organization. The survey found that more than 40 percent of job seekers found it difficult to make a lateral move at their current company, but most were optimistic about the broader job market.\n\nWorkers may also see leaving as the best means of climbing the career ladder. Only half of those surveyed said that their employer had helped them advance their career. HR managers may agree with that assessment. More than half of them said they could enhance their employee experience this year by investing more in training and development.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The data has shown a steadily improving job market for a few years now, but some job h", "title": "The Best Way to Find a Job Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/19/Best-Way-Find-Job-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04192016_Jobs_Hiring.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/19/Best-Way-Find-Job-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04192016_Jobs_Hiring.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The data has shown a steadily improving job market for a few years now, but some job h", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The survey found that more than 40 percent of job seekers found it difficult to make a lateral move at their current company, but most were optimistic about the broader job market.\n\u201cA strong application coupled with quality referrals will provide job seekers with an advantage in the hiring process,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe data has shown a steadily improving job market for a few years now, but some job hunters are still reporting trouble finding a new gig.\nWorkers may also see leaving as the best means of climbing the career ladder.\nRelated: The 25 Best Jobs in AmericaRich Milgram, the founder of Beyond, recommends that candidates expand their network by attending industry conferences, meeting former colleagues for lunch, and making connections online."}
