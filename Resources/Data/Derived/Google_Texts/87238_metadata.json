Yet Kimmel\u2019s monologue blistered ObamaCare in a way that even Leno might have avoided.\n\nKimmel began by explaining why ObamaCare needs plenty of young, healthy enrollees to make the math work, noting that so far youthful Americans aren\u2019t flocking to sign up. Next, he trotted out a mock Obama PSA featuring an older couple thanking ignorant youngsters for footing their medical bills.\n\nALEX: I take blood pressure medication. MARTHA: And Levitra. ALEX: Yes. And Martha\u2019s got beta blockers and something for her osteoporosis. And it\u2019s not cheap. MARTHA: But fortunately we don\u2019t have to pay for it. ALEX: No, you do. MARTHA: That\u2019s right. You young people are paying for our drugs and our doctors. ALEX: Not to mention our Social Security and our Medicare when we retire to Boca. And you know why? MARTHA: Because you don\u2019t vote. ALEX: And we do. MARTHA: That\u2019s right. Hope you enjoy that Burning Guy festival. ALEX: Come on, Martha, let\u2019s go find that Levitra. MARTHA: Oh, Alex! ANNOUNCER: The Affordable Care Act. Next time, maybe pick up a newspaper.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not entirely the fault of young Americans that they didn\u2019t realize what ObamaCare had in store for them. The media did all it could to downplay bad news about the reform while failing to investigate its claims before the critical 2012 presidential elections.\n\nNow, comedians like Kimmel are picking up the slack at long last.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jimmy Kimmel tore into both ObamaCare and young adults who voted for a politician whose signature policy takes direct aim at their wallets.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel tore into both ObamaCare and young adults who voted for a politician whose signature policy takes direct aim at their wallets.", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Young People Who Blindly Supported ObamaCare - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/01/14/kimmel/kimmel.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/01/15/kimmel-crushes-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy Kimmel tore into both ObamaCare and young adults who voted for a politician whose signature policy takes direct aim at their wallets.", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Young People Who Blindly Supported ObamaCare - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/01/14/kimmel/kimmel.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "published_time": "2014-01-15T09:34:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee23\"", "article_summary": "MARTHA: That\u2019s right.\nKimmel crushed the disastrous ObamaCare rollout, the logic behind its funding and 20-somethings who didn\u2019t study how it would impact them during Tuesday\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel Live.\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not entirely the fault of young Americans that they didn\u2019t realize what ObamaCare had in store for them.\nKimmel began by explaining why ObamaCare needs plenty of young, healthy enrollees to make the math work, noting that so far youthful Americans aren\u2019t flocking to sign up.\nYet Kimmel\u2019s monologue blistered ObamaCare in a way that even Leno might have avoided."}
