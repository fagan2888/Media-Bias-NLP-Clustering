Jackson represents Ward 3, on the East Side where I live. He has been plagued by scandal and bad choices for years, and barely won his last election against write-in candidate Marcus Mitchell.\n\nI reluctantly voted for Jackson over Mitchell because of Mitchell\u2019s past association with US Senator Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania. Mitchell claimed the mantle of progressive, but I couldn\u2019t trust him, and there was little time to properly vet him. What little I knew about Mitchell didn\u2019t thrill me. In 2005, Mitchell, then a registered Republican, was Senator Rick Santorum\u2019s Director of Community & Economic Development in Pennsylvania. Santorum represents everything I find ugly in a politician.\n\nSantorum once compared Obamacare to apartheid in a tribute speech to Nelson Mandela. Santorum is anti LGBTQ rights at best, a raving homophobe at worst. He\u2019s not only anti-abortion, he\u2019s against your right to use contraception. He supported the privatization of Social Security. He called climate change \u201cjunk science.\u201d\n\nDid I allow my completely reasonable disdain for Santorum to cloud my judgement regarding Mitchell? Perhaps. But given what I knew about Santorum and what little I knew about Mitchell, I made the best choice I could.\n\nI voted for Jackson. I don\u2019t regret making what I consider to be the best choice in a bad situation\u2026\n\n\u2026but it\u2019s time for Jackson to resign.\n\nJackson has done some good things as a city councilor in the last year, including fighting against fiscally irresponsible Tax Stabilization Agreements (TSAs). Some of the most recent TSAs, supported by Mayor Elorza, would have functioned as little more than cash giveaways to connected realtors.\n\nThis is all for the good, but I think voters in Ward 3 could do a lot better than Jackson in an open election.\n\nBuddy Cianci is dead, and the culture of casual corruption he represents should have died with him. Jackson backed Cianci when the former Mayor made his quixotic bid at a return to power. I found Jackson\u2019s support of Cianci embarrassing.\n\nWard 3 could vote for a candidate that both looks after our interests and doesn\u2019t play fast and loose with his campaign cash. We could vote for a candidate that has not been accused of embezzlement. We could vote for a candidate that does not embarrass us but instead represents us.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Jackson to resign.\n\nVN:R_U [1.9.20_1166]\n\nRating: 10.0/10 (2 votes cast)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0", "copyright": "Copyright (c) May 2016", "author": "Steve Ahlquist", "revised": "Thursday, May 12th, 2016, 9:26 pm", "robots": "index,follow", "template": "Hybrid News 0.4", "keywords": "Campaign 2016, Elections, Featured, Opinion, Politics, Providence, Rhode Island, buddy cianci, Kevin Jackson, Marcus Mitchell, Rick Santorum, tax stabilization agreements, TSAs", "description": "Ward 3 could vote for a candidate that both looks after our interests and doesn\u2019t play fast and loose with his campaign cash.
