If agencies had stronger oversight over their telework programs, they could save money by weeding out the workers who aren\u2019t working productively \u2013 money that could be far better spent.\n\nZinser said senior managers have no control over whether employees are actually working the hours they\u2019re claiming on their time cards.\n\nThe agency allows about half its workers \u2013 or 4,000 employees \u2013 to work full-time from their homes. The practice saves the government about $34 million a year in office space leases, the agency says \u2013 though there\u2019s the potential for tremendous waste if workers aren\u2019t actually producing anything.\n\nAn earlier report revealed that at least 19 paralegals at the Patent and Trademark Office were paid $60,000 to $80,000 a year to visit Facebook, online shop and watch TV \u2013 costing taxpayers about $5.1 million over the last four years.\n\nRelated: Widespread Abuse of Government Charge Cards\n\nThat same report suggested agency managers looked the other way while this occurred and allowed employees to bill the hours under \u201cother time\u201d while those same employees collected thousands in performance bonuses.\n\nAt the time, Colleen M. Kelley of the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) defended the workers, saying they didn\u2019t have enough work to do \u2013 which is why they were surfing the web. \u201cThese frontline employees wanted to work. They let managers know that and ultimately some of them went to the Inspector General about the lack of work, which instigated this report,\u201d Kelley said in a statement.\n\nYet lawmakers aren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cTo say I am extremely disappointed that the patent office failed to manage its telework program would be an understatement,\u201d Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) said during the hearing. He and other lawmakers have pressed federal prosecutors to open a probe into alleged fraudulent recordkeeping by the agency, The Associated Press noted.\n\nRelated: Taxpayers Treat DHS Workers to $30K of Starbucks\n\nHe went on to say that if the agency doesn\u2019t exercise better oversight over its program, other federal telework programs could be jeopardized.\n\nOther agencies have also struggled with oversight issues. Earlier this year, a Federal Communications Commission worker was busted for spending a significant portion of his workweek watching porn because, as he said, he didn\u2019t have enough work to do. Similar incidents have occurred at the Environmental Protection Agency, where agency employees were paid for skipping work while managers looked the other way.\n\nThe auditors have all recommended that agency officials develop a more effective oversight strategy in order to curb misconduct. It\u2019s unclear, for now, if any of the agencies have done so.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For years federal auditors have called attention to the government\u2019s widespread proble", "title": "Federal Workers Goof Off, Get Paid When They Don\u2019t Have Enough to Do", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/19/Federal-Workers-Goof-Get-Paid-When-They-Don-t-Have-Enough-Do", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02242014_Telecommuting_Working_From_Home.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/19/Federal-Workers-Goof-Get-Paid-When-They-Don-t-Have-Enough-Do", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02242014_Telecommuting_Working_From_Home.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For years federal auditors have called attention to the government\u2019s widespread proble", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "WHY THIS MATTERSThe federal government is spending millions of tax dollars a year to pay workers who aren\u2019t doing their jobs.\nSimilar incidents have occurred at the Environmental Protection Agency, where agency employees were paid for skipping work while managers looked the other way.\nThe agency allows about half its workers \u2013 or 4,000 employees \u2013 to work full-time from their homes.\nFor years federal auditors have called attention to the government\u2019s widespread problem of employees abusing their work from home privileges, known as telework.\nRelated: Taxpayers Treat DHS Workers to $30K of StarbucksHe went on to say that if the agency doesn\u2019t exercise better oversight over its program, other federal telework programs could be jeopardized."}
