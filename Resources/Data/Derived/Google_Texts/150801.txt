Skip Bondur has been on top of his big yellow school bus for one week hoping to collect thousands of toys for children all around Bay County.

Sunday, one state leader stopped by to help the cause.

State Representative Matt Gaetz came with armfuls of toys to donate for the Stuff the Bus toy drive.

Gaetz said he wanted to help Bondur in hopes of providing a special holiday season for many families in the area.

"About 5,700 toys have been donated already. We hope to about double that by the end of the day," Gaetz said. "This is going to be the difference for a lot of families who might be in need, and just might need that extra little bit of reason to be excited and hopeful for the new year."

Bondur said they hope to collect about 10,000 toys by the end of the drive this Wednesday.
