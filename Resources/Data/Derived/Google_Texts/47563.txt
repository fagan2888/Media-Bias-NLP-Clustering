Today’s observance of National Youth HIV & AIDS Awareness Day (#NYHAAD ) provides our nation with an opportunity to engage young people (and adults) in conversation about the epidemic’s impact on youth. These conversations include sharing stories and facts about the epidemic, and can involve listening to young people and sharing tools for action. This year’s theme is “Engaging Youth Voices in the Response to HIV & AIDS.” We at AIDS.gov hope you will use these digital resources for #NYHAAD and beyond to engage with youth about HIV.

Digital Storytelling: AIDS.gov recently released Positive Spin. This digital storytelling series features the personal experiences of five HIV-positive, gay black men who have successfully navigated the HIV care continuum, from diagnosis to treatment and, ultimately, to viral suppression. Achieving viral suppression helps those with HIV stay healthy, live longer, and dramatically reduce their chances of passing the virus to others.

Among these Positive Spin stories are: Uriah’s story of learning at age 17 that he is HIV-positive and Guy’s story of being a young, black gay man living with HIV. Watch their stories, share them on social media using #mypositivespin, and leave us your comments.
