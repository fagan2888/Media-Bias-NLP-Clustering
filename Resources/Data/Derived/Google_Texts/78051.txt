The daughter of reality star William Hayden, of the now-canceled reality show “Sons of Guns,” has been arrested on child abuse charges just two months after her father was arrested for child molestation.

Kristafor Ford, husband of Stephanie Hayden, is accused of hitting a 9-year-old with a leather belt on the child’s lower thigh, causing a large bruise. Mrs. Hayden was arrested Friday in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, and charged with principal to cruelty to a juvenile because she was allegedly in the room at the time of the incident, a local Fox affiliate reported.

Both Mr. Ford and Mrs. Hayden appeared on the canceled Discovery Channel series that followed employees at Red Jacket Firearms, which was owned by William Hayden before he was forced out of the company over molestation charges.

Mr. Hayden’s 12-year-old daughter accused him of repeatedly vaginally and orally raping her for the last two years. Stephanie Hayden originally came out in support of her father but later recanted her story and came to her sister’s defense, accusing her father of molesting her as well. He has not been charged in that case.

Separately, Mr. Hayden was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated rape and one count of indecent behavior with a juvenile, all separate victims. Two of the rape charges are in East Baton Rouge Parish, and the other rape charge and indecent behavior charge is out of Livingston Parish, the Fox affiliate reported.
