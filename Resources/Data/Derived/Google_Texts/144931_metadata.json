Baruch is within easy reach of Wall Street, Midtown, and the global headquarters of major companies and non-profit and cultural organizations, giving students unparalleled internship, career, and networking opportunities. The College\u2019s more than 17,000 students, who speak more than 110 languages and trace their heritage to over 160 countries, have been repeatedly named one of the most ethnically diverse student bodies in the United States.\n\nClandestine services (CS) is the department of the CIA that conducts covert operations in overseas affairs. Analysts are sent to collect information regarding government and social affairs of a country.\n\n\u201cThe National Clandestine Service (NCS) serves as the clandestine arm of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the national authority for the coordination, de-confliction, and evaluation of clandestine operations across the Intelligence Community of the United States,\u201d is noted on the CIA\u2019s website as a description for the service.\n\nUndergraduate Internship Program\n\nThe National Clandestine Service (NCS) Undergraduate Internship Program is designed to give a limited number of talented undergraduate students the opportunity to support the NCS mission. The NCS intern will be part of a unique world of important events and meaningful accomplishments.\n\nInterns work at our Headquarters facility in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area with knowledgeable professionals.\n\nStudent internship positions offer \u201csalaries competitive with the private sector and the same benefits as federal employees.\u201d (See: https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/clandestine-service/internship-programs.html ).\n\nA recruiter calling herself Leanne, who students describe as rather attractive lady, using a \u201ccover name\u201d to conceal her real name, introduced the other two representatives, Zack and Julie, who were also concealing their real names.\n\nLeanne began the presentation and clarified what the agency does and does not do. While flashing an award winning smile.\n\n\u201cShe was freaking hot\u201d, said one male student.\n\nThe National Clandestine service only focuses exclusively on what she called: \u201cforeign intelligence issues\u201d.\n\nWE DON\u2019T SET POLICY\n\n\u201cWe do not set policy or recommend changing policy, we only inform,\u201d Leanne said. She quickly brushed up the \u201cAbout Us\u201d portion of the organization, and handed the stage to the next representative.\n\nJulie began by noting the CIA\u2019s three main objectives: 1) Intelligence Collection, 2) Intelligence Analysis and 3) Covert Action.\n\n\u201cWe make an assessment based on intelligence analysis over the years and we inform the President,\u201d she said.\n\nNoting several locations worldwide, ranging from Iraq Analysis, Crime and Narcotics Analysis to Weapons Intelligence Proliferation & Arms Control, Julie also noted the Clandestine Service\u2019s most valuable careers.\n\nCAREERS ARE US!\n\nCareers in Medical Analyst, Science & Technology and Weapons Analyst, and Targeting Analyst, the analysis of distinguishing potential targets to determine military tactics and actions, were among the top three most valuable positions in the CIA.\n\nBENEFITS AND OTHER PERKS!\n\n\u201cThey pay is very competitive and the benefits are great\u201d, she said.\n\nA few Directorate of Intelligence (DI) products Julie mentioned included: The President\u2019s Daily Brief, a report that the president reads that includes information along the many fields the CIA covers, Worldwide Intelligence Review, and \u201cother assessments,\u201d and noted that a normal day at the CIA included tasking, drafting the articles, coordinating, reviewing, editing, meeting with the briefer and getting feedback.\n\nJulie then invited Zack onto the stage to speak more on what clandestine services are.\n\nHOW TO PROPERLY STEAL FROM A SAFE\n\nZack started off his portion of the session by saying, \u201cAllow me to give you all a context of where you will be.\u201d He then gave a \u201cmovie\u201d example of what the CIA does.\n\nHis example of the CIA through what many believe it to be was the stereotypical spy (007) who ropes down the tall building, cuts the glass, cracks the safe and then comes back to Washington with the secret documents.\n\nThe spy, in Zack\u2019s example, gives the documents to his boss, but his boss tells him that there is new intelligence and his documents are outdated.The spy now has to go back, break in again, get into the safe, and get the new documents.\n\n\u201cThis method is inefficient,\u201d Zack said.\n\nBUILDING RELATIONSHIPS \u2013 ONE AT A TIME!\n\nThe purpose of clandestine services is \u201cto collaborate with someone who actually has the combination to the safe, build a relationship with that person, and then recruit that person to commit espionage,\u201d Zack said.\n\nThe National Clandestine service\u2019s mission is to incorporate \u201cforeign intelligence, counter intelligence and covert action\u201d to effectively create reports so that government officials can make strategic decisions.\n\nJOB QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDE A COLLEGE DEGREE\n\nIn order to be considered, ages 21-25 must have earned a college degree and ages 26-35 must have earned advanced college degrees and have military experience.\n\nNO POT SMOKERS ALLOWED! BOOZE OK!\n\nLeanne then spoke about the Directive of Integrity, which consist of the CIA\u2019s policy to screen for drug involvement, criminal conduct, and other relations of that sort.\n\nAccording to the CIA\u2019s website, drug use within the past 12 months will exempt you from being accepted for the position.\n\nAn audience member asked, \u201cWhat do we tell our family?\u201d Referring to the extreme secrecy of the clandestine service and an analyst\u2019s inability to speak about his or her work.\n\nZack answered the question by saying that not all analysts are \u201ccovert\u201d, and that many CIA employees in the clandestine service speak openly about their operations in the office.\n\nInternship opportunities are available only to sophomore and freshmen. CIA internships span over two summers.\n\nCollege graduates are encouraged to apply regardless of \u201cpast experience\u201d for related fields with a preference for the applicant being fluent in a \u201cforeign language\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is a definite plus\u201d, she said.\n\nCIA CORE VALUES ?\n\nCore values guide our professional and personal actions.\n\nService. We put country first and Agency before self. Quiet patriotism is our hallmark. We are dedicated to the mission, and we pride ourselves on our extraordinary responsiveness to the needs of our customers.\n\nWe put country first and Agency before self.

You must excuse them they may have had other colleges in New York to visit.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty standard how the CIA recruits kids out of colleges. In this case it was done with the approval of the faculty and staff of the college\u201d, said one former CIA analyst now retired in Charlotte, N.C. \u201cKids today are very easy to recruit because they are so dumb today. They also have five figure and six figure student loans to pay off in most cases. I think the CIA would recruit more qualified students if they offer to forgive student loans and offer free healthcare, in addition to all the beer they want to drink\u201d, the former analyst said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "GroundReport", "description": "I received a email from an old friend indicating the CIA\u2019s Clandestine Service still continues to recruit students at Baruch College in New York.
