As a writer, I curiously scrolled through it. And while I scrolled, I began to notice something \u2013 there was only one screenplay listed about the experiences of people of color \u2013 \u201cComing to America.\u201d While the list included three films staring a black performer \u2014 \u201cComing to America,\u201d \u201cTrading Places,\u201d \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d \u2014 they all starred the same black performer. And the funniest film named \u2014 \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d \u2014 is one that few people of color have even seen, let alone would hail as the funniest ever written.\n\n\u201cFriday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka.\u201d \u201cHarlem Nights.\u201d \u201cBoomerang.\u201d \u201cHouse Party.\u201d \u201cUp in Smoke.\u201d None of these films made the cut on a list that includes highbrow humor and slapstick comedies alike. But \u201cAirplane!,\u201d \u201cCaddyshack\u201d and \u201cThe Hangover\u201d made the cut.\n\nYet, the WGA was not alone.\n\nJust two months prior, the Hollywood Reporter (THR) unveiled its list of \u201cHollywood\u2019s 100 Favorite TV Shows.\u201d THR\u2019s list was about the same, listing only one show about the experience of people of color \u2013 \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d \u2014 and three shows prominently featuring actors of color (\u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d). Yet these shows were buried down a list where the show that reigns supreme is \u2026 \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nOne show out of 100 \u2014 of all time.\n\n\u201cSanford & Son.\u201d \u201cGood Times.\u201d \u201cNew York Undercover.\u201d \u201cMartin.\u201d \u201cUgly Betty.\u201d \u201c227.\u201d \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show.\u201d \u201cRoc.\u201d \u201cResurrection Blvd.\u201d \u201cIn Living Color.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening?\u201d \u201cThe Jeffersons.\u201d I failed to understand the logic of how none of these shows made the list. And despite Bill Cosby\u2019s current image, how could \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d not have been acknowledged in some way?\n\nNot to be left out, the American Film Institute (AFI) proudly boasts its \u201c100 Greatest American Movies of All Time\u201d on its website. While films like \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cSnow White & the Seven Dwarfs\u201d and \u201cThe Third Man\u201d (which is ironically a British film) make the cut, great American films like \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Story\u201d somehow do not. \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d squeaked in at No. 99 \u2026 so there\u2019s that.\n\nAll of these lists got me thinking: How is it that films and television shows starring/about people of color are so rarely recognized as being good enough?\n\nThe lack of Oscar diversity over the last two years highlights the quantity-quality dilemma for diverse talent. That in order to increase the number of recognitions received, their works have to be deemed deserving enough to warrant that increase. So how can that be achieved in an industry with the quality standards represented above? Where, of 300 listed works, a mere six shows or films not solely about whites are deemed worthy enough to be considered among the best?\n\nThis reality demonstrates why, rather than focusing on the desired result \u2014increasing the number of recognitions bestowed on diverse filmmakers \u2014 it may be more helpful to focus on the process of how filmmakers of color get such little recognition to begin with.\n\nHillary Clinton recently caused much debate when she said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you change hearts\u2026I believe you change laws.\u201d What she said may not be popular, but it does accurately depict the harsh reality of racism. For example, if 75 percent of whites do not even know a single black person, and only 1 percent even have a black person in their lives that they would call a \u201cclose friend,\u201d how likely is it that their hearts will be changed?\n\nThis highlights the challenge of empathy that works against people of color in the industry. People of color have long struggled to be recognized as being people. Because if others cannot empathize with you, they will not respect you, consider you or even simply see you.\n\nSpike Lee eloquently addressed this in \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d in a scene between his character, Mookie, and Mookie\u2019s boss\u2019s son Pino (John Tuturro):\n\nMookie: \u201cPino, who\u2019s your favorite basketball player?\u201d Pino: \u201cMagic Johnson.\u201d Mookie: \u201cMovie star?\u201d Pino: \u201cEddie Murphy.\u201d Mookie: \u201cMovie star? Prince. You\u2019re a Prince fan\u2026Pino, all you ever talk about is \u2018n***a this and n***a that,\u2019 and all your favorite people are so-called n***as.\u201d Pino: \u201cIt\u2019s different. Magic, Eddie, Prince\u2026they\u2019re not n***ers. I mean, they\u2019re not black\u2026I mean\u2026let me explain myself. They\u2019re not really black. I mean, they\u2019re black, but they\u2019re not really black. They\u2019re more than black. It\u2019s different.\u201d Mookie: \u201cIt\u2019s different?\u201d Pino: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this mentality that allows black biopics, for example, into award show conversations. Actors of color are rarely celebrated, nor do black films realize \u201ccrossover\u201d box office success, unless the films focus on pop culture figures or subservient/victimized characters \u2014 films about entertainers, athletes, maids and non-rebellious slaves. In other words, films that are palatable to whites. Whites otherwise rarely watch character-driven films with, by or about black life. White people need a white conduit into each film.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that \u201cTraining Day\u201d would not have crossed over into awards territory if Denzel Washington\u2019s co-star was not white. And it\u2019s likely that \u201cMonster\u2019s Ball\u201d would not have been widely regarded if its raw sex scene had been between two black actors rather than exploring the \u201ctaboo\u201d of interracial sex. \u201cThe Blind Side\u201d would likely never have been made if a black family had adopted Michael Oher rather than a white one, nor would \u201c42\u201d if it hadn\u2019t also been turned into a story about Branch Rickey.\n\nThis Racial Empathy Gap is what black actors and filmmakers are up against every day. And it\u2019s what Matt Damon failed to realize when he trumpeted that the \u201cProject Greenlight\u201d winner would be selected based on \u201cmerit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When we look at the films Hollywood values, it's clear that white standards of \"merit\" set the rules", "title": "I can explain #OscarsSoWhite in 2 words: \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When we look at the films Hollywood values, it's clear that white standards of \"merit\" set the rules", "title": "I can explain #OscarsSoWhite in 2 words: \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/28/i_can_explain_oscarssowhite_in_2_words_annie_hall/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/allen_murphy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When we look at the films Hollywood values, it's clear that white standards of \"merit\" set the rules", "title": "I can explain #OscarsSoWhite in 2 words: \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/allen_murphy.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Beanie Barnes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #oscarssowhite, 2016 Academy Awards, diversity, Editor's Picks, Hollywood, Racism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I mean, they\u2019re black, but they\u2019re not really black.\nAnd the funniest film named \u2014 \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d \u2014 is one that few people of color have even seen, let alone would hail as the funniest ever written.\nIt\u2019s probable that \u201cTraining Day\u201d would not have crossed over into awards territory if Denzel Washington\u2019s co-star was not white.\nIt\u2019s different.\u201d Mookie: \u201cIt\u2019s different?\u201d Pino: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s different.\u201dIt\u2019s this mentality that allows black biopics, for example, into award show conversations.\nYet these shows were buried down a list where the show that reigns supreme is \u2026 \u201cFriends.\u201dOne show out of 100 \u2014 of all time."}
