Marco Rubio says he\u2019s the only Republican running for president who\u2019s actually notched a win against President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, widely loathed on the political right.\n\n\u201cLast year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion,\u201d Rubio tweeted earlier this month. The campaign has amplified that claim on Facebook and in media interviews.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut Rubio\u2019s proposals to completely repeal the health law\u2019s \u201crisk corridors\u201d have gone nowhere in Congress. Other Republicans who quietly worked to successfully outwit the Obama administration on the issue say Rubio is taking credit for a victory he didn\u2019t deliver.\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that Rubio was among the first politicians to criticize the \u201crisk corridors\u201d program, which compensates insurers that sign up sicker-than-expected patients and incur high costs.\n\nWhere Rubio\u2019s frontal assault failed, an inside maneuver succeeded. The gambit in 2014 restricted the administration\u2019s legal authority to make payments to insurers under the program, designed to help stabilize premiums in the health law\u2019s insurance markets. The restriction was inserted into a massive government spending bill and got little notice.\n\nBut it had consequences. As a result, the government could pay only $362 million of $2.87 billion in risk corridor claims from insurers for 2014. The industry says the government still owes $2.5 billion.\n\nIn a statement Monday evening, campaign spokesman Alex Conant repeated the claim that Rubio \u201cis the only candidate running for president with a signature win against Obamacare that stopped a $2.5 billion taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurance companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor over a year, Marco sounded the alarm about the bailout that was coming, introduced legislation to stop it, rallied support from conservative organizations and members of Congress, and ultimately succeeded by making it a Republican priority in the spending bill that became law,\u201d Conant said.\n\nBut according to interviews and documents, the strategy and legal case for the spending restriction were developed over months of work involving the staffs of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. Upton is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. At the time, Sessions was the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nThey teamed up with former Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., who chaired a panel that oversees spending on health care programs.\n\nAsked by The Associated Press who was responsible for the spending restriction, Sessions released a statement crediting his staff, along with the offices of Upton and Kingston. It pointedly omitted Rubio.\n\n\u201cThe essential feature of our joint approach was that it did not require the passage of a stand-alone bill,\u201d Sessions said, drawing a contrast with Rubio\u2019s approach to totally repeal risk corridors.\n\nInstead, Sessions added, his approach established that the risk corridor program was legally flawed, lacking its own permanent appropriation, or specific congressional authority, to spend money.\n\nThat laid the groundwork \u201cfor successfully blocking the illicit transfer of funds in the budget bill,\u201d Sessions said. Without the restrictive language the administration might have been able to shift funds to cover the $2.5 billion shortfall.\n\nA Sept. 30, 2014, legal opinion from the congressional Government Accountability Office validated part of the Sessions-Upton strategy. The analysis confirmed that the president\u2019s health law failed to provide specific authority for the risk corridor payments.\n\nBut there was a nuance. Under risk corridors, insurers whose medical claims costs are lower than expected in a given year pay in money to help insurers whose costs are high. GAO said those were \u201cuser fees\u201d and the administration could still pay insurers through other health care accounts endowed with broad spending authority.\n\nThose accounts could also be used to shift additional funding in case insurer payments into the program were insufficient.\n\nAlong with Kingston, Sessions and Upton sprang the trap, crafting a one-sentence budget provision that blocked the administration from covering any shortfalls.\n\nPaul Winfree, a former Sessions staffer credited by his boss for uncovering the flaw in the health law, said that Rubio\u2019s role was raising awareness about risk corridors.\n\n\u201cBut most of the work that led to the actual stopping of the bailout wasn\u2019t Rubio,\u201d Winfree said. \u201cThat was based on other members.\u201d Winfree now works on economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nKingston, now a principal with a major Washington law firm, said he doesn\u2019t remember dealing with Rubio. But he added he thought it was possible Sessions and Rubio could have been working together.\n\nSessions did sign an Oct. 2014 letter circulated by Rubio to former House Speaker John Boehner, outlining legal concerns about the administration\u2019s authority to make risk corridor payments.\n\nBrian Blase, a former Republican staffer with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Rubio raised concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to say he was solely responsible, but it is fair to say he raised the initial concerns,\u201d said Blase, now working on health care policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia.\n\nRubio actually voted against the 2014 spending bill that contained the risk corridors restriction, but so did Sessions and a number of other Senate Republicans. The bill passed.\n\nRubio has aggressively promoted his risk corridors role on the presidential campaign trail.\n\nIn a Fox Business interview earlier this month, Rubio again took full credit. \u201cLast year, I was successful in getting language at the end of the year in the budget bill that took that bailout money away,\u201d he told host Neil Cavuto.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear if that will be permanent.\n\nThe administration says it will pay outstanding risk corridor claims with money collected in future years.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, some legal experts say insurers may be able to take the government to court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Sen.
