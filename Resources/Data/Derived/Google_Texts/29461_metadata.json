The fix was a 72-hour waiting period between when a Medicaid patient consented to a tubal ligation and when the operation was done. Two years later, that waiting period was extended to 30 days.\n\nBut that has created its own problem, according to researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School. Medicaid patients who want to have their tubes tied immediately after having a baby can\u2019t do that because of the 30-day rule.\n\nIf they wait 30 days, some may no longer have Medicaid coverage, since pregnancy-related eligibility ends shortly after delivery.\n\n\u201cWhile we certainly don\u2019t want to return to the days when low-income women were coerced into agreeing to sterilization, we feel that the current rule \u2013 while well-meaning \u2013 goes too far in the other direction,\u201d said James Trussell, one of the authors of the paper submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine, and a professor of public and international affairs.\n\nIn addition, the consent form is too complicated for many patients to understand. An earlier study found that more than a third of the women didn\u2019t fully understand the long-term consequences of sterilization after they read the form. Switching to a form set to a lower literacy level helped patients grasp both the waiting period details and the availability of other, reversible, forms of contraception.\n\nNearly half the women who requested \u2013 but did not receive -- a tubal ligation procedure be done right after childbirth were pregnant within the following year. That is twice the pregnancy rate of the women who didn\u2019t request sterilization.\n\nMany of those women didn\u2019t get the sterilization they sought because of timing. They either put in a request too close to their delivery date, delivered a baby too early to meet the 30-day waiting period, or else didn\u2019t have the form with them when they delivered.\n\nReducing the waiting time and making the consent form easier to understand could help in \u201cmaking a dent in this stubbornly high rate of unintended pregnancy and the high costs associated with it,\u201d Trussell said.\n\nStudies done elsewhere estimate there are 62,000 unfulfilled requests for tubal ligation annually. Those, in turn, resulted in 29,000 unintended pregnancies, of which 10,000 were termination by abortion and 19,000 led to a birth. The public cost: $215 million.\n\nThose numbers \u2013 both the number of women impacted and the resulting cost \u2013 are likely to expand as more working poor join Medicaid under provisions of Obamacare, the research report stated.\n\nFOLLOW THE STAR-LEDGER: TWITTER \u2022 FACEBOOK \u2022 GOOGLE+\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news','obamacare'", "title": "Princeton expert: Medicaid rules keep poor women from getting sterilized", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Princeton expert: Medicaid rules keep poor women from getting sterilized\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/princeton_expert_medicaid_rules_keep_poor_women_from_getting_sterilized.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/14305951-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12233301\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-19T12:55:43Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/14305951-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "File this one under the category of &#8220;It seemed like a good idea at the time.&#8221; That time was 1976, when public health officials worried about poor women being permanently sterilized without their consent.
