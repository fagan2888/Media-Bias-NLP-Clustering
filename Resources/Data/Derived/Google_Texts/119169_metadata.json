The company would then earn a return on student rents.\n\nAva Parker, Poly\u2019s chief operating officer, said such arrangements are becoming more common in academia, and in Poly\u2019s situation, it was necessary to structure the deal this way.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that you\u2019re limited in how you can pay for residence halls,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of using our operating budget for that. If you can come up with another way to do that, provide the benefit and value for our students, and not require the university to provide the cash to get it up and going, it\u2019s a good option for us.\u201d\n\nFlorida Polytechnic was created in the 2012 legislative session and has been supported by an annual state allocation that had gone to USF Polytechnic, which was under the University of South Florida umbrella. Much of Poly\u2019s bankroll is wrapped up in the $110 million Innovation, Science and Technology building rising at Interstate 4 and the eastern end of the Polk Parkway.\n\nThe school had considered temporary portable housing or some sort of public-private partnership in developing student residences, but recently put out a request for proposals \u201cto see if there was any interest in partners who would basically bring their own money to the table,\u201d Parker said.\n\nSeven companies expressed interest.\n\n\u201cWe were very pleased with the responses that we received,\u201d Parker said.\n\nThe school\u2019s board of trustees settled on Vestcor, which has built student residential properties in Charlotte, N.C., Athens, Ga. and Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be a neat product, and we\u2019re looking forward to getting started,\u201d said Will Morgan, president of Vestcor Communities.\n\nIt will cost about $12 million to build, Morgan said, and will have about 200 beds, most in four bedroom/two bath units with a kitchenette.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be more like apartment-style living in a dormitory-style atmosphere,\u201d he said.\n\nThe construction timetable may seem daunting, but Morgan said one of the keys to accepting the challenge was that the construction company used by Vestcor \u2014 global giant Skanska \u2014 is already on site building the Innovation, Science and Technology building.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re mobilized, they\u2019re ready to go, and they can throw a lot of resources at it,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve vetted all that at the front end to make sure everybody\u2019s comfortable with timetables and delivery dates. We have complete confidence we\u2019ll get that done.\u201d\n\nSimilar projects in the Tampa Bay area have taken more time. The Hawks Landing complex at Hillsborough Community College, with 420 beds and a $17 million price tag, took a year to complete. The University of Tampa\u2019s Urso Hall, which cost $15.6 million and has 182 beds, took 15 months to complete. UT\u2019s new West Kennedy Hall, at $44 million for 528 beds, took 17 months to build. Residence Hall One on the USF St. Petersburg campus cost $15.8 million for 343 beds, and took 13 months to complete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that if we enter into an agreement with them and they say that\u2019s what they can do, then that\u2019s what they will do,\u201d said Parker.\n\nPoly trustees are expected to formally approve the residence hall deal on Thursday. It comes amid a slew of activity at the school as it gears up for next fall.\n\nRecruiters have completed their first month of luring students, and officials said the response has exceeded expectations.\n\nThe admissions team said it received more than 2,000 inquiries and more than 400 applications so far.\n\nPoly has hired a chief information officer, Tom Hull, from Pace University in New York and a former tech planner for IBM and the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about our recruiting progress,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019ve made on campus, and I\u2019m looking forward to receiving our new students next year,\u201d\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 20 Oct 2013 17:05:44 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 They may be sweeping construction dust from the hallways, but it appears that members of the inaugural class at Florida Polytechnic University who want to live on campus will have a pl", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 They may be sweeping construction dust from the hallways, but it appears that members of the inaugural class at Florida Polytechnic University who want to live on campus will have a pl", "title": "Florida Poly hurries to build dorms by fall 2014", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/florida-poly-hurries-to-build-dorms-by-fall-2014-20131020/", "image": {"width": 4928, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131020/ARTICLE/131029926/EP/1/1/EP-131029926.jpg", "height": 3192}, "updated_time": "2013-10-20T17:06:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 They may be sweeping construction dust from the hallways, but it appears that members of the inaugural class at Florida Polytechnic University who want to live on campus will have a", "title": "Florida Poly hurries to build dorms by fall 2014", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131020/ARTICLE/131029926/AR/0/AR-131029926.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-20T17:05:44Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T17:06:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba00\"", "article_summary": "Poly trustees are expected to formally approve the residence hall deal on Thursday.\nUT\u2019s new West Kennedy Hall, at $44 million for 528 beds, took 17 months to build.\nThe University of Tampa\u2019s Urso Hall, which cost $15.6 million and has 182 beds, took 15 months to complete.\nResidence Hall One on the USF St. Petersburg campus cost $15.8 million for 343 beds, and took 13 months to complete.\nFlorida\u2019s 12th public university is negotiating with a Jacksonville developer to build a residence hall on the Lakeland campus, and officials say the structure will be completed by the time classes start in the fall of 2014."}
