Patients who prefer to pay cash for their surgery despite having health insurance \u2014 in Canada, through the government\u2019s single-payer program; in the United States, through ObamaCare\u2019s private-but-highly-subsidized exchange plans \u2014 \u201chave coverage, but they really don\u2019t have access to care.\u201d\n\nCanadians, for instance, are often subjected to long waits for procedures. According to Forbes, \u201cIn 2013, Canadians, on average, faced a four and a half month wait for medically necessary treatment after referral by a general practitioner.\u201d The wait for basic diagnostic imaging such as an MRI stretched into weeks if not months. And these long lag times come at a price: the patient\u2019s physical and mental health. Productivity is lost, health often deteriorates, and sometimes death results.\n\nAmericans, meanwhile, are learning that ObamaCare exchange coverage is often expensive, has high deductibles, and features a very narrow network of healthcare providers. Those covered under such plans are likely to have to wait to be seen by a physician and to pay a significant portion of their healthcare costs out of pocket. Those who obtained coverage under ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion are in even worse shape because fewer and fewer doctors are willing to treat Medicaid patients given that program\u2019s parsimonious payments.\n\nWhat do you do if you have coverage on paper but can\u2019t obtain care \u2014 at least not at an affordable price? You turn to someone willing to provide care outside the government-medical cartel.\n\nSCO is perhaps the most prominent example of this type of free-market healthcare. The facility posts prices for all its procedures on its website, and they are often a fraction of the cost that other providers charge even to patients paying cash. In some cases, the prices are so low that patients with ObamaCare coverage actually save money by paying cash to SCO rather than going to one of the providers that take their insurance.\n\n\u201cHealthcare should not be anywhere near as expensive as it is,\u201d SCO cofounder Dr. Steven Lantier told The New American last year, \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t be so expensive without all of the collusion that we see between government and corporate medicine. We prove that here every day, showing that it\u2019s possible to drive down medical costs while raising performance, by getting government interference and government-enabled cartel medicine out of the equation.\u201d\n\n\u201cCost of care in the United States is really the problem,\u201d Smith said in his blog. \u201cAfter all, if the cost of healthcare is reasonable, then coverage is an afterthought. Coverage and insurance, which is a necessary thing, is [sic] there to cover uncertainty \u2014 not to cover the equivalent of a healthcare oil change.\u201d\n\nAs Americans have been forced to become more cost-conscious in recent years, the SCO model has been replicated to varying degrees across the country. Pennsylvania\u2019s St. Luke\u2019s University Health Network recently introduced its PriceChecker website, which allows patients to see up front how much certain procedures will cost and then to prepay for them.\n\nIndividual doctors are also getting into the act. \u201cA Physicians\u2019 Foundation 2014 survey found 7 percent of doctors run a direct-pay practice and another 13 percent plan to transition to some form of direct-pay model,\u201d reported the News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, in an article on the many doctors in the small state who have chosen to exit the third-party-payment game in favor of spending more time with their patients and less on completing paperwork and meeting insurers\u2019 demands.\n\nThese moves toward free-market medicine are to be welcomed. As Smith put it, \u201cWhat the United States healthcare system needs \u2026 is the same free-market competition and discipline every other industry must endure.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there are still those who believe that the problem isn\u2019t too much government intervention but not enough, and they continue to clamor for Canadian-style single-payer health insurance. This, Smith pointed out, \u201cis really a distraction because it focuses on coverage,\u201d not cost.\n\n\u201cPeople in countries that have single-payer coverage have just that,\u201d Smith asserted. \u201cThey have coverage, but they really don\u2019t have a lot of access to care. And more and more stories of the disaster of single-payer in the many countries that have adopted this are becoming clear and are leaking out every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen somebody wants to talk about single-payer, try to get them to talk a little bit about the cost of care and address the cost of care,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is it that drives cost down and quality up? It\u2019s the free market. Every single time; no other economic mechanism is more powerful.\u201d\n\nPhoto of medical center sign: Coolcaesar at the English language Wikipedia", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Health coverage, health care, waiting times, access, single-payer", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/21969-health-insurance-doesn-t-guarantee-access-to-care", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/2cffcd2e19e89fbd4fd74fd631a490b7_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Health coverage doesn't guarantee access to care, so single-payer won't solve anything, said Dr. Keith Smith of the Surgery Center of Oklahoma, one of the free-market alternatives to the government-insurance-medical complex. by Michael Tennant", "title": "Health Insurance Doesn\u2019t Guarantee Access to Care"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/2cffcd2e19e89fbd4fd74fd631a490b7_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople in countries that have single-payer coverage have just that,\u201d Smith asserted.\nAnd these long lag times come at a price: the patient\u2019s physical and mental health.\nWhat do you do if you have coverage on paper but can\u2019t obtain care \u2014 at least not at an affordable price?\n\u201cThey have coverage, but they really don\u2019t have a lot of access to care.\nEvery single time; no other economic mechanism is more powerful.\u201dPhoto of medical center sign: Coolcaesar at the English language Wikipedia"}
