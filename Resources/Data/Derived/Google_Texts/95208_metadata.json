Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley appeared at the debate, which was hosted by NBC News and YouTube and moderated by anchor Lester Holt.\n\nHere is a partial transcript of the debate, courtesy of NBC News. Check back later for the full transcript.\n\nLESTER HOLT: Good evening and welcome to the NBC News/YouTube Democratic candidates debate. After all the campaigning soon Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa. And New Hampshire, not far behind. Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So let\u2019s get started. Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Governor Martin O\u2019Malley. Lester Holt: Well welcome to all of you, hope you\u2019re excited, we\u2019re excited. We want to thank our host, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. I\u2019m joined by my colleague, Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. 60 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know you\u2019ll all keep exactly the time so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. We\u2019ll also have questions from the YouTube community throughout the debate. This is a critical point in the race. You\u2019ve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. We\u2019re here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Let\u2019s have a great debate. We\u2019ll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate starting with Secretary Clinton.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: Well good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow. You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager and his moral clarity the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people, and that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job. I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I\u2019m prepared and ready to take it on, and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, and the next president of the United States.\n\nHOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement sir.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it\u2019s important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. And as we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that\u2019s rigged. That ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the income and wealth going to the top one percent. And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections. This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.\n\nHOLT: Senator, thank you. And Governor O\u2019Malley, your opening statement tonight.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O\u2019Malley and I was born the year Dr. King delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. And I want to thank the people of South Carolina not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emmanuel Church. You taught us in fact, in keeping with Dr. King\u2019s teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house, let go of the past, and move forward. Eight years ago you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Our country is doing better, we\u2019re creating jobs again. But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law we have urgent work to do and the voices of anger and fear and division that we\u2019ve heard coming off the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud. We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again. Thank you.\n\nHOLT: Governor, thank you. Alright to our first question now. The first question I\u2019ll be addressing to all the candidates. President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency, how you would think big. So complete this sentence: In my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be: fill in the blank. Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: Well, that\u2019s what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right. That we should raise the minimum wage to at least 15 dollars an hour, that we have got to create millions of decent paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. So what my first days are about is bringing American together to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes they are gonna start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us and not just big campaign contributors.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question. My first 100 days in office, my top 3 priorities will be:\n\nCLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the congress my plans for creating more good jobs and manufacturing infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing finally equal pay for women\u2019s work. I would also, I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out of pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs, by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn\u2019t take too much money out of the pockets of hard working Americans. And third, I would be working in every way that I knew to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean spiritedness. There\u2019s a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:08:55:00 Governor O\u2019Malley, same question.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:08:58:00 Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans rather than down. Equal pay for equal work. Making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages. Getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour however we can, wherever we can.\n\n09:09:23:00 Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100% clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create five million jobs along the way. (CHEERING) Thank you.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:09:42:00 So you\u2019ve all\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:09:43:00 I\u2019m sorry, that was second, Lester. And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America\u2019s cities. We have not had a new agenda for America\u2019s cities since Jimmy Carter. (APPLAUSE) We need a new agenda for America\u2019s cities that will invest in the talents and the skills of our people, that will invest in CBBG, transportation, infrastructure and transit options and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built, clean, green energy future that will employ our people.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:10:08:00 All right. Governor, thank you. (APPLAUSE) You\u2019ve all laid out large visions and we\u2019re gonna cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let\u2019s start with one of \u2019em, the issue of guns. Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you, quote, a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby. Right before the debate you change your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers. Can you tell us why?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:10:36:00 Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D minus voting record from the N.R.A. I was in 1988\u2013 there were three candidates running for Congress in the state of Vermont. I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.\n\n09:11:01:00 I have supported from day one an instant background check to make certain that people who should not have guns do not have guns. And that includes people with criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loopholes.\n\n09:11:23:00 And I think it should be a federal crime if people act (UNINTEL). We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people and then coming out and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together. And, by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:11:53:00 Senator\u2013\n\n09:11:53:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:11:54:00 \u2013provide a sensible\u2013\n\n09:11:56:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:11:57:00 \u2013you didn\u2019t answer the question that you did change your (CHEERING) position on immunity for gun manufacturers\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:12:00:00 What I\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:12:01:00 \u2013so can you\u2013 can you answer the\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:12:01:00 \u2013what I have said\u2013\n\n09:12:03:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:12:04:00 \u2013is that the m\u2013 gun manufacturers liability bill had some good provisions. Among other things we prohibited ammunition that would have killed cops who had protection on. We had child safety protection\u2013 on guns in that legislation. And what we also said is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held libel if somebody does s\u2013 something terrible with that gun.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:12:35:00 So.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:12:36:00 What I would say is that I would relook at it. We are gonna relook at it. And I will support stronger (?) provisions.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:12:41:00 Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:12:43:00 Yes. Look, I\u2013 I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders\u2019 own record that he\u2013 has voted with the N.R.A., with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady bill five times. He voted for what we call the Charleston loophole.\n\n09:13:02:00 He voted for immunity from gun makers and sellers which the N.R.A. said was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. He voted to let guns go onto Amtrak, guns go into national parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.\n\n09:13:22:00 Let\u2019s not forget what this is about. Ninety people a day die from gun violence in our country. That\u2019s 33,000 people a year. One of the most horrific examples, not a block from here, where we had nine people murdered. Now I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity.\n\n09:13:48:00 And I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:14:02:00 And that\u2013 and that\u2019s the\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:14:01:00 \u2013were. And that needs to be reversed.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:14:04:00 \u2013all right. Governor O\u2019Malley, (APPLAUSE) you signed tough gun control measures as governor or Maryland. And there are a lot of Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, \u201cYou wanna take my guns.\u201d What would you say to them?\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:14:20:00 This is what I would say, Lester, look, the\u2013 I\u2019ve listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation. And\u2013 (APPLAUSE) and I would have to agree with both of them.\n\n09:14:34:00 They\u2019ve both been inconsistent when it comes (LAUGHTER) to this issue. I\u2019m the\u2013 I\u2019m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting\u2013 little boy in Johns Hopkins hospital. He was gettin\u2019 a birthday haircut at the age of three when drug dealers turned that barber shop into a shooting gallery.\n\n09:14:58:00 And that boy\u2019s head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him. It did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. And his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.\n\n09:15:11:00 So after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut, Lester, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, (APPLAUSE) universal background checks. And you know what, we did not interrupt a single person\u2019s hunting season. I\u2019ve never met a self-respecting deer hunter that needed an AR15 to down a deer. And so (CHEERING) we\u2019re able to actually do these (UNINTEL).\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:15:34:00 All right, governor, thank you. Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course as you mentioned, the\u2013 the church shootings. We won\u2019t forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police. We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified. But it played straight to the fears of many African-American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception or in your view is it reality?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:16:04:00 Well, sadly it\u2019s reality. And it has been heartbreaking and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed\u2013 by police officers. There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.\n\n09:16:35:00 And that requires a very (CHEERING) clear agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief. One out of three African-American men may well end up going to prison.\n\n09:17:02:00 That\u2019s the statistic. I want people here to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men. And very often the black (CHEERING) men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated for offenses that do not lead to the same results for white men. So we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:17:23:00 And your time is up. I\u2013 Senator Sanders, my next question is\u2013\n\n09:17:27:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:17:27:00 \u2013actually my next question\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:17:26:00 Let\u2013 let me\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:17:28:00 \u2013was for you.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:17:27:00 \u2013respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth including China, disproportionately African-American and Latino?\n\n09:17:45:00 Who is satisfied (APPLAUSE) that 51% of African-American young people are either unemployed or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEOs of Wall Street companies who destroyed our (CHEERING) country have no police records?\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:18:09:00 Senator\u2013 Senator Sanders\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:18:10:00 We need to take\u2013 we need to take a very hard look\u2013\n\n09:18:17:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:18:16:00 Sen\u2013 Senator Sanders\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:18:18:00 \u2013at our criminal justice system, investing in jobs and education\u2013\n\n09:18:20:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:18:22:00 \u2013not in jail and\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:18:23:00 Just over a week\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:18:22:00 \u2013incarceration.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:18:25:00 \u2013just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she\u2019s beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How could you be the nominee if you don\u2019t have that support?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:18:39:00 Well, let me talk about polling. The secretary\u2013 (LAUGHTER) as Sectary Clinton well knows when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all up 3% points. Guess what? In Iowa, New Hampshire the race is very, very close. Maybe we\u2019re ahead (CHEERING) (UNINTEL). In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton in terms of taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating her by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that I saw.\n\n09:19:18:00 To answer your question, when the African-American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda and with our views on the economy and criminal justice just as the general population has become more supportive so will the African-American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum. We\u2019re on a path to a victory.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:19:43:00 Let\u2019s gonna\u2013\n\n09:19:43:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:19:44:00 \u2013governor I\u2019m gonna come to you (CHEERING) in a second. But Google searches for the words Black Lives Matter surpass Civil Rights Movement last year. And here in South Carolina Black Lives Matter was the number one trending political issue. Governor O\u2019Malley, your campaign and your record is Governor of Maryland and before that the Mayor of Baltimore.\n\n09:19:59:00 Last year of course Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray. And right from the start of your campaign you\u2019ve been dogged by those who blame your tough on crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:20:18:00 Well, let\u2019s talk about this, when I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year. And that\u2019s why I ran because, yes, black lives matter.\n\n09:20:34:00 And we did a number of things. We weren\u2019t able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray\u2013 unrest and\u2013 and tragic death showed. But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations.\n\n09:20:49:00 The truth of the matter is we create a civilian review board. And all\u2013 many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I\u2019ve put forward. We created a\u2013 civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy\u2013 use of excessive for\u2013 force, lethal force. I repealed\u2013 the possession of marijuana as a\u2013 as a crime in our state. I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows and became the first governor south of the Mason Dixon line to repeal the death penalty. I feel a responsibility every day to find things (APPLAUSE) that work.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:21:25:00 All right.\n\n09:21:26:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:21:26:00 And do more (UNINTEL) criminal justice system.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:21:26:00 Let\u2019s talk more\u2013 let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we\u2019re gonna hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube starting with Franchesca Ramsey who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let\u2019s watch.\n\nFRANCHESCA RAMSEY (ON VIDEO):\n\n09:21:40:00 Hey, I\u2019m Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities. For example, last month the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice weren\u2019t indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:22:01:00 Senator Sanders?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:22:02:00 Apologize for not hearing\u2013 all of that\u2013 question.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:22:06:00 Would you like me to read it back to you?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:22:06:00 Yeah.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:22:07:00 Prosecutors\u2013 I believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently we saw this with the non-indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:22:23:00 Right.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:22:24:00 How would your presidency\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:22:24:00 So.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:22:25:00 \u2013ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:22:29:00 Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. justice department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police customer they should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general\u2019s investigation. (CHEERING) Second of all, and I think as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of \u2019em are honest, hardworking people trying to do a difficult job.\n\n09:23:00:00 But let us be clear, if a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable. (CHEERING) And thirdly, we have got to demilitarize our police departments so they don\u2019t look like occupying armies. We\u2019ve gotta move to a community police\u2013 police (UNINTEL). And fourthly we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their (CHEERING) diversity.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:23:30:00 Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It\u2019s become a major issue in this race in a lotta places where you\u2019ve been campaigning. Despite an estimated $1 trillion spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:23:52:00 Well, Lester, you\u2019re right. Everywhere I go to campaign I\u2019m meeting families who are affected by\u2013 the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now. And lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I\u2019ve met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.\n\n09:24:12:00 So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that number one does tell the states we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about $1 billion a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.\n\n09:24:29:00 The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it, so should fire-fighters and others. We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment and recovery.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:01:00 And that\u2019s time.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:25:03:00 So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:06:00 Senator\u2013 Senator\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:25:07:00 \u2013a growing epidemic.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:09:00 \u2013Sanders, would you like to respond?\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:25:09:00 You know, (APPLAUSE) I agree\u2013 I agree with everything\u2013 the secretary\u2013 said. But let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not (APPLAUSE) looking at the consequence of it.\n\n09:25:27:00 And second of all when we talk about addiction being the disease the secretary is right. What that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now which is why I believe in universal health\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:50:00 And that\u2019s\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:25:50:00 \u2013care with a special\u2013\n\n09:25:50:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:51:00 \u2013and that\u2019s\u2013 I will be getting to all that coming up but we\u2019re gonna\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:25:53:00 \u2013Lester, just ten seconds.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:54:00 \u2013take a break. We need to take\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:25:55:00 Just ten seconds.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:55:00 \u2013a break. And when we come back\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:25:56:00 All of the thing\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:25:58:00 \u2013anger brewing in America.\n\n09:26:10:00 (MUSIC)\n\n09:26:17:00 (BREAK IN TAPE)\n\n09:30:04:00 (MUSIC)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:30:08:00 Welcome back to (UNINTEL) turned into another area where there\u2019s been fierce disagreement, that would be health care. Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100 day priorities. Let\u2019s turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell, now to lead that questioning.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:30:22:00 Thank you, Lester. Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls Medicare for all. Now you\u2019ve said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it. Secretary Clinton, is it really fair to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:30:39:00 Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I\u2019ve worked on this for a long time. People may remember that\u2013 I took on the health insurance\u2013 industry back in the \u201990s. And I didn\u2019t quit until we got the children\u2019s health insurance program that insures eight million kids.\n\n09:30:57:00 And I certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions. But when you\u2019re talking about health care the details really mattel\u2013 matter. And therefore we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years\u2013 as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people\u2019s health care. He didn\u2019t like that. His campaign\u2013 didn\u2019t like it either. And tonight he\u2019s come out with a new health care plan. And again we need to get into the details. But here\u2019s what I believe. The Democratic party in the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed. We finally have a path to universal health care.\n\n09:31:37:00 We\u2019ve accomplished so much already. I do not want to see the Republicans repeal it. And I don\u2019t wanna see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend (APPLAUSE) and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:31:54:00 Okay.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:31:55:00 Senator Sanders?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:31:57:00 Secretary\u2013 Secretary Clinton didn\u2019t answer your question. (LAUGHTER) Because what her campaign was saying Bernie Sanders who has fought for universal health care for my entire life\u2013 he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children\u2019s health insurance program.\n\n09:32:15:00 That is nonsense. What a Medicare for all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now the truth is that (APPLAUSE) Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people. I\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better pr\u2013 piece of legislation. I voted for it.\n\n09:32:46:00 But right now what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off. And here\u2019s the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks. That\u2019s the vision we need to take.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:33:19:00 Well, Senator Sanders\u2013\n\n09:33:20:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:33:20:00 \u2013if I can\u2013 (CHEERING) you know, I\u2013 I\u2013 I have to say I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight or we\u2019re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is (APPLAUSE) we have the Affordable Care Act.\n\n09:33:36:00 That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic party (CHEERING) and of our country. And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance. We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people up to the age of 26 being able to stay on their parents\u2019 policy.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:34:05:00 Well, that\u2019s\u2013\n\n09:34:06:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:34:04:00 Now there are things we can do to improve it. But to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate I think is the wrong direction.\n\n09:34:18:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:34:19:00 I have to talk about something that\u2019s absolutely\u2013\n\n09:34:20:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:34:21:00 I have\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:34:20:00 No one\u2019s tearing this up. We\u2019re gonna go forward. But what the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are under insured with huge copayments and deductibles. Tell me why we are spending over three times more than the British who guarantee health care to all of their people? 50% more than the French, more than the Canadians.\n\n09:34:44:00 The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way. We\u2019re not gonna tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicare\u2013\n\n09:35:01:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:35:00:00 Andrea\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:35:00:00 \u2013for all.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:35:01:00 \u2013Andrea\u2013 Andrea\u2013\n\n09:35:02:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:35:02:00 \u2013instead of\u2013 (CHEERING) Andrea, I think instead of attacking one another on health care we should be talking about the things that are actually working. In our state we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals that driver of cost at the center away from fee for service and actually to pay we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That\u2019s the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work and reduce costs and increase access.\n\n09:35:36:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:35:36:00 And that\u2019s exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act. What Governor O\u2019Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down. We do limit a lot of the unnecessary cost that we still have in the system.\n\n09:35:56:00 But with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act and thank goodness President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare (CHEERING) for the American people.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:17:00 You know\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:18:00 Senator Sanders let me ask you this though\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:20:00 \u2013yeah.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:36:20:00 \u2013you talked about Medicare for all. And tonight you\u2019ve released a very detailed plan\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:24:00 Not all that detailed\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:25:00 \u2013just two\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:25:00 \u2013just\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:27:00 \u2013hours before the debate. You did.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:28:00 \u2013well\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:29:00 But let me ask you about Vermont because Vermont\u2013 you tried in the state of Vermont. And Vermont walked away from this kind of idea of\u2013 of Medicare for all, single payer, because they concluded it require major tax increases\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:40:00 \u2013well, that\u2013 you\u2013 you might want\u2013\n\n09:36:41:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:42:00 \u2013and by some estimates it would double the budget. If you couldn\u2019t\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:44:00 \u2013Andrea, let me just say this\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:44:00 \u2013sell it in Vermont, Senator\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:46:00 \u2013let me just say that you might\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n09:36:47:00 \u2013how can you sell it to the country?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:36:48:00 \u2013ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I\u2019m not the governor. I\u2019m the senator from the state of Vermont. But second of all\u2013 (APPLAUSE) second of all here is what the real point is. In terms of all of the issues you\u2019ve raised, the good questions you\u2019ve raised, you know what it all comes down to? Do you know why we can\u2019t do what every other country\u2013 major country on earth is doing? It\u2019s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt.\n\n09:37:15:00 We have super packs. We have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying and the private (NOISE) insurance companies as well. What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward. It\u2019s Medicare for all. It is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money and the pharmaceutical industry. That\u2019s what this debate should be about. (CHEERING)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:37:42:00 Well, a\u2013 as someone who\u2013 as someone who has a\u2013 a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry that (CHEERING) spent, you know, many, many millions of dollars attacking me and probably will so again because of what I believe we can do, building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it\u2019s important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.\n\n09:38:09:00 I know how much money influences the political decision making. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance. And even during the Affordable Care Act debate there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option.\n\n09:38:27:00 In other words, people could buy into Medicare. And even when the Democrats were in care of the Congress we couldn\u2019t get the votes for that. So what I\u2019m saying is really simple, this has been the fight of the Democratic party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s make it work. Let\u2019s take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they\u2019ve been in 50 years. Now we\u2019ve gotta get individual costs down. That\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:38:59:00 And that\u2019s time. We\u2019re gonna take a turn now. Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address President Obama said his biggest\u2013 regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn\u2019t do it, how will you?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:39:11:00 Great question.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:39:12:00 Well, I think it\u2019s an important\u2013 point the president made in his State of the Union. And here\u2019s what I would say. I will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground. That\u2019s what I did as a first lady when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the children\u2019s health insurance program.\n\n09:39:27:00 When I worked with (UNINTEL) one of the most\u2013 partisan of Republicans to reform the adoption and foster care system, what I did working in the Senate where I crossed the aisle often. Working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get tri-care for national guardsmen and women. And it\u2019s what I did as secretary of state on numerous compassions. And most particularly rounding up 2/3 votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. So I know it\u2019s hard. But I also know you\u2019ve gotta work at it every single day.\n\n09:40:07:00 I look out here I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day because maybe you can only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party. But who knows? If you\u2019re successful there maybe you can build even more\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:40:24:00 And that\u2019s time.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:40:25:00 \u2013that\u2019s what I will do.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:40:25:00 Senator Sanders response? (CHEERING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:40:32:00 A couple of years ago when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in a timely manner I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veterans\u2019 health care legislation in modern history.\n\n09:40:47:00 But let me rephrase your question because I think if\u2013 in all due respect, your question, in all due respect, (LAUGHTER) you\u2019re missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it\u2019s not that Republicans and Democrats hate each other. That\u2019s a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do. (CHEERING) The real issue is that on\u2013 the real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour, the American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating le\u2013 13 million jobs, the American people want it. Pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes, the American people\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:41:39:00 That\u2019s\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:41:40:00 \u2013want it.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:41:41:00 \u2013that\u2019s time. But let me\u2013\n\n09:41:41:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:41:42:00 We have gotta make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not to\u2013\n\n09:41:47:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:41:45:00 Senator Sanders, let me continue. You call yourself a (CHEERING) Democratic socialist.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:41:51:00 I do.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:41:51:00 And throughout your career in politics you\u2019ve been (LAUGHTER) critical of the Democratic party. Even saying in a book you wrote, quote \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a hell of a big difference between the two major parties.\u201d How will you when a general\u2013\n\n09:42:00:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:42:01:00 \u2013how will you win a general election labeling yourself a Democratic socialist?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:42:05:00 \u2013because when I believe\u2013 what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50 state strategy so that people (APPLAUSE) in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need instead of being dependent on super packs. What we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people, not wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:42:42:00 Yeah, but senator, you can\u2013\n\n09:42:43:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:42:44:00 \u2013we need to expand\u2013 we need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point. (CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:43:02:00 Yeah, but senator, you never came\u2013\n\n09:43:05:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:43:06:00 \u2013to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. We can talk all we want about wanting (CLAPPING) to build a stronger Democratic party.\n\n09:43:14:00 But, Lester, the question you answered, there\u2019s no laughing matter. The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across (UNINTEL) and talk with my neighbors is, \u201cHow are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country?\u201d\n\n09:43:29:00 This is the biggest challenge we face as a people. All my life I brought people together over\u2013 over deep divides and\u2013 and very old wounds. And that\u2019s what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep s\u2013 talking past each other, declaring all Republicans our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires or it\u2019s all against American Muslims or all against immigrants. Look, it\u2019s Frederick Douglas said, \u201cWe are one. Our cause is one. And we must help each other if we\u2019re going to succeed\u2013\u201d\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:43:53:00 And that is\u2013 that is\u2013\n\n09:43:55:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:43:56:00 \u2013and that\u2013 (CHEERING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:43:56:00 And I respectfully disagree\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:43:57:00 \u2013Secretary Clinton, my next question is for you.\n\n09:44:00:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:43:59:00 I respectfully disagree with\u2013 with my c\u2013 my friend over here. And that is you are right. All of us have denounced Trump, attempt to divide this country, the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, the anti-Muslim rhetoric. But where I disagree with you, Governor O\u2019Malley is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:44:23:00 I agree with that.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:44:25:00 \u2013who control the economic and political life of this country.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:44:27:00 I agree.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:44:28:00 Nothing real will\u2013 get\u2013 happen unless we have a political revolution\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:44:31:00 And\u2013 and\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:44:32:00 \u2013where millions of people\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:44:33:00 \u2013and we\u2019re gonna\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:44:33:00 \u2013finally stand up.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:44:36:00 \u2013we\u2019re gonna get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, (APPLAUSE) here\u2019s another question from YouTube. It\u2019s from a young video blogger who has over five million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.\n\nCONNOR FRANTA:\n\n09:44:45:00 Hi, I\u2019m Connor Franta. I\u2019m 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation\u2019s vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate. Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers. But what I wanna know is how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:45:03:00 Secretary Clinton.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:45:03:00 Well, thanks for the question. And\u2013 congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube. That\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future. And therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.\n\n09:45:21:00 I\u2019ve laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable, how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs. Because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed about the economic prospects they feel they\u2019re facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt-free tuition.\n\n09:45:49:00 Looking for ways to protect our rights, especially from the concerted Republican assault on voting rights, on women\u2019s rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers\u2019 rights. And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we\u2019re going to encourage even more Americans to vote. Because it is absolutely clear\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:46:22:00 That\u2013 that\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:46:24:00 \u2013to me that turning\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:46:24:00 \u2013that\u2019s time but\u2013\n\n09:46:26:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:46:25:00 \u2013over our White House to the Republicans\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:46:27:00 Secretary\u2013\n\n09:46:26:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:46:27:00 \u2013would be bad for everybody, especially young people.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:46:31:00 \u2013a quick follow-up, a 30-second follow-up, (APPLAUSE) why is Senator Sanders beating you two to one among younger voters?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:46:36:00 I\u2013 I\u2013 look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and\u2013 for his supporters. And I\u2019m gonna keep working as hard as I can\u2013 to reach as many people of all ages\u2013 about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House. And I hope to have their support when I\u2019m the Democratic nominee.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:46:56:00 All right, we\u2019re gonna\u2013\n\n09:46:55:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:46:56:00 \u2013we\u2019re gonna take a break. When we come back, (CHEERING) big bank, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American economy. We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n09:47:08:00 (MUSIC)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:51:18:00 Welcome back from Charleston. Let\u2019s turn now to the economy. Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic vision for regulating Wall Street. Quote, \u201cOne says it\u2019s okay to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes, and make them pay their fair share.\u201d What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:51:47:00 Well, the first difference is, I don\u2019t take money from big banks. I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do\u2013 (APPLAUSE) what I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60% of the G.D.P. of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.\n\n09:52:22:00 You gotta bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you gotta break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is, \u201cThese guys are too powerful. Break them up.\u201d I believe that\u2019s what the American people want to see. That\u2019s my view. (APPLAUSE)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:52:52:00 Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:52:57:00 Well, there\u2019s no daylight on the basic\u2013 premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don\u2019t just affect me. I can take that. But he\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street.\n\n09:53:24:00 And President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama\u2019s work to push through the Dodd-Frank\u2013 (AUDIENCE REACTION) the Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we\u2019ve had since the 1930s. So I\u2019m gonna defend (APPLAUSE) Dodd-Frank and I\u2019m gonna defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, (CHEERING) taking on the financial industry, and getting results.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:54:09:00 Senator Sanders, your response\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:54:09:00 Okay, first of all, set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kids enough to campaign for me. 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected. And in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. You know, I\u2013 our friends, we work together on many issues, we have some differences of opinion.\n\n09:54:32:00 But here is the issue. Secretary touched on it. Can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna do this and do that.\u201d But I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. I am very proud. I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street\u2019s money. I\u2019ll rely on the middle class and working families for my campaign contributions\u2013\n\n09:55:09:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:55:10:00 \u2013that\u2019s time. Governor O\u2019Malley, I\u2013 I have a question for you\u2013 (APPLAUSE)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:55:11:00 Well, you know, I think that\u2013 I think then, if Senator Sanders followed up on this\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:55:15:00 First, 30-second response.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:55:17:00 Your\u2013 your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama\u2013 are a little strange, given what you said about him in 2011. But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher more effective, and more comprehensive.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:55:35:00 That\u2019s not true.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:55:36:00 It builds on the Dodd-Frank\u2013 (AUDIENCE REACTION) yes it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank regulatory\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:55:41:00 It\u2019s just not true.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:55:42:00 \u2013schemes. But it goes much further.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:55:44:00 Oh come on.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:55:45:00 Because both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector, were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession. I go after them, and I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure think I\u2019m the one they don\u2019t want to be up against\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:56:14:00 Governor\u2013 Governor O\u2019Malley.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:56:15:00 Yeah, thank you. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) Yeah, Le\u2013 Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What\u2013 (APPLAUSE) I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.\n\n09:56:36:00 Look, if\u2013 if a bank robber robs a bank, and all you do is slap \u2019em on the wrist, he\u2019s just gonna keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits. Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you. But for you to say there\u2019s no daylight on this between the three of us, is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass-Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to\u2013 no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.\n\n09:57:05:00 In prior debates, I\u2019ve heard you even bring up\u2013 I mean, fir\u2013 now you p\u2013 bring up President Obama here in South Carolina, in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street. In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 911, 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you did not go as far in reining in Wall Street as I would. And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that\u2019s on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street and\u2013\n\n09:57:33:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n09:57:34:00 Secretary Clinton, your 30-second response.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:57:35:00 Yes, well\u2013 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) first of all\u2013 first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others, have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:57:52:00 And we\u2019ve never used it.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:57:53:00 \u2013that pose a risk to the financial sector. I wanna go further and add to that. And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lotta money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democrat Governor\u2019s Association. And you were\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:58:09:00 Yeah, but I haven\u2019t gotten a penny this year. Would somebody please go up\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:11:00 Well\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:58:12:00 \u2013to MartinOMalley.com\u2013 (CHEERING) go into MartinOMalley.com, send me your checks. They\u2019re not getting\u2013 zero.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:19:00 Well, the\u2013 yeah, well\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:58:20:00 So what do you\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:20:00 So\u2013 but the point is that if\u2013 if we\u2019re going to be\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:58:22:00 The point being\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:22:00 \u2013serious about this, and not just try to score political points\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:58:26:00 Right.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:27:00 \u2013we should know what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:58:28:00 Right, let\u2019s ta\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:29:00 And what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank already gives the president\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:58:30:00 Oh, let\u2019s not score political points\u2013\n\n09:58:30:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:32:00 \u2013the authority to give regulators\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:58:32:00 Let me give you an example of how\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:58:34:00 \u2013to make those decisions.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:58:35:00 \u2013corrupt\u2013 (CHEERING) how corrupt the system is. (APPLAUSE) Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of Treasury, one on the Republicans, one on the Democrats.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:58:53:00 Yeah.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n09:58:54:00 The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to congress and tells us we should cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Secretary Clinton, and you\u2019re not the only one, so I don\u2019t mean to just point the finger at you. You\u2019ve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year. I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted while kids who smoke marijuana (CHEERING) get a jail sentence.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n09:59:32:00 Andrea\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n09:59:33:00 Well, it\u2019s\u2013 l\u2013 the last point on this is Senator Sanders, you\u2019re the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s phrase, to make the S.E.C. and the communities\u2013 the Commodities\u2013 Futures Trading Commission, no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in \u201908. So there\u2019s plenty\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:00:05:00 If you want to\u2013 (APPLAUSE)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:00:06:00 \u2013there\u2019s plenty of problems that we all have to face together. And I\u2013 the final thing I would say, we\u2019re at least having a feverish debate about reining in Wall Street\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:00:15:00 Senator Sanders\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:00:15:00 \u2013the Republicans wanna give them\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:00:16:00 Okay.\n\n10:00:17:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:00:17:00 \u2013more power and repeal\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:00:18:00 Any\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:00:19:00 \u2013Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s what we need to stop\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:00:21:00 Anyone who wants to check (APPLAUSE) my record\u2013 (CHEERING) anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street, when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions, to get the government off their backs, they got the government off their backs. Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think it\u2019s time to put the government back on their backs.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:00:56:00 Senator Sanders\u2013 (APPLAUSE) Senator Sanders, we\u2019ve talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the federal minimum wage\u2013\n\n10:01:05:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:01:06:00 \u2013raised to $15 an hour, (LAUGHTER) you want to expand social security benefits\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:01:09:00 Yeah, right.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:01:11:00 You\u2019re very specific about what you want. But let\u2019s talk about how to pay for all this\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:01:14:00 Good.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:01:15:00 You have now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your healthcare plan. You haven\u2019t been specific about how to pay for the other things.\n\n10:01:25:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:01:25:00 Would you tell us tonight?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:01:26:00 Good. You\u2019re right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loopholes that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands and not in some years pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this c\u2013 country, who has the ability, to be able to go to a public college or university tuition-free.\n\n10:01:55:00 And by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well. How do I pay for it? (APPLAUSE) I pay for it through a (UNINTEL) tax on Wall Street speculation. This country and the middle class bailed out Wall Street. Now it is Wall Street\u2019s time to help the middle class. In fact\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:02:15:00 Andrea\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:02:15:00 \u2013we have documented, (APPLAUSE) unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:02:24:00 Andrea, I\u2019m the only person on this stage\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:02:24:00 Secretary\u2013 secretary Clinton, he mentioned\u2013\n\n10:02:26:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:02:26:00 \u2013so Secretary Clinton, you want to respond?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:02:28:00 Well, I have\u2013 actually documented\u2013 every way that I\u2019m going to pay for what I\u2019m doing\u2013 because I think the American public deserves to know. And you can go to my website and actually see that. But there are serious questions about how we\u2019re going to pay for what we want to see our country do.\n\n10:02:48:00 And I\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes. And I\u2019m gonna do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt-free tuition, for childcare, for paid family leave, to help us bring down student debt, we\u2019re going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars. Yeah, and that will also come out of some of the pockets of\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:03:19:00 Okay\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:03:19:00 \u2013people in the financial services industry\u2013\n\n10:03:20:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:03:21:00 \u2013but Senator Sanders, let me\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:03:22:00 But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I propose\u2013\n\n10:03:24:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:03:27:00 Here is the major point\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:03:27:00 Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:03:29:00 Yeah.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:03:29:00 \u2013because the most (UNINTEL) political (LAUGHTER) issue in\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:03:32:00 I got you.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:03:33:00 \u2013in the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:03:45:00 What is correct, and I am disappointed that Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign has made this criticism. It\u2019s a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare. And she understands, I believe, that a Medicaid-for-all-single-payer program, will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families.\n\n10:04:08:00 So what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. So instead of paying $10,000 to Blue Cross or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes. But the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It\u2019s a pretty good deal. (APPLAUSE)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:04:39:00 Senator\u2013\n\n10:04:39:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:04:40:00 \u2013Senator, let me just follow up on that, because\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:04:41:00 Yeah.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:04:42:00 \u2013on Meet the Press, on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And having said that, now you say you\u2019re gonna raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:04:55:00 No. It is not breaking my word. When you are\u2013 it\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cI\u2019m raising taxes.\u201d It\u2019s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. So if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:05:17:00 Senator, I\u2019m the only person on this stage that\u2019s actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:05:22:00 I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:05:24:00 Okay, so that was eight years. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget downtime, during a recession. And\u2013 and Andrea\u2013 I had to make more cuts than any governor in the state of Maryland. But we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools number one in America five years in a w\u2013 row. And went four years in a row without a penny\u2019s increase to college tuition.\n\n10:05:46:00 The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making univer\u2013 like making national service a universal operation in order to cut youth employment in half in the next three years, all of these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.\n\n10:06:04:00 And that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much, much lower marginal tax rate than what\u2019s usual for the better part of these 80 years. And if we tax\u2013 earnings from investments on money, namely capital gains at the same rate that we tax earnings from sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better. (CHEERING)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:06:28:00 We\u2019ve got a lot of ground to cover here. Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the theme of scientists from YouTube\u2019s Minute Earth channel, here\u2019s their take.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:06:42:00 Hello from Minute Earth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit. But we now know that burning these fuels are really just heat-trapping gasses that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina\u2019s devastating flooding last year.\n\n10:06:57:00 Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and (UNINTEL) the bulk of the world\u2019s energy supply to alternative sources. Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whopping 82% of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas. In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists, and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:07:21:00 Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted. How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:07:33:00 I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively. I was home in Burlington, Vermont on Christmas Eve. The temperature was 65\u00b0. People in Vermont know what\u2019s goin\u2019 on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m on both the Environmental and Energy Committees.\n\n10:07:53:00 The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse. It is amazing to me, and I think we\u2019ll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry, and their campaign contributions, that they don\u2019t even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.\n\n10:08:25:00 It is beyond my comprehension (APPLAUSE) how we can elect the president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese. (LAUGHTER) Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy\u2013\n\n10:08:53:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:08:54:00 I\u2019ve got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:09:00:00 Governor O\u2019Malley, 30 seconds\u2013\n\n10:09:01:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:09:02:00 Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science, (LAUGHTER) I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100% clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done with solar, with wind, (APPLAUSE) with new technologies, with green buildings.\n\n10:09:27:00 This can happen. But in all\u2013 President Obama made us more energy independent. But\u2013 but in all of the above strategy didn\u2019t land us on the moon. We need American ingenuity and we need to reach this goal by 2050 for the sake of our kids\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:09:40:00 That\u2019s time. We\u2019re gonna take a break\u2013\n\n10:09:42:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:09:42:00 When we return, (APPLAUSE) the late-breaking development regarding Iran. (MUSIC) The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear, and hearing few good answers. We\u2019ll be right back. (LONG PAUSE) (MUSIC) Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now for the candidates, starting with Iran.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:16:12:00 Thank you, Lester. Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now in force. Iran is getting us billions of dollars. Several Americans who have been held are now gonna be heading home. The president said today is a good day. It\u2019s a good day for diplomacy. Is it time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979, and actually reopen a U.S. embassy in Tehran?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:16:36:00 I think what we have got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations\u2013 with Iran, understanding that Iran\u2019s behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with. Their support for terrorism\u2013 the anti-American rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing from some of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.\n\n10:17:00:00 On the other hand, the fact that we managed to reach an agreement, something that I very strongly supported, that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that we did that without going to war, and that I believe we\u2019re seeing a thaw in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.\n\n10:17:27:00 Can I tell you that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don\u2019t think we should. But I think the goal has got to be, as we have done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:17:41:00 Your response, Secretary Clinton? (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:17:44:00 Well, I\u2019m very proud\u2013 of the\u2013 Iran nuclear agreement. I was\u2013 very pleased to be part of\u2013 what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsibility for getting those sanctions imposed, which put the pressure on Iran that brought them to the negotiating table, which resulted in this agreement.\n\n10:18:06:00 And so they have been, so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We\u2019ve had one good day over 36 years, and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly\u2013 toward any know normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreements. And then we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region, which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and elsewhere.\n\n10:18:39:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:18:39:00 You\u2013 you mentioned Syria, let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let\u2019s turn to Syria, the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria? Not just special forces, special operators, but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role? Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton (UNINTEL).\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:19:00:00 Absolutely not. I have a three-point plan that does not include American ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition, which is what we are doing. Supporting fighters on the ground, the Iraqi Army, which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters\u2013 that we are now helping to reconstitute, and Kurdish fighters on both sides of the border.\n\n10:19:25:00 I think we also have to try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money. And we do have to contest them in online space. So I\u2019m very committed to both going after ISIS, but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political, diplomatic course to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria, which is the root of so many of the problems that we see in the region and beyond.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:19:57:00 Senator Sanders\u2013 (APPLAUSE)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:19:58:00 This is\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:19:58:00 \u2013ground forces? Yes or no?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:20:00:00 As everybody here knows, this is an incredibly complicated and difficult issue. And I applaud, I know President Obama\u2019s been gettin\u2019 a lotta criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing. What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want, is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare, in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:20:38:00 Andrea\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:20:39:00 We should\u2013 (APPLAUSE)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:20:39:00 Governor O\u2019Malley?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:20:40:00 We should learn\u2013 we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said, is this is a war for the soul of Islam. And that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:21:09:00 Governor O\u2019Malley?\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:21:09:00 Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best. And that is by joining forces with others, by acting in coalitions. And I believe that President Obama\u2019s doing the right thing in this case. We need to learn the lessons from the past.\n\n10:21:28:00 We do need to provide the special\u2013 special ops advisors. We n\u2013 do need to provide the technical support that over the long term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to the level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.\n\n10:21:45:00 And I also want to add\u2013 one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don\u2019t use the term you hear Republicans throwin\u2019 around, tryin\u2019 to look all bravado and macho, sending other kids tr\u2013 kids into\u2013 combat. They keep using the term \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \u201cGovernor, when you\u2019re with your colleagues, please don\u2019t refer to my son, who has served two du\u2013 du\u2013 tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of \u2018boots on the ground.\u2019\u201d We need to be mindful (APPLAUSE) of the\u2013 (UNINTEL PHRASE).\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:22:15:00 I have a question\u2013 I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:22:29:00 No. I think the vacuum was created\u2013 by the disastrous war in Iraq. Which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yeah, it\u2019s easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn\u2019t the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him, and what kind of political vacuum occurs, and who rises up?\n\n10:22:59:00 Ca\u2013 groups like ISIS. So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran. And he said, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m gonna do my best to bring American troops home.\u201d And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.\n\n10:23:23:00 And one point that I wanna make here that is not made very often. You have incredibly wealthy countries in that region. Countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest\u2013 wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States (APPLAUSE) to do it.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:23:46:00 Senator\u2013 Secretary Clinton, I wanna talk to you about red lines. Because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama\u2019s decisions to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus, after Assad had used chemical weapons, hurt the president\u2019s credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:24:09:00 Look, I\u2013 I think that the president\u2019s decision\u2013 to go after the chemical weapons, once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians\u2013 opened that door, resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out. I know from my own experience\u2013 as secretary of State\u2013 that we were deeply worried about Assad\u2019s forces using chemical weapons, because it would have had not only an horrific effect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states\u2013 Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:24:54:00 But should he\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:24:54:00 \u2013big deal. But\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:24:54:00 Should he have stuck to his guns\u2013\n\n10:24:56:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:24:57:00 Well, but\u2013 but look\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:24:57:00 \u2013or did it hurt U.S. credibility?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:24:58:00 I\u2013 I think as commander in chief, you\u2019ve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama. And I wanna just add to something that Senator Sanders said. The United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region.\n\n10:25:23:00 If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, se\u2013 setting Shia against Sunni. It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people, 250,000 plus dead, millions fleeing, causing this vacuum that has been filled, unfortunately, by terrorist groups\u2013 including ISIS.\n\n10:25:54:00 So I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the\u2013 criticisms I\u2019ve had of\u2013 Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria and go after ISIS\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:26:14:00 Your\u2013 your ti\u2013 your time is up, Secretary\u2013\n\n10:26:15:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:26:16:00 \u2013let me just\u2013\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:26:16:00 Which I don\u2019t think would be a good idea\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:26:17:00 Okay, but let me\u2013\n\n10:26:18:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:26:18:00 \u2013but overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:26:21:00 All right.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:26:22:00 \u2013are ones that we cannot\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:26:23:00 Okay.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:26:24:00 \u2013directly influence, but we can\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:26:27:00 All right, let me suggest\u2013\n\n10:26:27:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:26:31:00 Senator Sanders? (APPLAUSE)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:26:33:00 Where\u2013 where Secretary Clinton and I think\u2013 I\u2013 I agree with most of\u2013 of\u2013 of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest\u2013 disagreement is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s fighting who, and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS\u2019s hands the next day. We all know that.\n\n10:26:53:00 And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right. Assad is a butcher of his own people, a man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting. But I think in terms of pr\u2013 our priorities in the region, our first priority\u2013 priority must be the destruction of ISIS.\n\n10:27:14:00 Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia. But the immediate task is to bring all interests together, who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies, to make that the major priority.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:27:36:00 But in all of that, Senator and Secretary, I think we\u2019re leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don\u2019t have the human intelligence, overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence, or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things. (COUGH)\n\n10:27:55:00 We are walking through this\u2013 this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country into bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers and bringing up a new generation of business people, and then actually understanding and having relationships in these places so we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:28:23:00 Your time is up.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:28:24:00 Yes\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:28:25:00 Lester?\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:28:25:00 \u2013as (APPLAUSE) Senator Sanders mentioned\u2013 Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia\u2019s foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea\u2013 fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner, and launched operations, as we just d\u2013 discussed, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:28:48:00 Well, I\u2019d depend for what I got for it. And I can tell you what we got\u2013 in the first term. We got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons\u2013 between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across\u2013 Russia. We got Russia to sign on\u2013 to our sanctions against Iran, and other\u2013 very important\u2013 commitments.\n\n10:29:15:00 So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interests of the other, to see if there isn\u2019t some way you can advance your security and your values. When Putin came back in the fall of 2011\u2013 it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened, because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom. And he cracked down, and in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed\u2013 record, to say the least, and we have to figure out how to deal with him. We\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:29:59:00 What\u2019s your relationship with him?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:30:01:00 Well, my relationship with him\u2013 (LAUGH) it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s\u2013 (LAUGHTER) it\u2019s one I think of\u2013 respect. We\u2019ve had some very tough dealings with one another. And\u2013 I know that he\u2019s someone that you have to continually stand up to. Because like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can, unless you do.\n\n10:30:32:00 And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up. I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, and the downing of the airliner. But we\u2019ve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:30:49:00 We wanna turn right now (APPLAUSE) to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That bring us to YouTube and this question.\n\nMARQUES BROWNLEE:\n\n10:31:00:00 Hi, my name is Marques Brownlee, and I\u2019ve been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years. I think America\u2019s future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data. But the government wants a back door into that information. So do you think it\u2019s possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:31:20:00 So Governor O\u2019Malley?\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:31:21:00 Thank you. I believe whether it\u2019s a back door or front door, that the\u2013 that the American principle of law should still hold. That our federal government should have to get a warrant whether they wanna come through your back door or your front door. (APPLAUSE) And I also agree, Lester, with\u2013 with Benjamin Franklin, who said, \u201cNo people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.\u201d\n\n10:31:42:00 So\u2013 well, we\u2019re a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here, with Silicon Valley, and other bright people in my own state of\u2013 of Maryland, around M.S.A. that can actually figure this out. But there are certain immutable principles that\u2013 will not become\u2013 antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms.\n\n10:32:02:00 And one of the things is our\u2013 our right to be secure in our homes and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant. I also wanna say that while we\u2019ve made some progress on the\u2013 patriot act, I do believe that we need an adversarial port system there. We need a public advocate, we need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:32:26:00 That\u2019s time. You have all talked about\u2013 what you would do fighting ISIS over there. But we\u2019ve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga, to San Bernardino\u2013 the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you gonna fight lone wolves here, Senator Sanders\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:32:42:00 Okay, Lester, year in and year out, I was the leader of the U.S.\u2013\n\n10:32:44:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:32:45:00 \u2013Senator Sanders, I wasn\u2019t clear. I apologize.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:32:47:00 Okay. I just wanted to add\u2013 in the previous question\u2013 I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O\u2019Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations. You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government have in terms of the websites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment. And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to translate information\u2013\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:33:32:00 But in terms of lone wolves\u2013 the threat, how do you deal with it\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:33:36:00 Right, what we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the internet, or in other ways\u2013 by ISIS, is in fact, discovered. But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:34:00:00 We have to go to\u2013\n\n10:34:00:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:34:01:00 We have to go to a break, but when we come back, let me get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer\u2013\n\n10:34:06:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:34:07:00 \u2013to talk about.\n\n10:38:08:00 (MUSIC)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:38:15:00 And welcome back to Charleston. As we were going to a break S\u2013 Secretary Clinton I\u2013 I cut you off. I\u2013 I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of\u2013 lone wolves.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:38:22:00 Can I get 30 seconds too? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:38:33:00 Secretary Clinton.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:38:36:00 Well, I\u2013 I wanted to\u2013 say\u2013 and I\u2019ll do it quickly, I was very pleased that\u2013 leaders of President Obama\u2019s\u2013 administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do consistent with privacy and security.\n\n10:38:52:00 We need better intelligence cooperation. We need to be sure that we\u2019re getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then we\u2019ve gotta recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans. And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you\u2019re hearing from the Republican side. We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against (CHEERING) terrorist attacks and lone wolves and working with Muslim Americans.\n\n10:39:23:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:39:23:00 Andrea has a follow-up.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:39:25:00 Just\u2013 just a quick follow-up\u2013\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:39:26:00 Andrea\u2013 Andrea\u2013\n\n10:39:28:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:39:27:00 \u2013for Secretary Clinton, just\u2013 just a moment, governor.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:39:29:00 \u2013my 30 seconds?\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:39:30:00 But\u2013 but\u2013 Secretary Clinton you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley. They were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:39:38:00 That is not what I\u2019ve heard. Let me leave it at that.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:39:40:00 Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness. Ever since the attacks of September 11th, 30 seconds, ever since the attacks of September 11th my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors made me their leader on homeland scrutiny and preparedness.\n\n10:39:53:00 Here in the homeland unlike combating ISIL abroad we\u2019re almost like it\u2019s\u2013 your body\u2019s immune system. It\u2019s able to protect your body against bad bugs not necessarily \u2019cause it outnumbers \u2019em but it\u2019s better connected. The fusion centers, the\u2013 bio-surveillance systems, better prepared first responders.\n\n10:40:11:00 But there\u2019s another front in this battle and it is this. That\u2019s the political front. And if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith he can start with me. And I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any s\u2013 thing\u2013\n\n10:40:33:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:40:34:00 All right, that\u2019s time. And we do\u2013 we (CHEERING) do have to move on. Secretary Clinton, this is the first time\u2013\n\n10:40:38:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:40:39:00 \u2013that\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:40:40:00 Can I just get a very brief response. Very brief.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:40:41:00 \u2013thir\u2013 third seconds, Senator.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:40:44:00 Okay. One\u2013 and\u2013 and I agree with what the secretary said and\u2013 and what Governor O\u2019Malley said. But here\u2019s an issue that we also should talk about. We have $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries.\n\n10:40:59:00 Unfortunately much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget\u2013 less than 10% actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinkin\u2019 hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the defense department.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:41:25:00 All right, Secretary Clinton, (APPLAUSE) this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues. But be specific if you can. Are you talking about\u2013 a kitchen table role on economics or will he have a real policy role?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:41:43:00 Well, I\u2013 it\u2019ll start at the kitchen table. We\u2019ll see how it goes from there. (LAUGHTER) And I\u2013 (CHEERING) I\u2019m gonna have the very best advisors that I can possibly have. And when it comes to the economy\u2013 and what was accomplished under my husband\u2019s leadership in the 90s, especially when it came to raising income for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than any time in recent history you bet I\u2019m gonna ask for his ideas, I\u2019m gonna ask for his advice.\n\n10:42:18:00 And I\u2019m gonna use him as\u2013 a good will\u2013 emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we\u2019ve got. Because I do believe, as he said, everything that\u2019s wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America. We just have to do more of it and we have to reach out, especially in the poor communities and communities of color to give more people their own chance to get ahead.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:42:41:00 Senator Sanders, a 30 second response (CHEERING) here.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:42:49:00 Great ideas. Governor O\u2019Malley, Secretary Clinton. But here\u2019s the truth, if you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees it ain\u2019t gonna accomplish very much. So here\u2019s a promise that I make, I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is. Goldman Sachs paying a $5 billion fine gives this country in recent history a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury. Here\u2019s a promise, if elected president Goldman Sachs is not gonna have\u2013 bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders\u2019 administration.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:43:29:00 (CHEERING) Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question, you called Bill Clinton\u2019s past transgressions, quote, totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable. Senator, do you regret saying that?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:43:43:00 I was asked a question, you know, one of the things, Andrea, and I\u2013 that\u2013 that question annoys me. I cannot (LAUGHTER) walk down the street\u2013 Secretary Clinton knows this\u2013 without being told how much I have to attack Secretary Clinton. Wanna get me on the front pages of the paper, I make some vicious attack. I have avoided doing that, trying to run an issue oriented campaign. (CHEERING) I was\u2013\n\n10:44:11:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:44:12:00 \u2013asked a question.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:44:14:00 You didn\u2019t have to answer it that way though. Why\u2013\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:44:13:00 Well\u2013\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:\n\n10:44:14:00 \u2013did you?\n\nBERNIE SANDERS:\n\n10:44:15:00 \u2013then if I don\u2019t answer it then there\u2019s another front page. So yes. (LAUGHTER) And I mean this seriously. You know that. We\u2019ve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No I have not. I\u2019m gonna debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O\u2019Malley on the issues facing the American people. Not Bill Clinton\u2019s personal (CHEERING) views (?).\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:44:38:00 We will take a break. We\u2019ll continue from Charleston right after this. (LAUGHTER)\n\n10:44:43:00 (MUSIC)\n\n10:44:52:00 (BREAK IN TAPE)\n\n10:48:54:00 (MUSIC)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:49:00:00 Welcome back, everybody. Finally before we go tonight we set up here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we\u2013 we\u2019ve learned a lot here. But before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to say? And we\u2019ll start with Governor O\u2019Malley. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) Didn\u2019t see that coming\u2013\n\n10:49:29:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:49:30:00 \u2013did you?\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:49:30:00 You know what, we\u2019re gonna have to get 20 minutes to do it. So (LAUGHTER) look I believe there\u2013\n\n10:49:34:00 (OVERTALK)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:49:35:00 \u2013are many issues, so what\u2013 60 seconds for this?\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:49:35:00 Sixty seconds. We\u2019d appreciate it.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:49:38:00 There are so many issues that\u2013 that we haven\u2019t been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation\u2019s now maintaining. We haven\u2019t discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are being treated with by these hedge funds that are working (UNINTEL). (APPLAUSE)\n\n10:50:00:00 We haven\u2019t discussed the fact that in our own hemisphere we have the danger of nation state failures because of drug traffickers in\u2013 in Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. I guess the bottom line is this, look, we are\u2013 a great people when we act at home and abroad.\n\n10:50:15:00 Based on the beliefs that unite us, our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is no challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad. We\u2019re on the threshold of a new era of American progress. And I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:50:40:00 And that\u2019s time.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:50:42:00 Thanks a lot. (CHEERING)\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:50:44:00 Secretary Clinton.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\n10:50:50:00 Well, Lester, I\u2013 I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what\u2019s happening in Flint, Michigan. And I think every (CHEERING) single American should be outraged. We\u2019ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African-American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water.\n\n10:51:15:00 And the governor of that state acted as though he didn\u2019t really care. He had request for help but he basically stonewalled. I\u2019ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it there would\u2019ve been action. So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the\u2013 mayor of Flint to see what I could do to help.\n\n10:51:39:00 And I issued a statement about what we needed to do. And then I went on a TV show and said it was outrageous that the governor hadn\u2019t acted. And within two hours he had. I wanna be a president takes care of the big (CHEERING) problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country every day.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:51:58:00 Thank you. Senator Sanders.\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY:\n\n10:52:04:00 Well, Secretary Clinton was right. And what I did which I think is also right is demanded the resignation of the governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly (APPLAUSE) should not stay in power. Now we are a great nation. And we\u2019ve heard a lotta great ideas here tonight.\n\n10:52:22:00 But let\u2019s be honest and let\u2019s be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy. (CHEERING) We have gotta get rid of super pack. We have got to get rid of citizens united.\n\n10:52:55:00 And what we have got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nLESTER HOLT:\n\n10:53:20:00 All right, well, thank you. (CHEERING) And thanks to all of you for being here tonight, shedding light on some of the differences\u2013 as Americans get ready to vote. I also wanna thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It\u2019s been a great, spirited conversation a new\u2013 American people appreciate it.
