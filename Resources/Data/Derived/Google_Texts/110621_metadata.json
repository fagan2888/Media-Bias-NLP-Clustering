Texas is 3-0 this season at home against AP top 20 opponents which includes wins over North Carolina, Baylor and Iowa State.\n\nThe Frank Erwin Center should be rocking, which gives Oklahoma yet another chance to earn a solid win on the road.\n\nTexas protects the ball\n\nTexas isn\u2019t a team that turns over the ball a lot, and has the fewest turnovers in the Big 12 with only 144 throughout conference play.\n\nGuard Isaiah Taylor is the Longhorns\u2019 biggest playmakers, averaging 17.3 points over the last three games and has been knocking down shots at an efficient rate. Taylor will have the help of freshman Eric Davis Jr., who\u2019s scored in double-digits six times throughout conference play.\n\nOklahoma is a solid defensive team and rank first in the Big 12 in field goal percentage defense (.398), but in order to win convincingly on Saturday the Sooners will need to disrupt the Texas\u2019 offense and force them into making bad decisions.\n\nLast true road test\n\nSaturday afternoon will be the last time this season the Sooners will have to face a ranked team in their arena, seeing the only road game remaining for OU comes against TCU on March 5. OU will be heavy favorites to win that game against the lowly Horned Frogs, so Saturday\u2019s road matchup at UT proves to be OU\u2019s toughest remaining test on the season.\n\nA win on the road against a top 25 team is a big accomplishment, and beating a rival like Texas would give the Sooners a huge confidence boost heading into the most important stretch of the season.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "No. 3 Oklahoma will face its last true road test of the season on Saturday afternoon when the Sooners\u00a0take on rival Texas in Austin at 1 p.m.", "author": "Brett Coppenbarger", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/31330086/ou-basketball-rivalry-week-continues-with-saturdays-showdown-against-texas", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9980744_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "No. 3 Oklahoma will face its last true road test of the season on Saturday afternoon when the Sooners\u00a0take on rival Texas in Austin at 1 p.m.", "title": "OU Basketball: Rivalry Week Continues With Saturday's Showdown Against Texas"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9980744_G.jpg", "description": "No. 3 Oklahoma will face its last true road test of the season on Saturday afternoon when the Sooners\u00a0take on rival Texas in Austin at 1 p.m.", "card": "summary", "title": "OU Basketball: Rivalry Week Continues With Saturday's Showdown Against Texas"}, "wnreadableurl": "ou-basketball-rivalry-week-continues-with-saturdays-showdown-against-texas", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2016/02/26", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,ou,sooners,texas,longhorns,ut,big 12,college basketball,buddy hield,lon kruger,isaiah taylor,shaka smart", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,ou,sooners,texas,longhorns,ut,big 12,college basketball,buddy hield,lon kruger,isaiah taylor,shaka smart"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cee\"", "article_summary": "3 Oklahoma basketball team will face its last true road test of the season when they take on rival Texas in Austin at 1 p.m.\nAnytime two Big 12 teams hit the floor it\u2019s worth watching, but the rivalry aspect to this matchup brings some added intrigue.\nThe Frank Erwin Center should be rocking, which gives Oklahoma yet another chance to earn a solid win on the road.\nOU will be heavy favorites to win that game against the lowly Horned Frogs, so Saturday\u2019s road matchup at UT proves to be OU\u2019s toughest remaining test on the season.\nThere\u2019s no question Shaka Smart\u2019s squad still thinks about that contest ended, and the Sooners will need to be prepared to face a Texas team that\u2019s itching for revenge on Saturday afternoon."}
