Let me put an exclamation point on that,\u201d House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, Pennsylvania Republican, said.\n\nMr. Shuster said the conference plans to finalize its report by Nov. 30, giving Congress just several days to send a final bill to President Obama.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a challenge, so we need to buckle down and get to work,\u201d he said.\n\nCongress hasn\u2019t passed a multi-year highway bill since 2005. That one expired in 2009, and Congress has passed a series of short-term extensions since then, making a multi-year bill a leading \u2014 yet elusive \u2014 priority for leaders in both chambers.\n\nLawmakers say hopping from one stopgap measure to another creates uncertainty for states that are trying to plan ahead and kickstart economic growth.\n\n\u201cThis bill at least stops the roller-coaster of short-term extensions,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat, said of the $325 billion package.\n\nThe chambers passed bills that set forth six years of policy but only pay for three of those years, leaving negotiators to see if they can cobble together the rest of the funding.\n\nAs it stands, lawmakers are relying on money from the federal gas tax and a mix of other revenue streams the Senate assembled when it passed its highway bill in July, including Transportation Safety Administration fees that are typically reinvested in border security and proceeds from selling off barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nDemocrats have accused the GOP-led chamber of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d to fund half the bill instead of raising the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax.\n\nThey say the tax is overdue for an update and it would be sound policy, as it is a \u201cuser fee\u201d on people who use the roads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House and Senate negotiators sat down Wednesday and pledged to hammer out their first multi-year highway bill in a decade, saying stopgap measures are failing motorists and businesses who contend with America's crumbling roads and infrastructure.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House and Senate negotiators sat down Wednesday and pledged to hammer out their first multi-year highway bill in a decade, saying stopgap measures are failing motorists and businesses who contend with America\u2019s crumbling roads and infrastructure.", "title": "House, Senate negotiators set to work on highway bill", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/18/house-senate-negotiators-set-work-highway-bill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/15/6a20f962bafd7a1a790f6a7067007a2e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/15/6a20f962bafd7a1a790f6a7067007a2e.jpg", "description": "House and Senate negotiators sat down Wednesday and pledged to hammer out their first multi-year highway bill in a decade, saying stopgap measures are failing motorists and businesses who contend with", "card": "summary", "title": "House, Senate negotiators set to work on highway bill"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Senate"}, "article_summary": "House and Senate negotiators sat down Wednesday and pledged to hammer out their first multi-year highway bill in a decade, saying stopgap measures are failing motorists and businesses who contend with America\u2019s crumbling roads and infrastructure.\nLet me put an exclamation point on that,\u201d House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, Pennsylvania Republican, said.\nCongress hasn\u2019t passed a multi-year highway bill since 2005.\n\u201cThis bill at least stops the roller-coaster of short-term extensions,\u201d Sen.
