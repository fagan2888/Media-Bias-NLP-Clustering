In fact, Kansas Republican Governor Sam Brownback and the Republican legislature were so confident that slashing safety nets, cutting education, and spending a budget surplus on tax cuts for the rich would produce an economic bonanza, they gave the wealthy well over a billion dollars in unfunded tax cuts that has the state\u2019s economy starved of revenue. However, despite Republican warnings the state will be bankrupt in two years, more than 100 Kansas Republicans swearing to help replace Brownback with a Democrat for governor, and a credit agency downgrading Kansas credit, a noted conservative economist lied to support Brownback\u2019s tax cuts as a job creating bonanza. Kansas is lagging behind the rest of the nation in creating jobs besides facing a revenue shortfall of massive proportions.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s senior economist, Stephen Moore, wrote a pro-Brownback op-ed attacking Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman because like every economist not in the employ of the Heritage Foundation and Fox News, Krugman does not support Republicans\u2019 failed trickle-down scam. Moore was caught red-handed deliberately using incorrect statistics to convince readers that Brownback\u2019s tax cuts create jobs. Moore lied and claimed states that do not give huge tax cuts to the rich are \u201cgetting clobbered by tax-cutting states\u201d in the number of jobs created. The editorial board of The Kansas City Star caught Moore\u2019s lies and published annotated corrections to his false assertions specifically stating that \u201cthe author misstated job growth rates for four states and the time covered.\u201d In other words; Moore was lying to convince Kansas residents that Brownback\u2019s \u201cruinous\u201d and \u201cdramatic tax-cutting failure\u201d warrants giving him another four years to completely eviscerate the Kansas economy.\n\nIn another instance of conservatives projecting their malfeasance on Democrats, Moore accused \u201cliberals\u201d like Krugman of \u201ccherry-picking a few events\u201d to argue that major tax cuts like Brownback\u2019s are failing miserably. Not only did Moore deliberately \u201ccherry pick bad data to support his claims,\u201d he cherry-picked a time frame when the entire nation was suffering from the Great Recession due, in part, to Bush-Republicans\u2019 major tax cuts for the rich. One might think Moore is unaware he was lying about the benefits of continuing to give tax cuts to the rich, but after thirty years of trickle-down\u2019s abject failure, he knew he was lying like he has done for years.\n\nFor example, Moore has consistently criticized the idea of raising the minimum wage he claims will result in a \u201cbig increase in unemployment.\u201d Obviously Moore, a \u201cnoted conservative economist,\u201d saw the recent statistics that the states he claimed lag \u201cmajor tax-cutting Republican states\u201d that raised their minimum wage, and taxes, are leading the nation in job creation as well a overall economic growth. One of the states Moore specifically cited, California, is experiencing the nation\u2019s best job creation increase according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in spite of increasing the minimum wage and taxes on the rich. Moore also spent years claiming the Affordable Care Act would kill millions of American jobs, and yet the unemployment rate is falling and there has been 52 straight months of private sector job growth while millions of Americans have healthcare for the first time in their lives.\n\nStephen Moore, like the Heritage Foundation he represents, is not just a pathological liar, he is guilty of pseudologia fantastica. It is unlikely Kansas residents believe such fantastic lies about the raging success of Brownback\u2019s tax cutting-spree because they see the devastation of the trickle down scam first hand. Certainly, a group of one-hundred-and-four current and former Kansas legislators understand that Brownback\u2019s billion-plus dollar tax cuts for the rich are decimating Kansas.\n\nThe group, Republicans for Kansas Values, endorsed Brownback\u2019s Democratic challenger and released a statement saying, \u201cAll of us standing here today know Kansas can do better. We can have better schools and a stronger economy. The values that unite us as Kansans are much bigger than the partisanship and experiment of Sam Brownback. Through hard work and cooperation, we can restore Kansas together.\u201d The 104 Republicans cited Brownback\u2019s failed trickle down tax plan, severe cuts to schools, and fiscally irresponsible budgeting as reasons for their historic decision and praised Paul Davis (D) for being a moderate with common sense leadership and \u201cfocus on proven solutions\u201d such as \u201creinstating taxes and spending at their previous levels;\u201d precisely what Stephen Moore lied and said is a recipe for disaster.\n\nObviously, there is no lie too fantastic, including citing false statistics, Republicans and their Heritage Foundation economists are willing to parrot ad nausem to perpetuate their thirty year failed economic theory that giving more tax cuts to the rich is the key to economic wonderland. Moore has always been a condescending liar and for the second time he has been caught lying. In February, CNN\u2019s Carol Costello destroyed Moore\u2019s conservative economic lies disparaging any consideration of raising the minimum wage, and correctly noted \u201cthat raising it would increase incomes and decrease poverty.\u201d\n\nOne would think that of all the states Moore would choose to unleash a rash of lies about the benefits of giving major tax cuts to the rich, he would have picked anyplace except Kansas. But Republicans, and so-called \u201cnoted\u201d conservative economists, are such pathological liars that they likely actually believe Kansas residents are unaware their state is drowning in debt, suffered a credit downgrade, lags the entire nation in job creation, and cannot afford $100,000 to keep a children\u2019s homeless shelter open; all due to what Stephen Moore says is the reason Kansas is \u201cclobbering states\u201d that are succeeding because they did not give tax cuts to the rich.\n\n\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite Republican warnings the state will be bankrupt in two years, more than 100 Kansas Republicans swearing to help replace Brownback with a Democrat for governor, and a credit agency downgrading Kansas credit, a noted conservative economist lied to support Brownback's tax cuts as a job creating bonanza.
