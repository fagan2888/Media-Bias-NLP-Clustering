Congresswoman Susan Davis and 79 of her House colleagues have written to House Speaker Paul Ryan imploring him to reject policy proposals in the budget that would reduce protections for seniors, said Press Secretary Aaron Hunter in a release.

“The budgets that Congress passes must protect seniors and our nation’s most vulnerable. It’s becoming all too common for members of the majority party to attempt to balance the budget on the backs of seniors,” said Davis.

“We can meet America’s needs in a fiscally responsible manner if we simply work together to reach a compromise like we did last year. Let’s not fall into the familiar partisan patterns of the past.”

The letter to Speaker Ryan says that proposals which harm Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs are detrimental to the well-being of senior citizens.

Five years ago, Speaker Ryan made proposals, as a Chair of the Budget Committee, to sharply reduce funding for these programs, and the letter asks him to consider the ramifications of these policies.

His plan would eliminate funding for services that provide seniors with transportation services to the grocery store, Meals on Wheels and other community support programs for seniors, according to the letter.

The letter states: “At a time when senior poverty is on the rise, median senior income is $24,500 and many of our older constituents are still struggling from the loss of retirement savings and the erosion of defined benefit plans, Congress should not pass a budget that includes the harmful cuts included in the Roadmap for America’s Future and subsequent Republican budgets.”

In addition to this, Davis has also pushed for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, said Press Secretary Hunter.
