Then I read articles like this piece of complete Chait that one of America\u2019s leading liberal commentators has just produced for New York magazine and all becomes clear: because \u2018progressive\u2019 journalists who write about the environment don\u2019t do research or due diligence \u2014 only fluffy sentiment and green propaganda.\n\nLet me show you, with reference to Chait\u2019s article \u2014 excerpts from which I\u2019ll put in italics, with my gloss below \u2014 what I mean.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis weekend, leaders from 196 countries approved the first global agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions in human history. The pact is a triumph of international diplomacy shared by diplomats across the planet.\n\nThe agreement is non-binding, carries no penalties and is entirely voluntary. That\u2019s why everyone signed: because it meant nothing \u2014 not because any diplomatic skills were necessary.\n\nObama\u2019s climate agenda has lurked quietly on the recesses of the American imagination for most of his presidency. It is also probably the administration\u2019s most important accomplishment.\n\nThat last sentence is probably true \u2014 but only because from Syria to Russia to Obamacare to Benghazi to Common Core to the proliferation of divisive #blacklivesmatter identity politics lunacy, everything else on the administration\u2019s watch has been an even bigger fail.\n\nMelted glaciers cannot be easily refrozen\n\nFive Ice Ages say you\u2019re a fool.\n\nextinct species cannot be reborn\n\nJurassic Park\n\nflooded coastal cities are unlikely to be rebuilt\n\nCurrent rate of sea level rise \u2014 about 5 inches per century. You think, what, that in 500 years\u2019 time when the seas have finally reached the bottom of people\u2019s shorts, they won\u2019t have figured out a way of dealing with the problem?\n\nParis is a BFD\n\nOMG this guy is so DWTK he KATA!!* (*Down With The Kids; Knows All The Acronyms)\n\nIn 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for a global treaty to limit the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United Nations spent the next quarter century trying, and failing, to organize effective world action, despite increasingly dire warnings of massive, deadly, irreversible change that would threaten human life as we know it. An extremely simple conclusion can be drawn from this timeline: A worldwide-climate-change agreement is incredibly hard to do. If the Paris agreement were a simple matter of serving some nice French meals and writing some vague feel-good goals, it would have taken less than a quarter-century to happen.\n\nI read English Literature at Oxford. I have re-read this paragraph several times. Can confirm: it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s climate strategy began with a massive infusion of $90 billion in green-energy financing in the stimulus, which set off a wave of new investment and research in wind, solar, storage, and other measures.\n\nSolyndra? Bright Source? As a commenter below the article rightly says: \u201cThis was corporate welfare where politically connected businesses who gave money to the Obama campaign were given billions of dollars of taxpayer money to profit from.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt used its existing regulatory power under the Clean Air Act to devise innovative new regulations to control greenhouse-gas emissions across the economy\n\nThe net effect of Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 according to calculations by Bjorn Lomborg \u2014 will be to reduce global temperatures by the end of this century by 0.004 degrees C. So: at an estimated cost of $292 billion \u2014 not to mention raised electricity prices and destroyed jobs and industries \u2014 Obama and the EPA may possibly have managed to effect a change in the earth\u2019s temperature so small it\u2019s barely measurable.\n\nThe plunging costs of solar and wind energy, plus new innovations in storage and other clean-energy technologies, made it suddenly plausible for governments across the world to transition their energy systems.\u201d\n\nJust hasn\u2019t happened. Solar and wind are still only viable with massive subsidies. The world remains stubbornly reliant on fossil fuel because only fossil fuel provides reliable, cheap energy.\n\nClimate change is a devilish issue for any politician, since the costs of action are heavily front-loaded, while the benefits lie far off in the future.\n\nSo far off that none of the politicians pushing these green measures will be alive to see the \u201cbenefits\u201d. Lucky, really, because were voters around to see how little they were actually getting for all those lost jobs and all that wasted money and all those raised taxes they might start forming lynch mobs\u2026\n\nThe United States has a somewhat unusual form of government in which the legislature and the executive branch can be controlled by opposing parties, which means that the president can negotiate a deal with other world leaders without being able to guarantee his government\u2019s support for the result. Any formal treaty requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, which is itself an undemocratic body giving disproportionate representation to citizens from small, rural states.\n\nLiberals loathe checks and balances. \u201cIf only,\u201d they think, \u201cwe could run more on the lines of China. Then we\u2019d really get things done.\u201d\n\nWorse still, the United States is the only country in the democratic world that has a major party that questions the scientific theory of anthropogenic global warming.\n\nBecause the \u201cscientific theory of anthropogenic global warming\u201d has long since been discredited by real world evidence. What should worry us is not that the Republican party acknowledges this; but rather that no other \u201cconservative\u201d party anywhere else in the world does.\n\nBut the stance taken by the Republican Party, in which respected leading figures endorse kook conspiracy theories, is simply not heard anywhere else.\n\nNever in global history has there been a theory more kooky or damaging or expensive than the notion that the trace gas carbon dioxide is the control knob for global temperatures.\n\nThe U.S. is the world\u2019s largest historic emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\nAnd now Honey Badger China is. And China just doesn\u2019t care\u2026\n\nThe pledges amount to about half of the reductions necessary to bring emissions down to a level scientists consider safe\u2026\n\nActually no. If all the countries stick to these \u201cpledges\u201d \u2014 and this ain\u2019t gonna happen, but suppose for one crazed second that they did \u2014 then the resultant fall in world temperatures by the end of the century, using the IPCC\u2019s own calculation methods, will be 0.048\u00b0C. That\u2019s 5/100ths of a degree: the same temperature change you experience when you climb two flights of stairs. At a cost of $1.5 trillion per year.\n\nIt is hard to find any important accomplishment in history that completely solved a problem. The Emancipation Proclamation only temporarily and partially ended slavery; the 13th Amendment was required to abolish it permanently, and even that left many former slaves in a state of terrorized peonage closely resembling their former bondage. The Lend-Lease Act alone did not ensure Great Britain would survive against Nazi Germany; the Normandy invasion did not ensure the liberation of Europe. Victories are hardly ever immediate or complete. The fight continues and history marches on. The climate agreement in Paris should take its place as one of the great triumphs in history.\n\nNo, no, you are absolutely right, Jonathan. There is simply no event in history \u2014 not the abolition of slavery, nor the defeat of Hitler, nor the liberation of the death camps, nor the fall of the Berlin Wall and destruction of Communism, nor anything else ever as you rightly say \u2014 which can match the moment when a bunch of green activists delegations went to Paris and signed a meaningless, toothless document which will require no one to do anything and which will most definitely fail to deal with the problem because the problem doesn\u2019t exist in the first place.\n\nTruly this is Obama\u2019s finest hour!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes I wonder how the left can remain so woefully ill-informed on the subject of climate change.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sometimes I wonder how the left can remain so woefully ill-informed on the subject of climate change.", "title": "Obama's Useful Idiot Jonathan Chait Declares Paris Climate Talks a Massive Success - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/ap_ap-photo732-wi-e1450211912616.jpg", "height": 479}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/12/15/obamas-useful-idiot-jonathan-chait-declares-paris-climate-talks-massive-success/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sometimes I wonder how the left can remain so woefully ill-informed on the subject of climate change.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/ap_ap-photo732-wi-e1450211912616.jpg", "title": "Obama's Useful Idiot Jonathan Chait Declares Paris Climate Talks a Massive Success - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Climate Change, COP21, Global Warming, Jonathan Chait, New York, Obama,Big Journalism, Environment, Obama,climate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Obama", "published_time": "2015-12-15T12:39:05-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism,Obama,Environment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSometimes I wonder how the left can remain so woefully ill-informed on the subject of climate change.\nThe climate agreement in Paris should take its place as one of the great triumphs in history.\nClimate change is a devilish issue for any politician, since the costs of action are heavily front-loaded, while the benefits lie far off in the future.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis weekend, leaders from 196 countries approved the first global agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions in human history.\nObama\u2019s climate agenda has lurked quietly on the recesses of the American imagination for most of his presidency."}
