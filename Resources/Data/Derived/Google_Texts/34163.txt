Dressed in all-white garb in a white room, Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) stands dutifully by the side of a sanguine President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who addresses the people of Panem from a white throne. “Since the dark days, our nation has known only peace,” he begins, as the words “prosperity” and “unity” flash across the screen. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta’s fellow District 12 tribute, is conspicuously absent.

The minute-long propaganda speech is the world’s first cinematic introduction to “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I,” the penultimate film in the four-part blockbuster “Hunger Games” movie franchise. The message is dark: “if you resist the system, you starve yourself. If you fight against it, it is you who will bleed,” says Snow. “I know you will stand with me, with us, with all of us, together, as one.”
