This is hilarious. Most have seen the campiness of the 1960s Batman TV series. Adam West as Batman was always good for a laugh.

Mix it with the Superman footage from the 70s and 80s, when Christopher Reeve brought the character to life.

Now combine it with the trailer for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After a terrible quality leak, Warner Bros. did the right thing and released a HD version to the masses.

YouTuber Bobby Burns decided we should all get a look at what the movie would look like with a retro feel. The audio from the trailer is mixed with scenes from the original show (Batman) and the films (Superman).

Sure, it may not have the stunning visuals. But, at least the comic relief was on purpose.

Let me know what you think? Do you prefer Adam Westâ€™s Batman to what looks like a brooding, Ben Affleck Batman?
