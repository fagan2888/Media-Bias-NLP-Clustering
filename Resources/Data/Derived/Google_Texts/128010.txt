Ashley Personey has been riding horses since a very young age. She was good enough to ride in several national competitions.

But when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she had to give it all up. In fact, back in April, doctors told her family they didn't expect her to make it to Christmas.

Which is why all she wants for Christmas, is a chance to spend some time with horses and other farm animals.

The Wichita Riding Academy made it happen Saturday, spending several hours washing and loading the animals to make Ashley's wish come true.
