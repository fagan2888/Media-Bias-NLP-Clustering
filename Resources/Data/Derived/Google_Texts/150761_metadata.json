Rick Snyder, the state, and the city of Flint.\n\nPlaintiffs Doris Collins, Robin Pleasant, and Jason Phinisee, all Flint residents who paid for\u2014and in some cases continue to pay for\u2014undrinkable water, filed the suit (pdf) on behalf of approximately 31,000 household residents who have also been affected by the public-health crisis.\n\n\u201c\u201dSince it\u2019s clear that the Snyder administration cannot adequately address this crisis, it\u2019s time the federal government stepped in.\u201d\n\n\u2014Lynna Kaucheck, Food & Water Watch\n\nThey say state and city officials all breached their contract to provide drinkable water, in return for payment, from April 2014 to the present. They charge that the \u201cuse of said funds without providing drinkable water as promised, constitutes unjust enrichment to the extent of the monies collected.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Snyder, the suit specifically names former Flint emergency financial manager Darnell Earley and other former emergency managers.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe lawsuit also cites violation of the state\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, reading:\n\nPrior to the time the State was forced to admit that it was responsible for poisoning the water, the State knowingly made false statements concerning the drinkability of the water. The State\u2019s statements that the water was suitable was drinking water were acts that were unfair, deceptive and practiced in violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act.\n\nThe legal action comes on top of a joint investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency as well as a separate class action lawsuit against the city, state and county, filed in November by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and National Resources Defense Council on behalf of the citizens of Flint, claiming officials had knowledge of dangerous levels of lead in the water but did nothing to protect the public health. \u200b\n\nMeanwhile, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reported this week that cases of the potentially fatal Legionnaires\u2019 Disease have soared in Genesee County following the city\u2019s move to the toxic water source.\n\nEighty-seven cases have been reported since June 2014\u2014two months after the switch. Of those cases, 10 have resulted in death.\n\nLegionella bacteria typically grows in warm water and can cause severe respiratory disease and lung infections. MDHHS said it \u201ccannot conclude that the increase is related to the water emergency in Flint\u201d\u2014but is treating the situation with \u201curgency.\u201d\n\nThe disturbing news is raising the alarm of residents, as well as high-profile activists.\n\n\u201cLegionella bacteria is transported by biofouled drinking water distribution systems, which Flint\u2019s clearly is,\u201d said renowned environmental activist Erin Brockovich on her Facebook page on Wednesday. \u201cOnce again\u2026 I beg, plead\u2026 cry for the [Environmental Protection Agency] to get into the Flint drinking water investigation and stop with the denial; your continued silence has proven deadly.\u201d\n\nAnd filmmaker Michael Moore, who originally hails from Flint and has repeatedly called for Snyder\u2019s arrest, declared on Twitter:\n\nAnd now, murder. BREAKING: 10 people dead in Flint from Legionnaires Disease. Flint River water suspected. No arrests yet. #ArrestGovSnyder \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 14, 2016\n\n\u201cThe water crisis in Flint is a total abomination,\u201d said Lynna Kaucheck, senior organizer for the advocacy group Food & Water Watch, in a statement released Thursday.\n\n\u201cGovernor Snyder and his administration could have protected Flint residents, but instead they turned a blind eye, even assuring residents that their water was safe,\u201d Kaucheck continued. \u201cThe situation in Flint is the very definition of a man-made public health crisis.\u201d\n\nNoting the ineptitude of current top officials, Food & Water Watch is calling for outsiders to take the reins before the situation gets even worse. \u201cSince it\u2019s clear that the Snyder administration cannot adequately address this crisis, it\u2019s time the federal government stepped in,\u201d Kaucheck concluded. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services should declare a state of emergency to give Flint residents the resources they so desperately need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meanwhile, officials probe possible link between water crisis and deadly cases of Legionnaires' Disease., Flint, Michigan National Organization for Women, Rick Snyder, water,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Deirdre Fulton | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Meanwhile, officials probe possible link between water crisis and deadly cases of Legionnaires' Disease., Flint, Michigan National Organization for Women, Rick Snyder, water,", "title": "On Behalf Of City Poisoned By Water, Residents File Suit Against Gov.
