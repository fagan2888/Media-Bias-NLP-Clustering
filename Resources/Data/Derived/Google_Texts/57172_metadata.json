We continue to work closely with issuers to ensure that consumers are able to use this new functionality make changes to their coverage.\u201d\n\nThe change, which was unveiled in a memo distributed on Thursday to participating insurers, was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nUnder the new rules, consumers who have already enrolled in a plan may switch to a different plan before the open enrollment period closes at the end of March, provided they stay with the same insurer and opt for roughly the same level of coverage.\n\nThe administration also rolled out a new \u201cReport a Life Change\u201d feature on healthcare.gov, the website that governs the federal insurance exchange for 36 states. The new feature will allow consumers to adjust their plans in accordance with changing circumstances like a new baby, a marriage, a relocation, or another life event.\n\n\n\nThe adjustment, which marks the first major alteration of Obamacare \u2019s rules since coverage began taking effect on Jan. 1, was likely prompted by frustration among some consumers about the difficulty of altering their insurance plans to accommodate new realities or ensure continued access to a doctor of their choice.\n\nStories of people losing access to their old doctor under a new insurance plan had emerged as a central complaint among opponents of the law, who\u2019d warned for months about the disruption it would cause in America\u2019s health insurance market.\n\nTo address this concern, the memo distributed by HHS explained that consumers who act before the end of March can now \u201cmove to a plan with a more inclusive provider network,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nFigures provided by the federal government show that about 3 million Americans had enrolled in health plans under the Affordable Care Act by the end of January, though it is unclear how many of those enrollees had actually cemented their coverage by paying their first insurance premium.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama administration alters health law&#039;s regulations to help consumers accomodate life change, like marriage or children, and access preferred doctors", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-rules-tweaked-amid-complaints-about-plan-flexibility/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/18/d7754d5c-a342-491f-9d9e-33ef998e80fb/thumbnail/1200x630/8cf9a68def8f9b7a6140558206ba4c7b/healthcare_generic_v05.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Obama administration alters health law's regulations to help consumers accomodate life change, like marriage or children, and access preferred doctors", "title": "Obamacare rules tweaked amid complaints about plan flexibility"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama administration alters health law's regulations to help consumers accomodate life change, like marriage or children, and access preferred doctors", "title": "Obamacare rules tweaked amid complaints about plan flexibility", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-rules-tweaked-amid-complaints-about-plan-flexibility/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-rules-tweaked-amid-complaints-about-plan-flexibility/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-rules-tweaked-amid-complaints-about-plan-flexibility/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/18/d7754d5c-a342-491f-9d9e-33ef998e80fb/thumbnail/1200x630/8cf9a68def8f9b7a6140558206ba4c7b/healthcare_generic_v05.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-rules-tweaked-amid-complaints-about-plan-flexibility/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-rules-tweaked-amid-complaints-about-plan-flexibility/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd349\"", "article_summary": "The administration also rolled out a new \u201cReport a Life Change\u201d feature on healthcare.gov, the website that governs the federal insurance exchange for 36 states.\n\u201cAs of this week, consumers are able to report these life events and change or update their coverage directly through the Marketplace.\nStories of people losing access to their old doctor under a new insurance plan had emerged as a central complaint among opponents of the law, who\u2019d warned for months about the disruption it would cause in America\u2019s health insurance market.\nThe new feature will allow consumers to adjust their plans in accordance with changing circumstances like a new baby, a marriage, a relocation, or another life event.\nTo address concerns among some Obamacare enrollees who lost access to their old doctors or found themselves unable to add a new dependent or spouse, President Obama\u2019s administration has tweaked the law\u2019s regulations to provide added flexibility for consumers, CBS News confirms."}
