Diving into the spam folder to rescue legitimate correspondence, they are confronted with seedy missives from the Internet\u2019s dark side\u2014cryptic, misspelled messages from old friends urging them to click a link and reconnect, or else \u201claughably-awful filter-beating projects\u201d seemingly generated by \u201csome huge Dada machine,\u201d to borrow a memorable phrase from the 2013 book Spam by Finn Brunton.\n\nFor these users, spam is at worst a nuisance. With nearly 3 billion users online, however, spam is a nuisance of global consequence and a powerful asymmetric weapon for all manner of bad actors.\n\nIn Spam Nation, journalist Brian Krebs guides readers through the intimidating and technical world of organized cybercrime. It is a world he knows well, having covered it as a beat reporter for the Washington Post before departing the paper to start his own site, krebsonsecurity.com.\n\nAs evidenced by Spam Nation\u2019s cover art, the titular nation is the United States, but it would be more accurate to say that Krebs has written a book about Russia. While Americans are the preferred marks of the billions of spam emails sent every day, the spammers Krebs describes are overwhelmingly from Russia and the former Soviet satellite states\u2014which explains the bad grammar and Cyrillic characters.\n\nKrebs focuses primarily on two spam barons and the nasty feud between them, dubbed the Pharma Wars.\n\nIgor Gusev and Pavel Vrublevsky were co-founders of an e-commerce company, ChronoPay, that processed online transactions for companies without scrutinizing their enterprises too closely. Krebs documents how ChronoPay brokered transactions for extreme pornography sites and \u201cscareware\u201d operations, which effectively hold computers for ransom by infecting them with malware and then offering their users pricey \u201canti-virus\u201d software to remove the problem. Unsurprisingly, both Gusev and Vrublevsky ran their own criminal enterprises on the side.\n\nAfter parting ways with ChronoPay, Gusev founded GlavMed, a chain of online pharmacies that offered inexpensive medications without the prescription requirements and quality control standard maintained by legitimate pharmacies. SpamIt, another Gusev project, blasted out millions of spam emails on GlavMed\u2019s behalf using networks of malware-infected computers, called botnets. Even if the click-through rate from these emails was small\u2014fractions of a percent, in reality\u2014a profit could be made through volume alone.\n\nFor his part, Vrublevsky stayed on as CEO of ChronoPay, which grew to become the largest e-commerce company in Russia. According to ChronoPay\u2019s website, its clients today include Sony, Electronic Arts, Greenpeace, and the World Wildlife Fund. Vrublevsky\u2019s position with ChronoPay lent him a certain public legitimacy which he would later leverage against his former partner.\n\nLike Gusev, Vrublevsky moonlighted as a pharmacy spammer. His network, Rx-Promotions, was instantly in competition with GlavMed for the world\u2019s impotent and infirm. Even as each made a fortune pushing pills, they began to look for ways to hamstring each other.\n\nBy 2010, Krebs was already well-known for his investigative reporting on spam, which had disrupted the operations of criminal outfits such as the Russian Business Network and complicit web hosts such as McColo Corporation. Krebs\u2019 expos\u00e9 on McColo led two major Internet service providers to drop it as a client. The volume of new spam email plummeted by over 50 percent after McColo was shut down, although the spammers were quick to recover.\n\nIn 2010, Krebs began to receive leaks of ChronoPay\u2019s internal information sent by an anonymous hacker. Leaks about GlavMed followed, as Vrublevsky and Gusev traded broadsides in a battle to see who could have the other imprisoned first.\n\nVrublevsky had the \u201claw\u201d\u2014such as there is such a thing in Russia\u2014on his side. Due to his prominence in Russian e-commerce, he was selected to serve on several government campaigns against cybercrime. Vrublevsky used his public perch to target Gusev, even as he funneled millions of his own money to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to protect himself from prosecution.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. The Pharma Wars ended in mutual destruction, with Vrublevsky cooling his heels in a Russian prison camp and Gusev on the run from an Interpol rap.\n\nThe power struggle Krebs depicts in Spam Nation is illustrative of many things, among them the Russian shakedown business, where criminals use the law \u201cas both sword and shield,\u201d in the words of Thomas Firestone, a U.S. Department of Justice legal adviser in Moscow.\n\nThe tale also illustrates the bizarre world inhabited by professional spammers. As told in Brian McWilliam\u2019s book Spam Kings, many spammers are disaffected oddballs. An extreme example is Andrew Greenbaum, a chess-playing Jew turned neo-Nazi (\u201cDavis Wolfgang Hawke\u201d) who peddled penis enlargement pills before AOL hit him with a lawsuit in 2005. Out of luck, Hawke made for the ratlines and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. His fortune is rumored to be buried on his parents\u2019 property in Massachusetts.\n\nThat a lone neo-Nazi can marshal the resources to send malware to half the world points to spam\u2019s most frightening aspect: its potential as weapon. While a million emails sent to a million addresses is a headache, a million emails sent to one address is a crippling blow.\n\nAmong the first to allegedly weaponize spam was\u2014and here we are again\u2014Russia. In 2007, the Estonian government announced that it was relocating a World War II monument dedicated to the Red Army, the liberators who never left. Shortly thereafter, the country\u2019s information infrastructure was crippled by a distributed denial of service attack carried out by massive spam botnets. The government in Moscow, Estonia claimed, was making its displeasure known.\n\nRussia is not alone. States such as China and Iran are all waking to the asymmetric promise of cyber warfare against a conventional behemoth like the United States. As are terrorist groups, a fact that led Assistant Attorney General John P. Carlin to warn that the United States is \u201cin a pre-9/11 moment, in some respects, with cyber.\u201d\n\nFuture wars will be waged in part by talented hackers with bot armies at their backs. For now, we have Krebs as a guide, and\u2014thankfully\u2014email filters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Brian Krebs\u2019 \u2018Spam Nation\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "For ordinary Internet users, email spam is an inconvenience and a mystery.
