Report: New York Obamacare exchanges money losers Losses by insurers raising questions

Albany

Though New York's Obamacare exchange has increased the number of state residents with insurance, losses sustained by participating insurance companies over the last two years raise concerns about the online market's sustainability, according to a report released Tuesday by the financial services company Standard & Poor's.

The state's exchange, called NY State of Health, was created in October 2013 to meet the requirements of the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

"If the experience in New York is any indication of how the rest of the country is managing through the initial years of the ACA, we can expect it to be a bumpy ride," the report concludes.

Three-quarters of the insurers participating in New York's exchange reported operating losses for their health plans sold to individuals in 2014, the report states. The state's insurance regulator, the Department of Financial Services, denied full rate increase requests from all but five insurers operating on the exchange.

In light of the report, the New York Health Plan Association, which represents insurance companies, renewed its call for reform of the state's rate-setting system, which requires insurers to get approval each year for premium rates for the following year's enrollment period.
