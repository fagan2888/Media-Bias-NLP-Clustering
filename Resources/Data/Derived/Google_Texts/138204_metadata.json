President Obama should urge the parties to quickly resolve their differences, get back to work, and keep the ports open.\u201d\n\nThe current contract between the union that represents West Coast port workers, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU); and the group that represent port operators, the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), was supposed to expire in July.\n\nNegotiators have thus far been unable to agree to more than temporary extensions, and a federal mediator was brought in to help resolve the outstanding issues earlier this month.\n\nThe labor strife at West Coast ports has worried retail groups in Washington about the economic impact of a potential shutdown, which they say would be catastrophic to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe National Retail Federation and National Association of Manufacturers said in a study conducted in 2014 that a shutdown of ports in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle would cost the U.S. economy almost $2 billion per day.\n\n\u201cThe last prolonged port shutdown of the West Coast ports was the 10-day lockout in 2002 which some estimate cost the U.S. economy close to $1 billion a day and took months to recover from,\u201d the groups said.\n\n\u201cThe NRF-NAM study estimates that a five-day stoppage would reduce GDP by $1.9 billion a day,\u201d the statement on the study continued. \u201cThis would increase exponentially with a 20-day stoppage resulting in a loss of $2.5 billion a day.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have also expressed concerns about the potential for a work stoppage at ports along the West Coast.\n\n\u201cTime is absolutely of the essence because significant economic damage has already been done to those people and businesses that rely on the efficient functioning of our ports,\u201d Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats from California, wrote in a letter to leaders on both sides of the standoff earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThe economic impact of the increased congestion at the ports is simply unacceptable and unsustainable,\u201d Feinstein and Boxer continued. \u201cAt the time of this writing, seventeen ships are anchored at bay awaiting the opportunity to come into port at the Port of Oakland. Twenty-two ships are anchored at bay awaiting the chance to dock at the Los Angeles - Long Beach Port Complex. As we understand it, in normal times these ships rarely have to wait to dock. Ships have been diverted from California ports in search of more efficient offloading sites. Long term damage to the competitiveness of California ports may have already occurred. These are terrible circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe port operators\u2019 group has blamed the cargo ship congestion along the West Coast on a slowdown they say is being purposely conducted by the dockworkers\u2019 union.\n\n\u201cThe PMA has a sense of urgency to resolve these contract talks and get our ports moving again,\u201d PMA spokesman Steve Getzug said in a statement last month. \u201cUnfortunately, it appears the union\u2019s motivation is to continue slowdowns in an attempt to gain leverage in the bargaining. The ILWU slowdowns and the resulting operational environment are no longer sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe dockworkers\u2019 union is offering a starkly different take, blaming port managers for cargo congestion.\n\n\u201cLongshore workers are ready, willing and able to clear the backlog created by the industry\u2019s poor decisions,\u201d ILWU President Bob McEllrath responded in a statement of his own. \u201cThe employer is making nonsensical moves like cutting back on shifts at a critical time, creating gridlock in a cynical attempt to turn public opinion against workers. This creates an incendiary atmosphere during negotiations and does nothing to get us closer to an agreement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Chamber presses for West Coast port labor resolution", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-10T16:38-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Chamber presses for West Coast port labor resolution", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/232351-chamber-presses-for-west-coast-port-labor-resolution", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/shipping-containers_getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-10T16:38:45-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/232351-chamber-presses-for-west-coast-port-labor-resolution", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-10T16:38-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Chamber of Commerce, International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Pacific Maritime Association, West Coast port labor fight,Thomas Donohue,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-10T16:38:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-10T16:38:45-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/232351-chamber-presses-for-west-coast-port-labor-resolution", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Chamber presses for West Coast port labor resolution"}}, "article_summary": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pushing for a resolution to a labor standoff that is threatening the flow of cargo packages at ports along the West Coast.\n\u201cThe Chamber is increasingly hearing from companies and industries whose business operations are being adversely affected by the serious slowdown surrounding the labor contract negotiations at the West Coast ports,\u201d Donohue said in a statement.\nThe labor strife at West Coast ports has worried retail groups in Washington about the economic impact of a potential shutdown, which they say would be catastrophic to the nation\u2019s economy.\nADVERTISEMENTDonohue said the impact of the labor fight on the movement of cargo into the U.S. was great that the Obama administration should consider stepping in to resolve the port labor issues.\n\u201cThe last prolonged port shutdown of the West Coast ports was the 10-day lockout in 2002 which some estimate cost the U.S. economy close to $1 billion a day and took months to recover from,\u201d the groups said."}
