As my friend Brian Costello from The Hockey News pointed out on Friday, the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee meets Monday to determine its pool for the class of 2014. And Peter Forsberg should be a lock for nomination.

As Costello wrote:

“Injuries limited Forsberg to 708 NHL regular season games, but he was magical when he was healthy. A two-time Cup with Colorado, Forsberg ranks among all-time NHL leaders in points per game (eighth at 1.25) and assists per game (fifth at .90). Few players in the game’s history played with the Swede’s combination of exceptional vision and physical style. Forsberg won the Hart Trophy in 2002-03, was a first-team all-star three times and also won the Art Ross and Calder trophies.”

I’ve said this before: Forsberg was the most talented player I ever saw in his prime — that I covered, in his prime, anyway. Foppa was magic on skates. Unfortunately, the magic was limited because of all those injuries.
