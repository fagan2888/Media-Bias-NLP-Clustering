They set out to test the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between the frequency in which bribes are requested (and presumably granted) and the waiting time to obtain a permit or license.\n\nThey found that firms confronted with demands for side payments had to wait longer for action than those that were not asked for bribes. According to a blog post by Rijkers, statistical analysis suggests that such firms take about 1.5 times longer to get a construction permit, operating license, or electrical connection; and 1.2 to 1.4 times longer to clear customs, all else being equal.\n\nRelated: Americans More Concerned About Over-Regulation Than Economic Inequality\n\n\u201cOur econometric analysis rejects the idea that corruption is somehow more beneficial for firms who are more likely to pay, or in countries where regulations are more burdensome,\u201d said Rijkers, who did the study with Caroline Freund, Mary Hallward-Driemeier and Varanya Chaubey. \u201cPut simply, it rejects the hypothesis that corruption \u2018greases the wheels.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe researchers\u2019 findings are reassuring in one sense, in that the corruption that permeates many aspects of global government activities doesn\u2019t always pay off. The report also hints at a larger point: that overly complex and time-consuming government regulations foster corruption by providing bureaucrats with increased opportunities to shake down applicants, many of whom are often more than willing to pay money under the table to expedite an application or review.\n\n\u201cMy advice to countries that want to reduce corruption is get rid of unnecessary paperwork, simplify regulations and use technology as much as possible, because \u2013 for example \u2013 one-stop online registration forms don\u2019t ask for bribes,\u201d said Freund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe study has one shortcoming that makes sweeping generalizations more difficult to make, however. While the questionnaires used in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys asked firms whether they were asked to pay bribes, they were not asked whether they actually paid the bribes.\n\nFreund says that few companies are willing to own up to having paid a bribe to do business \u2013 but they don\u2019t mind saying whether someone tried to shake them down. Even so, she said, a lot of research has shown that data on the number of people asked to pay a bribe \u201cis more highly associated with true levels of corruption than asking the question, \u2018Did you pay a bribe?\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, while it\u2019s likely that many of those firms approached did indeed pay a bribe, many others may have balked at the request \u2013 and ended up being penalized by having to wait even longer than those who weren\u2019t asked to pay a bribe. Rijkers is dismissive of any concerns about the limitations of the data.\n\n\u201cWe rule out the possibility that the explanation for these delays is that firms that reported demands for bribes are somehow special \u2026 by comparing wait times incurred by the same firm across different applications,\u201d he wrote in his blog.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s long been an article of faith that the wheels of government bureaucracies turn mo", "title": "New Study Proves that Every Man Doesn\u2019t Have His Price", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/22/New-Study-Proves-Every-Man-Doesn-t-Have-His-Price", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03192012_gov_corruption_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/22/New-Study-Proves-Every-Man-Doesn-t-Have-His-Price", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03192012_gov_corruption_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s long been an article of faith that the wheels of government bureaucracies turn mo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While the questionnaires used in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys asked firms whether they were asked to pay bribes, they were not asked whether they actually paid the bribes.\nThe researchers used data that firms provided in response to the World Bank Enterprise Surveys of 107 countries.\nThey found that firms confronted with demands for side payments had to wait longer for action than those that were not asked for bribes.\nThe study has one shortcoming that makes sweeping generalizations more difficult to make, however.\nAccording to a blog post by Rijkers, statistical analysis suggests that such firms take about 1.5 times longer to get a construction permit, operating license, or electrical connection; and 1.2 to 1.4 times longer to clear customs, all else being equal."}
