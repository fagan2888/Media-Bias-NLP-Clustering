Secretary of State John Kerry, in particular, delivered mixed messages. From \u201cwar is the wrong terminology,\u201d to \u201cyes, we are at war with ISIL,\u201d and finally arriving at, \u201cI think it's a waste of time to focus on [what terminology is used],\u201d Kerry covered the spectrum of available responses.\n\nNevertheless, the most unsettling answer that Kerry gave was that semantics are \u201ca waste of time.\u201d He could not be more incorrect.\n\nControlling the narrative of this conflict is paramount, especially in regards to how it impacts the international community\u2019s perception of the Islamic State. With that considered, Obama should use a tactic from one of his own, self-professed heroes\u2014President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhen the southern states seceded from the Union, their first goal was to attract and define a sense of legitimacy for their new, self-declared nation. Lincoln recognized this, and the implications of semantics going forward. Lincoln not only refused to recognize the Confederacy as a legitimate nation-state, he even refused to recognize the conflict itself as a lawful secession. Lincoln repeatedly referred to the southern cause as nothing more than a \u201crebellion.\u201d In a July 1861 Special Message to Congress, Lincoln explained that, \u201cIt might seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the present movement at the South be called \u2018secession\u2019 or \u2018rebellion.\u2019 The movers, however, well understand the difference.\u201d In other words, Lincoln meant to convey that by defining the conflict as a \u201crebellion,\u201d it robbed the Confederacy the legitimacy of being a nation-state. In this sense, Lincoln\u2019s first priority was to define the conflict and control the narrative on the Union\u2019s terms.\n\nSimilarly, the Islamic State is wasting no time in defining the narrative. Following Obama\u2019s primetime announcement, the Islamic State released a video entitled \u201cFlames of War: Fighting has just begun,\u201d with all the trappings of a movie trailer. The video is a strong indication that the Islamic State wants the ensuing conflict portrayed as \u201cThe United States vs. the Islamic State.\u201d Obama should not grant them this sense of legitimacy. Instead, the Obama administration should stick to its original narrative\u2014that the conflict with the Islamic State is not a separate war of one nation-state against another. Rather, the conflict is another component of the U.S.\u2019s larger campaign against international, Islamic terrorism.\n\nNone of this is to say that the U.S. should take the threat any more lightly. The end-game remains the Islamic State\u2019s destruction. Again, while Lincoln relegated the southern cause to a mere rebellion, it did not stop him from waging total war on the southern states to achieve victory. Likewise, though the U.S. is engaged in a \u201csustained counterterrorism operation\u201d rather than a full-blown \u201cwar,\u201d it does not mean the U.S. is not focused on wiping the Islamic State from the face of the earth.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s primary purpose is to establish itself as a functioning, self-declared nation-state. It is clear that the Islamic State\u2019s strategic goals span beyond the functions of a conventional terrorist organization. Its establishment of an Islamic neo-caliphate makes that abundantly clear. Consequently, if Obama wishes to engage the Islamic State, he should define it on the U.S.\u2019s terms. To Kerry and others, this may appear to be \u201ca waste of time,\u201d or a meaningless game of words. To the \u201cmovers,\u201d however, it is not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In war, the first battle is to define the conflict; the second is to control the narrative..05/26/2016 1:47:54AM EST.", "author": "Joshua Holdenried", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "In war, the first battle is to define the conflict; the second is to control the narrative.", "title": "- War of the Words\u2014Using the Lincoln Strategy Against the Islamic State", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/joshuaholdenried/2014/09/26/war-of-the-wordsusing-the-lincoln-strategy-against-the-islamic-state-n1897140", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/323/c295f0f1-b29c-4a2e-9f21-4160244f148f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "In war, the first battle is to define the conflict; the second is to control the narrative.", "title": "- War of the Words\u2014Using the Lincoln Strategy Against the Islamic State", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/joshuaholdenried/2014/09/26/war-of-the-wordsusing-the-lincoln-strategy-against-the-islamic-state-n1897140", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/323/c295f0f1-b29c-4a2e-9f21-4160244f148f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "War of the Words\u2014Using the Lincoln Strategy Against the Islamic State, Joshua Holdenried, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15db\"", "article_summary": "The video is a strong indication that the Islamic State wants the ensuing conflict portrayed as \u201cThe United States vs. the Islamic State.\u201d Obama should not grant them this sense of legitimacy.\nConsequently, if Obama wishes to engage the Islamic State, he should define it on the U.S.\u2019s terms.\nSimilarly, the Islamic State is wasting no time in defining the narrative.\nIt is clear that the Islamic State\u2019s strategic goals span beyond the functions of a conventional terrorist organization.\nControlling the narrative of this conflict is paramount, especially in regards to how it impacts the international community\u2019s perception of the Islamic State."}
