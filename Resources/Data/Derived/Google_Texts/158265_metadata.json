Deemed the \u201cWorld\u2019s Ugliest Woman\u201d in a YouTube video that went viral when she was in high school, Vel\u00e1squez has a rare syndrome that makes her look a lot older than she is and prevents her from gaining weight. Through it all, the Texas State University alumna says that she\u2019s going to let her inner beauty define her, not what people think of her outer appearance. Vel\u00e1squez has become a motivational speaker, asking audiences, \u201cHow do you define yourself?\u201d\n\n\"It's not easy, I will be the first to tell you it's not easy,\" Vel\u00e1squez told Dr. Drew Pinsky on an episode of his show in 2012. \"I may have this outer exterior of people saying, 'She can handle everything, she's dealt with this for so long,' and to be honest, I'm human and of course these things are going to hurt.\"\n\nVel\u00e1squez has a rare condition that prevents her from gaining weight, even though she eats every 15 minutes. The Texas native has never weighed more than 64 pounds in her entire life, the International Business Times reported. Her condition also causes an accelerated aging of her face and body that makes her look decades older. Though doctors haven\u2019t quite pinpointed what Vel\u00e1squez has, some experts believe she has a form of neonatal progeroid syndrome, also known as Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS). The genetic disorder is extremely rare, with only one or two people in the world currently living with it. The syndrome is characterized by elderly appearance, inability to store body fat, thin skin, and rigid joints.\n\nWith the support of her family, Vel\u00e1squez has not let her condition or people\u2019s cruelty define how she moves through life. Instead, she rises above the negativity by disseminating a message of love and respect for yourself and others. Her \u201cHow do you define yourself?\u201d TED talk has already garnered close to half a million views on YouTube. Vel\u00e1squez has also authored three books, including one entitled Be Beautiful, Be You.\n\n\"I've had a really difficult life, but that's OK,\" Vel\u00e1squez said. \"I'm going to let my goals and my success and my accomplishments define me, not my outer appearance.\"\n\nWatch Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s captivating talk below, as well as a short clip from when she was featured on the Discovery Channel:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lizzie vel\u00e1squez, world's ugliest woman, neonatal progeroid syndrome, motivational speaker", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Lizzie Vel\u00e1squez, once deemed the \"world's ugliest woman,\" has a rare genetic disorder that prevents her from gaining weight.
