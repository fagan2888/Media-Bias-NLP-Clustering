Thus far Bush has been able to raise a substantial amount of money and has a PAC supporting him with over 100 million dollars, giving him the most money to spend out of all Republicans running. Still Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign has been one mistake after another, and he has failed to maintain his front runner status. Unless Bush can turn his campaign around, and quickly, it is time for Jeb to move on.\n\n2) Chris Christie\n\nIn 2012 Chris Christie decided not to run for president, even though he would have been the immediate front runner. In 2016 Christie is falling behind the in the polls and was just recently demoted to the \u201cJV\u201d debate. Due to the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal and an incredibly crowded field, Christie is struggling to raise money and his poll numbers. Soon it will be time for Christie to end his lackluster campaign.\n\n3) Mike Huckabee\n\nMike Huckabee had great success in 2008, even winning Iowa. In 2016 Huckabee isn\u2019t even polling in the top five in Iowa, a state which ideologically couldn\u2019t be a better fit for Huckabee. Huckabee is struggling heavily to gain any press or recognition, and failed to qualify for the last primetime debate. Huckabee\u2019s next step should be ending his run for president.\n\n4) Carly Fiorina\n\nCarly\u2019s campaign started off with several terrific debate performances and punch lines. After the 2nd GOP debate on CNN, Carly appeared to be on her way to stardom. However as time has passed, she continues to use the same one liners and her lack of experience in foreign policy has hurt her poll numbers tremendously. As entertaining as a Carly vs Hillary debate would be, it has become very clear it will not occur. Fiorina would make a very strong Vice President, but it is time for her to end her run at being President.\n\n5) Ted Cruz\n\nPerhaps the least obvious candidate on this list, Ted Cruz is climbing in the polls and continues to raise enough money to run a top notch grassroots campaign. Sadly for Cruz his platform will only take him so far, in a general election against Hillary Clinton, Cruz is losing in almost every single poll. If Cruz cannot win the general election, then what is the point in him running for the nomination? If Cruz honestly wanted to be the President of United States he would not have taken countless partisan stances on issues Independents will never support. It is time for Ted Cruz to end his campaign and continue to work towards limited government as a U.S. Senator.\n\nFollow the author on Twitter: @thomashern4\n\nRead more at hypeline.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here are 5 candidates that may not be so obvious, but should still drop out now.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "Here are 5 candidates that may not be so obvious, but should still drop out now.", "title": "5 Not-So-Obvious Candidates Who Should Drop Out", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AP_Chris_Christie_ml_140109_16x9_992-620x350.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/5-not-so-obvious-candidates-who-should-drop-out/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AP_Chris_Christie_ml_140109_16x9_992-620x350.jpg", "description": "Here are 5 candidates that may not be so obvious, but should still drop out now.", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "5 Not-So-Obvious Candidates Who Should Drop Out"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Headline News", "tag": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-12-10T12:12:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "5 Not-So-Obvious Candidates Who Should Drop OutFrom our friends at hypeline.orgThomas Hern1) Jeb BushWhen Jeb Bush announced his run for the presidency he was the unanimous front runner.\nIt is time for Ted Cruz to end his campaign and continue to work towards limited government as a U.S.\nStill Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign has been one mistake after another, and he has failed to maintain his front runner status.\nDue to the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal and an incredibly crowded field, Christie is struggling to raise money and his poll numbers.\n2) Chris ChristieIn 2012 Chris Christie decided not to run for president, even though he would have been the immediate front runner."}
