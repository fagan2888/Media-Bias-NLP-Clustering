David Vitter (R-La.), its presumed target. Vitter, who survived a prostitution scandal in 2007, called on Friday for an ethics probe of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).\n\nWithout mentioning prostitution explicitly, Vitter accused the Democratic senators of violating rules for \"proposing and circulating through the press legislation that ties Members\u2019 personal healthcare benefits to their performance of specific acts and votes.\"\n\n\"Senator Vitter's charges are absurd and baseless,\" said Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Reid. \"This is nothing more than Senator Vitter's desperate attempt to change the subject from his previous ethics issues.\"\n\nThe proposed legislation would make any senator who a congressional ethics panel has \"probable cause\" to believe solicited prostitutes ineligible for for congressional health insurance. A Democratic aide estimated the federal government has spent $112,624.88 on its share of Vitter's premiums since 1999, when he first entered Congress, assuming the feds have paid 75 percent of a standard HMO plan.\n\nThe dispute began when Vitter demanded a vote on an amendment repealing a rule allowing the federal government to continue to pay its portion of lawmakers' and aides' premiums in the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats responded by shining the spotlight on Vitter's role in the \"D.C. Madam\" scandal, when he was revealed to be a client of a prostitution service in 2007. He apologized for a \"very serious sin.\" Deborah Jeane Palfrey, the woman convicted for running the prostitution ring , was later found dead of an apparent suicide.\n\nQuestions for Senators Reid and Boxer, and Their Staffs\n\nIf Senators Reid and Boxer, and their staffs, assert that they have not been involved in this Democratic intimidation and payoff scheme, then they should be forced by your Committee to answer the following questions under threat of perjury:\n\n1) When did you become aware of the Democratic-lead plan to tie Senators\u2019 personal healthcare benefits to their official actions? Have you, as Senate Majority Leader and Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, taken any actions to prevent this bribery scheme from being implemented?\n\n2) The news organization Politico has reported that this scheme was \u201cdrafted by staff in response to requests by several Democratic senators\u2026it was discussed at a Senate Democratic lunch on Thursday.\u201d Who are the Democratic staff members that drafted this legislation?\n\n3) Who specifically are the \u201cseveral Democratic senators\u201d who requested that this legislation be drafted?\n\n4) Did Senators Reid and Boxer attend the referenced Senate Democratic lunch where this legislation was discussed? If yes, were either or both of them a part of such discussion?\n\n5) Was ethics guidance requested from this Committee by the involved staffers and/or the several Democratic Senators who proposed this bribery scheme? If so, what guidance was provided?\n\nRequest for Chair Boxer\u2019s Recusal\n\nThe Chair of the Ethics Committee is in a position of unique importance, and her integrity and credibility must be beyond reproach. Until sworn answers are provided to the above outlined questions that prove she was not in any way involved in the development of the outlined intimidation tactics, I respectfully request that Chair Boxer recuse herself from this matter. It is absurd on its face to think that the Committee can fairly and impartially address the potential ethics violations outlined herein when the Committee\u2019s Chair and her staff appear to have orchestrated them in the first place, or at best were aware of them and did nothing to stop the violations, therefore becoming co-conspirators.\n\nThis situation is especially egregious because news reports indicate that the Democratic scheme includes use of the Senate Ethics Committee process to intimidate senators and influence their official actions and votes.\n\nUpon proof or Senator Boxer\u2019s complicity in this scheme, the minimum consequence for such behavior should be her removal from the Committee.\n\nFacts and Precedent\n\nIn response to my proposal and call for a vote on my amendment to reverse the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Congressional exemption from the Affordable Care Act, Senator Reid and Boxer have apparently lead an effort to employ political scare tactics, personal attacks, and threats that would affect each Senator\u2019s personal finances (i.e. bribery). News reports indicate that one of these proposals would prohibit the employer contribution to any \u201cMember of Congress who has offered an amendment in the House of Representatives or the Senate that would prohibit such contributions on behalf of other individuals, or who has voted for the adoption of such an amendment.\u201d Such an arrangement, whereby the Senate Majority Leader and the Chair of this Committee are threatening to take away their colleagues\u2019 healthcare coverage subsidy if they do not vote a certain way, at worst constitutes bribery and a quid pro quo arrangement, and at best amounts to improper conduct reflecting discreditably on the Senate.\n\nEven if the proposed amendment is not actually introduced, the fact that such legislation has not only been drafted, but also released to the press, has already induced the intended intimidating effect. Politico described the scheme as \u201ca hardball move\u201d by the perpetrators, and the ethics violation has now occurred.\n\nThe Senate Ethics Manual makes clear that personal financial penalties may not be used to induce Senators to take an official act. In addition, this Committee has been clear that Senators may not hold government officials captive by tying their personal finances or benefits to their official acts. As recently as 2012, this Committee explained:\n\nAs stated in the Code of Ethics for Government Service, \u201cpublic office is a public trust.\u201d A government employee must not be influenced by extraneous factors when making decisions and \u201cnever accept for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.\u201d\n\nIn this case, Senator Reid's and Senator Boxer\u2019s tying Senators\u2019 personal healthcare benefits to their official actions undermines these principles. If a senator voted for Senator Reid's and Senator Boxer\u2019s favored amendment, and against my amendment, it would appear that his or her decision was based on personal interests, and not the public interest.\n\nIn addition, the federal bribery statute makes it a crime to \u201cdirectly or indirectly, corruptly give[], offer[] or promise[] anything of value to any public official \u2026 with intent \u2026 to influence any official act.\u201d The phrase \u2018anything of value\u2019 in bribery and related statutes has consistently been given a broad meaning, to carry out the congressional purpose of punishing misuse of public office.\u201d Just as Courts have recognized that the promise of higher-paying employment is a \u201cthing of value\u201d for purposes of the statute, the employer contribution that is being threatened to be withheld from Members who do not vote the way that Senators Reid and Boxer prefer is clearly also a \u201cthing of value,\u201d and therefore subjects the members and staff involved in this scheme to potential bribery prosecution.\n\nI request that the Committee immediately investigate Senator Reid's and Senator Boxer\u2019s attempt to induce official action by their Senate colleagues by threatening to take away their healthcare benefits if they do not vote for their proposal and against my amendment.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDavid Vitter\n\nUnited States Senate", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- A proposed Democratic amendment barring senators who have been investigated for soliciting prostitutes from receiving health insurance has ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-14 16:32:58 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A proposed Democratic amendment barring senators who have been investigated for soliciting prostitutes from receiving health insurance has ...", "title": "Senator Who Survived Prostitution Scandal Calls For An Ethics Probe Of His Colleagues", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/13/david-vitter-ethics_n_3922350.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1352361/images/o-DAVID-VITTER-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- A proposed Democratic amendment barring senators who have been investigated for soliciting prostitutes from receiving health insurance has ...", "creator": "johnson", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1352361/images/o-DAVID-VITTER-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Senator Who Survived Prostitution Scandal Calls For An Ethics Probe Of His Colleagues", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-13 16:32:58 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3922350", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "david vitter harry reid,David Vitter prostitution,david vitter barbara boxer,david vitter ethics,David Vitter,senator david vitter", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "david vitter harry reid,David Vitter prostitution,david vitter barbara boxer,david vitter ethics,David Vitter,senator david vitter", "published_time": "2013-09-13 16:32:58 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-13 18:06:04 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8fb\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- A proposed Democratic amendment barring senators who have been investigated for soliciting prostitutes from receiving health insurance has hit a nerve with Sen.
