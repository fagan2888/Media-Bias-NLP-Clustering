To do this, facilities are turning to clinical decision support (CDS) systems.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a CDS and an RBM is that clicking a button with a CDS and clinical physician order entry is a lot cheaper than making a phone call to a real person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could save millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe body of literature showing the effectiveness of CDS systems is growing, he said, and the ACR continues to lobby the U.S. Congress for a mandate that practices and hospitals individually implement some type of CDS. There are a wide variety of CDS systems available, including the ACR\u2019s version, ACR Select.\n\nUltimately, Halabi said, the hope is that CDS systems will guide referring physicians and facilities to order the most appropriate exam for each patient, eliminating the need for preauthorization from an RBM. Already, there are legislative efforts in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Boston that would require insurance payers to accept CDS use in lieu of RBM preauthorization.\n\nThe federal government has also taken steps in this direction with the Oct. 30 release of a policy draft from both the U.S. House and Senate that would penalize providers who don\u2019t consult appropriateness criteria before ordering an imaging study and would mandate some type of CDS for referring physicians who are outliers when compared to their peers.\n\nThere are challenges to reaching this widespread CDS use, however, he said. Many physicians ask other providers, such as nurses or physician\u2019s assistants, to order imaging studies, and those individuals could have limited knowledge of the patient\u2019s medical history or could be unaware of the need to follow appropriateness criteria.\n\n\u201cThe train is coming \u2014 these things are already appearing in legislation,\u201d Halabi said. \u201cWe will soon be able to determine whether we as clinicians have to not only support the use of CDS but implement one, as well.\u201d\n\nDose documentation laws\n\nThere are also efforts underway at the state level to get radiologists more directly involved with double-checking dose levels before a study begins, and California is leading the charge. Prompted by a 2010 incident where a clinic in Cedar Sinai Medical Center accidentally overdosed hundreds of patients receiving CT scans over an 18-month period, a California law now requires the radiologist to be responsible for recording the dose level.\n\nThere are two main ways for radiologists to comply with the law, said Jonathan Breslau, MD, president and chairman of the board at Radiological Associates of Sacramento. Providers can either catch inappropriate dose levels in dictated reports or they can use a structured reporting system that requires dose information to be included before the radiologist can sign off on the report.\n\nThe result, he said, has been significant. Of the 150 affected radiology practices, 45 percent report an increased awareness of appropriateness criteria, and 20 percent have used this information to change their scan parameters. There is still room for improvement, but these results are a move in the right direction, he said.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that radiologists should own this, and they should be thinking about this all the time,\u201d said Breslau, who is also a council steering committee member for the ACR. \u201cIt should be viewed as something positive. We have an important tool; it\u2019s lifesaving, and it can influence care dramatically. We need to be responsible stewards of how it\u2019s implemented.\u201d\n\nImpact on mobile medical technology\n\nEarlier this year, the radiology community waited with bated breath for the FDA to release its guidance on the use of mobile medical apps for smartphones and tablets. This direction was released in late September, defining mobile medical apps and addressing what must be done to make them safe and effective.\n\nHowever, current legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives could strip the FDA of its regulatory authority over medical mobile apps. Known as the SOFTWARE Act \u2014 the Sensible Oversight for Technology Which Advances Regulatory Efficiency Act \u2014 the legislation seeks to provide regulatory clarity on mobile medical apps, CDS, electronic health records, and software upgrades.\n\n\u201cAs it\u2019s written, the SOFTWARE Act says the FDA lacks the necessary tools to oversee mobile medical apps without overstepping its authority,\u201d said David Hirschorn, MD, director of radiology informatics at Staten Island University Hospital. \u201cBut, the bill wouldn\u2019t give the FDA the tools to assert that authority. Rather it tailors and curtails that authority.\u201d\n\nIf passed, he said, the bill would benefit vendors the most, allowing them to create apps and market them as medical tools without having to work with the FDA. It would also mean the FDA could exercise no regulatory control over CDS systems.\n\nWith no companion bill in the U.S. Senate, though, the SOFTWARE Act is unlikely to move forward in the near future, Hirschorn said. He recommended radiologists take advantage of this time to contact their legislators to share their insight on the importance of the FDA\u2019s regulatory powers.", "article_metadata": {"dc.date": "2013-12-24", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Several federal and state initiatives could impact how providers order studies and report results and whether new technologies are rigorously vetted."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebc0\"", "article_summary": "However, current legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives could strip the FDA of its regulatory authority over medical mobile apps.\nThis direction was released in late September, defining mobile medical apps and addressing what must be done to make them safe and effective.\nKnown as the SOFTWARE Act \u2014 the Sensible Oversight for Technology Which Advances Regulatory Efficiency Act \u2014 the legislation seeks to provide regulatory clarity on mobile medical apps, CDS, electronic health records, and software upgrades.\nWe need to be responsible stewards of how it\u2019s implemented.\u201dImpact on mobile medical technologyEarlier this year, the radiology community waited with bated breath for the FDA to release its guidance on the use of mobile medical apps for smartphones and tablets.\n\u201cAs it\u2019s written, the SOFTWARE Act says the FDA lacks the necessary tools to oversee mobile medical apps without overstepping its authority,\u201d said David Hirschorn, MD, director of radiology informatics at Staten Island University Hospital."}
