The law requires that any FDA-approved form of birth control, including the pill, UID\u2019s or patches, be provided without cost-sharing as long as the patient has a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nIn a statement to House Representative Jackie Speier, however, CVS admitted to charging approximately 11,000 women for the drugs and said that it had been caused by a \u201cdrug price coding error\u201d in the computer system.\n\nRead More: Birth Control Supreme Court Decision\n\nSpeier\u2019s office became aware of the problem after a staff member encountered it and sent a September 9 letter to the company and CEO Larry Merlo. In its response, CVS noted the computer error. Merlo promised to resolve it by September 26 and send refunds to the effected customers; all checks should arrive by October 1.\n\nIn addition to CVS, isolated incidents have been reported at Walgreens and Target pharmacies. These issues remain under investigation.\n\nAlthough a major goal of the ACA is to expand and guarantee free birth control for women, a recent study out of the Guttmacher Institute shows that goal coming true for only about 67% of women.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many reasons why it\u2019s not 100%,\u201d said Judy Waxman, vice president for health and reproductive rights with the Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cOne thing is that this doesn\u2019t apply to all people on Medicaid, and of course 23 states haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, so when you\u2019re looking at all women there\u2019s a lot of holes. The other thing is that the plans that this applies to are un-grandfathered, meaning that they\u2019ve changed their plans since the ACA passed in a significant enough way [to have to meet the law\u2019s requirements]. At this point 75% of employer plans are un-grandfathered, and over the next several years they\u2019ll all be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "The Affordable Care Act requires that any FDA-approved form of birth control, including the pill, UID\u2019s or patches, be provided without cost-sharing as long as the patient has a prescription.", "author": "Eric Reed", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "The Affordable Care Act requires that any FDA-approved form of birth control, including the pill, UID\u2019s or patches, be provided without cost-sharing as long as the patient has a prescription.", "title": "CVS Caught Overcharging Women for Birth Control Covered by Obamacare", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/cvs-caught-overcharging-women-for-birth-control-covered-by-obamacare", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/cvs25-large.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/cvs25-large.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "date": "2014-09-25T17:16Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "cvs, overcharging for birth control, personal finance, obamacare, affordable care act, the pill, uids", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "uids", "published_time": "2014-09-25T17:16Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611368"}, "guid": 12893240, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act requires that any FDA-approved form of birth control, including the pill, UID\u2019s or patches, be provided without cost-sharing as long as the patient has a prescription.", "title": "CVS Caught Overcharging Women for Birth Control Covered by Obamacare", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/cvs-caught-overcharging-women-for-birth-control-covered-by-obamacare", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/cvs25-large.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/cvs25-large.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cvs, overcharging for birth control, personal finance, obamacare, affordable care act, the pill, uids"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd143e\"", "article_summary": "The law requires that any FDA-approved form of birth control, including the pill, UID\u2019s or patches, be provided without cost-sharing as long as the patient has a doctor\u2019s prescription.\nAlthough a major goal of the ACA is to expand and guarantee free birth control for women, a recent study out of the Guttmacher Institute shows that goal coming true for only about 67% of women.\nRead More: Birth Control Supreme Court DecisionSpeier\u2019s office became aware of the problem after a staff member encountered it and sent a September 9 letter to the company and CEO Larry Merlo.\nAt this point 75% of employer plans are un-grandfathered, and over the next several years they\u2019ll all be.\u201d\nIn addition to CVS, isolated incidents have been reported at Walgreens and Target pharmacies."}
