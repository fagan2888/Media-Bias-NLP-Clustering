(Photo: William Petroski/The Register)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Ben Carson doesn\u2019t think hardship and hurdles are necessarily bad, but he says he disagrees with liberal critics who claim he wants to pull away government safety nets that provide opportunities for many Americans to escape poverty.\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth. Some people are very skillful liars. They think they will throw out a headline and people will believe it,\u201d the Republican presidential candidate told a Des Moines Rotary Club breakfast crowd of more than 100 people Friday.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I would like to do is to provide a ladder for people on the lower rungs of society to climb up and not be dependent on something else. I think that is what is destroying our society. We are going from a \u2018can-do\u2019 society to a \u2018what-can-you-do-for-me' society?\u201d\n\nCarson, who grew up poor in Detroit and became an internationally known neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, spoke passionately about his belief that education can help anyone become successful in America.\n\nHe explained how he and his wife founded a scholarship program that includes a reading room project to help children develop literacy skills, and he said his presidential candidacy is driven by his concerns the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nThe best education is provided at home through home schooling, Carson said, followed by private schools, charter schools, and public schools. He added that he favors a voucher system for educational choice so that children are not stuck in failing school systems.\n\nAsked about the U.S. Department of Education, Carson described it as federal agency that is bloated with inefficiency and with employees who are overpaid \u201cand don\u2019t do anything.\u201d The department should be shrunk in size, he added.\n\nOne thing that needs to be recognized is that this country is behind in STEM education \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 compared with other industrialized nations, Carson said. But there is \u201cincredible technology\u201d that can bring students up to speed academically, particularly in math, because it can evaluate how a student solves math problems, which can allow a student to be tutored more effectively.\n\n\u201cWe need to start taking advantage of that 'virtual classroom,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nBen Carson, center, talks Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa, with John Bouslog, left, a lawyer from Urbandale, and his son, Jordan, a commercial real estate agent. Carson spoke to the Rotary Club of Des Moines at the Wakonda Club.

He proposed replacing President Obama's Affordable Care Act with a health care plan that would be focused heavily on individual Health Savings Accounts and catastrophic health insurance policies with high deductibles\n\nHe suggested that people could accumulate enormous amounts of money in Health Savings Accounts over time that would allow them to cover nursing home bills when they get older. He also said he rejects the idea that poor people aren't responsible enough to manage such a plan, saying most low-income people have shown they can responsibly use food stamps.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Rlgn3C", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The GOP candidate says he wants to provide opportunities for Americans to escape poverty.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "The GOP candidate says he wants to provide opportunities for Americans to escape poverty.", "title": "Ben Carson calls liberal critics \u2018skillful liars\u2019", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/02/ben-carson-calls-liberal-critics-skillful-liars/73237652/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP candidate says he wants to provide opportunities for Americans to escape poverty.", "title": "Ben Carson calls liberal critics \u2018skillful liars\u2019", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/36d9a64b36f2a0888cfd0b9f48e25b194e2a4852/c=72-0-1423-1351&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Education", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Education", "title": "Ben Carson calls liberal critics \u2018skillful liars\u2019", "author": "William Petroski", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58fbef1e7bd5d4e5f37145bffd07217a3a24dfd5/c=241-0-1254-1351/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/78098e208776d2a47bc31281e0f32a98a3dcf7d5/c=72-0-1423-1351/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67d57e93cb8d859141fa339b46ba0960827e3e64/c=0-113-1496-1238/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ec124187777d142afecd3a8dd8612836b488f13/c=0-253-1496-1098&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-10-02T18:18:22.580000-04:00", "shorthed": "Ben Carson calls liberal critics \u2018skillful liars\u2019", "articleid": 73237652, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a313fb43ee6b5796785f7e11471d1ffd9102f66/c=0-253-1496-1098/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/08e8e91f6b0e9cd9497f6574719b179e416e8f38/c=370-0-1127-1351/local/-/media/2015/10/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635793805943284517-Ben-Carson-Wakonda-Club.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd016\"", "article_summary": "Ben Carson speaks Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, to the Rotary Club of Des Moines at the Wakonda Club in Des Moines, Iowa.\nCarson spoke later before more than 300 people at Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny.\nCarson spoke to the Rotary Club of Des Moines at the Wakonda Club.\nThe best education is provided at home through home schooling, Carson said, followed by private schools, charter schools, and public schools.\nBen Carson, center, talks Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa, with John Bouslog, left, a lawyer from Urbandale, and his son, Jordan, a commercial real estate agent."}
