He was one of several dozen participants at a roundtable held by state Sens. James Seward (R-Milford) and Kemp Hannon (R-Garden City) earlier this month in Albany to discuss the insurer\u2019s failure.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the state Department of Financial Services announced that Health Republic \u2014 the second most popular insurer on the exchange statewide in 2015 \u2014 was going out of business by the end of the year because of financial problems. But on Oct. 30, the state agency said it was shutting down Health Republic by the end of November because its finances were \u201csubstantially worse than the company previously reported.\u201d As of June 2015, it had reported about $130 million in losses, according to state regulatory filings.\n\nThe announcement left about 215,000 New Yorkers \u2014 including 16,000 Long Islanders \u2014 frantically looking for new coverage, and doctors, hospitals and insurance brokers wondering whether they would ever be paid about $200 million they are owed. It also meant that taxpayers are out about $265 million that Health Republic received in loans from the federal government.\n\nThe state said it was launching an investigation into \u201cthe inaccurate representations Health Republic made to the state about its financial condition.\u201d And on Dec. 7, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calling for \u201ca thorough criminal investigation\u201d to \u201cdetermine what, if any, illegal actions\u201d led to the company\u2019s failure. DFS has declined to comment on its investigation, and the Justice Department has not commented on Zeldin\u2019s request.\n\nAccording to experts, Health Republic\u2019s failure can be attributed to fundamental miscalculations by the company in setting prices too low and attracting many more customers than it could easily handle, changes in what the federal government would pay and, as one report concludes, \u201can apparent breakdown in state oversight of the health insurance industry.\u201d\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\u201cHealth Republic\u2019s growing financial troubles should have been no surprise to insurance regulators,\u201d said the Dec. 22 report written by Bill Hammond for the Empire Center for Public Policy, an Albany-based nonpartisan think tank. \u201cThe company\u2019s filings to DFS showed steep operating losses, mounting debt, unanticipated costs and heavy reliance on a federal risk-management subsidy that failed to materialize.\u201d\n\nParticipants at the Senate roundtable agreed with that assessment, in particular faulting the department for the prior approval process in which DFS sets the rates insurers can charge for premiums. Historically, that has meant the agency, whose job it is to oversee the solvency and prudent practices of insurance companies, has lowered rates requested by insurers \u2014 even in the case of Health Republic, which was losing money. Paul Macielak, president of the New York Health Plan Association, which represents health insurers statewide, called this a \u201cfailed state policy.\u201d\n\nBut Troy Oechsner, special assistant to the superintendent for DFS, pushed back, citing the agency\u2019s quick response once it realized the depth of the insurer\u2019s dire financial straits. And he \u2014 like the company and others at the time of its closing \u2014 attributed much of Health Republic\u2019s financial problems to federal money that it banked on and did not receive.\n\nHealth Republic was one of 23 nonprofit Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, or CO-OPs, nationwide created under the Affordable Care Act to increase competition and offer low-cost health care. Twelve of these CO-OPs have gone out of business since their debut on federal or state exchanges in January 2014.\n\nFrom the beginning, the program ran into headwinds. The Affordable Care Act provided $6 billion in initial funding but Congress, in a series of cuts, reduced that to $2.4 billion.\n\nThat decrease limited the number of nonprofits in the program and also the ability of the government to support CO-OPs through early cash flow challenges, according to a report released Dec. 10 by the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit based in New York.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gave the CO-OPs startup loans and solvency loans, which were provided to make sure they had enough money to cover insurance payouts. (Under New York law, not-for-profit insurers are required to maintain reserves that equal 12.5 percent of premiums.)\n\nHealth Republic, founded by the Freelancer\u2019s Union, a group of independent workers that offered health insurance to its members, received the largest of these: a startup loan of about $24 million, according to the company\u2019s March 2015 financial statements, plus solvency loans of $241 million. The loans were to be repaid.\n\nFaced with relatively short deadlines to file their rates and plans with the states, many CO-OPs outsourced their networks of doctors and hospitals and claims processing, according to the Commonwealth Fund report. Health Republic leased its network of doctors and hospitals from MagnaCare, which provided broad network coverage but little savings to the company. And when the company debuted, it offered very low premiums for 2014 coverage. Health Republic\u2019s benchmark silver plan was the lowest in seven of eight regions statewide. Fidelis Care was the only company offering lower premiums on Long Island.\n\nFrom the outset, industry insiders said they were concerned that premiums were too low and could push others out of the market.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nUnitedHealth Group chief executive Stephen Hemsley said in a earnings call with analysts in April 2014 that the new entrants in the New York market were \u201cpricing well below cost and [at] what we would view as unsustainable pricing levels.\u201d\n\nWith its broad network and low prices, Health Republic became in many ways a victim of its own success.\n\nA July 2015 report by the Office of Inspector General in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that while more than half of the CO-OPs did not reach their enrollment projections, Health Republic had a 504 percent higher enrollment than what it had projected, with more than 155,000 enrollees in its first year of operation \u2014 more than 2.5 times more than the CO-OP with the next highest enrollment.\n\nNot only did that initially overwhelm the company, which scrambled to ramp up its customer service, but it also had to put more capital reserves aside, meaning it had less cash on hand. The Commonwealth Fund report called this the \u201cGoldilocks problem\u201d for the CO-OPs, which, as new entrants, had no actuarial experience in their markets: Price too high and you risk not attracting members. Price too low and you risk significant losses if revenues from premiums can\u2019t cover your costs.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial financial statements for 2014 show that it generated close to $529 million in income from premiums with an additional $68 million in other revenues and adjustments.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nBut claims expenses were more than $556 million and administrative costs were $76.7 million. Initially the company reported it was $35 million in the hole but that was ultimately amended to more than $77.5 million in losses for 2014. That was significantly higher than the $5 million loss the company had initially projected, according to the inspector general\u2019s report. By June 2015, the company was reporting another $52.6 million in losses for the year, according to state regulatory filings.\n\nAnticipating that insurers might have problems initially setting prices for premiums on the exchange, the ACA set up risk protection programs known as the \u201cthree R\u2019s\u201d: reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors. But two of the three, risk adjustment and risk corridors, proved to be of little help to Health Republic. In fact, the risk corridors program signaled its death knell.\n\nUnder risk adjustment, those insurers that enrolled healthy customers had to transfer some funds to those with a larger share of high-risk enrollees. With a healthier customer base, Health Republic had to pay $80 million into this program in 2014, according to CMS.\n\nThe risk corridor program, a mechanism through which CMS shifts money from profitable plans to struggling ones, proved to be the most problematic for Health Republic \u2014 as for other CO-OPs. When it became evident that more CO-OPs were running deficits than surpluses, Congress, led by Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, in December 2014, barred the agency from using other intragency funds to backfill the program. That meant it had to be \u201cbudget neutral,\u201d or could not use federal dollars.\n\nBecause there were more losses than surpluses, CO-OPs only got 12.6 percent of risk corridor payments they had anticipated for 2014. That meant Health Republic received only $18.8 million of the $149 million that it sought from the risk corridor program, according to a November 2015 CMS report.\n\n\u201cThis pretty much sunk Health Republic,\u201d said John Sardelis, associate chair of Health Administration at Saint Joseph\u2019s College in Patchogue. \u201cHealth Republic\u2019s premiums may have been too low for the people who signed up, thereby encountering an underwriting loss, and since it was still less than the overall average, it required a substantial contribution to the risk adjustment fund. The risk corridor designed to mitigate losses was cut drastically and was the final fiscal blow that sunk Health Republic.\u201d\n\nYet despite Health Republic\u2019s ongoing and escalating financial woes, the state cut Health Republic\u2019s requested premium increases for both 2015 and 2016. For 2015, the company asked for a 15.4 percent hike and was granted a 13 percent increase in the individual and family market. For 2016 \u2014 which ended abruptly in September \u2014 the company had requested a 14.4 percent hike and received 14 percent.\n\nHammond said in an interview that while the state agency\u2019s actions were not the primary cause of Health Republic\u2019s demise, DFS bears some responsibility.\n\n\u201cI am not blaming DFS for Health Republic\u2019s failure,\u201d he said. \u201cI am blaming them for not recognizing how serious the situation was for Health Republic earlier in the process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sat, 23 Jan 2016 06:03:00 -0500", "sailthru.author": "Ridgely Ochs", "description": "Health Republic, the nonprofit federally backed health insurance company that went belly up in November, was doomed to failure from the outset because its prices", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11355634.1453547070!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "Health Republic, the nonprofit federally backed health insurance company that went belly up in November, was doomed to failure from the outset because its prices", "title": "Health Republic: Factors that led to its demise", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/long-island/the-factors-that-led-to-once-popular-insurer-health-republic-s-fall-1.11355273", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11355634.1453547070!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health Republic, the nonprofit federally backed health insurance company that went belly up in November, was doomed to failure from the outset because its prices", "title": "Health Republic: Factors that led to its demise", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11355634.1453547070!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "sailthru.title": "Health Republic: Factors that led to its demise", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "Long Island,Health,NEWSDAY", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "Long Island,Health,NEWSDAY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis pretty much sunk Health Republic,\u201d said John Sardelis, associate chair of Health Administration at Saint Joseph\u2019s College in Patchogue.\n\u201cI am blaming them for not recognizing how serious the situation was for Health Republic earlier in the process.\u201d\nIt also meant that taxpayers are out about $265 million that Health Republic received in loans from the federal government.\nHealth Republic\u2019s benchmark silver plan was the lowest in seven of eight regions statewide.\n\u201cI am not blaming DFS for Health Republic\u2019s failure,\u201d he said."}
