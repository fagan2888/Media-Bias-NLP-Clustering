But when the influx of newly insured Americans finally flounder their way through the health care website, there may not be enough doctors waiting on the other side.\n\nOrganizations like the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) predict that even if the federal government wasn\u2019t trying to insure an additional 32 million people, the ageing U.S. population would quickly outpace the growth of the doctor pool. The scarcity is particularly acute in primary care\u2014the physicians who preside over the mundane yet vital tasks of ordering routine blood tests, diagnosing strep throat, providing cancer screenings, and treating chronic illnesses\u2014where the AAMC estimates there will be a shortfall of 45,000 doctors over the next decade. That means longer waits to see pediatricians, family practitioners, and internists\u2014and shorter visits when patients do get to see their doctor.\n\nThings are even worse in rural areas, where few physicians want to live or work. Only ten percent of physicians practice outside cities and suburbs, areas where approximately one-fifth of the American population lives. Rural primary-care providers are also older on average than their urban counterparts, according to an analysis conducted by the University of Washington, raising concerns about what will happen when they begin to retire. Thousands of rural counties are designated by the government as primary-care, health-professional shortage areas. \u201cMostly wealthy people go to medical schools, and they graduate and practice in areas that already have plenty of physicians,\u201d says Catherine Dower, associate director of the Center for Health Professions at the University of California-San Francisco. \u201cFor every one doctor that goes into an underserved area, four doctors go into an already well-served area. And the gap is only getting worse.\u201d\n\nThankfully, this isn\u2019t a problem without solutions. But the remedy varies, depending whom you ask. Professional organizations for physicians tout fixes that help doctors repay debt, so a career in primary care, which has a much lower annual salary than a medical specialty like anesthesiology, looks more appealing. (In 2010, the median salary for a primary-care provider was $189,402; for an anesthesiologist, it was $407,292.) The AAMC recommends a boost in federal funding for residency programs, which has been capped since 1997. The rise in telemedicine\u2014the use of technology like Skype and e-mail to remotely diagnose and treat ailments\u2014could also save physicians time and help reach patients in remote areas.\n\nBut there\u2019s an even simpler answer to the hand-wringing about the primary-care crisis: Start making the most of the health care professionals we already have.\n\nAdopting new primary-care models that give greater autonomy to nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician\u2019s assistants (PAs)\u2014mid-level clinicians who are qualified to prescribe medications, diagnose conditions, order laboratory tests, and develop treatment plans\u2014could cut the primary-care provider shortage in half, according to a new study released by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit think tank. David Auerbach, one of the study\u2019s co-authors, says that most estimates about the future need for doctors aren\u2019t taking newer methods of care into account. Thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, which encourages something called \u201cteam-based care,\u201d mid-level clinicians who have long been relegated to the sidelines of medicine are being given greater responsibility. Nurse-managed health centers\u2014clinics that are often attached to academic medical centers that provide primary-care services\u2014were given $50 million under the ACA to offer basic medical care like blood pressure screenings, immunizations, and physical exams to underserved populations. In other models of team-based care, like patient-centered medical homes, which are designed to facilitate a long-lasting relationship with their primary-care providers, physicians work closely with nurses, pharmacists, and social workers and delegate tasks based on the patients\u2019 needs. Instead of waiting for a five-minute appointment with a physician, a diabetes patient might spend half an hour with an NP to discuss their diet or medication.\n\nThe ACA is promoting these new models because they save money, but there\u2019s also evidence that patients prefer them. Contrary to the notion that patients would rather see a doctor, no matter how humdrum their condition, a recent study published in Health Affairs shows that most Americans are just fine with seeing NPs or PAs for problems like a worsening cough or frequent, painful headaches. Especially when faced with a wait to see a doctor, many patients elected to see a mid-level clinician. \u201cIt\u2019s a safety and quality issue, as well as an access issue,\u201d Dower says. \u201cThe studies show that the care provided by a nurse practitioner is as safe, and in many ways it\u2019s better. Nurse practitioners get much higher satisfaction rates from patients.\u201d\n\nSo why aren\u2019t medical homes and nurse-managed centers being touted as a cheap, easy solution to the primary-care crisis? In many cases, state law gets in the way. Although 17 states allow NPs and PAs to diagnose and treat patients without oversight from a physician, the remaining two-thirds have some form of limitation on mid-level clinicians\u2019 autonomy. \u201cEven though the nurse practitioners are trained to do a whole bunch of stuff\u2014prescribing drugs, diagnosing and treating various illnesses\u2014they have to have their orders signed off by a physician somewhere down the chain,\u201d Auerbach says. \u201cThat takes time, and it means there always has to be a physician on staff. Nurse practitioners can\u2019t operate independently.\u201d\n\nSome states are recognizing the need to reform these \u201cscope of practice\u201d laws. Earlier this year, Nevada legislators passed a law permitting nurse practitioners, who used to have to get an expensive written agreement from a local doctor in order to operate autonomous health clinics with no physician oversight. But a similar effort to expand NPs\u2019 autonomy in California fell flat, in large part because of aggressive lobbying from the California Medical Association.\n\nNot all doctors\u2019 groups are opposed to expanding NPs\u2019 scope of practice. But according to Molly Cooke, the president of the American College of Physicians, much of the problem is cultural\u2014doctors aren\u2019t used to thinking about NPs or PAs as peers. Part of the problem, she says, is the structure of medical school. \u201cThere are lots of things that nurses and NPs do better than physicians,\u201d she says. \u201cIt might be very reasonable for a medical student who\u2019s learning about how you support a patient\u2019s coping skills to learn that from a nurse. But a medical student will say, no, I\u2019m a medical student and I want to be a supervised by a physician.\u201d\n\nAtul Grover, the chief public policy officer for the AAMC, agrees that a shift toward team-based care will help alleviate some of the pressure on the primary-care system, but warns that the crisis won\u2019t subside unless the federal government puts more money toward training doctors. \u201cWe have enough medical students enrolled to deal with this shortage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge is that we need more residency positions in primary care. That\u2019s the real bottleneck.\u201d\n\nBut Dower says that if the federal government wants to get a return on its investment, it should put money toward training more mid-level clinicians. If more public funding is shifted toward residencies, she says, they should be in rural, underserved areas, to encourage doctors to settle there.\n\nEither way, some kind of government action will be required\u2014whether it\u2019s on the state level, by loosening scope of practice laws, or renewed federal funding for medical residencies and debt forgiveness programs for medical students who practice in remote areas. Insurance companies will need to be part of the mix too; many doctors are pushing for an end to \u201cfee for service\u201d payment models, where providers are paid separately for each office visit and procedure, and sometimes aren\u2019t reimbursed for extra time spent with patients, clerical work, or telemedicine. Medical schools, too, are working to encourage more students to choose primary care, despite its smaller paycheck; a new school of medicine in Connecticut just opened with the sole goal of training more primary-care doctors. But it\u2019s clear that if newly insured patients are going to see health care providers in a timely way, greater independence for nurse practitioners and physician\u2019s assistants will have to be part of the solution.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "[[nid:219195]]Right now, as we&amp;rsquo;re stuck in a swamp of headlines about the failure of Obamacare&amp;rsquo;s rollout, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine that there are bigger problems looming for the Affordab", "title": "Changing Primary Care's Colors", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/changing-primary-cares-colors", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/ap207604126935.jpg?itok=OxZqtLcK", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd42c\"", "article_summary": "Nurse practitioners can\u2019t operate independently.\u201dSome states are recognizing the need to reform these \u201cscope of practice\u201d laws.\nBut there\u2019s an even simpler answer to the hand-wringing about the primary-care crisis: Start making the most of the health care professionals we already have.\nBut when the influx of newly insured Americans finally flounder their way through the health care website, there may not be enough doctors waiting on the other side.\nThat means longer waits to see pediatricians, family practitioners, and internists\u2014and shorter visits when patients do get to see their doctor.\nMedical schools, too, are working to encourage more students to choose primary care, despite its smaller paycheck; a new school of medicine in Connecticut just opened with the sole goal of training more primary-care doctors."}
