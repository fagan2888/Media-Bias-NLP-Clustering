He had ended a three-year stint as the Avalanche\u2019s head coach but still was living in the Denver area. He had just been arrested for suspicion of driving while intoxicated in Lone Tree when I ran into him at a Centennial ice rink.\n\nCanadian-raised brothers Bud and Greg Ahbe run a private drop-in skate and are mutual friends, and Quenneville and I were playing hockey together. It\u2019s the Wednesday night skate, and we call it \u201cThe Dub.\u201d\n\nWe chatted during warm-ups, on the bench and briefly after the 90-minute skate. But Quenne- ville didn\u2019t stick around for a beer. He was ashamed of being arrested and he was out of work \u2014 although he said he had some things to do as a Chicago Blackhawks scout.\n\nWe all felt sympathy for \u201cCoach Q,\u201d and realized how one mistake during a tenuous time could significantly tarnish a great career.\n\nThe next month, just four games into the NHL season, Quenneville was the Blackhawks\u2019 head coach, replacing Hall of Famer Dennis Savard. Colorado\u2019s loss was Chicago\u2019s gain. And there was no more feeling sorry for \u201cCoach Q\u201d \u2014 particularly as time went on.\n\nQuenneville, a former NHL player with the Colorado Rockies, among others, has built on a possible Hall of Fame coaching career by leading the Blackhawks to seven consecutive playoff appearances. They won the Stanley Cup in 2010 and 2013, played in the Western Conference finals in 2009 and 2014, and entered Saturday with a 1-0 lead in the Stanley Cup Final against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nIn 17 seasons as an NHL coach, including seven with the St. Louis Blues, Quenneville failed to advance to the playoffs only once \u2014 in 2006-07, when the Avalanche went 44-31-7. His 754 career regular-season victories are third-most all time, and only Scotty Bowman has more wins (1,244) with a better winning percentage (.657). Quenneville\u2019s winning percentage (.615) is third-best among the top 20 coaches in wins behind Bowman and Mike Babcock (527, .627).\n\nQuenneville owns three Stanley Cup rings, the first in 1996 as an assistant with the Avalanche, and will retire as one of hockey\u2019s best all-time coaches. He has yet to coach Canada in the Olympics \u2014 somewhat of a head-scratcher \u2014 but is otherwise considered a legend by his fellow countrymen.\n\nThere\u2019s no feeling sorry for \u201cCoach Q.\u201d Only pride for seeing a great coach have a great career.\n\nCaptain Cal O\u2019Reilly is related to Ryan O\u2019Reilly\n\nCal O\u2019Reilly, older brother of Avalanche forward Ryan O\u2019Reilly, is the captain and leading playoff scorer for the Utica Comets, who began Game 1 of the Calder Cup Finals on Saturday at the Manchester (N.H.) Monarchs. The Comets are the American Hockey League affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks, and the Monarchs \u2014 who are moving to Ontario, Calif., next season \u2014 are the Los Angeles Kings\u2019 top prospects.\n\nO\u2019Reilly, a three-time AHL all-star, is an assist king for Utica. He leads the Comets with 15 postseason points (zero goals) in 18 games. In the regular season, O\u2019Reilly led Utica with 61 points, including 51 assists. His assists were tied for second behind league scoring champion Brian O\u2019Neill (58) of Manchester.\n\nO\u2019Reilly, 28, was a 2005 fifth-round draft pick of the Nashville Predators. He has played in 113 NHL games, with the Preds, Coyotes and Penguins.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chambers: Nobody is feeling sorry for Chicago\u2019s Coach Quenneville now", "title": "Chambers: Nobody is feeling sorry for Chicago\u2019s Coach Quenneville now", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/chambers-nobody-is-feeling-sorry-for-chicagos-coach-quenneville-now/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T20:22:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T02:29:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s no feeling sorry for \u201cCoach Q.\u201d Only pride for seeing a great coach have a great career.\nAnd there was no more feeling sorry for \u201cCoach Q\u201d \u2014 particularly as time went on.\nThe next month, just four games into the NHL season, Quenneville was the Blackhawks\u2019 head coach, replacing Hall of Famer Dennis Savard.\nWe all felt sympathy for \u201cCoach Q,\u201d and realized how one mistake during a tenuous time could significantly tarnish a great career.\nThey won the Stanley Cup in 2010 and 2013, played in the Western Conference finals in 2009 and 2014, and entered Saturday with a 1-0 lead in the Stanley Cup Final against the Tampa Bay Lightning."}
