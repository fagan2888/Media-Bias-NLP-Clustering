At a press conference in Rome, he said he wanted to reflect on his role on the 17-member panel.\n\nRELATED STORY: Pope Francis moves to hold bishops accountable in sex abuse crisis\n\n\u201cI have not left and I will not leave my position on the commission,\u201d he said. \u201cI was appointed by His Holiness Pope Francis and I will only talk to him about my position.\u201d\n\nSaunders, founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood in Britain, is one of two victims to sit on the advisory body, set up by the pontiff in 2014. The other is Marie Collins, who was raped by a priest as a girl in Ireland.\n\nSaunders said there was a vote of no-confidence in him backed by all but one member of the commission present at the seven-day meeting, which ends Monday (Feb. 8). He said they were unhappy with his outspokenness on pedophilia in the church.\n\n\u201cA number of members of the commission expressed their concern that I don\u2019t tow the line when it comes to keeping my mouth shut,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cI made clear I would never be part of something that was a public relations exercise.\u201d\n\nTOP STORY: President Obama: Religious freedom keeps us strong (RNS EXCLUSIVE \u2013 COMMENTARY)\n\nOne panel member said Saunders had a different understanding of its purpose, arguing that it should set up policies to protect children rather than advocate for individual cases. \u201cWe are deeply dedicated to the protection of children,\u201d the member told RNS, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s not a public relations exercise.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether Saunders will show up at Sunday\u2019s meeting. He had invited Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean sex abuse victim, to discuss his case with the panel.\n\nCruz was abused by convicted pedophile Fernando Karadima, a mentor of Bishop Juan Barros of Osorno in Chile, appointed by Francis last year. Barros has denied allegations that he covered up abuse by Karadima and rejected calls for his resignation.\n\nSpeaking alongside Saunders, Cruz called the commission a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to say that child abuse is behind us and now it\u2019s recovery time. It\u2019s in no way the case,\u201d he said, describing the church in the southern hemisphere as \u201ca playground for pedophiles.\u201d\n\nCruz said he was hoping to deliver letters from clergy and others in Chile to the pope, urging him to remove Barros from his position.\n\n(Rosie Scammell covers the Vatican for RNS)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Catholic, Christian, clerical abuse, Peter Saunders, Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Vatican", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "ROME (RNS) \u201cI made clear I would never be part of something that was a public relations exercise,\u201d said British Catholic Peter Saunders.", "title": "Sex abuse victim allegedly sidelined by papal panel", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/02/06/sex-abuse-victim-allegedly-sidelined-from-papal-panel/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/RTX25R48-e1454793315186.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rosiescammell"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/02/06/sex-abuse-victim-allegedly-sidelined-from-papal-panel/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/02/06/sex-abuse-victim-allegedly-sidelined-from-papal-panel/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "ROME (RNS) \u201cI made clear I would never be part of something that was a public relations exercise,\u201d said British Catholic Peter Saunders."}, "article_summary": "ROME (RNS) One of the two victims of clerical sexual abuse serving on a Vatican commission set up by Pope Francis has apparently been sidelined.\nHe had invited Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean sex abuse victim, to discuss his case with the panel.\nRELATED STORY: Pope Francis moves to hold bishops accountable in sex abuse crisis\u201cI have not left and I will not leave my position on the commission,\u201d he said.\nIts head, Boston Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, said Saunders had been asked to consider establishing a victim survivor panel to work with the advisory body.\nSaunders disputes that he is on leave, and takes issue with the Vatican\u2019s view of his service on the commission."}
