As a leader, success depends on your ability to understand and deliver what your patients and their families, the marketplace and regulators expect.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough. Understanding the necessary capacity and capability of your workforce, business partners, and the suppliers of critical goods and services are key to visionary leadership.\n\nWhen practice leaders do not clearly set direction, define performance expectations, create a patient focus, and demonstrate clear and visible practice values and ethics, physicians and other employees are likely to invent their own ideas as to what needs to be done and how to accomplish it. Imagine the inefficiencies and inconsistent clinical, financial and patient experience results if your practice staff is working at cross-purposes!\n\nThe following are 7.5 specific skills and attributes needed to be a systems thinker and visionary leader. As you read each section, give yourself a score between 1 (needs serious help / improvement or someone else on your team to take that role) and 10 (outstanding, wouldn\u2019t change a thing).\n\n1 \u2013 I understand the difference between being a leader and being a boss.\n\nA boss says, \u201cGO staff!\u201d A leader says, \u201cLet us go, team!\u201d and leads the charge. The CEO or managing physician needs to clearly articulate the vision and mission of your practice. The practice administrator, with input from other key organizational stakeholders, creates the strategy to meet the practice vision and mission and, along with the rest of the team, execute that plan. A leader is able to help each team member understand the valuable part they play in achieving the organization\u2019s goals and, ultimately, its vision and mission.\n\nYour practice\u2019s values, those guiding principles and behaviors that embody how your organization and staff are expected to operate, support and guide the decisions made by every workforce member and pave the right path to achieving the practice\u2019s mission and vision. The example a leader sets will drive the action of their staff far better than words.\n\n2 \u2013 I am a key part of a leadership system.\n\nAs a leader of a medical practice, HOW do you lead? We\u2019re not talking about the behaviors you exhibit that \u201cshow\u201d you are a leader. We\u2019re talking about the process you follow to ensure you have the right plan and the right people and the right tools to have an exceptional practice.\n\nAlthough leadership systems can vary, most have some common steps. First, exceptional leaders set the direction for the organization. With the input of all of their stakeholders, exceptional leaders develop the strategies and plans to move the organization in that direction. They make sure they have the right people and processes to carry out their plans. They make sure their entire workforce and other key stakeholders (vendors, volunteers, the community, etc.) know the plan and the role they must play in its success. And exceptional leaders evaluate the achievement of the plan and the effectiveness of their leadership.\n\n3 \u2013 I manage for innovation and leading edge thinking in my practice.\n\nYou know the saying, \u201cThink outside the box?\u201d Nido Quebein, who has transformed North Carolina\u2019s High Point University in the last few years, says to \u201cthrow the box outside of the window.\u201d Are you asking your team for their input on improvements or is your own voice the loudest in the room? Are you reconnecting to share what will work, what won\u2019t work and what\u2019s missing? Often your front line team will be the best go-to people for insight on positive change that will impact business performance. How do you promote innovation, initiative and appropriate risk taking? Encourage your staff to challenge the status quo. Be agile and avoid long chains of command that require lengthy decision paths.\n\n4 \u2013 I have a focus on the future of my medical practice.\n\nChanges are rapidly occurring in how we deliver care, what resources are available, the expectations of our patients, new technology, new partnering opportunities, the economy, the needs of our workforce, regulatory requirements, strategic moves by competitors\u2026the list goes on and on. Change is inevitable, but you can plan for it.\n\nHow do you rate yourself in your ability to focus on the future and deal with change? As you strategically plan, are you considering the key external and internal factors that will affect your practice and your market? Are you agile enough to modify your plans when circumstances warrant? Are you developing future leaders in your practice?\n\n5 \u2013 I manage by fact.\n\nSales managers for Dale Carnegie Training often ask their instructors to share statements about the company that distinguish Dale Carnegie Training from its competitors. As instructors state what they believe to be distinguishing factors, the manager asks the group \u201cIs this a fact or is it a claim?\u201d Now apply that same way of thinking to your practice. If you say your practice delivers exceptional patient care on all of your advertising, yet your patient experience survey ratings or your clinical outcomes are in the tank, then your message is a claim, not a fact.\n\nThe monitoring and use of key performance data is critical to the success of any business. The operative word is \u201ckey,\u201d meaning the essential few measures that are critical to achieving your practice\u2019s intended outcomes. The amount of data available to every practice manager can be overwhelming. Find the measures that best represent improved healthcare outcomes, improved patient experience, improved financial performance, and other factors important to your practice. That data should then be analyzed to extract meaning to support the decisions you make, to drive improvement and innovation, and to plan for the future.\n\n6 \u2013 I know the importance of taking intelligent risk.\n\nDo you tolerate failure in your practice? You should. As long as taking a risk does not cause personal harm or irreversible loss to the organization, encouraging the exploration of different avenues of improvement can ultimately lead to finding ways to make your practice exceptional. Not all actions are going to achieve the desired outcomes. But if your practice is risk-averse, the ability to improve may be limited.\n\n7 \u2013 I have a \u201csystems perspective\u201d in managing my practice.\n\nThe Malcolm Baldrige Health Care Criteria for Performance Excellence defines systems perspective as \u201cmanaging your whole organization, as well as its components, to achieve sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe work of a visionary leader is complex. You must drive exceptional results by building strategies based on key business environment factors, including the very important voice of your patients and their families. You must make certain you have the right people with the right training in the right roles. You must be a motivational leader to ensure your staff is inspired to show up every day and do their best work. You must measure the right things and use this data to drive improvement. You must make sure all of your key processes are functioning smoothly and producing exceptional results. A systems thinker wraps their arms around all of these components and clearly sees their linkage.\n\n7.5 - I show our patients and their families that I care about them as a person.\n\nSmile, make eye contact, use the person\u2019s name, don\u2019t interrupt, be genuinely interested in them as a person, sit down next to them if possible, address everyone in the room, not just the patient, be willing to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and remember, these are people, not just \u201cthe gallbladder in room 12.\u201d\n\nWant to take an intelligent risk? Give them a hug, when appropriate, and follow a Mary Kay Ash principle \u2013 make them feel like the most important person in the world. These foundational skills can set you apart as a provider. People are much more forgiving and understanding when they feel you are being kind, patient, and caring.\n\nWant to take another intelligent risk? Make a commitment to put more CARE into healthcare by using these principles daily. These will enhance your leadership skills and ability to connect with your team in a meaningful way while making an impact in patient- and family-centered care.\n\nMerikay Tillman works with healthcare organizations that want to create change to transform the patient experience.
