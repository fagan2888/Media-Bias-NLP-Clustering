Just seven percent of Republicans want Congress to take steps to delay or defund the health reform law, according to a new poll from the Morning Consult group.\n\nAltogether, the Morning Consult poll found that just six percent of registered voters favor delaying or defunding Obamacare. By far, it\u2019s the least popular strategy for moving forward with the health reform law. Most people said they wanted to find a way to make the health law work. Thirty-one percent of respondents said that Congress should \u201cmake changes to improve the law,\u201d 22 percent said Congress should let the law take effect, and 11 percent wanted Congress to expand the healthcare law further. Thirty percent wanted Obamacare to be repealed altogether.\n\nThe findings track with a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that even when Americans have negative reactions to Obamacare, they still don\u2019t want to defund it.\n\nMainstream Republican lawmakers are similarly resistant to recent efforts to defund Obamacare. During the August recess, after several GOP lawmakers were confronted by angry constituents at town halls who demanded to know why they wanted to get rid of the health law\u2019s consumer protections, many Republicans began to soften their rhetoric about forcing a government shutdown specifically to target the law. One GOP senator said defunding Obamacare in this way was the \u201cdumbest idea\u201d he\u2019d ever heard. Even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) recently acknowledged that these efforts to block Obamacare\u2019s implementation likely won\u2019t work.\n\nRepublicans typically tout the myth that Obamacare is deeply unpopular and the American public wants to get rid of it entirely. In fact, that\u2019s not exactly the whole story. Although Americans do tend to say that they don\u2019t like the health reform law as a whole, they do support its specific provisions without even realizing they\u2019re part of Obamacare. Thanks to consistent misinformation campaigns about the health law, \u201cObamacare\u201d has simply become a politically-charged buzzword, and Americans don\u2019t realize how the law\u2019s benefits are connected to the law itself.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Some far-right GOP lawmakers have been pushing to block funds for the health reform law, but those efforts are extremely unpopular among their voter base.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Some far-right GOP lawmakers have been pushing to block funds for the health reform law, but those efforts are extremely unpopular among their voter base.", "title": "Just Seven Percent Of Republican Voters Actually Want To Defund Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/04/2571191/obamacare-percent-defund/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some far-right GOP lawmakers have been pushing to block funds for the health reform law, but those efforts are extremely unpopular among their voter base.", "title": "Just Seven Percent Of Republican Voters Actually Want To Defund Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T13:06:52+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd082b\"", "article_summary": "Health Just Seven Percent Of Republican Voters Actually Want To Defund Obamacare CREDIT:CREDIT: Tim Sloan/AFP/Getty ImagesOver the past month, a number of far-right GOP lawmakers have advocated for shutting down the federal government in order to defund Obamacare \u2014 but those efforts are deeply unpopular with Republican voters.\nMainstream Republican lawmakers are similarly resistant to recent efforts to defund Obamacare.\nBy far, it\u2019s the least popular strategy for moving forward with the health reform law.\nThanks to consistent misinformation campaigns about the health law, \u201cObamacare\u201d has simply become a politically-charged buzzword, and Americans don\u2019t realize how the law\u2019s benefits are connected to the law itself.\nJust seven percent of Republicans want Congress to take steps to delay or defund the health reform law, according to a new poll from the Morning Consult group."}
