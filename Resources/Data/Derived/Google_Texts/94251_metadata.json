Construction dates will be announced later.\n\nAt the center, fourth-year dental students and dental residents will hone their patient-care techniques and learn the ins-and-outs of operating a community practice under the watch of experienced faculty members. It is the seventh center that ECU has announced since it began its new dental school in 2008.\n\nThe $3 million, 7,700-square-foot center is one of up to 10 ECU plans to build across the state. The first two centers have opened in Ahoskie and Elizabeth City. Two more are under construction in Lillington in the central part of the state and Sylva in the mountains. Others are planned for the mountain town of Spruce Pine and in Davidson County in the Triad.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about working with the county health department and the local dental community and look forward to providing quality dental care to people of Robeson County and the surrounding counties,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Chadwick, dean of the School of Dental Medicine at ECU.\n\nThe center will have 16 dental chairs and will employ local staff members, including 1.5 full-time dental faculty positions, a business manager, five to six dental assistants, two to three dental hygienists and two general dentistry residents. Four to five students will be at the center for nine-week rotations.\n\nOnce open, the center will provide a variety of services, including general, preventive and emergency dental care and will include services such as crowns, root canals and bridges.\n\nWhile services won't be free, charges will be on a sliding scale. Officials have said fees typically will be about 70 percent of those at a private dental practice.\n\nWilliam Smith, director of the Robeson County Health Department, said the center will help the 14,000 people in his county who don't qualify for Medicaid or insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The department closed its dental center in July due to financial pressures after the state did not expand its Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cI think not only for Robeson County but the region as a whole the clinic is going to be vital for a segment of our population that heretofore has not accessed dental care,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe setting will also provide students and dental residents with an opportunity to learn what practicing in a community setting is like. The school admitted its first class in 2011, and all students are North Carolina residents. Goals of the school are to educate students from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds and to improve access to dental care.\n\n\u201cThe ECU approach \u2013 educating students and residents in our community service learning centers \u2013 could become a future model for dental education,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cCommunity service learning centers are more than just dental clinics. They are an integral part of our dental school where our seniors will spend much of their fourth year.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina ranks 47th out of the 50 states in the number of dentists per capita, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Many people without good dental care live in rural areas, where North Carolina averages three dentists for every 10,000 people. That compares to urban areas of the state, where the ratio is nearly five dentists for every 10,000 people. Nationally, the ratio is six dentists for every 10,000 people.\n\nRobeson County had a population of 134,168 in the 2010 census, with Lumberton being home to more than 21,000. The county has fewer than 2.1 dentists for every 10,000 people, according to the Sheps Center.\n\nSmith said the center will help maintain a level of service in the county as dentists there retire during the next few years.\n\nECU hopes the centers will help improve the status of dental health in the state while adding an innovative educational aspect to dental school. Chadwick compares to centers to moving the students' fourth-year clinical work off the ECU campus and into communities across the state.\n\n\u201cWe are not only providing much needed care, but we are also educating students in areas similar to where we hope they will practice,\u201d Chadwick said.\n\nConstruction will be paid for with funds appropriated by the state to ECU. Additionally, the CSLCs will generate revenue through patient care each of the centers will provide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robeson County will soon be home to a facility that officials say will bring dental care to low-income, underserved residents while providin\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540732783", "og": {"site_name": "WBTW.com", "description": "Robeson County will soon be home to a facility that officials say will bring dental care to low-income, underserved residents while providing educational opportunities to East Carolina University d\u2026", "title": "ECU to build dental center in Lumberton", "url": "http://wbtw.com/2013/09/16/ecu-to-build-dental-center-in-lumberton/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f0835f18bc1d1939fc9e0f3ee3667db?s=200&ts=1464056317", "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robeson County will soon be home to a facility that officials say will bring dental care to low-income, underserved residents while providing educational opportunities to East Carolina University d\u2026", "title": "ECU to build dental center in Lumberton", "image": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f0835f18bc1d1939fc9e0f3ee3667db?s=240", "creator": "@wbtwnews13", "site": "wbtwnews13", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "News Uncategorized", "msapplication-tooltip": "Myrtle Beach, Florence SC News, Weather, Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_06b9e1fdab4924636f286ef7ff3fe2fa", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wbtw.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f0835f18bc1d1939fc9e0f3ee3667db?s=16", "application-name": "WBTW.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WBTWNews13", "published_time": "2013-09-16T19:45:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-16T19:45:06+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "sKiGHRJ4PLYZDhmjRqAd2omwp83Wb6Zpdmli8JiKSDw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf826\"", "article_summary": "That was the message today as Robeson leaders and the ECU School of Dental Medicine announced plans to build a \u201ccommunity service learning center\u201d in Lumberton.\nIt is the seventh center that ECU has announced since it began its new dental school in 2008.\nAt the center, fourth-year dental students and dental residents will hone their patient-care techniques and learn the ins-and-outs of operating a community practice under the watch of experienced faculty members.\nECU will build the facility next to the Robeson County Health Department on land donated by the county.\nECU hopes the centers will help improve the status of dental health in the state while adding an innovative educational aspect to dental school."}
