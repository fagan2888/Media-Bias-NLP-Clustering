Some beekeepers have tested the method and it had the declared parameters,\" said Professor Vitezslav Bicik, of the university's zoology department.\n\nBee keepers have tried using heat before. But their efforts have been hampered by difficulties in powering the heating units in often remote locations and making sure the bees themselves are not harmed by the high temperatures.\n\nUp to now they have often resorted to removing the entire population before heating the hive, a tricky and time-consuming procedure.\n\nLinhart, a bee keeper himself, said he got round the problems by using just the power of the sun for his thermosolar hive, and a technique that heats the hive through the glass top for about two hours.\n\nAccording to the plans, the heat slowly builds up in black-painted metal sheets inside the insulated hive, paralyzing, sterilizing and eventually killing the mites but leaving the bees unharmed.\n\n\"With this, you can take 100 hives, or as many as you have, and work simultaneously on all of them,\" Linhart said.\n\n(Reporting by Robert Muller; Editing by Michael Roddy and Andrew Heavens)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "czech, teacher, battles, bee, killing, disease, hot, hive", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists battling a bee-killing disease are about to start testing a new weapon -- a sun-heated hive designed by a Czech high school teacher.", "title": "Czech Teacher Battles Bee-Killing Disease With Hot Hive", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/czech-teacher-battles-bee-killing-disease-hot-hive-335492", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/beehive.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists battling a bee-killing disease are about to start testing a new weapon -- a sun-heated hive designed by a Czech high school teacher.", "title": "Czech Teacher Battles Bee-Killing Disease With Hot Hive", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/czech-teacher-battles-bee-killing-disease-hot-hive-335492", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/beehive.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/beehive.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-28T16:08:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T16:08:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists battling a bee-killing disease are about to start testing a new weapon -- a sun-heated hive designed by a Czech high school teacher."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f91\"", "article_summary": "CHRUDIM, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Scientists battling a bee-killing disease are about to start testing a new weapon -- a sun-heated hive designed by a Czech high school teacher.\nUp to now they have often resorted to removing the entire population before heating the hive, a tricky and time-consuming procedure.\nThe stakes are high, as the death of bees threatens harvests which rely on the insects for pollination.\n\"With this, you can take 100 hives, or as many as you have, and work simultaneously on all of them,\" Linhart said.\nSome beekeepers have tested the method and it had the declared parameters,\" said Professor Vitezslav Bicik, of the university's zoology department."}
