It appears that Denver\u2019s Dazzle Jazz club has plans for your ears.\n\nDrummer Rudy Royston, who grew up in the Denver area but has been seeking his fortune in New York recently, will celebrate his homecoming with two nights at the venue, Sept. 11-12. His new CD, \u201c303\u201d (on trumpeter Dave Douglas\u2019 Greenleaf label) should stand as one of the boldest debut efforts of the year. Royston\u2019s compositions are as filled with life as his animated drumming style, and his current working group shines with talent, including saxophonist Jon Irabagon. Fans of creative music know Irabagon\u2019s work from his own group, the assertive and intelligent Mostly Other People Do The Killing.\n\nAs fine as the \u201c303\u201d release sounds, the live performances of the music should add depth as Royston and his crew have a chance to stretch out. The drummer has played Dazzle on many occasions, but these shows will be his first time as a critically acclaimed bandleader.\n\nThen on Sept. 13-14, longtime Colorado guitarist and educator Dale Bruning will pay tribute to one of his friends, the late jazz giant Jim Hall. Bruning\u2019s gentle spirit and accomplished technique would be reason enough to attend, but he\u2019s invited his most famous student to join him onstage for both nights.\n\nTireless guitarist Bill Frisell has accepted Bruning\u2019s invitation, and it\u2019s a joy to see and hear the two perform together. Trumpeter Ron Miles and a handful of Denver\u2019s best will fill out the bill, and these shows will likely sell out.
