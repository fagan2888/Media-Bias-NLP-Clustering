The question that caused Ms. Rice to flee was a fairly simple one: whether or not the president has authorized the bombing of targets in Syria. Rice responded multiple times that the timing of strikes would not be released, but that was not the question at hand, and reporters pressed her on whether her boss had authorized strikes. This she could not answer. Did she not know? Or had he not bothered to sign the authorization? Or did she get her information from Valerie Jarrett and not know the details? We don’t know because she ran away. See for yourself via Breitbart.

The National Security Advisor of the United States did something astonishing yesterday. In the middle of a reporter’s questioning, she bolted from the podium of the White House pressroom, saying, “Nice to see you,” fleeing a situation she evidently was unable to cope with.

Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit has a sarcastic tag line that is painfully apt here: The country is in the best of hands.

Rice was supposed to have been appointed Secretary of State to replace Hillary Clinton, but her everlasting disgrace as designated liar proclaiming the false narrative that a mob reaction to an obscure internet video cause the Benghazi attack torpedoed that ambition. As it turns out, the State Department dodged a bullet there. But the National Security apparatus is equally critical. If that is not scary enough, ponder for a moment that her back up at the National Security Council is Ben Rhodes, seen here with Obama speechwrtier Jon Favreau.

And the current incumbent, when she has a difficult question being pressed by a reporter, flees, as in turns tail and runs away.

Ponder this for a moment. The National Security Advisor is the one person in a White House who is required to have nerves of steel, the person who places the 3 AM phone call waking up the president in a time of crisis, the person who is expected to have options and plans available for the the POTUS. The person who takes the measure of the enemy and explains to the nation’s chief executive the risks and the possibilities in a situation of extreme peril.
