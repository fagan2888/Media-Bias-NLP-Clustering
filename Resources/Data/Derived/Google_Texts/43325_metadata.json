The information is allegedly shared with advertisers if the private messages contain a \u201cLike\u201d in them, along with a shared link.\n\nThe plaintiffs are hoping to turn the suit into a class action movement on behalf of all Facebook users that have sent or received a private message in the past two years.\n\nInformation Security Solutions firm High-Tech Bridge published a report in August claiming that private messages that included a link sent on Facebook\u2019s messaging service could be used for potential robot spying.\n\nFacebook told FOXBusiness.com it plans to fight the suit. \"We believe the allegations in this lawsuit have no merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,\" a spokesperson said in an email message.\n\nFOXBusiness.com also reached out to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Michael Sobel, for comment, but did not receive a response at press time.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Facebook\u2019s posted terms of service, \u201cWe may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services. We may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services.\u201d\n\nGant Redmon, general counsel for incident response software company Co3 Systems, says the lawsuit may hold up, although the federal statute it is relying on may be a bit of a stretch.\n\n\u201cThis may gain traction with the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] because they go after anyone that is doing something with people\u2019s information and not disclosing it,\u201d Redmon says. \u201cThe No.1 thing the FTC loves to go after people for when it comes to privacy is a policy that doesn\u2019t click with the actual use of personal information.\u201d\n\nRedmon describes Facebook\u2019s privacy policy as long winded and it\u2019s highly likely that individuals aren\u2019t paying close attention to it when using the site.\n\n\u201cA lot of what the FTC wants is for you to say what you do, and do what you say,\u201d Redmon says. \u201cBehind these causes for action are often \u2018did the person have a reasonable expectation of privacy?\u2019 And when people send private communications, yes they do.\u201d\n\nDepending on the outcome of the suit, Facebook may move to alter its privacy policy, he says, to be more explicit in how they are gathering and using data.\n\nHe adds that the recent data and privacy breaches has shifted the way people behave online and that they have taken matters of privacy into their own hands.\n\n\u201cI do believe people will start to decide how they communicate and what they share, and find tools to stop other from seeing what they are doing,\u201d he says. \u201cThese things do matter, but it comes down to that tipping point of \u2018I am really upset about this, and want to maintain privacy.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-06 11:31:13 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A lawsuit filed in California claims Facebook\u2019s messenger service is mining data about its users and sharing this with advertisers.
