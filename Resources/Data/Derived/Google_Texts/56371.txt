The Florida Manatee and Aquatic Center habitat at Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa has cared for more than 300 sick and injured manatees, including one they have named "Buoyance," for the injury to her lung that makes her float to the top of the water.

Virginia Edmonds, who has been working at the manatee hospital for about 18 years, explained how they are treating "Buoyance," who has been at the zoo for about a month.

Endangered species are ones that are in danger of extinction now, while threatened species are ones that likely will be on the verge of extinction in the future.
