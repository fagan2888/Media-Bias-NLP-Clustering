Police and deputies arrested a suspect early Saturday in the slaying of a 42-year-old Loveland woman, authorities say.

Arlen Wallace has been charged with first-degree murder and stalking, according to a news release by Sgt. Justin Chase of the Loveland Police Department.

He is being held on a $500,000 bond in connection with the death of Christina Anjoleen Gray who was found dead Wednesday afternoon.

Loveland and Larimer County SWAT teams arrested Wallace without incident at about 1:13 a.m. at his home at 420 E. 57th St. He is being held at the Larimer County Jail in Fort Collins.

Gray’s body was found by two friends on Wednesday after a family member called them out of concern for her welfare.

Loveland Police Chief Luke Hecker said patrol officers and detectives have worked around the clock to solve the case along with help from investigators of the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

Experts at the Northern Colorado Regional Forensics Laboratory also contributed to the investigation, Hecker said.

“This case is not over,” he said. “We recognize that to many, Christina Anjoleen Gray was silenced on December 18 but these dedicated investigators and technicians will continue to work to insure that Christina Anjoleen Gray’s voice is heard and that she is well remembered in the on-going investigation and prosecution.”

A Larimer County magistrate judge signed an arrest warrant shortly after midnight Saturday.
