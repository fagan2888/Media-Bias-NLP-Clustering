Victoria Steele (D) to share a secret of her own, according Mother Jones.\n\nDuring testimony last Wednesday, Steele choked up while debating a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, confessing that she herself had been sexually molested as a child, when a committee chairperson asked her if she thought abortion was a medical service. Steele surprised everyone, including herself, when she responded from a place that was personal.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a child, I was molested for years by one particular person,\u201d Steele testified, according to Mother Jones. \u201cThis is health care. Having the ability to get an abortion. This is health care. And that\u2019s why I see this as necessary.\u201d\n\nSteele thought she was the only victim of a male relative, and like many children, didn\u2019t tell anyone until years after she\u2019d grown up and left home. Rarely do molesters have only one victim, and this time was no different. Steele later found out there were many victims. One of them told her their molester said he\u2019d \u201cstick a pencil up there and take care of it\u201d if she ever ended up pregnant.\n\nSB 1318, which ended up passing the state House Committee 5-3 along party lines, would traumatize the victims of rape all over again. The bill will now go to the full House for a vote. Victims who have recently been raped and find themselves pregnant as a result would have to go through the tortuous experience of telling their insurance panel, and possibly their agent, about the ordeal they went through. And the bill puts a target on the back of doctors, according to Steele, because doctors performing abortions would become part of the public record.\n\nAccording to The Arizona Republic, Steele was shaken for a couple of hours after giving her testimony, and her abuse took place in the early 1970s. Imagine how difficult, or impossible, it would be to have to relive such a horrific experience in front of strangers who are judging you.\n\nRape victims shouldn\u2019t be victimized all over again to satisfy the right-wing ideology of the GOP. Republicans have been corrupting the laws, trying to deny women and girls the ability to obtain abortions not only due to rape and incest, but in cases where they are victims of human trafficking as well.\n\nAbortion is a protective right that all women should have, regardless of their circumstances. The choice should be between a woman and her doctor, not dictated by lawmakers who don\u2019t even understand simple anatomy.\n\nH/T: Mother Jones, Arizona Central", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill designed to make it even harder for women to obtain abortion coverage moved Arizona state Rep.
