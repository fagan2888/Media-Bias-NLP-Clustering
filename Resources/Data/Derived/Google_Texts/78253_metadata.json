(Mike Miesen) Mulago National Referral Hospital, the keystone of Uganda\u2019s system of public hospitals, is located on top of an ochre hill overlooking the capital city of Kampala. The sprawling six-story hospital has spawned an ecosystem of restaurants, guesthouses, and\u2014in a macabre combination of remarkable efficiency and casual indifference\u2014multiple coffin sellers. It\u2019s named after omulago, a plant that once grew on the same hill and was used in traditional Banda medicine to ward off spirits. The hill offers only Western medicine now, and throngs of Ugandans can be found waiting for treatment and standing vigil by loved ones, with babies secured on their backs by flowery kitenge. Mulago\u2019s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit is a cramped, 20-by-30-foot rectangle. On the day I visit, it\u2019s crowded with about 50 newborns in hospital beds and mothers\u2019 laps. Justine, one of the two NICU nurses on shift, said it was a light day: \u201c50 to 60 babies is the lowest\u2014you will find 70 or 80 at times. We put them on chairs.\u201d\n\nThe premature and low birth weight babies lie cordoned-off from the rest in a narrow space where 20 incubators are arranged like Tetris pieces; most were donated by NGOs and bilateral agencies like USAID. Many lay open, and the silence is interrupted only by the cries of newborns; no sound emanates from the machines. They aren\u2019t on. \u201cThey\u2019re old, so they break down soon,\u201d Justine informs me matter-of-factly as we survey the carnage. 13 of the 20 incubators are broken. The instructions for one are in Dutch. Ugandans typically speak Luganda, Kiswahili, and English. Mulago\u2019s experience is not unique. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, \u201cmedical device graveyards\u201d litter the empty closets and spare corners of hospitals. The World Health Organization estimates that \u201ca large proportion (up to 70 percent) of equipment lies idle.\u201d Another study pegged a lower, still troubling figure of 38 percent. Speaking with four major equipment donation organizations gave a vastly different impression than on-the-ground visits to 20 hospitals. Despite the best intentions of these organizations, the system is not working. Good intentions are not enough. As one administrator bluntly put it, \u201cDonations just do not work. That is almost always the case.\u201d (Like many of the physicians and administrators I spoke with, this one did not want to be named, for fear of seeming ungrateful.) Things can get better, though: with a few simple changes to the process, improper and useless donations can be reduced. But a larger question looms: even with improvements, is this how aid should be delivered? *** Bwindi Community Hospital (Mike Miesen) Bwindi Community Hospital is an orderly, wonky hospital (pie charts of funding sources and admission figures greet patients at the entrance) tucked into the breathtaking green expanse of southwest Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest. Dr. Kurigamba Gideon, a lanky physician administrator prone to a wide smile and a quick joke, showed me around. The pediatric ward was covered in colorful wall paintings, below which a nutritionist taught new mothers how to make a special recipe to treat acute malnutrition. Next door, the maternity ward was clean and quiet, and one corner was home to a suspiciously large number of medical devices.\n\nAll were inoperable. This was Bwindi\u2019s own device graveyard. One donated anesthesia machine in particular was infamous: It was used on \u201conly one patient before it stopped working,\u201d Kurigamba explained to me. \u201cIt was just a mess.\u201d The perception on the ground is that some donors \u201cdump\u201d useless junk equipment\u2014a phrase I heard from multiple administrators. \u201cIt was dumping, actually. That\u2019s what it was,\u201d Kurigamba added. All of the equipment donation organizations I spoke with condemned dumping as wasteful and expensive. International Aid, a Michigan-based Christian non-profit that refurbishes medical equipment and ships it abroad, has a frank philosophy on donating: \u201cDon\u2019t send \u2018Junk for Jesus,\u2019 you know?\u201d its medical equipment services director, Jim Loeffler, said. Most of the equipment organizations such as International Aid receive is second-hand, so many have biomedical technicians on staff to recondition the devices. Another such organization is Samaritan\u2019s Purse, a North Carolina-based Christian group that places volunteer clinicians and refurbished medical equipment in hospitals worldwide. Jim Moore, a technical support supervisor for the organization, believes that small NGOs and churches should donate medical equipment through organizations such as his, rather than directly giving to hospitals. \u201cThe church groups and NGOs that have donated the equipment haven\u2019t had the support we have here with technical help, to not only test equipment before it\u2019s sent, but to have the knowledge of what will work\u201d for three to five years after being donated, he told me. \u201cMany organizations don\u2019t have the means to follow up, and that turns into a nightmare for a country.\u201d Multiple hospitals I visited expressed disappointment about the equipment they\u2019ve received over the years. However, none indicated that large organizations\u2019 donations were substantially better than what they received from smaller organizations. Every hospital I visited had devices in the same state as Bwindi\u2019s: donated and dead.\n\n*** Mengo Hospital is the oldest of its kind in Uganda, established in 1897 by the British physician Sir Albert Cook in southwest Kampala. On its sprawling campus, a stocky, energetic physician directed me to an anesthesia machine that was donated without the tubes necessary for it to work. He and many other clinicians and administrators wondered why an organization would ever send a piece of equipment that it knew wasn\u2019t functional. Even a piece of equipment that works out of the crate will eventually need spare parts and a consistent supply of single-use consumables, like electrocardiogram paper, which can be prohibitively expensive for cash-strapped hospitals. Because of this, the World Health Organization recommends that donors ensure the recipient of the equipment also receives \u201cenough consumables and spare parts to last two years.\u201d Whether this occurs is a matter of some debate. International Aid offers spare parts and consumables, but asks the recipient hospital to pay for them. Samaritan\u2019s Purse sends \u201cas many boxes of consumables as we can\u201d when shipping the initial piece of equipment, according to Moore, and Project C.U.R.E., a Colorado-based group, makes efforts to re-supply recipients with consumables and spare parts, though not an explicit commitment. Regardless of initial condition, all medical equipment will eventually need regular maintenance and repair. If the equipment is novel to the region and the expertise isn\u2019t available to maintain and fix it, a device that breaks is broken forever. As Justine, the nurse from Mulago\u2019s NICU, said, \u201cSome devices are new, but if they have a problem, there\u2019s no one to fix. We lack knowledge.\u201d The organizations I spoke with all indicated that, whenever possible, they provide onsite technician training. But, as Moore put it, \u201cmuch of the developing world has no biomedical support \u2026 as far as in-country people,\u201d so often the organization will train whomever is available. Unfortunately, the training often ends at the hospital gate; large-scale regional training rarely occurs. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a training program anymore, unfortunately,\u201d Loeffler said. \u201cYou know, finances are limited.\u201d\n\n*** Four hours east of Kampala sits Mbale, a sleepy city of 100,000 near the Kenyan border. It gives the impression of a place in perpetual state of transition from rural to urban. Across the street from one of the nicest places in town\u2014the beautifully manicured Protea Hotel\u2014is a home where chickens and goats roam freely under a plot of matooke trees. CURE Children\u2019s Hospital of Uganda (no relation to Project C.U.R.E.) sits at the edge of Mbale. Its peaceful grounds stand in stark contrast to the hectic, bustling public referral hospital down the street. Established in 2000, CURE Uganda specializes in pediatric neurosurgery and conducts more than 1,000 surgeries each year, mostly hydrocephalus and spina bifida procedures. Patients and their caregivers journey from all over east Africa, traveling thousands of kilometers to reach the experienced surgeons and well-trained staff. It receives medical equipment from a number of the organizations I spoke with, and recently received a crate with over $316,000 in \u201cIMEC Suites\u201d\u2014groups of devices that are used together. A Surgical Suite, for example, comes with an operating table, a theater light, scalpels, and everything else needed to carry out surgeries. IMEC, a Massachusetts-based not-for-profit founded in 1995 by hospital administrator Tom Keefe, has a process that sets up equipment donations for long-term use. It ensures the equipment can be used by the recipient, makes a long-term commitment of spare parts and consumables, and builds regional capacity for upkeep, maintenance, and repair. Before any equipment is shipped, IMEC conducts a thorough needs assessment, usually onsite, to ensure that the equipment will be able to be used and serviced. (Project C.U.R.E. and Samaritan\u2019s Purse also typically conduct onsite assessments.) \u201cWe have a very strict process on how to do things \u2026 It\u2019s just no good if you send something over and they don\u2019t know how to use it,\u201d Dr. Sue Crawford, IMEC\u2019s Project Coordinator for Africa, told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to send inappropriate things they can\u2019t service.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Without spare parts or trained technicians, they stop working almost immediately.", "author": "Mike Miesen", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Without spare parts or trained technicians, they stop working almost immediately.", "title": "The Inadequacy of Donating Medical Devices to Africa", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/meddevices1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/donating-medical-devices-to-africa-isnt-the-solution/279855/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "International Aid, a Michigan-based Christian non-profit that refurbishes medical equipment and ships it abroad, has a frank philosophy on donating: \u201cDon\u2019t send \u2018Junk for Jesus,\u2019 you know?\u201d its medical equipment services director, Jim Loeffler, said.\nMost of the equipment organizations such as International Aid receive is second-hand, so many have biomedical technicians on staff to recondition the devices.\nRegardless of initial condition, all medical equipment will eventually need regular maintenance and repair.\nAnother such organization is Samaritan\u2019s Purse, a North Carolina-based Christian group that places volunteer clinicians and refurbished medical equipment in hospitals worldwide.\nAcross Sub-Saharan Africa, \u201cmedical device graveyards\u201d litter the empty closets and spare corners of hospitals."}
