Bruce Feiler, a renowned expert on religion in modern life, took this feat to the next level, becoming the first person ever (he thinks) to complete six pilgrimages in one calendar year.\n\nFeiler\u2019s six-part PBS series, \u201cSacred Journeys With Bruce Feiler,\u201d tells the story of his encounters with American pilgrims who traveled to Lourdes, Shikoku, Jerusalem, the Hajj, the Kumbh Mela and Osun Osogbo. Salon spoke with Feiler to learn about his groundbreaking, trying adventure and to learn about humanity\u2019s common quest for spirituality and meaning.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited.\n\nHow did this specific project come about?\n\nI\u2019ve been for most of the last 20 years going on religious adventure trips like this, \u201cWalking the Bible,\u201d \u201cAbraham,\u201d \u201cWhere God Was Born.\u201d \u201cWalking the Bible\u201d became a three-hour series on PBS in 2006. WGBH, which is the public television station in Boston, came to me five years ago and said they wanted to do a show on pilgrimage, was I interested in partnering with them. And I said no. I said I didn\u2019t want to make a show that was a series of Wikipedia entries about strange people going on strange journeys in strange places. But what I said and what I felt then and what I feel now is: What is the thing you hear most often in religious circles these days? That is, \u201cI\u2019m not religious, I\u2019m spiritual. I\u2019m on a journey of some kind.\u201d And I really wanted to make a series in which whatever journey you\u2019re on you could find that reflected in what you were seeing on the screen.\n\nSo we got together. It took us five years. It was a year to plan it, a year to raise the money, a year to find the pilgrims, a year to shoot it\u2013I did all of these journeys in the course of one year. I\u2019m assuming or guessing I\u2019m the only person who has ever done it. It hasn\u2019t been logistically possible in the past. The pilgrim part was very important because in \u201cWalking the Bible,\u201d the TV show, I was in every scene basically and I was the one going through the intellectual and emotional transformation. But I obviously couldn\u2019t be expected to go through the emotional transformation in all these different places, so getting the pilgrims was really important because without the emotional component you\u2019ve got those Wikipedia entries I wanted to avoid.\n\nHow did you find the featured pilgrims?\n\nIt was challenging because we needed to find people who were going, we needed to find people who were willing to share their story, but I think the power of the series at the end of the day is in their stories. Take Lourdes [France], for example: we traveled, as you know, with 40 wounded warriors. People have their legs blown off, they were blinded, an African-American sniper from Kansas who literally had a grenade go off in his mouth. They make this journey, and to me, the juxtaposition of these grizzled war veterans who have seen some of the worst of human nature and this 14-year-old peasant girl who sees the Virgin Mary 150 years ago, that tension between the purity of that story and the intensity of the veterans is remarkable. And where the emotion of the show comes from.\n\nIt then took us a year to get permission from the Pentagon because this had never been put on film before. So we\u2019re not just getting permission from the pilgrims, it was getting permission from all the people around them. So that\u2019s an amazing, remarkable story that I\u2019m thrilled people are going to get a chance to see.\n\nWhat is the difference between spirituality and religion? How is American religion evolving in relation to that difference?\n\nWell, I think that organized religion is more threatened than ever before. Attendance is down, membership is down, but it\u2019s not down that much. Here\u2019s what I think is going on. The idea that you would go to a building at the time of the building\u2019s choosing and sit in a pew while someone stands up on a high platform like a mountain and tells you what to think and believe from a text that has been closed for hundreds or thousands of years\u2013every part of that is completely anathema to how we live today.\n\nPeople want to be more interactive, they want to do things on their own schedule, they want to tell their own story, they don\u2019t want to just listen to other people\u2019s story. So what\u2019s going on is that people are pulling away from formal institutions, but they\u2019re not giving up on these core questions about who am I, how do I get through difficult times in my life, what does it mean to have values, how can I serve my community and is there a higher calling in some way. So what happens is people are breaking away from the institution but they are still asking the big questions, and that\u2019s exactly where pilgrimage fits in. Because a pilgrimage is at its core a gesture, or an action. It\u2019s saying that I\u2019m going to take a step. I\u2019m going to figure out what I really believe and I\u2019m going to determine for myself how I want to live my life. Whereas traditional religion is much more passive, going on a sacred journey is much more active. That\u2019s why pilgrimage is so popular today.\n\nThere was this U.N. study, the United Nations held the first world conference of tourism in its history in September in Spain, and in conjunction with that they released a report that says a third of all tourists around the world every year are pilgrims. That\u2019s 330 million people a year. This is not some hype machine thing, this is the U.N. So spiritual pilgrimage is much bigger today than it\u2019s ever been before as a phenomenon, and it\u2019s a combination of people determining their own beliefs, coupled with the ease of international travel, coupled with general mobility with which we all live. Bear in mind, 50 percent of Americans will change faith in the course of their lives, four in 10 Americans are in an interfaith marriage, so there is just a lot more fluidity. We no longer just accept the religion that our parents gave us. We each have the opportunity and, in effect, the obligation to decide what we believe for ourselves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bruce Feiler went on six pilgrimages in a single year", "title": "\u201cYou have to go on a journey\u201d: How one man traveled to the end of the Earth in search of spirituality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bruce Feiler went on six pilgrimages in a single year", "title": "\u201cYou have to go on a journey\u201d: How one man traveled to the end of the Earth in search of spirituality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/03/you_have_to_go_on_a_journey_how_one_man_traveled_to_the_end_of_the_earth_in_search_of_spirituality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/sacredjourneys_bruce01_credit-Khishnendu-Bose-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bruce Feiler went on six pilgrimages in a single year", "title": "\u201cYou have to go on a journey\u201d: How one man traveled to the end of the Earth in search of spirituality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/sacredjourneys_bruce01_credit-Khishnendu-Bose-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bruce feiler, PBS, pilgrimage, Religion, sacred journeys, Spirituality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m going to figure out what I really believe and I\u2019m going to determine for myself how I want to live my life.\nTopics: bruce feiler, PBS, pilgrimage, Religion, sacred journeys, Spirituality, NewsEach year, millions of people embark on spiritual pilgrimages or journeys that will take them across the globe in search of answers to life\u2019s biggest questions.\nIt\u2019s saying that I\u2019m going to take a step.\nWhereas traditional religion is much more passive, going on a sacred journey is much more active.\nSalon spoke with Feiler to learn about his groundbreaking, trying adventure and to learn about humanity\u2019s common quest for spirituality and meaning."}
