Nine months later, the Apple Watch was announced, a wearable device which Apple says will help us \u201clive a better day.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has published a draft that clarifies whether a wearable device is also a medical device, thereby setting it up for governmental scrutiny. The draft, \u201cGeneral Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices,\u201d could be approved after a 90-day public review process.\n\nWearable devices are only medical devices when claims are made that they can treat specific diseases or conditions, or present inherent risks to consumers\u2019 safety. Otherwise, they are defined as a \u201cgeneral wellness\u201d tool. These types of devices are those related to weight management, physical fitness, relaxation or stress management, mental acuity, self-esteem, sleep management, or sexual function.\n\nMedical devices, by definition, are those which make claims regarding the treatment, or diagnosis, of diseases or conditions such as obesity, eating disorders, anxiety, autism, muscle atrophy, or erectile dysfunction.\n\nIn other words, devices like the Apple Watch fall under the general wellness umbrella, and thereby should avoid the FDA\u2019s oversight. The Apple Watch is also exempt from the 2.3 percent medical device tax, which is part of the U.S. Affordable Care Act.\n\nFirst introduced in September, the Apple Watch comes with tracking tools to motivate us to \u201cmove,\u201d \u201cexercise,\u201d and \u201cstand\u201d more. It isn\u2019t being advertised to treat diseases or medical conditions.\n\nThe Apple Watch is expected to arrive in stores this spring.\n\nSee also: The first Apple Watch arrived 20 years ago, Apple naysayers target the Watch next, and Quanta reportedly going on hiring sprees for 12-inch MacBook Air and Apple Watch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New FDA regulations clarify the definition of wearable devices.", "language": "en", "author": "AppAdvice Staff Author", "og": {"site_name": "AppAdvice", "description": "New FDA regulations clarify the definition of wearable devices.", "title": "FDA: The Apple Watch is a wellness tool, not a medical device", "url": "http://appadvice.com/appnn/2015/01/fda-the-apple-watch-is-a-wellness-tool-not-a-medical-device", "image": "http://handoff.cdn.appadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Apple-Watch-health-fitness-white-blue-1940x1231-642x407.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New FDA regulations clarify the definition of wearable devices.", "creator": "appadvice", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "appadvice://appadvice.com/appnn/2015/01/fda-the-apple-watch-is-a-wellness-tool-not-a-medical-device", "iphone": "appadvice://appadvice.com/appnn/2015/01/fda-the-apple-watch-is-a-wellness-tool-not-a-medical-device"}, "name": {"ipad": "AppAdvice", "iphone": "AppAdvice"}, "id": {"ipad": 364906378, "iphone": 364906378}}, "title": "FDA: The Apple Watch is a wellness tool, not a medical device", "site": "@appadvice", "image": {"src": "http://handoff.cdn.appadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Apple-Watch-health-fitness-white-blue-1940x1231-642x407.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364906378, affiliate-data=myAffiliateData, app-argument=appadvice://appadvice.com/appnn/2015/01/fda-the-apple-watch-is-a-wellness-tool-not-a-medical-device", "csrf-token": "kSXFI0GzqmWlCHgLJiu9GowGaj0A956YRoCWC9kqmX9vfOzd1MT+moWnGfUArMOLGlY9BLg0LS7BkagD457M+g==", "keywords": "ipad, iPhone, iPod, touch, iPod touch, app store, apps, itunes, deals, sales, price drops, rss, feeds", "article": {"tag": "ipad, iPhone, iPod, touch, iPod touch, app store, apps, itunes, deals, sales, price drops, rss, feeds"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fb0\"", "article_summary": "See also: The first Apple Watch arrived 20 years ago, Apple naysayers target the Watch next, and Quanta reportedly going on hiring sprees for 12-inch MacBook Air and Apple Watch.\nNine months later, the Apple Watch was announced, a wearable device which Apple says will help us \u201clive a better day.\u201dThe FDA has published a draft that clarifies whether a wearable device is also a medical device, thereby setting it up for governmental scrutiny.\nThe Apple Watch is also exempt from the 2.3 percent medical device tax, which is part of the U.S.\nFirst introduced in September, the Apple Watch comes with tracking tools to motivate us to \u201cmove,\u201d \u201cexercise,\u201d and \u201cstand\u201d more.\nIn other words, devices like the Apple Watch fall under the general wellness umbrella, and thereby should avoid the FDA\u2019s oversight."}
