They also talk about \u201chelping the unemployed\u201d and \u201cstriving to help families\u201d while remaining conspicuously silent on Republican opposition to unemployment benefits or food assistance programs that help people do very basic, unglamorous things like, you know, eat.\n\nBut man, what a great leather jacket the guy who hates unemployment benefits is wearing! Sure do love that jacket. I feel so distracted by that cool leather jacket that I forgot all about the core tenets of the Republican platform. LGBTQ rights what? Reproductive justice who? Voting rights how? Minimum wage where? Just get me that leather jacket!", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP has released a new series of ads in an effort to shake its image as a party of old white men VIDEO", "title": "GOP releases ads targeting voters who wear leather jackets and hate unemployment benefits", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP has released a new series of ads in an effort to shake its image as a party of old white men VIDEO", "title": "GOP releases ads targeting voters who wear leather jackets and hate unemployment benefits", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/18/gop_releases_ads_targeting_voters_who_wear_leather_jackets_and_hate_unemployment_benefits/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-18-at-9.52.21-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP has released a new series of ads in an effort to shake its image as a party of old white men VIDEO", "title": "GOP releases ads targeting voters who wear leather jackets and hate unemployment benefits", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-18-at-9.52.21-AM.png", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GOP, Republicans, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39d2\"", "article_summary": "But man, what a great leather jacket the guy who hates unemployment benefits is wearing!\nJust get me that leather jacket!\nI feel so distracted by that cool leather jacket that I forgot all about the core tenets of the Republican platform.\nTopics: GOP, Republicans, Video, Life News, News, Politics NewsThe GOP has released a new series of ads in an effort to shake its image as a party of old white men in the lead-up to the 2014 midterm elections.\nThe actors smile and say banal things like, \u201cI believe in opportunity for all,\u201d while pumping gas or pulling espresso shots."}
