Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nAs snowboarder Vic Wild stood atop the medal podium in Sochi this week, his home country's national anthem playing in honor of his gold medal in the parallel giant slalom event, the sound of locals singing along to the Russian tune was so overwhelmingly loud that it leaked into NBC's telecast. But the gold medalist from White Salmon, Wash., wasn't part of the pop-up chorus. He wasn't even mouthing the words.\n\nThat puts Wild, the born-and-bred American who is riding for Russia, in the minority of gold medalists during these Games: 59.3% of them sang along with their countries' national anthems in Sochi, according to a Commissariat of Calculation survey of medal ceremonies that included 81 gold medalists across individual and team sports. Men and women embraced their glorified karaoke stints at equal rates, which marks a change of tune from 2012, when a Journal audit found 51.4% of men and 35.1% of women were singers at the London Games.\n\nENLARGE\n\nWild wasn't the only Russian who stood stoically during his ceremony. But another Olympian representing the host country under similar circumstances took a different approach. Victor An, the short-track speed skater who used to compete for South Korea but won gold for Russia during these Games, belted out his new country's national anthem as if he were auditioning for \"American Idol.\"\n\nOur study found Olympians were likelier to sing than cry while celebrating. In the Commissariat's calculations, only 17% of Olympians shed tears on the medal stand, not a far cry from the 15.5% of Olympians who bawled in London. Of that small group, 65% pulled off the Olympian task of crying while singing.\n\n\u2014Ben Cohen", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-02-21T00:09:00.000Z", "article.section": "Sports", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "A solid 59.3% of gold medalists at the Sochi Olympics are singing their national anthem while it is played after their victory, our research shows.", "title": "How Many Gold Medalists Sing Their National Anthem on the Podium?", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AB184_OLYCOU_G_20140220181528.jpg", "alt": "Athletes use their patriotic pipes on the podium.", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AB184_OLYCOU_D_20140220181528.jpg"}, "creator": "@bzcohen", "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303636404579395063472715986&headline=Athletes%20use%20their%20patriotic%20pipes%20on%20the%20podium.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303636404579395063472715986"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "gold medalists sing,olympians singing,olympics main,singing the national anthem,sochi,sochi 2014,sochi olympics,political,general news,living,lifestyle,olympics,sports,recreation,routine general news", "news_keywords": "gold medalists sing,olympians singing,olympics main,singing the national anthem,sochi,sochi 2014,sochi olympics,political,general news,living", "article.headline": "Athletes use their patriotic pipes on the podium.", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AB184_OLYCOU_E_20140220181528.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AB184_OLYCOU_D_20140220181528.jpg"}}, "description": "A solid 59.3% of gold medalists at the Sochi Olympics are singing their national anthem while it is played after their victory, our research shows.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303636404579395063472715986&headline=Athletes%20use%20their%20patriotic%20pipes%20on%20the%20podium.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303636404579395063472715986", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Sports", "article.summary": "A solid 59.3% of gold medalists at the Sochi Olympics are singing their national anthem while it is played after their victory, our research shows.", "page.site": "wsj", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-02-21T04:13:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-73ec", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 4, "image_count": 3, "word_count": 277, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A solid 59.3% of gold medalists at the Sochi Olympics are singing their national anthem while it is played after their victory, our research shows.", "title": "How Many Gold Medalists Sing Their National Anthem on the Podium?", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303636404579395063472715986", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OL-AB184_OLYCOU_G_20140220181528.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Ben Cohen", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "How Many Gold Medalists Sing Their National Anthem on the Podium?", "article.type": "2014 Winter Olympics", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303636404579395063472715986", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-21T04:13:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5fc\"", "article_summary": "ENLARGE Russian figure skaters sing their national anthem after winning the team gold.\nVictor An, the short-track speed skater who used to compete for South Korea but won gold for Russia during these Games, belted out his new country's national anthem as if he were auditioning for \"American Idol.\"\nBut the gold medalist from White Salmon, Wash., wasn't part of the pop-up chorus.\nAgence France-Presse/Getty ImagesAs snowboarder Vic Wild stood atop the medal podium in Sochi this week, his home country's national anthem playing in honor of his gold medal in the parallel giant slalom event, the sound of locals singing along to the Russian tune was so overwhelmingly loud that it leaked into NBC's telecast.\nOur study found Olympians were likelier to sing than cry while celebrating."}
