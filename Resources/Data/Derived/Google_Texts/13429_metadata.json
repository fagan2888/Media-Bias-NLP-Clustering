The legislation, which the House approved in the last Congress, also shortens the amount of time VA employees have to appeal disciplinary actions.\n\nA companion bill was passed out of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee last week.\n\nThe House vote comes soon after the indictment of Cathedral Henderson, 50, a manager at a Veterans Affairs medical center in Georgia.

Henderson was placed on leave, not fired.\n\nThe indictment was the result of investigations launched after the patient-wait time scandal that rocked the Obama administration last year.
