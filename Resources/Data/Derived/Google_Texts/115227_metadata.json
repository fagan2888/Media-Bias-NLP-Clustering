Think of it as a kind of insurance for insurers \u2014 they pay into a pool that would help spread a single company\u2019s big losses across the whole industry. (A detailed explanation of what those terms mean can be found here.)\n\nJonathan Chait, calling the talking point a \u201cnew Death Panel,\u201d argued that it was a cynical attempt to capitalize on the fact that \u201c\u2019bailout\u2019 may be the single most unpopular policy concept in American politics.\u201d But despite conservatives\u2019 high hopes, the narrative died an untimely death last week, when the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the provisions will actually make the government around $8 billion in profits \u2014 it\u2019s a reverse bailout if anything. (This followed the speedy demise of another widely touted claim that the CBO projected Obamacare would cost the economy two million jobs.)\n\nBut in a new twist, Republicans in some states that refused to expand Medicaid under the ACA are being forced into their own \u201cgovernment bailout.\u201d Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel explains:\n\nWhen Democrats predict that the GOP will eventually have to embrace the Affordable Care Act, they usually start with the plight of rural hospitals. In the 25 states that have accepted the Medicaid expansion, these hospitals are taking in reimbursements when they cover the indigent who are newly covered. In the 25 states that haven\u2019t\u2014no reimbursements. Red states (and red-run blue states like Wisconsin) first embraced the Supreme Court decision that made Medicaid expansion optional, and saved them from putting up 10 percent of the cost of a new annual entitlement. But the costs of doing nothing are burning up the plains. How can a Republican governor fix this problem without accepting the Medicaid expansion? Ray Henry and Christina Cassidy explain: They\u2019ve trying to bail out hospitals within the states. In South Carolina the state has agreed to reimburse 100 percent Medicaid spending at distressed hospitals. In Georgia the Republican charged with this year\u2019s budget is looking at a bailout worth \u201ctens of millions of dollars.\u201d In Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant wants $4.4 million for a bailout.\n\nThe refusal to expand Medicaid remains a triumph of ideology over good governance. Many of the states refusing the expansion are among those with the highest rates of uninsured citizens. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the refusals will leave around five million people who earn too little to qualify for the ACA\u2019s insurance subsidies and fail to qualify for states\u2019 existing Medicaid programs in a \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d\n\nIronically, to the degree these states have to bail out their rural hospitals with state dollars, it\u2019s also the antithesis of fiscal conservatism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "States refusing to expand Medicaid now have to spend big bucks rescuing struggling hospitals.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "States refusing to expand Medicaid now have to spend big bucks rescuing struggling hospitals.", "title": "The Obamacare 'Bailout' Conservatives Don't Want to Talk About | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP120627120591.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-02-12T12:23:04-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/12/the-obamacare-bailout-conservatives-dont-want-to-talk-about/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "States refusing to expand Medicaid now have to spend big bucks rescuing struggling hospitals.", "title": "The Obamacare 'Bailout' Conservatives Don't Want to Talk About | BillMoyers.com", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP120627120591.jpg", "creator": "@JoshuaHol", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-02-12T12:07:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T12:23:04-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140212}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddd5\"", "article_summary": "How can a Republican governor fix this problem without accepting the Medicaid expansion?\n(This followed the speedy demise of another widely touted claim that the CBO projected Obamacare would cost the economy two million jobs.)\nIn Georgia the Republican charged with this year\u2019s budget is looking at a bailout worth \u201ctens of millions of dollars.\u201d In Mississippi, Gov.\nIn the 25 states that have accepted the Medicaid expansion, these hospitals are taking in reimbursements when they cover the indigent who are newly covered.\nMany of the states refusing the expansion are among those with the highest rates of uninsured citizens."}
