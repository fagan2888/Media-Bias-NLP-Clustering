But this window shopping tool, as we previously wrote, provided inaccurate estimates in many cases because it did not consider a person\u2019s specific age, household size or tobacco use \u2014 all factors that can greatly affect premiums.\n\nBut the site now asks visitors to provide specific ages for each household member when estimating the cost of premiums. That change was one of many recent improvements that have been made to the website. The new and improved anonymous shopper tool went live overnight on Dec. 1, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the anonymous shopper tool still does not consider tobacco use when estimating premiums \u2014 which can result in inaccurate estimates for smokers in most states. The website provides this new warning as visitors browse for plans in their area: \u201cThe prices you\u2019ll see are for people who don\u2019t use tobacco. You\u2019ll get final quotes for specific plans based on your income after you complete a Marketplace application.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can charge smokers up to 50 percent more \u2014 unless a state expressly prohibits charging higher premiums based on tobacco use. WebMD.com says, \u201cSeven states and Washington, D.C., will not charge smokers higher insurance premiums. The states are: California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.\u201d\n\nIn our Nov. 22 item, \u201cHealthCare.gov Estimates May Be Misleading,\u201d we compared HealthCare.gov premium estimates to the actual price quotes offered by Independence Blue Cross and Aetna for a family of four living in the Philadelphia suburbs. In our example, none of the four \u2014 ages 55, 54, 21 and 14 \u2014 are smokers. At that time, HealthCare.gov gave premium estimates that were significantly less than the prices quoted by the insurance companies. That\u2019s no longer the case. The premium estimates now are the same as the prices offered by the insurers.\n\nIt would be a different story, however, if the husband and wife in that family were both smokers. Independence Blue Cross, for example, would charge that same family anywhere from $218.95 to $279.98 more per month for the Silver plans than the estimates provided by HealthCare.gov.\n\nOur experience shows that HealthCare.gov now provides accurate estimates for non-smokers. But smokers in most states should know that the prices they wind up paying may be higher than the estimates they see on HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ab0\"", "article_summary": "The states are: California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.\u201dIn our Nov. 22 item, \u201cHealthCare.gov Estimates May Be Misleading,\u201d we compared HealthCare.gov premium estimates to the actual price quotes offered by Independence Blue Cross and Aetna for a family of four living in the Philadelphia suburbs.\nAt that time, HealthCare.gov gave premium estimates that were significantly less than the prices quoted by the insurance companies.\nHealthCare.gov allows visitors to anonymously surf the site to compare health plans on the federal exchange and obtain premium estimates without having to create an account.\nBut smokers in most states should know that the prices they wind up paying may be higher than the estimates they see on HealthCare.gov.\nThe premium estimates now are the same as the prices offered by the insurers."}
