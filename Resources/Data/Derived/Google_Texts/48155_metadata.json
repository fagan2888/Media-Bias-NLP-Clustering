There was also the economy.\n\n\u201cThe general change in the U.S. economy impacted the number of prospective students who wanted to go to school and receive a college degree,\u201d he said.\n\nEnrollment plunged 55 percent from 2011 to 2014, he said.\n\nWinding down operations could take 12 to 15 months because it plans to make sure every student graduates or transitions to a new school, he added.\n\nJones has 2,000 enrolled students, mostly working on business or education degrees. It also employs 115 people full time, plus an additional 90 adjunct members. Most are in Centennial.\n\nThe school has partnered with Trident University International, an online school in Cypress, Calif., that offers many of the same courses. Jones also is working with other schools that may provide education tracks unavailable at Trident.\n\nTrident was chosen because of its similar approach to student well-being and courses offered. It\u2019s also more affordable, Wallace pointed out. At the graduate level, Trident charges $475 per credit compared with Jones\u2019 $800. For undergrads, Trident credits are $350, compared with $530 at Jones.\n\nJones Intercable founder Glenn R. Jones pioneered this nontraditional learning back in 1987, when he started a cable TV network called Mind Extension University. It offered courses from more than 30 colleges televised to 30,000 students.\n\nHe moved the effort online in 1993 with the opening of Jones University, which became the first accredited online university in 1999, according to the school. (Jones Intercable sold to Comcast that same year.)\n\nThat was long before the current trend of Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs. This includes the range of courses from traditional academic schools to vocational or online hobbyist classes. Some are free; some cost hundreds of dollars. Some can be taken for college credit. Companies include Udemy, Coursera and Udacity.\n\nThe online learning market also includes companies like Denver-based Craftsy, which offers online video courses for sewing, photography and cake decorating.\n\nOne research firm, MarketsandMarkets, said global online learning revenues hit $2.55 billion in 2013 and were expected to grow to $7.83 billion by 2018.\n\nJones, the school\u2019s founder, continues to expand other business operations. He\u2019s behind a new 42-acre mixed-use development right next to the Centennial campus that was announced last fall.\n\nTrident also plans to rename its business school The Glenn R. Jones College of Business Administration.\n\n\u201cIt was important to Glenn that there be a mission to democratize education and create educational opportunities for students all around the world,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cLooking back, we\u2019re happy to have achieved that mission and see what we\u2019ve accomplished in 22 years.\u201d\n\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Gadgetress", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "First accredited online school, Jones University, to shutter in 2016", "title": "First accredited online school, Jones University, to shutter in 2016", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/02/first-accredited-online-school-jones-university-to-shutter-in-2016/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-02T17:34:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-02T17:34:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbf0\"", "article_summary": "He moved the effort online in 1993 with the opening of Jones University, which became the first accredited online university in 1999, according to the school.\nThe school has partnered with Trident University International, an online school in Cypress, Calif., that offers many of the same courses.\nTrident also plans to rename its business school The Glenn R.
