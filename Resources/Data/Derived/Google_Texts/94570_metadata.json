Opinions offered here are Dr. Deane's alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the NMHIX Board.\n\nMedicare has been in trouble since it was created in 1965. Its fiscal woes became obvious when the Congressional Budget Office warned in 1996 that the Medicare Trust Fund would be bankrupt by 2015 and would be unable to pay for medical services. The public outcry led to an ill-conceived solution in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 called the Sustained Growth Ratio.\n\nSustained Growth Ratio and DocFix\n\nCongress implemented the Sustained Growth Ratio in 1998 and began to cut payments to doctors who cared for Medicare patients: 600,000 physicians for over 40 million seniors.\n\nThese cuts did not solve the Medicare fiscal imbalance. They did, however, exacerbate an already critical doctor shortage just as baby boomers were reaching their golden years. Medicare suffered from both medical woes \u2013 limited access to care \u2013 as well as a fiscal nightmare of impending bankruptcy.\n\nAs noted here at TheBlaze, Congress\u2019 infamous DocFix fixed neither Medicare\u2019s doctor problem nor its economic conundrum. Repeal of both the Sustained Growth Ratio and the DocFix would move us away from fantasyland and closer to reality. These two repeals would not solve either Medicare\u2019s medical dilemma nor its spending imbalance. Congress is currently negotiating various adjustments to Medicare such extended eligibility age, further reductions in reimbursement, or alterations in means-testing. They will not fix Medicare. These modifications will only provide political cover.\n\nMedicare cannot be fixed. Any promise to save Medicare is more than unrealistic. It is impossible. Share:\n\nMedicare cannot be fixed. Any promise to save \u201cMedicare as we know it\u201d is more than simply unrealistic. It is impossible. Anyone making such a promise either doesn\u2019t understand first grade arithmetic or is just plain lying.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n\nYou don\u2019t need a PhD in Economics from Harvard to know that any system with limited supply and unlimited demand is unstable and cannot survive. That\u2019s like pouring water at a constant rate into a barrel while making the hole at the bottom bigger and bigger. The barrel will soon be empty and you will simply be wasting water.\n\nThat is Medicare: increasing demand for services \u2013 more people demanding more expensive technologies \u2013 paid by a fixed or decreasing supply of dollars. The supply of money for you keeps dropping because more and more dollars are being sucked away from care services to pay for care bureaucracy like Medicare and Obamacare.\n\nTreatments for illnesses that us old folks get \u2013 heart disease, arthritis, cancer, and diabetes \u2013 are getting better all the time.They are also getting more expensive. Medicare could be saved by medical rationing \u2013 restricting medical procedures to less expensive ones. Rationing might \u201csave\u201d Medicare, but rationing will kill seniors, and what is left won\u2019t be \u201cMedicare as we know it.\u201d\n\nWe must face facts. Poorly conceived systems \u2013 political ones like Soveit Russia or financing schemes such as Medicare \u2013 eventually collapse under the weight of their conceptual flaws. Hopefully, Medicare will succumb to Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s creative destruction. Someone will propose a better-designed system, which will by its obvious superiority, replace the ill-conceived plan called Medicare.\n\nSaving Ourselves by Replacing Medicare\n\nLet\u2019s speed things up. Let\u2019s save ourselves. Let\u2019s kill Medicare.\n\nSuppose the federal government counted up all the dollars that each senior citizen contributed to the Medicare Trust Fund over his or her working lifetime. Let\u2019s say that averaged out to $100,000 for each of the 49 million Americans who are now covered by Medicare. That\u2019s how much each person is owed.\n\nSimple math reveals: $100,000 times 49,000,000 people = $4.9 trillion. In 2014, the U.S. spent well over $500 billion on Medicare.\n\nSuppose Washington, D.C. put $10,000 a year for the next 10 years into 49 million Health Savings Accounts, one for each member of the over-65 crowd. That would cost $4.9 trillion over 10 years. The current projection for Medicare spending over the next 10 years is $6.6 trillion, which is considerably more than what this proposed plan would cost.\n\nSeniors could use their money to pay for their care as they see fit. They could shop around and would have a strong incentive to economize, in stark contrast to the federal government. Sellers of medical goods and services would have to compete for seniors\u2019 dollars, driving down the prices enormously. There would be no medical rationing. And most importantly, the government would no longer control your care.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts can only be used for medical expenses and for medical insurance. At death, the unused portion would be transferable to a family member of your choice, without being taxed.\n\nMedicare bureaucracy would virtually cease to exist. The public has no idea of the size, reach, and expense of this monster, whose upkeep and growth we unknowingly support.\n\nMedicare\u2019s vaunted dollar-efficiency, \u201conly 3 percent administrative cost,\u201d is a myth. It implies that 97 percent of Medicare dollars go to care. Hogwash! Horsefeathers! B.S.! That ignores all the other costs.\n\nMedicare has a complex, generally incomprehensibly, opaque, and often contradictory structure of rules and regulations; billing and coding procedures and processes; and compliance activities. Think about the costs (that you pay for) of writing, reviewing, interpreting, defending in court, rewriting, and enforcing of millions of pages of 10-point font, single-spaced government mandates.\n\nUnder this plan, all Medicare spending would go to health CARE. This would be dollar-efficient spending instead of what we now have: a massively wasteful, dollar-inefficient system that will soon bankrupt itself and take us down with it.\n\nWant Time With Your Doctor?\n\nThere is a second, even better benefit to a Health Savings Account plan: time with your doctor. At present, care providers waste millions of hours a year \u2013 hours they cannot spend with you \u2013 reviewing and being tested on worthless study modules on subjects that have nothing to do with improving your health.\n\nTo name but a few, there are the latest HIPAA compliance guidelines; \u201cPreparing your own sterile preparations\u201d (we haven\u2019t done that since my grandfather practiced medicine); intricacies of the ICD-10 billing code book (with 148,000 codes: 10 times the number of diseases that affect humans); or latest revision in electronic medical records so now it takes over 20 minutes just to write a prescription for Penicillin.\n\nNot only do you want that doctor-patient time, but so does your provider!\n\nWe can save Medicare, not \u201cas we know it,\u201d but create a much better version. A Health Savings Account is an approach to consider and test. It is time for our elected officials to stop using \u201cpolitically acceptable\u201d as an excuse to avoid doing what is right and necessary for We The People.\n\nDr. Deane Waldman MD MBA is author of award-winning \u201cThe Cancer In Healthcare;\u201d Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology and Decision Science; and Adjunct Scholar (Healthcare) for the Rio Grande Foundation, a public policy think tank.
