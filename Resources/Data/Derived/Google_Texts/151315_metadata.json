There\u2019s plenty more where they came from, though: the Jones Family Singers are modern practitioners of a long musical tradition, and they premiere their song \u201cDown on Me\u201d today on Speakeasy.\n\n\u201cModern\u201d is a relative term, of course: the Texas group, comprising five sisters, two brothers and their father, has been singing together for more than 20 years, infusing their joyful, reverent songs with elements of vintage soul and R&B. Jittery guitar and a swift-flowing backbeat propel \u201cDown on Me,\u201d which features lyrics offering praise to the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe song kicks off the Jones Family Singers\u2019 first studio album, \u201cThe Spirit Speaks,\u201d recorded after years of performing in churches and at gospel festivals. The album began humbly enough, with the family planning to record a handful of songs to accompany a documentary about the group by the Austin, Tex., filmmaker Alan Berg. A three-day studio session in Austin instead yielded enough material for \u201cThe Spirit Speaks.\u201d Fred Jones, the family patriarch, said it\u2019s an indication that the Jones Family Singers are doing right.\n\n\u201cThe group has had many obstacles in our path that seemed to suggest that gospel music would get you nowhere, but after prayer and much pressing forward, God always showed us that there is success in Christian living being faithful to that genre of music,\u201d said Jones, who has been a bishop for three decades at Mount Zion Church of God In Christ in Markham, Tex. \u201cAs a result of the many tests we faced, we asked God to \u2018let your Spirit fall down on us,\u2019 and He did.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Spirit Speaks\u201d is due April 1on Arts + Labor. What do you think of \u201cDown on Me?\u201d Leave your thoughts in the comments.\n\nFor more music news, follow @erdanton.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Gospel group the Jones Family Singers premiere \"Down on Me\" on Speakeasy.", "title": "Jones Family Singers Honor Holy Spirit on \u2018Down On Me\u2019 (Song Premiere)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/18/jones-family-singers-honor-holy-spirit-on-down-on-me-song-premiere/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Jones Family Singers Honor Holy Spirit on \u2018Down On Me\u2019 (Song Premiere)", "description": "Gospel group the Jones Family Singers premiere \"Down on Me\" on Speakeasy.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Eric R.
