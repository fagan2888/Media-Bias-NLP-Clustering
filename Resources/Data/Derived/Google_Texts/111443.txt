A huge bobcat was seen darting across the fairway Friday at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.

It was a rare sighting of the big cat between the first and second holes on TPC Scottsdale’s Stadium Course.

According to the Arizona Game and Fish website, bobcats are generally seen alone.

They’re most active around sunrise and sunset, which made Friday’s daytime sighting all the more unusual.

The bobcat made the guest appearance on a day that saw 160,415 people pack into TPC Scottsdale. Attendance broke the previous Friday record (123,674) set in 2014 by nearly 37,000.

Friday’s attendance was the 10th-highest one-round total in the 81 year history of the event.
