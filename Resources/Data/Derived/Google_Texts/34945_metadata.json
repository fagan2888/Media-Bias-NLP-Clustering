Three members voted in favor \u2014 Sen. Pat Roberts, Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Kevin Yoder \u2014 and three members voted against: Reps. Tim Huelskamp, Lynn Jenkins and Mike Pompeo.\n\nThree years later, the issue has again arisen in Washington. The bank\u2019s charter expired July 1, and while attempts to revive it have been successful in the Senate, the House didn\u2019t vote on the matter before adjourning Wednesday for its five-week August recess.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank is a credit agency for the federal government, financing and insuring purchases by non-American individuals and businesses when they purchase products from American businesses. Though its existence dates back to the Great Depression, its charter must be renewed by Congress every few years.\n\nDepending on whom you ask, the bank is either a necessary financial institution allowing American businesses to compete overseas, an extravagant example of corporate welfare run amok, or something in between. In the minds of most members of Kansas\u2019 congressional delegation, the bank seems to fall within the latter category.\n\n\u201cThe Kansas economy is highly dependent on exporting our products, and I have been contacted by employers from all across Kansas who have attested to the importance of the Ex-Im Bank in their efforts to sell those products and services overseas,\u201d Jenkins said in an email Thursday. \u201cI have also heard from many Kansans who are concerned that the Ex-Im Bank places taxpayers\u2019 money at risk for loans, too much of which benefits a handful of major corporations.\u201d\n\nJenkins said she would prefer if export loans were financed in the free market. If the bank\u2019s charter is to be reauthorized, the 2nd District representative said reforms should be put in place to remove taxpayers from any risk.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by 4th District Rep. Mike Pompeo, who said in an interview last week that major revisions to the bank\u2019s charter are needed.\n\n\u201cWe should get taxpayers out of projects that benefit private enterprise,\u201d Pompeo said, adding that \u201ca half-dozen reforms\u201d are necessary before the bank\u2019s charter should be reauthorized.\n\nHuelskamp, meanwhile, has been an outspoken opponent of the bank, calling it \u201can outdated, Depression-era program\u201d and \u201cspecial interest handout\u201d in a news release last year. Huelskamp\u2019s office and Yoder\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment last week.\n\nOpposition to the Export-Import Bank has resulted in a strange alliance of fiscal conservatives, like Huelskamp, and progressives, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. While running for president, then-Sen. Barack Obama opposed the Export-Import Bank but as president Obama has urged Congress to reauthorize it.\n\nOn July 26, the Senate voted to approve an amendment to a six-year highway bill that would reauthorize the bank. With both Kansas senators voting in favor, the amendment passed 64-29. However, the House opted not to take up the highway bill before its August recess, leaving the bank unable to approve any new deals made by U.S. businesses overseas.\n\nThat uncertainty isn\u2019t sitting well with companies that export many of their products. Boeing threatened last week to move portions of its manufacturing overseas to take advantage of export-import banks in other nations and both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Kansas Chamber of Commerce support reauthorization.\n\n\u201cEliminating the program at this juncture, with no public or private U.S. alternative in place, essentially means unilaterally disarming ourselves in the economic battle to attract a market for our products,\u201d said Emily Mitchell, the Kansas Chamber\u2019s director of communications. \u201cOur Kansas engineering, aerospace and ag partners, to name a few, need this tool in their international trade toolbox.\u201d\n\nSuch a strong push from business groups has placed some Kansas Republicans in a tight spot between their fiscal conservatism and their support for agriculture and aerospace companies. For Moran, the choice is clear.\n\n\u201cSince 2007, the Ex-Im Bank has helped more than 83 Kansas companies and their workers compete in the global economy,\u201d the freshman senator said in an email last week. \u201cThe Kansas Chamber of Commerce and many Kansas businesses \u2014 both large and small \u2014 asked that I support reauthorization because it is so important to their ability to compete and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nMoran was asked about the bank\u2019s charter during a town hall meeting in Emporia on Friday. He told the crowd that while he wished the U.S. and other countries such as China didn\u2019t have export-import banks, Ex-Im\u2019s charter must be renewed if American companies are to compete internationally.\n\n\u201cIn my view, if you want to diminish further the manufacturing base in our country, if you want China to be more supreme than it is in the economy, take away one of the tools that allows our companies in Kansas and across the country to meet the competition that comes from all those other countries that have this bank,\u201d Moran said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "In May 2012, Kansas' all-Republican congressional delegation was split over whether to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
