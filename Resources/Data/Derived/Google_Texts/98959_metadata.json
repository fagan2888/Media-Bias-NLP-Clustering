If found guilty they have to repay lost wages to the workers they fire. Some employers treat this as a cost of doing business. That must be stopped. Penalties should be large enough to stop this illegality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor addresses one of the oft-overlooked causes of our crippling income inequality VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: Unions can save the middle class", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor addresses one of the oft-overlooked causes of our crippling income inequality VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: Unions can save the middle class", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/06/robert_reich_unions_can_save_the_middle_class_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor addresses one of the oft-overlooked causes of our crippling income inequality VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: Unions can save the middle class", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Middle Class, RobertReich.org, Unions, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde414\"", "article_summary": "In fact, the decline of the American middle class mirrors almost exactly the decline of American labor union membership.\nTopics: Middle Class, RobertReich.org, Unions, Video, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogOne big reason America was far more equal in the 1950s and 1960s than now is unions were stronger then.\nThat gave workers bargaining power to get a fair share of the economy\u2019s gains \u2013 and unions helped improve wages and working conditions for everyone.\nSecond, build in real penalties on companies that violate labor laws by firing workers who try to organize a union or intimidating others.\nFirst, make it easier to form a union, with a simple majority of workers voting up or down."}
