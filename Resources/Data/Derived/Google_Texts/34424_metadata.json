ABOVE: Grossman, without her \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d makeup and clothing.\n\nBy Jeremy Foster\n\nCosplay \u2014 short for costume players \u2014 has become a mainstay at comic conventions.\n\nCara Nicole, of Phoenix, would know. She appears at 30 conventions a year and attended the last two conventions in Ventura. In 2014, she came to the Ventura County Fairgrounds as the Marvel Comic character Black Widow and says this year will be a surprise.\n\nIn its fourth year, Ventura\u2019s hometown version of San Diego\u2019s hugely popular Comic-Con International convention is expected to surpass last year\u2019s attendance of 10,000 people this weekend. More than a dozen professional cosplay guests, including Nicole, will be on hand to mingle with visitors and appear in panels.\n\nNicole said cosplay encourages people to get their geek on and is especially attractive to introverts, who sometimes find that it\u2019s more comfortable to adopt a persona like that of other comic characters such as Batgirl or Harley Quinn.\n\nBeing a comic and fantasy convention, visitors are encouraged to dress up as their favorite super hero or villain. For some, putting on a costume is just the beginning.\n\nThe conventions are a chance for everyday people to show no shame and spare no expense to look and act like their favorite fictional characters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the Geek Fashion Show because it\u2019s not only about cosplay but also geek clothing,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cGeek chic is really in right now. It\u2019s finally becoming acceptable to wear Spider-Man T-shirts and Firefly hats.\u201d\n\nComic cons are a great way to bridge generational gaps among family members, she added.\n\n\u201cI think Batman of the Adam West generation can have something in common with Batman of the George Clooney generation and the animated series of new Batmans,\u201d she said. \u201cI love seeing families come together and enjoy pop culture.\u201d\n\nMore than just a cornucopia of comic books, Central Coast Comic Con at the Ventura Fairgrounds this weekend will offer everything from hard-to-find comic books, gaming events, celebrities, discussion panels and cosplayer contests.\n\n\u201cThere are no other local comic cons or pop culture events like this,\u201d said Kris Blackburn, the marketing and operations manager for WTF Events, the company putting on this weekend\u2019s showy display. \u201cI fought for nearly two years to get the chance to bring this event to Ventura. Being community-first was the only way we would have ever done this event.\u201d\n\nLike the bigger Comic Cons, the Central Coast Comic Con \u2014 also known as C4 \u2014 showcases what is loved in pop culture at large, such as video games and movies based on comic book heroes. Unlike the big production in San Diego, the Central Coast Comic Con was organized to offer an affordable, hometown alternative and to support local community causes.\n\n\u201cThe lessons we took from the last two years is that many still do not know what a comic con is,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cWe are still teaching the community that it\u2019s more than comics and cosplay. This event is about community and giving back.\u201d\n\nTable after table of vendors will sell everything from comic books and T-shirts to action figures and prop weapons.\n\nSome 100 vendors, 75 artists, writers, creators and 35 celebrities are slated to attend the convention. Two main halls \u2014 called Rebel Legion and Star Fleet \u2014 will be devoted to that talent, comic books and the like. Three other halls will feature more entertainment, such as gaming events, contests and panel discussions.\n\nOutside attractions will feature more than 15 movie cars such as the The Dragula car from the The Munsters and the Jurassic Park Explorer car.\n\nKid\u2019s Day events on Sunday will offer a variety of fun, including a costume contest, a pro-wrestling panel discussion, a magic show and a Disney princess show.\n\nCelebrity guests slated to appear are actor and Simi Valley resident Sid Haig, known for his Capt. Spaulding character from films \u201cHouse of 1000 Corpses\u201d and \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rejects;\u201d Tommy \u201cTiny\u201d Lister, best known as Deebo from \u201cFriday;\u201d Gigi Edgley, aka Chiana from \u201cFarscape,\u201d and actor Nicholas Brendon, best known as Xander Harris on the \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d television series.\n\nOf course, what\u2019s a comic con without comics?\n\nGeorge Chase, of Hypno Comics in Ventura, is helping comic book creators like Bob Layton, Howard Chaykin, and Allen Bellman to meet with fans and sign autographs.\n\n\u201cThe movies have made a new generation of fans, and it\u2019s our job to show them the decades of stories available for these characters,\u201d Chase said. \u201cComic books are more than a product. They are a hobby, a shared lifestyle now, a community. Being a geek is a mainstream way of life these days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Central Coast Comic Con lets geeks go chic", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/entertainment/central-coast-comic-con-lets-geeks-go-chic-ep-1248332674-351140211.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/screen+shot+2015-08-28+at+11.49.03+am_1440787795171_23335367_ver1.0_640_480.png", "height": 467}, "type": "article", "description": "Event at the Ventura County Fairgrounds lets guests get creative about their costumes and lifestyle.", "title": "Central Coast Comic Con lets geeks go chic"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/screen+shot+2015-08-28+at+11.49.03+am_1440787795171_23335367_ver1.0_640_480.png", "description": "Event at the Ventura County Fairgrounds lets guests get creative about their costumes and lifestyle.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Central Coast Comic Con lets geeks go chic"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe74\"", "article_summary": "Unlike the big production in San Diego, the Central Coast Comic Con was organized to offer an affordable, hometown alternative and to support local community causes.\nContributed photo/Casey O\u2019Quinn Character actor Tommy Lister will be among the celebrities at the Central Coast Comic Con Saturday and Sunday at the Ventura County Fairgrounds.\n\u201cI love seeing families come together and enjoy pop culture.\u201dMore than just a cornucopia of comic books, Central Coast Comic Con at the Ventura Fairgrounds this weekend will offer everything from hard-to-find comic books, gaming events, celebrities, discussion panels and cosplayer contests.\nContributed photo Naomi Grossman, who plays Pepper on \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d will be on hand at the Central Coast Comic Con, which is Saturday and Sunday at the Ventura County Fairgrounds.\nTwo main halls \u2014 called Rebel Legion and Star Fleet \u2014 will be devoted to that talent, comic books and the like."}
