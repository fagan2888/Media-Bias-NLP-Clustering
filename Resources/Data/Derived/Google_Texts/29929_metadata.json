Walker is putting the state on the hook for the new Bucks stadium. His plan to pay for it is based on a Goldman Sachs concocted plan that player pay and resulting taxes will magically rise to cover our new liability.\n\nNow we learn that he wants to grab $319 million from the university system to help balance his growing deficit. The UW has a basketball team too, the Badgers, who play for nothing in a paid-for stadium. The justification for the UW has also been the higher pay and taxes paid by its graduates who, unlike NBA stars, stay and make the state better long term in ways that really matter.\n\nHere\u2019s a better idea. Fund the Badgers. Forget the Bucks.\n\nBernard Starzewski\n\nValders\n\nTaxed enough?\n\nI\u2019m taxed enough already! Reduce wasteful spending! Prioritize services! Encourage personal responsibility!\n\nBut I still expect my side street plowed by 5 p.m. on a Sunday night even if it\u2019s still snowing. I also expect you to plow my street before I clean my driveway so I don\u2019t have to go out a second time, and don\u2019t bury any of the fire hydrants near my house because the fire department will need to use them if my house starts on fire. Finally, don\u2019t be giving me a ticket for parking on the street overnight after a snowstorm since no one specifically told me that the streets were going to be plowed and my car would be in the way.\n\nReally!?\n\nCarla Halvorson\n\nMishicot\n\nNot for prophet\n\nTerrorists groups like ISIS, al-Qaida (several different factions) and Boko Haram in Africa are killing people to gain power and control of Islam. Mullahs are opening up schools, training male students in radical Islam. Moderate Muslims need to speak up to these radical defects of character.\n\nWomen are considered second-class citizens, not allowed to drive a car, go to school or run a business according to radical beliefs. They want America to fight their group; it makes that particular terrorist group more powerful. You can kill people but democracy will remain strong. Terrorists are doing this for profit, not for a prophet.\n\nJerome Bolle\n\nWhitelaw\n\nMiddle class\n\nOur America is a work in progress, but fast approaching a critical point for the middle class. We need to fix, not replace, our economic engine. We need to return it to the simplicity of its founding. It needs to provide the capital for businesses and jobs, but not speculation and manipulation! And, if speculation and manipulation, then the tax should be extreme, at least until every American is employed and earning a living. Isn\u2019t that fair for us to ask of our economy?\n\nWe must stop giving the reward before the effort. I don\u2019t believe in defeat, I believe sometimes you need to step back, assess, correct and move out smartly! We keep overlooking the economic elephant in the room, cost of labor. It costs jobs because some Americans want a better return on investment not realizing nor maybe caring about the real cost to America. Jobs!\n\nThis nation will be only as strong as its middle class. That\u2019s where freedom resides. But, we grow weaker; we say nothing.\n\nEd Hansen\n\nManitowoc\n\nName change\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name? That depends who is doing the naming. The latest new wrinkle out of the Obama administration is that the Taliban in Afghanistan are no longer \u201cIslamic terrorists.\u201d Suddenly they have become \u201carmed insurgents.\u201d How convenient. Since U.S. policy is not to negotiate with terrorists, with a simple change of name, we can now negotiate with the bad guys and not violate U.S. policy. After all, they are now insurgents and not terrorists. It is an amusing spectacle to listen to administration spokespersons turn themselves inside-out to avoid linking Islamic and terrorists in the same sentence.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1DPOcTm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Our Opinion Panel weighs in on the issues of the day", "og": {"site_name": "HTR Media", "description": "Our Opinion Panel weighs in on the issues of the day", "title": "Opinion panel: Bucks funding, taxes and terrorists", "url": "http://www.htrnews.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/02/07/panel-discussion/23039143/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/htrnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our Opinion Panel weighs in on the issues of the day", "title": "Opinion panel: Bucks funding, taxes and terrorists", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f704ab9ea188554d241efceeeca3ec9b417cd105/c=84-0-422-338&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Manitowoc/2015/02/07/B9316137945Z.1_20150207140250_000_GVP9SGUIH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@htrnews", "site": "@htrnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883325026", "fb": {"app_id": 179306802094584}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "panel discussion, Manitowoc, Herald Times Reporter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7c2\"", "article_summary": "It is an amusing spectacle to listen to administration spokespersons turn themselves inside-out to avoid linking Islamic and terrorists in the same sentence.\nHis plan to pay for it is based on a Goldman Sachs concocted plan that player pay and resulting taxes will magically rise to cover our new liability.\nWalker is putting the state on the hook for the new Bucks stadium.\nNow we learn that he wants to grab $319 million from the university system to help balance his growing deficit.\nThe latest new wrinkle out of the Obama administration is that the Taliban in Afghanistan are no longer \u201cIslamic terrorists.\u201d Suddenly they have become \u201carmed insurgents.\u201d How convenient."}
