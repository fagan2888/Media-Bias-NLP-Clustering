Could a team come in with a trade that maybe Minnesota doesn\u2019t see? Yes, it could happen. Therefore, it is not done. But, essentially before the papers have been signed, there is a handshake agreement: Kevin Love to the Cavs, Andrew Wiggins to the Timberwolves, and I believe Thaddeus Young will end up in Minnesota, either as part of a separate deal or as part of a three-way deal. Possibly Anthony Bennett, who\u2019s on the Cavs right now, could get re-routed to Philadelphia in part of a deal for Thaddeus Young, there will be draft picks involved.\n\n\u201cBut essentially what you need to know if you\u2019re an NBA fan: Kevin Love\u2019s going to be on the Cavs barring anything unforeseen, and Andrew Wiggins, the No. 1 overall pick, is going to be in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nIt has seemed inevitable for a while now \u2014 or soon after LeBron James announced his return to Cleveland \u2014 that Love would land on the Cavs. Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor told the Pioneer Press over the weekend that Love would likely be dealt on Aug. 23 or 24, a date that further hinted to a trade with Cleveland.\n\nThe Cavs signed Wiggins to a four-year deal on July 24, which prevented them from trading him for 30 days but made it easier for them to make a trade for Love once that period ends. Wiggins is set to earn $5.5 million next season, meaning the Cavs clear that much from their books when dealing him, helping to make room for a player like Love, who is due $15.7 million next season.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andrew Wiggins,Cavaliers,Glen Taylor,Kevin Love,LeBron James,NBA,Timberwolves,trade", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "The Timberwolves have agreed to a deal to send Kevin Love to Cleveland, but it cannot be made official until Aug. 23, when the Cavs are able to trade No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins.", "title": "Report: Cavs, Timberwolves have \"handshake\" deal in place for Kevin Trade", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/08/04/cavaliers-timberwolves-agree-kevin-love-trade/11304/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/08/love-495x352.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Timberwolves have agreed to a deal to send Kevin Love to Cleveland, but it cannot be made official until Aug. 23, when the Cavs are able to trade No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins.", "title": "Report: Cavs, Timberwolves have \u201chandshake\u201d deal for Kevin Love", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/08/04/cavaliers-timberwolves-agree-kevin-love-trade/11304/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/08/love-495x352.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Timberwolves have agreed to a deal to send Kevin Love to Cleveland, but it cannot be made official until Aug. 23, when the Cavs are able to trade No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb48\"", "article_summary": "The Timberwolves have a handshake deal in place to send all-star forward Kevin Love to the Cavaliers, ESPN.com\u2019s Brian Windhorst said on ESPN Radio on Monday.\n\u201cThe teams have agreed, but they can\u2019t say they have agreed and they can\u2019t agree because we\u2019re in this weird moratorium period, because you can\u2019t Andrew Wiggins until the 23rd of this month.\n\u201cBut essentially what you need to know if you\u2019re an NBA fan: Kevin Love\u2019s going to be on the Cavs barring anything unforeseen, and Andrew Wiggins, the No.\nBut, essentially before the papers have been signed, there is a handshake agreement: Kevin Love to the Cavs, Andrew Wiggins to the Timberwolves, and I believe Thaddeus Young will end up in Minnesota, either as part of a separate deal or as part of a three-way deal.\nThe Cavs signed Wiggins to a four-year deal on July 24, which prevented them from trading him for 30 days but made it easier for them to make a trade for Love once that period ends."}
