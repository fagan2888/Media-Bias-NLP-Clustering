PETERSBURG \u2014 From that gaggle of fearless geese constantly standing guard at Crescent Lake to the mysterious night heron that meanders in the grass at Northshore Park after dark and the roseate spoonbills hanging out in the watery ditches off Ulmerton Road, avians are a big part of the scenery anywhere in the city.\n\nBirds help determine the health of the landscape and the critters that live there, researchers say, and their migration patterns can hint at changing weather patterns. That\u2019s why each year several dozen environmentalists wake up well before dawn to count birds in Pinellas County as part of the Audubon Society\u2019s Christmas Bird Count, a nationwide survey now in its 114th year.\n\nBetween Dec. 14 and Jan. 5, thousands of volunteers across the country peruse cities and towns, marking down every bird and bird species they see.\n\n\u201cEverything you see gets counted,\u201d said environmental activist Lorraine Margeson, who helps coordinate the St. Petersburg Christmas Bird Count. \u201cEverything that flies \u2014 except butterflies and bugs \u2014 you count.\u201d\n\nVolunteers start between 2 and 4 a.m., when they try to count nocturnal birds such as owls, for which they use a device that mimics their call. They then visually survey areas with known bird concentrations, such as Weedon Island Preserve or Clam Bayou. Audubon records for the 2012 count show 162 bird species were found in south Pinellas and 156 in north Pinellas.\n\nOrganizers say the work is crucial because knowing how bird concentrations fluctuate from year to year helps determine long-term environmental changes.\n\n\u201cData from the Audubon Christmas Bird Count are at the heart of hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies and inform decisions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of the Interior and the EPA,\u201d Gary Langham, Audubon\u2019s chief scientist, wrote. \u201cBecause birds are early indicators of environmental threats to habitats we share, this is a vital survey of North America and, increasingly, the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\n\nMargeson said she is seeing \u201csome really scary trends\u201d suggesting that shifting climate patterns could be affecting bird migration patterns, for example, warmer weather up north would mean birds wouldn\u2019t have to travel as far south to search for food in the winter.\n\n\u201cBirds species that we used to get a lot of are not making it this far down,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore this year, volunteers surveyed only mainland areas of north and south Pinellas. The south county survey was earlier this month, and the north county survey was this past weekend. This year, a third area \u2014 encompassing Fort De Soto Park, Egmont Key, Shell Key Preserve and reaching down into Manatee County\u2019s Anna Maria Island \u2014 has been added and will be surveyed on Jan. 5. For birders, including these particularly avian-heavy locales, where rare birds such as least terns and red knots tend to congregate, is going to be huge.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get data that we just never had,\u201d Margeson said.\n\nkbradshaw@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-7999\n\nTwitter: @kbradshawTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 23:53:17 -0400", "Description": "ST.
