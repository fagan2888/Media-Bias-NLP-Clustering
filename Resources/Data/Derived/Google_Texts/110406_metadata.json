At NARAL Pro-Choice NC, we believe it\u2019s critical that this rule-making process not be politicized by the same political interests and lawmakers that sought to eliminate access to abortion care in the first place,\u201d said Suzanne Buckley, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it \u2013 the law that forced these rules to be written was backed by politicians with a single goal: to prevent women in North Carolina from accessing safe, legal abortion care,\u201d continued Buckley. \u201cWe would welcome oversight and regulations that protect patient safety, but there is absolutely no medical basis for the restrictions proposed by the General Assembly. The law had nothing to do with keeping women safe, and everything to do with making it practically impossible for North Carolina women to access abortion care.\u201d\n\nDHHS will hold a 60-day a public comment period and a public hearing on Friday, December 19 before the new rules are approved. Buckley concluded, \u201cDuring this period of public input, NARAL Pro-Choice NC will do everything possible to amplify the perspectives of women\u2019s health experts, abortion providers, and concerned citizens who believe that women\u2019s health, safety and wellbeing \u2013not a political agenda\u2013 should come first in North Carolina. DHHS would be wise to heed that call.\u201d\n\nRegulations such as these \u2013 generally known as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP laws \u2013 are a commonplace legislative tactic designed to force the closure of facilities where safe, legal abortions are provided by imposing burdensome and medically unnecessary requirements. Currently, 90% of North Carolina counties have no abortion provider, forcing 57% of women to travel great distances, often a full days drive, to access abortion care. \u201cIf the final regulations put politics over women\u2019s health, women and families in North Carolina will lose access to a a wide range of essential reproductive health care services from cancer screenings to check-ups to abortion care, with rural and low-income women being hit the hardest,\u201d said Buckley.\n\nRecent polling found that 76 percent of those surveyed \u2013 representing all age groups, political affiliations, ethnicities and regions of the state \u2013 agree that decisions about whether to choose adoption, end a pregnancy, or raise a child must be left to a woman, her family, and her faith, with the counsel of her doctor or health care provider, not a politician. \u201cThe fact is, North Carolinians are united in their agreement that politicians should not interfere in these personal decisions,\u201d Buckley said.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2902\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services has written a set of regulations with input from experts in the field of reproductive health care.\nCurrently, 90% of North Carolina counties have no abortion provider, forcing 57% of women to travel great distances, often a full days drive, to access abortion care.\nBuckley concluded, \u201cDuring this period of public input, NARAL Pro-Choice NC will do everything possible to amplify the perspectives of women\u2019s health experts, abortion providers, and concerned citizens who believe that women\u2019s health, safety and wellbeing \u2013not a political agenda\u2013 should come first in North Carolina.\nDURHAM, NC\u2014Today the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released a set of rules regulating abortion providers in North Carolina, in accordance with SB 353, which the legislature passed in an extended legislative session this year.\n\u201cThe fact is, North Carolinians are united in their agreement that politicians should not interfere in these personal decisions,\u201d Buckley said."}
