It isn\u2019t a holiday observed by post offices or banks, at least not in any official capacity. You won\u2019t be getting a day off (although you might be getting off). And, no, it has nothing to do with Mother\u2019s Day (ideally).\n\nGive up? It\u2019s International Masturbation Month, according to, you know, some people who decided it is. It\u2019s also National Pet Month, National Bike Month, National ADHD Awareness Month and, like 14 other things. Of all the causes vying for the public\u2019s attention this month, Masturbation Month certainly has the most pleasurable fundraising approach: masturbate-a-thons, in which people literally cum together for a cause. Yes, this is a thing that exists in the world, and it\u2019s been around for nearly 20 years now.\n\nI talked to Good Vibrations Staff Sexologist Carol Queen, one of the minds behind this commemorative month, to talk onanistic advocacy, vanishing taboos and masturbation slang.\n\nHow did Masturbation Month get started?\n\nIn 1994, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, then the U.S. surgeon general, was fired for saying one brief and sensible thing about masturbation: that \u201cit\u2019s something that perhaps should be taught\u201d about in sex-ed curricula. Good Vibrations staff struggled to make sense of this senseless situation, and decided to create National Masturbation Month, now known as International Masturbation Month, to celebrate and provoke discourse about this so prevalent but often disrespected sexual practice.\n\nWhat\u2019s it take to make an international month, anyway? Is there an official process or do you just declare it \u201csuch and such\u201d month and hope people listen?\n\nI don\u2019t know how all those other quirky holidays got on the calendar, but in this case, we just did it and waited for the people to celebrate.\n\nWhy do we need to have an International Masturbation Month? Is masturbation really something in need of awareness-raising?\n\nWell, if the Kinsey Reports were right that almost everyone masturbates, at least at some point in their life, you could argue that this is a behavior that needs no boosters. But it\u2019s also a serious source of shame and opprobrium. That\u2019s, in fact, a terrible mix \u2014 it\u2019s not rare, yet when someone notable says something neutrally, carefully respectful about it, they get the axe. Ordinary people who do it think there\u2019s something wrong with them, and it\u2019s painted as a pathetic third choice if you can\u2019t get someone to have sex with you. In fact, if you can shake off this bad rap, masturbation is amazing. It can provide extraordinary pleasure, or just help you get to sleep, teach you about your body and sexual responses, and help keep the blood flowing in the nethers, as they might say on Firefly. It\u2019s good for you, unless you do it so much that you forget to eat or run afoul of the laws of physics \u2014 here I\u2019m really talking about friction.\n\nJust how far have we come since Jocelyn Elders\u2019 Masturbationgate? Have much have people\u2019s views on masturbation evolved?\n\nIt\u2019s a glass-half-empty thing. We\u2019ve had almost 20 years of more open discourse about it \u2014 at least during May every year \u2014 so of course things have improved. But generations of students still have terrible sex education, so it\u2019s like the consciousness-raising has to start all over again every few years.\n\nHas Masturbation Month ever courted controversy?\n\nOne could say that the whole notion courts controversy, though there\u2019s been surprisingly little ruckus. The Masturbate-a-Thon, I suppose, has been the most controversial thing, even before the live-action version was developed. But partly that\u2019s because it\u2019s so cheeky. We didn\u2019t want to depart very far from this position of a serious message delivered with a light touch, because bringing real controversy down would also include broadcasting the message that there was something wrong with masturbation. This, of course, is the message we don\u2019t want to encourage. But drawing out the snarling anti-masturbation dogs, then pointing and laughing, is really quite tempting.\n\nActually, when an entity \u2014 a media outlet or pundit, say \u2014 finds us too controversial, one of their strategies is often just silence. Coverage of International Masturbation Month in the U.S. has been way scantier than in many other countries, and often less substantive. When we did a Masturbate-a-Thon in London in 2006, we got tons more press than we get for the events in the U.S. It\u2019s one way, I think, that this country continues to live its prudish, Puritan history.\n\nTell me about this Masturbate-a-Thon.\n\nSo there are two sorts of Masturbate-a-Thon: One is the kind Good Vibrations\u2019 brainstormers came up with in 1999, in which a participant got pledges for their involvement, masturbated \u2014 presumably privately, or maybe with a partner \u2014 and then remitted those pledges to Good Vibes so they could be passed on to nonprofits who dealt with sexual health. Good Vibes was always trying to cook up new Masturbation Month angles, and this one got lots and lots of attention; it went on for many years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In honor of Masturbation Month, Salon talks to the pioneer of self-pleasuring who coined this quirky holiday", "title": "Ready, set, masturbate!: The mastermind behind \u201cInternational Masturbation Month\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In honor of Masturbation Month, Salon talks to the pioneer of self-pleasuring who coined this quirky holiday", "title": "Ready, set, masturbate!: The mastermind behind \u201cInternational Masturbation Month\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/18/ready_set_masturbate_the_mastermind_behind_international_masturbation_month/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/clenched_hand.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In honor of Masturbation Month, Salon talks to the pioneer of self-pleasuring who coined this quirky holiday", "title": "Ready, set, masturbate!: The mastermind behind \u201cInternational Masturbation Month\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/clenched_hand.jpg", "creator": "@TracyClarkFlory", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tracy Clark-Flory", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Love and Sex, Masturbation, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4360\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s also National Pet Month, National Bike Month, National ADHD Awareness Month and, like 14 other things.\nOf all the causes vying for the public\u2019s attention this month, Masturbation Month certainly has the most pleasurable fundraising approach: masturbate-a-thons, in which people literally cum together for a cause.\nCoverage of International Masturbation Month in the U.S. has been way scantier than in many other countries, and often less substantive.\nIt\u2019s International Masturbation Month, according to, you know, some people who decided it is.\nWhy do we need to have an International Masturbation Month?"}
