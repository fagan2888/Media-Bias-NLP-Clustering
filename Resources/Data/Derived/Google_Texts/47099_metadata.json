Legislature\n\nA proposal to prohibit the scary practice of handcuffing pregnant inmates during labor has cleared its first hurdle through the Massachusetts Legislature. If passed, the so-called \u201canti-shackling bill\u201d would \u201ccreate uniform laws in county jails and the state prison system banning the shackling of pregnant women during childbirth and post-delivery recuperation \u2014 unless they present a specific safety or flight risk,\u201d according to an earlier WBUR report.\n\n\u201cThis bill has been on file for over a decade \u2014 the language has changed a bit \u2014 but it\u2019s never seen the light of day,\u201d says Megan Amundson, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts. The bill was reported out of committee on Friday, and now it will be given a new number and then most likely go to the House Ways and Means Committee, Amundson says.\n\nHere\u2019s more from the NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts news release:\n\nIn a step toward joining the 18 states that have passed legislation banning the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women, the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Safety has released the Anti-Shackling Bill, a bill the prohibits the practice of shackling pregnant women in our jails and prisons, sponsored by Senator Karen Spilka. The bill has now passed the first hurdle to passage. \u201cAs hard as this is to believe, it is not unusual for pregnant women in Massachusetts jails to be handcuffed to the hospital bed even while in labor,\u201d said Megan Amundson, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts. \u201cIt is inhumane and puts the woman\u2019s and the fetus\u2019s health at risk.\u201d A coalition of medical practitioners, human rights organization, women\u2019s groups, and faith leaders is urging the Massachusetts legislature to create uniform laws in Massachusetts county jails and the state prison that would prohibit the shackling of pregnant women during childbirth and post-delivery recuperation unless they present a specific safety or flight risk. It would also establish minimum standards for the treatment and medical care for women in jail who are pregnant to promote safe and healthy pregnancy outcomes, including adequate nutrition, prenatal care, and services for managing high-risk pregnancies. Today, the Department of Corrections and each county jail has its own policy regarding the health care for pregnant women and shackling. \u201cIt is absurd that each prison or jail in the Commonwealth has its own policies on whether, when, and how they shackle pregnant women,\u201d said Gavi Wolfe, Legislative Counsel for the ACLU of Massachusetts. \u201cThere should be one across-the-board standard: we don\u2019t do it.\u201d Marianne Bullock, Co-Founder of The Prison Birth Project, has worked in Western Massachusetts with over 100 women who have been incarcerated while pregnant. \u201cPassing this bill is crucial,\u201d she stated. \u201cEnding the practice of shackling and restraint of pregnant, laboring and postpartum women in Massachusetts will allow mothers throughout the commonwealth to give birth with dignity\u2014free of restraint.\u201d The American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists all oppose the use of shackles or restraints on incarcerated women in labor because it impedes the ability of physicians to assess, evaluate, and provide appropriate care to the mother and child. \u201cShackling pregnant women interferes with a physician\u2019s ability to treat mothers and their newborns, and it is an inhumane, unacceptable practice,\u201d said Senator Karen Spilka, sponsor of the bill. \u201cThis bill is an important and necessary step toward improving reproductive health for female prisoners and ensuring safe, healthy outcomes for women and their babies.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a national roundup of current anti-shackling proposals from around the country, posted on the blog Moms Rising.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A proposal to ban the scary practice of handcuffing pregnant inmates during labor has cleared its first hurdle through the Massachusetts state legislature.
