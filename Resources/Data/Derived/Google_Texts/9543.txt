New York City officials, including Mayor Bill DeBlasio and NYPD Chief Bill Bratton, held a press conference late last night to encourage New Yorkers to remain aware of their surroundings, but not to change their daily habits.

"We cannot be intimidated, and that's what terrorists seek to do. They seek to create fear. They seek to intimidate. We will not be intimidated, and we will not live in fear," Bratton said.

"We are aware of the newly-released ISIS video that mentions Times Square. While some of the video footage is not new, the video reaffirms the message that New York City remains a top terrorist target," the NYPD released in a statement late last night. "While there is no current or specific threat to the City at this time, we will remain at a heightened state of vigilance and will continue to work with the FBI, the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the entire intelligence community to keep the City of New York safe. In addition, we are continuing to deploy additional Critical Response Command (CRC) teams throughout the City, out of an abundance of caution."
