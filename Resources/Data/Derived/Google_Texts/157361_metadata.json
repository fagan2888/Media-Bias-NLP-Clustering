With both man-on-the-street and physician interviews, Hartle aims to clear up any preconceived suspicions about recreational marijuana, as well as hear the opinions of regular Coloradans. As a stand-up comedian, he coined the film as the \u201cworld\u2019s first historical comedy documentary.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Colorado became the first place, anywhere in the world, to make marijuana legal for anyone over the age of 21. Not even Amsterdam has pot sales that are as legal as they are in Colorado. Though the use of marijuana was technically legal earlier in the state in 2012, specially licensed stores opened up on Jan. 1, 2014. Marijuana use, possession, and sales are still illegal under federal law, however. Recently, New York became the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana, but no other state other than Colorado allows recreational marijuana. Thus, the legalization debate continues throughout the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown this film to a few test audiences so far, and what we\u2019ve found is the 20- to 40-year-old demographic who have used cannabis before absolutely love it, and the older crowd who hasn\u2019t find it less favorable,\u201d the documentary\u2019s co-writer Anthony Hashem told Deadline.\n\nWatch the trailer below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marijuana legalization, colorado", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The filmmaker behind a new weed documentary will hand out free pot to people who attend the screening.", "title": "Pot Documentary Filmmaker Lures People To Screening With Free Weed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pot-documentary-mile-high-comeback-cannabis-will-pass-out-free-marijuana-people-colorado-screening", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/free-weed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The filmmaker behind a new weed documentary will hand out free pot to people who attend the screening.", "title": "Pot Documentary Filmmaker Lures People To Screening With Free Weed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pot-documentary-mile-high-comeback-cannabis-will-pass-out-free-marijuana-people-colorado-screening", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/free-weed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/free-weed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-07-09T16:35:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T16:35:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The filmmaker behind a new weed documentary will hand out free pot to people who attend the screening."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7504\"", "article_summary": "Recently, New York became the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana, but no other state other than Colorado allows recreational marijuana.\nStand-up comedian and filmmaker of the new documentary, \"Mile High: The Comeback Of Cannabis,\" Adam Hartle, plans to hand out free weed to people who attend the screening.\nIn Colorado, a filmmaker seems to have figured out a new and fairly obvious marketing plan \u2014 handing out free weed to whoever shows up to his new documentary\u2019s screening.\nThough the use of marijuana was technically legal earlier in the state in 2012, specially licensed stores opened up on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\u201cNo purchase necessary, but we highly encourage you to stay and watch the film.\u201dThe film, \u201cMile High: The Comeback of Cannabis,\u201d documents the story behind Colorado\u2019s Amendment 64, which officially made growing, selling, and smoking weed legal in Colorado."}
