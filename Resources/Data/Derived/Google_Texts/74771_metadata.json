Alice Hyde Medical Center can now share health care services, expertise and administrative functions with other hospitals in the network.\n\n\u201cIn that way we're able to reduce costs, day to day operating costs, and actually standardize systems and processes to make sure that things are done the same way, regardless of what hospital they're being done in,\u201d said Doug DiVello, President & CEO, UVM Health Network - Alice Hyde Medical Center.\n\nThe UVM Health Network was formed in 2011, under the name Fletcher Allen Partners.\n\nThere are now five hospitals under the UVM Health Network: University of Vermont Medical Center (Burlington, Vt.), Central Vermont Medical Center (Berlin, Vt.), Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital (Plattsburgh, NY), Elizabethtown Community Hospital (Elizabeth, NY) and Alice Hyde Medical Center (Malone, NY).\n\n\u201cA patient who may have gone from Malone, two hours to Burlington, to access a specialist, under this new affiliation and this new relationship, that patient now may be able to get that care in Plattsburgh,\u201d said DiVello.\n\nThe five hospitals had a combined $1.8 billion budget in 2014, according to network executives.\n\nUniversity of Vermont Health Network President & CEO John Brumsted says the Affordable Care Act has lead to reduced funds, putting pressure on hospitals to become more efficient.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to do that is to come together and collaborate and really improve the quality of the health care services,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York Attorney General\u2019s Office investigated the legality of the affiliation and how it will affect patients.\n\n\u201cWould this reduce competition and if it would, is it necessary in order to preserve essential services for the area?\" asked Glen Michaels, Assistant Attorney General In Charge and Public Integrity Officer in the Plattsburgh office.\n\nThe AG\u2019s office, AntiTrust Bureau and Health Care Bureaus decided reduced competition was better than no hospital at all.\n\n\u201cMany small hospitals without affiliating with larger organizations, can't make it today,\u201d said Michaels. \u201cAnd what we don't want, no one wants, is for people to be left without good medical care.\"\n\nBecause the University of Vermont Medical Center is a teaching hospital, CVPH in Plattsburgh is launching a residency program next month.\n\nThe four residents will also be spending time at Alice Hyde, learning from primary physicians throughout the network.\n\nWith the addition of Alice Hyde to the network, the UVM Health Network totaled more than 1.5 million patient/physician encounters in 2015 and employees 12,000 people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alice Hyde Medical Center, in Malone, NY, has become the fifth regional hospital to join the University of Vermont Health Network.", "author": "Staci DaSilva", "og": {"site_name": "MYCHAMPLAINVALLEY", "description": "Alice Hyde Medical Center, in Malone, NY, has become the fifth regional hospital to join the University of Vermont Health Network.", "title": "Hospital Network Expansion Increases Healthcare Options in Northern NY", "url": "http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/hospital-network-expansion-increases-healthcare-options-in-northern-ny", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/mychamplainvalley/photo/2016/05/10/ailce%20hyde_1462914827829_8492345_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 836618003087056}, "google-site-verification": "17nV0ekEFulJungqcNnFlZ2Xnd68g3bP87cesaEsnB0", "keywords": "News,Local News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-05-11T00:52:02+0000", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T00:52:02+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Alice Hyde Medical Center, in Malone, NY, has become the fifth regional hospital to join the University of Vermont Health Network.\nThe affiliation means the University of Vermont Health Network -
