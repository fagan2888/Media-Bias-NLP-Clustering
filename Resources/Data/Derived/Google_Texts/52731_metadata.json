Eliot Engel (D-NY) said President Barack Obama\u2019s Iranian nuclear program deal is a \u201cmixed bag of tricks\u201d that Congress has to decide if the United States is \u201cbetter off with it or without it.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nEngel said, \u201cFirst of all, I think Congress has to play a role. This is very, very important. I think that Congress has to decide.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a sellout,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a mixed bag of tricks. I think it is all going to be sorted out. There are things I like and things I don\u2019t like about it. I like that Iran has to destroy two-thirds of centrifuges, I like the fact that it is certain inspections last 25 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that Iran has the right to enrich on its territory,\u201d Engel continued. \u201cSeems to me preliminarily it is a mixed bag of tricks. We have to sort it through. I have said on the outset no deal is better than a bad deal. We have to assume or figure out if this is more of a good deal or more of a bad deal. It is certainly a mixed bag of tricks and we\u2019re going to have to assess it in the next few months while the bill and details are being hammered out.\u201d\n\n\u201cRonald Reagan would say trust but verify, I would say don\u2019t trust and verify,\u201d he added. \u201cIran continues to be a bad actor in the region. One of the thing that disturbs me, we are talking about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, not talking about the instability Iran caused in the region being the main supporter of terrorism in the world, being supporter of Hamas, Hezbollah, helping overthrow the government in Yemen, propping up Assad in Syria, it is very disturbing. Again, there are some good things and I think we have to weigh it. Better off with it or without it?\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dem Rep Engel: Iran Deal 'Mixed Bag of Tricks'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Dem Rep Engel: Iran Deal 'Mixed Bag of Tricks'", "title": "Dem Rep Engel: Iran Deal 'Mixed Bag of Tricks' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/engel1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/03/dem-rep-engel-iran-deal-mixed-bag-of-tricks/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dem Rep Engel: Iran Deal 'Mixed Bag of Tricks'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/engel1.jpg", "title": "Dem Rep Engel: Iran Deal 'Mixed Bag of Tricks' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Iran Nuclear Deal, Rep.
