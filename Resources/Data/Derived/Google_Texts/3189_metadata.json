Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius. In both cases, for-profit corporations have challenged the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employer-based health plans cover contraception, including certain methods\u2014such as the morning-after pill\u2014that the companies\u2019 owners find objectionable on religious grounds. In both cases, the first question the Court must answer is whether for-profit corporations can have religious faith. For many people, the notion of a religious company rings false. Things get complicated, however, when you consider that thousands of U.S. corporations are, in fact, religious. They\u2019re called churches.\n\nAs nonprofit \u201creligious corporations\u201d under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, churches enjoy a variety of legal benefits. For example, churches may flout certain employment discrimination laws when hiring or firing, on the theory that religious institutions should be able to oversee their own affairs, free from governmental intrusion. Hobby Lobby is arguing that it should be entitled to similar benefits\u2014that, as a company, it shouldn\u2019t be precluded from seeking religious accommodations just because it\u2019s organized as a for-profit corporation. In the words of Hobby Lobby\u2019s Supreme Court brief, legal rights shouldn\u2019t \u201cturn on a corporation\u2019s tax status.\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby\u2019s lawyers, led by a former Solicitor General, Paul Clement, have worked hard to cast a churchlike aura around the company, even though its business has no religious dimension\u2014the stores sell craft supplies. But, unlike many other companies that might qualify down the line for the kind of religious exemptions that Hobby Lobby is requesting, Hobby Lobby actually does seem to care about love-thy-neighbor ideals. Workers get paid higher than the national minimum wage; stores are closed on Sundays, to encourage employees to spend time with their families; and company-subsidized health care is\u2014minus a few forms of contraception\u2014affordable and robust. This inspired Justice Sonia Sotomayor to quip, during Clement\u2019s portion of the argument last Tuesday, that he certainly \u201cpicked great plaintiffs.\u201d\n\nBut the question is not whether Hobby Lobby behaves well. The question is whether Hobby Lobby is equivalent to a church for the purpose of opting out of the contraception mandate.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the question depends on the difference, more generally, between for-profit and nonprofit corporations. In some legal settings, it makes a lot of sense to treat nonprofit and for-profit entities uniformly. It would be crazy, for example, to argue that for-profit corporations shouldn\u2019t be able to appeal adverse legal rulings simply because they turn a profit\u2014or, similarly, to argue that for-profit media corporations deserve less protection under the Freedom of the Press Clause than their non-profit counterparts.\n\nBut this case is different. For-profit corporations are bundles of assets with built-in liability protection (\u201climited liability\u201d) for owners. This is what allows for mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, and reorganizations; because corporate assets are transferable, and because owners cannot be held personally liable for actions taken by the company, corporate control can be bought and sold on the market, and corporate assets can easily be repurposed at the will of new owners. By contrast, no one owns the assets of a nonprofit corporation\u2014at least, not in the normal sense of the term. A nonprofit corporation cannot be bought or sold. Its assets are deployed in the service of a specific purpose (the nonprofit\u2019s mission), and their use is accountable to the public at large.\n\nThese observations may seem unrelated to the issue of religious exercise. But imagine that the Greens, the Christian owners and managers of Hobby Lobby, decide to sell Hobby Lobby to Walmart, and Walmart decides to keep the hobby chain intact as a subsidiary. Would Hobby Lobby still be a Christian corporation? Or imagine that the Greens, tired of hobby supplies, decide to exchange their interest in Hobby Lobby for that of another business; now, the Green family owns and operates the second business\u2014call it Corporation A\u2014while the previous owners of Corporation A own Hobby Lobby. Would Hobby Lobby still be a Christian corporation? Would Corporation A become a Christian corporation? In these scenarios, the difference between for-profit and nonprofit activity becomes crucial.\n\nEven if it made sense to speak of a company\u2019s religious faith, one would have to consider the faith of the human beings who comprise it. Then the question becomes: Which human beings? Whose faith matters, that of shareholders, executives, workers, or customers? These questions are not rhetorical. The Green family has been operating under the assumption that, as owners, they should be allowed to dictate Hobby Lobby\u2019s religious identity. But it\u2019s not clear why this should be the case. It would be one thing if Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners, managers, and labor force were homogeneously Christian. But they are not. The Greens bear the burden of showing why they\u2014as a small handful of comparatively wealthy and influential people in a company with thousands of employees\u2014should exercise monopoly power over the company\u2019s religious faith.\n\nConstitutionally, there\u2019s actually a strong argument against giving such power to owners or managers. The principle of religious neutrality, codified in the First Amendment, includes two complementary prohibitions. First, the Constitution prohibits laws that impede or discourage religion; second, it prohibits laws that endorse or encourage religion. The latter commitment comes under strain when laws offer religious entities an economic subsidy to the detriment of secular competitors. Worse still are laws that actually give incentives to people\u2014in this case, to corporate managers who might want to avoid insurance premiums\u2014to embrace religion falsely or opportunistically in order to avail themselves of a legal benefit.\n\nHobby Lobby\u2019s position invites exactly this problem. As the amicus brief filed by the U.S. Women\u2019s Chamber of Commerce put it:\n\nIf the corporate parties in this case prevail, there will likely be a flood of similar suits filed to obtain similar exemptions based on corporate religious beliefs. For example, a corporation adhering to the tenets of the Church of Christ, Scientist\u2014which believes that illness may only be cured by prayer and supplication to God, not medicine\u2014arguably could obtain an exemption from providing employee health coverage for anything other than religious healing, and thereby drastically cut expenses relative to its competitors.\n\nOr, in the similar but more acerbic words of another amicus brief filed by corporate and criminal law professors:\n\nIt is very easy to imagine how companies would react if this Court were to rule in favor of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. Companies suffering a competitive disadvantage will simply claim a \u201cRoad to Damascus\u201d conversion.\n\nOne can imagine the new McKinsey practice group now\u2014perhaps \u201crevelation and conversion support\u201d\u2014complete with graphics and flowcharts, outlining the steps companies can take to assure regulators of their newfound faith.\n\nKiel Brennan-Marquez is an academic fellow at the Information Society Project, an intellectual center at Yale Law School.\n\nIllustration by Tomby.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "From a legal standpoint, the Hobby Lobby question depends on the difference between for-profit and nonprofit corporations.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "From a legal standpoint, the Hobby Lobby question depends on the difference between for-profit and nonprofit corporations.", "title": "Is a Corporation Like a Church? - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 290, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hobby-lobby-290.jpg.jpeg", "height": 427}, "updated_time": "2014-07-16T15:31:03-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-a-corporation-like-a-church", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From a legal standpoint, the Hobby Lobby question depends on the difference between for-profit and nonprofit corporations.", "title": "Is a Corporation Like a Church? - The New Yorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hobby-lobby-290.jpg.jpeg", "creator": "@newyorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"1625411\",\"title_alt\":\"Is a Corporation Like a Church?\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/hobby-lobby-290.jpg-290-375.jpeg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "article": {"section": "Currency", "tag": "Currency", "published_time": "2014-04-04T18:18:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T15:31:03-04:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 1625411, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "bizpages, Business, Currency"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95ca\"", "article_summary": "The question is whether Hobby Lobby is equivalent to a church for the purpose of opting out of the contraception mandate.\nOr imagine that the Greens, tired of hobby supplies, decide to exchange their interest in Hobby Lobby for that of another business; now, the Green family owns and operates the second business\u2014call it Corporation A\u2014while the previous owners of Corporation A own Hobby Lobby.\nA nonprofit corporation cannot be bought or sold.\nWould Corporation A become a Christian corporation?\nWould Hobby Lobby still be a Christian corporation?"}
