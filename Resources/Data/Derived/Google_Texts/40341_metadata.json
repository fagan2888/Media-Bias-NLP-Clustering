But critics say the IRS should blame itself.\n\nJudy Woodruff sat down recently for this conversation with the IRS commissioner.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And we are joined by the man in charge, Commissioner John Koskinen of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nWelcome to the NewsHour.\n\nJOHN Koskinen, Commissioner, IRS: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, let me just start this interview by citing a couple of numbers we have on taxpayers\u2019 experiences with the IRS this year.\n\nWe know that, last year, 70 percent of the people who tried to get through with a question were successful. This year, that\u2019s down to fewer than 40 percent. The average wait time for taxpayers trying to get through to the IRS with questions shot up from 10 minutes last year to 24 minutes this year.\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: The short answer is that Congress cut our budget and we have fewer people available to answer the phone.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Flesh that out for us. How much of a budget cut? What does that mean and how many\u2026\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: Well, over the last five years, our budget has been cut by $1.2 billion.\n\nIn December of this year, the last $350 million of that cut was provided. We only had nine months left in the year, so we had to take difficult choices across the board. One of them was, 70 percent or more of our budget is personnel. So, had to immediately say we wouldn\u2019t hire any new personnel.\n\nWe also had to not hire for as long a period of time as many seasonal workers that we bring in during the tax season, because that\u2019s the busiest time of the year. And we didn\u2019t hire our couple thousand temporary employees we normally would hire.\n\nAnd those are all decisions we knew would have a negative impact on taxpayer services. We had warned the Congress about it, but we had no choice.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And what has it meant?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: What it\u2019s meant is, the people who care most about this are the dedicated IRS employees who are in the call centers and feel great satisfaction whenever they can help a taxpayer answer a question.\n\nAnd they\u2019re the ones most concerned that we can\u2019t provide the taxpayers the service that our employees think they have a right to.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: I want to quote the congressman who is chair of the congressional subcommittee that oversees funding for the agency, Ander \u2014 Representative Ander Crenshaw of Florida.\n\nHe said, in referring to past problems that the IRS has had, overspending on conferences, misguided, as they put it, scrutiny of organizations seeking tax-exempt status and so on, he said \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cCongress has deliberately lowered the funding for the IRS to a level to make them think twice about what they were doing and why.\u201d\n\nHave you and your colleagues been thinking twice?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: We have thought twice and more so.\n\nThe problems that have been cited oftentimes took place two to five years ago. We have solved them all. We have explained that all to the Congress in great detail. There are some efficiencies when your budget gets cut that you can obtain.\n\nBut we have done that. We save over $200 million a year now in efficiencies we have taken. As I have tried to explain, at some point, when the cuts get to be more severe, you have to basically understand you are going to do less with less. And that\u2019s where we are now.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: There\u2019s another complaint we\u2019re hearing from the other side of the Capitol, from the Senate, Senator Orrin Hatch, among other things.\n\nAs you know, he chairs the Senate Finance Committee. He\u2019s been raising questions about whether you and the agency, in his words,are wasting money by paying millions of dollars in bonuses to IRS employees, I think they said 1,100 IRS employees, who owe back taxes or who have other problems.\n\nHow do you answer?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: Well, again, when that problem was raised, we investigated it. And we have set in place policies where, if you are willfully violating your obligation to pay taxes at the IRS, not only are you subject to dismissal, but you no longer will be eligible for any performance award.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Are people today being paid bonuses if they owe back taxes?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: No.\n\nIn other words, we actually monitor everyone in the IRS. Our compliance rate is over 99 percent. The IRS has the highest compliance rate by far of any federal agency or any congressional operation. So, it\u2019s a high compliance rate, but the employees understand they have an obligation to pay their taxes. And we monitor each employee.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you about another new wrinkle this year. It has to do with the new health care reform law, kicked in tax penalties for people who don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nAnd there are issues with people trying to reconcile their premium tax credits against their income. We\u2019re hearing reports that, of the millions of people out there who are affected by this, that many of them are having real problems. They\u2019re struggling to figure out their tax issues.\n\nHow is the IRS handling this?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: Well, we spent a year trying to explain to tax preparers and taxpayers as much as we could how the act works. We have had a quarter-of-a-million hits on our Web site.\n\nWe have a special section for ACA that helps out. And from our perspective, the filing season for those people is going well. Last year, 91 percent of people used software. And we work with the software developers and the preparers to make sure that taxpayers could simply provide answers to question, they will never see the forms, as they never do anyway, and that the filing would be straightforward.\n\nAnd thus far \u2014 we monitor all the calls to see if there are questions coming in that we need to answer where the answers aren\u2019t available, and, thus far, from our perspective, things have gone well. I would estimate \u2014 or emphasize over 75 percent of people just check a box and say they have coverage.\n\nSo, for the vast majority of people filing, the ACA act has not been a problem at all.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But for those individuals who may end up not paying the taxes they owe, either because it\u2019s a penalty or for some other reason they don\u2019t get the taxes they\u2019re due, what is the IRS\u2019 position when it comes to enforcing this?\n\nAre you going to go after people? Are you going to provide some leniency because you\u2019re strapped for personnel, or what?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: Well, thus far, our experience is, although it\u2019s still \u2014 and we have a couple of days to go \u2014 our experience has been that the people who are affected in the reconciliations, give or take a little, 40 or 50 percent of them are getting an increase in refund because they underestimated the premium they were \u2014 advanced premium they were eligible for.\n\nAnd the other half that actually are now getting a smaller fund basically are getting smaller refunds. We do not see a large number or any significant number of people who actually are putting in a position of their owing taxes that they can\u2019t pay. We have made it clear \u2014 the Treasury Department issued a policy, if you can\u2019t pay, you should file, but there will be no penalties.\n\nYou will be in fact absolved of any penalty, but you still have to file.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: There is one other thing I want to ask you about.\n\nAnd that is the question that is raised by the challenges the IRS is dealing with right now in terms of personnel. And that is auditing. We know that the percentage of returns the IRS audited last year dropped to the lowest it had been in a decade, less than half \u2014 or about a half of 1 percent.\n\nIs this an invitation of people to, frankly, avoid taxes, particularly people who are wealthy, who have all sorts of complicated forms to fill out? How much are you concerned about your ability to audit as many people as you think need to be audited?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: Well, over time, I am concerned.\n\nSome people have said, when you underfund us and we have 5,000 fewer revenue agents and criminal investigators, it is really a tax cut for tax cheats. And I think everyone, as they pay their taxes, wants to feel it\u2019s a fair system and everybody is paying.\n\nSo, if they feel that some people are cheating and getting away for it, that undercuts the voluntary compliance system. On the other hand, I would note that we will do still over a million individual audits this year. And, as I have said, the roulette wheel spins, and you don\u2019t want the white ball to land on your number, because we won\u2019t be happy.\n\nIt may take us longer to find you, because we have fewer agents. But the longer it takes us, the higher your tax bill will be, because you will owe interest and penalties on what you also didn\u2019t pay. So, we think that, while we are concerned about it in the long run, we are telling taxpayers, you still have a pretty good chance of getting caught. And if you get caught consciously trying to avoid your taxes, you should expect that we are not going to be happy.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So the message is, don\u2019t relax just because you see that we\u2019re having difficulty with number of people to deal with all these returns?\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: That\u2019s right.\n\nAnd our experience is, the vast majority of Americans take their obligation seriously, are compliant, do the best they can, which is why we\u2019re concerned about taxpayer service. We want to help taxpayers as much as we can figure out how much they owe and how to pay it.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Only a couple of more days to go.\n\nJohn Koskinen, commissioner of the IRS, thank you very much.\n\nJOHN KOSKINEN: My pleasure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bad news for taxpayers this year: If you have questions for the Internal Revenue Service, getting through is going to take longer.
