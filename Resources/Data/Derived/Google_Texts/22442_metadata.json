I am Joseph Antos, the Wilson H. Taylor Scholar in Health Care and Retirement Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. The views I offer today are mine alone.\n\nMy testimony makes the following points:\n\nThe current tax exclusion provides a strong incentive for employers to offer health insurance to their employees, but it is inefficient and unfair.\n\nThe Cadillac tax discourages employers from offering high-cost health plans, but it does not correct problems with the tax exclusion.\n\nCongress should not simply repeal the Cadillac tax without offering a real reform plan.\n\nCapping the exclusion is a sensible compromise that would be both simpler and fairer than the current system, and could be accomplished without disrupting the way most people purchase health insurance.\n\nComprehensive reform of the tax treatment of health insurance would address the tax exclusion, the Cadillac tax, and the subsidies offered on the exchanges through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We should not ignore middle-class persons buying on the individual insurance market, who cannot access either exchange subsidies or subsidies through the employer market.\n\nRead the PDF.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comprehensive reform of the tax treatment of health insurance should address the health care tax exclusion, the Cadillac tax, and the subsidies offered on the exchanges through the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Comprehensive reform of the tax treatment of health insurance should address the health care tax exclusion, the Cadillac tax, and the subsidies offered on the exchanges through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Testimony: Reforming the tax treatment of health insurance - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/aei-logo.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/testimony-reforming-the-tax-treatment-of-health-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Introduction:Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Levin, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the tax treatment of health care.
