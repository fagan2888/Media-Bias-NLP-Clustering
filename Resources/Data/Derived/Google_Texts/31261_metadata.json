Go get your sunscreen. I\u2019ll wait. Bring it here and start reading the ingredients. All sunscreens are NOT created equal.\n\nA very high number of name-brand chemical sunscreens are tainted with toxic ingredients and act as endocrine disruptors, and should be swept from your shelves, right along with artificial sweeteners, antibacterial soaps and beach bags with names of cities on them. Get the reading glasses. Oxybenzone? Just say no. Retinyl palmitate? Not in your sunscreen. A blend of insect repellent and sunscreen? Bug off. Don\u2019t use sunscreen powders either. The Food and Drug Administration quietly banned them in 2012 because the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles could get into people\u2019s lungs and cause serious damage. Oops. Sunscreen sprays are harmful in a similar way, so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using, can it.\n\nAnd you know those super-high SPF sunscreens rated 50+ or more that you bought because you thought you were getting super-high extra protection from skin cancer?\n\nIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s just clever, misleading marketing. A 50+ isn\u2019t better for you than a 30 and can be much worse because it gives you a false sense of protection and results in even more exposure to damaging rays.\n\nThese are some of the sunny highlights of this year\u2019s Environmental Working Group\u2019s 2014 Sunscreen Guide, a mustread in my house, right up there with Best Beach Bars of Greece. I\u2019ve been consulting EWG\u2019s online list of best and worst sunscreens for years, and I want you to do the same (www.ewg.org).\n\nBut prepare to do a slow burn. The billion-dollar sunscreen industry has done a great job bamboozling us for years about the safety and effectiveness of their products. The FDA has been an enabler \u2014 slow to act, unwilling to provide meaningful protection \u2014 and the EWG characterizes its 2012 rewrite of a few rules as \u201cfeeble, tardy and full of gaps.\u201d Other public health advocates aren\u2019t quite so polite.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part that makes me go pale: Not only haven\u2019t rates of skin cancer gone down since people have been slathering up with chemical sunscreens, but they\u2019ve skyrocketed. For example, the number of melanoma cases \u2014 the pit viper of skin cancers \u2014 has tripled since the 1970s, when sunscreen mania began.\n\nFor a fuller explanation of what\u2019s been going on, pay attention to EWG\u2019s first Sun Safety Campaign promoting the use of physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens. Meanwhile, let\u2019s shine a little more light on some of the darker details:\n\nAvoid oxybenzone. This chemical ingredient is a synthetic estrogen. It quickly penetrates your skin, gets into your bloodstream, circulates throughout your body, and is linked to cell damage, endocrine disruption, allergic reactions and cancer. Cancer? Yep. And not just skin cancer. Breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, too. More than 40 percent of all beach and sport sunscreens on the market today have this hormone-disrupting ingredient. Keep it off your porous and precious skin.\n\nAvoid retinyl palmitate. Retinyl palmitate is another name for vitamin A. It\u2019s a very good nutrient in your sweet potatoes and spinach, but not in your sunscreen, screams the EWG. Why? Because there\u2019s growing data (including the FDA\u2019s own research) that links vitamin A to the accelerated growth of skin tumors and lesions. That\u2019s right. The sunscreen you use to prevent skin cancer is raising your risk of getting it. Talk about the scorching truth. The EWG reports that 20 percent of the sunscreens on the market list retinyl palmitate as an ingredient.\n\nThe good news. Two-thirds of the mass-marketed sunscreens the EWG analyzed don\u2019t work well and have toxic ingredients. But the good news is there are more good choices available than ever before. Zinc and titanium-based products are physical sunscreens that don\u2019t penetrate the skin, don\u2019t contaminate your endocrine system, and offer lasting ultraviolet protection. Yes, you\u2019ll look like you\u2019ve dived into a vanilla cupcake, but actually there are some newer formulas of physical sunscreen that blend in better.\n\nThe best sunscreen, many experts conclude, is a hat and a shirt. I also urge you to do regular self-exams, looking for suspicious moles or growths. If you see something, say something. And even if you don\u2019t, have a professional check out your skin at least once a year. It\u2019s a jungle out there.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda422\"", "article_summary": "Retinyl palmitate?\nThe sunscreen you use to prevent skin cancer is raising your risk of getting it.\nAvoid retinyl palmitate.\nRetinyl palmitate is another name for vitamin A.
