The study was small and is the first to make the connection between blood pressure and impaired vision, so more research will be needed for more conclusive evidence.\n\nIt was Dr. Takuhei Shoji of Saitama Medical University in Japan who decided to examine the link between eye disease and cardiovascular risk factors, as well as lifestyle habits. The study reviewed 872 men in the Japanese Self Defense Force in Kyoto, between the ages of 20 and 60; they were given two tests to see how well they could see and determine various colors. In one test, 130 failed, and 31 failed the other. The research team examined the participants\u2019 medical records, weight, cholesterol, blood sugar levels, and any eye diseases. They discovered the higher the participants' blood pressure was, the greater the chances of having impaired color vision.\n\nThe study is limited because it didn't give researchers a chance to look at vision changes or blood pressure levels across time. In addition, the link between impaired vision and high blood pressure is a correlation, not necessarily causation. But the researchers believe that \u201c[t]he data are useful and important for further investigations of many of these associations,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cFuture research is needed to popularize this idea, and perhaps come up with simpler ways of checking color vision, on modalities such as home smartphones and devices as a home screening tool,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cWe have to wait for the research to catch up.\u201d\n\nSource: Shoji T, Sato H, Chihara E, Sakurai Y. \u201cAre Middle-Age Blood Pressure Levels Related to Color Vision Impairment?
