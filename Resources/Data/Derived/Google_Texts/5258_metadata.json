(Photo: Bob Bielk/Gannett)Buy Photo\n\nNEPTUNE CITY - It\u2019s located in a strip mall, next to a cellphone repair shop. Second Chances Thrift Boutique does repair work, too, but of a different kind.\n\nIt helps repair lives.\n\nThe store is an arm of Redeem-Her, a nonprofit support organization for women who are transitioning back into mainstream life after time in prison or substance abuse rehab. Redeem-Her has a house in Toms River where women can stay as they get back on their feet.\n\n\u201cHonestly, that house saved my life,\u201d said Jen, a formerly incarcerated Brick resident who asked that her last name not be used. \u201cWhen I came out, I had nowhere to go. I had burned all my bridges. I didn\u2019t have money for an apartment. I had nothing but the clothes on my back.\u201d\n\nThe house is funded in part by the thrift store, which also offers job opportunities to the residents.\n\n\u201cI had some work experience but not much,\u201d said Redeem-Her house president Theresa Ortenzio, who is overcoming an addition to Xanax and painkillers. \u201cSo to give me an opportunity to put something other than \u2018exotic dancer\u2019 on a resume gave me a push to do other things.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, folks across America will count their blessings. But few of us know what it\u2019s like to have nothing, to survive on life\u2019s desperate edge. For Redeem-Her residents and alumni, giving thanks means much more than turkey and football.\n\nBuilding a foundation\n\nRedeem-Her was founded by Stacey Kindt, a former Brick resident who served 18 months in prison for a kidnapping that stemmed from a custody battle. It began offering transitional housing in 2007 and got a boost from Monmouth University, which opened the thrift store in 2008 to give students experience in nonprofit business.\n\nThe house accommodates eight women, who can stay as long as they need to, provided that they follow some basic rules.\n\nBuy Photo Board members of Redeem-Her, a charity that helps women coming out of prison of rehab.

(Photo: Bob Bielk/Gannett)\n\n\u201cThe biggest success that we can claim is when these women come out and have a place to live, it builds a foundation,\u201d said Prudy White, chair of Redeem-Her\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cFinally having safe and sober housing, living with other women who have been down the same path, it gives them the opportunity to rebuild their life and to see a future.\u201d\n\nOrtenzio is doing just that. The Sayreville native checked in during the summer of 2014, after an extensive rehab stint following the loss of her 2-year-old son Luca to sudden infant death syndrome. She forged a bond with her housemates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to have real friends that are women who care about me and don\u2019t want anything from me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you have addiction, it\u2019s about what you have and what you can do for people. I\u2019ve never been able to say I have true friends.\u201d\n\nThe house is self-governing, and Ortenzio was elected president. She interviews applicants, pays the bills, makes sure residents attend their recovery meetings and enforces a 30-day curfew for newcomers.\n\n\u201cI have to be accountable not only for myself but for other women,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like if I went back out (into substance abuse), I wouldn\u2019t be letting just myself down but a lot of other people.\u201d\n\nHelping others succeed\n\nMonmouth University continues to be a supportive partner for Redeem-Her. Eleanor Novek, a professor of communication, is planning several projects for her students. One is the recording and archiving of oral histories from house residents. Another is the redesign of Redeem-Her\u2019s website and the ramping up of the organization\u2019s social media presence.\n\n\u201cOur students are very career-focused, which is good, but I hope projects like this will show them that they can also use their skills to help others succeed,\u201d Novek said.\n\nThis sign at Second Chances thrift store says it all. (Photo: Jerry Carino)\n\nThe Second Chances thrift store stands as a monument to the possible.\n\nOrtenzio\u2019s work at its former branch in Toms River enabled her to land a full-time job at a local bakery. Jen\u2019s work in the Neptune City flagship led to a job as general manager of a nearby restaurant, though she still helps out at Second Chances twice a week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the store because it helps me in so many ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to give back and help other people.\u201d\n\nAfter six months in the Redeem-Her house, Jen moved home with her mom and 14-year-old son. She got her driver\u2019s license back and has a car.\n\nThere\u2019s a small sign on the wall of the thrift store. It bears a motto for Redeem-Her and a reminder for all those who take good fortune for granted.\n\n\u201cWe believe in second chances.\u201d\n\nSecond Chances accepts donated items at its location at 101 3rd Ave., Neptune. The store also seeks volunteers. Monetary donations to Redeem-Her may be sent to P.O. Box 1913, Toms River, NJ 08754.
