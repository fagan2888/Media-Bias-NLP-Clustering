And although many also pay a large portion of the cost to add dependents to the plan, it\u2019s not uncommon to see a plan that requires significant employee contributions to cover dependents.\n\nOver the years, many of our clients have purchased individual health insurance for their spouse and children specifically because their employer-sponsored plan became unaffordable when they added dependents.\n\nIn the past, individual health insurance was less expensive than it is now (not counting subsidies), but that\u2019s because the coverage was less comprehensive, and also because eligibility hinged on an applicant\u2019s medical history. So healthy families were able to purchase individual coverage for the spouse and children, while taking advantage of the employer subsidy that offset a good chunk of the employee\u2019s premium. If medical issues were present though, the options were much more limited.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, that\u2019s no longer the case, as medical history is not a factor in determining eligibility for coverage in the individual market. But the net price of individual health insurance varies considerably depending on whether an applicant qualifies for premium subsidies.\n\n\u2018Glitch\u2019 makes families ineligible for subsidies\n\nWe still get calls on a regular basis from people who are shopping for individual insurance because adding dependents to their employer plan is prohibitively expensive. We estimate that roughly 20 percent of the people who contact us are in this situation.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a \u201cglitch\u201d in the ACA, they are not eligible for premium subsidies in the exchange if the amount the employee has to pay for employee-only coverage on the group plan is deemed \u201caffordable\u201d \u2013 defined as less than 9.56 percent of household income in 2015. (This is a slight increase from 9.5 percent in 2014).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much the employee would have to pay to purchase family coverage. The family members are not eligible for exchange subsidies if the employee could get employer-sponsored coverage just for him or herself, for less than 9.56 percent of the household\u2019s income.\n\nThis issue \u2013 known as the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d \u2013 was clarified by the IRS in a final rule published in early 2013, based on the language of the ACA. There are two main sections of the law that are involved: 36B deals with subsidies, and 5000A deals with the individual mandate and penalty.\n\nIn 36B, the law states that an employer plan is affordable as long as the employee\u2019s required contribution doesn\u2019t exceed 9.5 percent of income (9.56 percent in 2015). And to clarify \u201crequired contribution\u201d we\u2019re referred to the definition in 5000A, which states that it\u2019s the amount that must be paid for self-only coverage.\n\nWhen the IRS issued their final rule, the agency noted that some commenters had suggested that the earlier proposed regulation be modified to define the employee\u2019s contribution as the total amount the employee must pay for family coverage. But ultimately the final rule was issued without changing the definition of the employee\u2019s required contribution.\n\nHealth Affairs explains that this was not an accident or oversight \u2013 it was carefully considered and the final regulation was delayed while the Government Accountability Office and the IRS analyzed the impact of the decision. There were concerns that employers would increase the contributions required to enroll family members, which would push more people off employer plans and into the exchanges, driving up the total cost of subsidies. Ultimately, those concerns prevailed and the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d was born.\n\nThe \u2018glitch\u2019 and employer-sponsored plans\n\nThe family glitch \u2013 just like the King and Halbig cases \u2013 relies on miniscule bits of text within the ACA rather than the broad scope and intent of the law. The overarching goal of the ACA was to expand access to health insurance, and to make it affordable. Yet the ruling on what constitutes \u201caffordable\u201d employer-sponsored coverage does nothing to make health insurance affordable or accessible for low- and moderate-income families whose employers don\u2019t subsidize a significant portion of dependents\u2019 coverage.\n\nUnder the ACA, employer plans with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees are required to offer coverage to their employees and to their employees\u2019 children, but not to spouses \u2013 although it\u2019s still relatively rare for companies to exclude spouses. If an employer plan doesn\u2019t cover spouses at all, the spouse is eligible to get subsidies in the exchange based on income. (There\u2019s no \u201cglitch\u201d if the employer coverage isn\u2019t offered).\n\nAnd if large employers don\u2019t make the coverage affordable for the employee (self-only coverage) and the employee then obtains a subsidy in the exchange, the employer is subject to a penalty. So there is an incentive for employers to make sure that they are subsidizing a good chunk of the employee\u2019s premium.\n\nBut while large employers are required to offer health coverage to employees\u2019 children (and most also do so for spouses), there is no requirement that the employer pay for that coverage, because the cost of the dependents\u2019 coverage is not factored into the \u201caffordable\u201d calculation. Many companies go above and beyond, subsidizing a large portion of dependents\u2019 health insurance premiums. But not all of them do.\n\nAffected families are disproportionately lower-income\n\nSomewhere between two million and four million people are impacted by the family glitch. They are disproportionately lower-income, because lower-wage workers have to spend a larger percentage of their income to pay for health insurance if subsidies aren\u2019t available, and because higher-income workers are more likely to work for companies that heavily subsidize coverage for dependents.\n\nFortunately for many of the families caught by the glitch, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides coverage for children with household incomes well over 200 percent of poverty in most states. But Congress still needs to reauthorize funding for CHIP, as it\u2019s currently only funded through the fall of 2015.\n\nMost of the ACA\u2019s regulations apply to individual and small group plans, because for the most part, large group plans were already offering solid coverage prior to 2014. Not all large groups were offering coverage though \u2013 particularly those with low-wage workers \u2013 and now they\u2019re required to do so. And because of a loophole in the ACA, some of them are offering skimpy bare-bones plans that do not provide adequate coverage.\n\nThe IRS has proposed regulations that would prohibit such plans from being considered acceptable under the minimum value standards, which means that large employers would no longer be able to offer them and avoid a penalty. The regulation is likely to be finalized in 2015, but the IRS has clarified that in the meantime, people who are offered such plans through their employers are eligible to receive premium subsidies in the exchange instead. So for those employees and their families, the ACA is working: they are not stuck with a subpar plan simply because it\u2019s available to them.\n\nBut for families that have the option to enroll in an employer plan \u2013 large or small \u2013 that does provide minimum value, the choice can sometimes come down to a rock or a hard place, with no way to purchase coverage that fits within the ACA\u2019s definition of \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s small consolation, but people caught in the family glitch are not subject to the ACA\u2019s individual mandate penalty if the only plans available to them cost more than 8 percent of their income. For most people though, having realistic access to health insurance would be far preferable to simply avoiding the penalty while remaining uninsured.\n\nIn 2014, Senator Al Franken introduced the Family Coverage Act, which would adjust the law so that the affordability test is applied to the entire premium that a worker must pay for family coverage, not just employee-only coverage. This would cost the government more in subsidies, but it would dramatically improve access to health insurance for the people who are currently without any reasonably priced options because of the family glitch. The bill was referred to a Senate committee in June, but will hopefully be reconsidered during the 2015 legislative session.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Somewhere between two million and four million people are impacted by the family glitch.
