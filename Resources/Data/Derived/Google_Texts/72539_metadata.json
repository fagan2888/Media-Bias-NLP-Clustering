He spent the first minutes jabbing the media, discussing polls and his unlikely rise in politics and as a contender for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting what\u2019s happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are. We are,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTrump continued on his speech by first attacking the current politicians who are running the country. Minutes later, he quickly shifted gears to his most controversial topic\u2026 the Mexican border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive problem. We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTrump received a standing ovation as he made it clear that he wants to build a wall along the border. The billionaire also targeted women voters on Monday. Two well-known conservative, female figures spoke just before Trump took the stage.\n\n\u201cI have such respect for women. I cherish women. I\u2019m going to take such good care of women\u2019s healthcare issues you won\u2019t even believe it. But I\u2019m surging with women,\u201d said Trump.\n\nAmong other issues, Trump also promised to lower taxes and to take on the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cObamacare. We\u2019re going to repel it, we\u2019re going to replace it, get something great. Repeal it, replace it, get something great!\u201d yelled Trump.\n\nSupporters feel Trump\u2019s strong word will stack up well against his opponents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think the rest of them are shaking in their boots and they ought to be,\u201d said William Baldwin, who drove from Gainesville to hear Trump speak.\n\nTrump will soon head to Los Angeles and prepare for Wednesday\u2019s debate.\n\n(\u00a92015 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
