Monnin stepped down from his MEP executive role in 2010 and briefly worked for Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen Gov. John Kasich, Senator John McCain and Congressman Pat Tiberi were in my office, they said my company was amazing and doing great things for this nation and for this state,\u201d Monnin said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cBut ever since I started questioning the establishment, I\u2019m a war profiteer and a hypocrite.\u201d\n\n\u201cBush was president when I started the company, not Obama,\u201d Monnin said, adding, \u201cI wrote the business plan while recovering from a back injury after a military parachute jump and I brought hundreds of jobs and millions of tax dollars to this state.\u201d\n\nMonnin noted Republican Kasich\u2019s support for Common Core and Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 both programs championed by Obama and touted by ORP as sources of federal funding for the state. Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion has cost federal taxpayers roughly $1.7 billion since Jan. 1.\n\nWhile ORP attacks Monnin as someone who \u201cdeals with Obama,\u201d the governor travels Ohio stumping on a message of increased entitlement spending. During an Oct. 28 speech in Columbus, Kasich implored Republicans to renew the Obamacare expansion, work together with Democrats and \u201crespect the office of the president.\u201d\n\nORP is led by Kasich loyalists and Monnin is running against incumbent Republican Anne Gonzales, an ally of the governor. ORP spent $47,603 on mailers for Gonzales during the most recent campaign finance reporting period.\n\n\u201cIf Rep. Gonzales had ANY courage, I would have gladly discussed this during a debate (as they are valid criticisms and I was up to the task) but she refused to show up,\u201d Monnin told Ohio Watchdog. \u201cWhy? Because she is a check-cashing puppet for the establishment and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\nGonzales has missed local debate opportunities, including a Gahanna Freedom Alliance meeting organizers claim they attempted to fit around her schedule. Gonzales declined comment to Ohio Watchdog because she had not seen the ORP mailer.\n\nAided by an obtuse legacy press, ORP and Kasich defend the federally funded Obamacare Medicaid expansion while campaigning against Obamacare and unsustainable federal spending. This spring, ORP mailers promoted Kasich-aligned candidates for the party\u2019s state central committee as strong Obamacare opponents.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans not on board with the party\u2019s self-contradictory messaging have been subjected to withering ORP attacks.\n\nTom Brinkman, a former Ohio House member and founder of Cincinnati-based Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes, was slammed as an Obama ally in ORP primary mailers because he ran on a platform of opposition to Common Core and Medicaid expansion.\n\nBrinkman toppled incumbent Peter Stautberg in May and is expected to win Tuesday\u2019s general election in the 27th Ohio House District.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Republican Party mailers are painting Chad Monnin as an Obama-funded candidate because of his company's defense contracts with the federal government.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio Republican Party mailers are painting Chad Monnin as an Obama-funded candidate because of his company's defense contracts with the federal government.", "title": "Ohio House candidate attacked over defense contracts - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/ohio-gop-monnin-mailer-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-12T15:09:21+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/180828/ohio-house-candidate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio Republican Party mailers are painting Chad Monnin as an Obama-funded candidate because of his company's defense contracts with the federal government.", "title": "Ohio House candidate attacked over defense contracts - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/ohio-gop-monnin-mailer-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Politics & Elections 1", "published_time": "2014-11-03T11:47:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-12T15:09:21+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Chad Monnin, Ohio Republican Party, Ohio GOP, Anne Gonzales, Ohio House District 19, John Kasich, Obamacare, Tom Brinkman, Ohio House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca0a\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogOhio Republican Party mailers are painting Chad Monnin, a Libertarian running in Ohio House District 19, as an Obama-funded candidate because of his company\u2019s defense contracts with the federal government.\nBrinkman toppled incumbent Peter Stautberg in May and is expected to win Tuesday\u2019s general election in the 27th Ohio House District.\nThis spring, ORP mailers promoted Kasich-aligned candidates for the party\u2019s state central committee as strong Obamacare opponents.\nWhile ORP attacks Monnin as someone who \u201cdeals with Obama,\u201d the governor travels Ohio stumping on a message of increased entitlement spending.\nAided by an obtuse legacy press, ORP and Kasich defend the federally funded Obamacare Medicaid expansion while campaigning against Obamacare and unsustainable federal spending."}
