Zachary Sheely/Kansas National Guard\n\nFour Black Hawk helicopters arrived in Medicine Lodge late Saturday morning to survey damage and dump water on the flames that continue to devastate Barber County.\n\n\"Where the ground crews have to spray, it takes a long time to get water on it. We can do water in either a long area, or 600 gallons in a small area and it delouses an area and puts the fire out quickly,\" said Chief Warrant Officer Steve Hood of the Kansas National Gaurd.\n\nThere are 15 crew members working to put out the flames. The helicopters are fueling at the Medicine Lodge Airport and taking water from a small lake on the north end of the town.\n\nCrews are expected to spend the night as their assistance is wanted for Sunday.\n\n\"This is really rough country, and it is hard to get water sources to a lot of these places,\" said Shawna Hartmen of the Incident Management Team.\n\nThe fire has not spread out of its perimeter. Crews are working on extinguishing hot spots and flames.\n\nThe Barber County Attorney is asking for land owners to work with the National Guard as they fly over peoples ground an put out fires.
