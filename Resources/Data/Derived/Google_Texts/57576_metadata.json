After the 24-hour mark, you kind of get over the pain of hunger. We get distracted, kind of, with the people that are visiting. We\u2019re trying to stay dry. It was raining last night,\u201d Edwin Lindo told ThinkProgress by phone Friday morning. \u201cI\u2019m hanging in there.\u201d\n\nLindo is one of six hunger strikers currently sitting in front of the Mission Police Station in San Francisco, alongside local rapper Equipto, preschool teacher Maria Cristina Gutierrez, local resident Ike Pinkston, and two others. Lindo, who is also running for District 9 supervisor, is one of the four people who initiated the action on Wednesday in protest of Police Chief Greg Suhr, the embattled leader of the San Francisco Police Department.\n\nUnder Suhr\u2019s leadership there\u2019s been a spate of fatal police shootings of residents of color, including Mario Woods, Alex Nieto, and Amilcar Perez-Lopez. Last year, racist and homophobic text exchanges between officers were made public, and similar messages were revealed earlier this month.\n\nActivists believe Suhr has failed to discipline the officers and allowed police violence to remain the status quo. In addition to Suhr\u2019s resignation, they want the community to have a hand in vetting prospective officers and holding cops accountable. Lindo, Gutierrez, Pinkson, and Equipto wanted to take drastic action, seeing no other way to get the city leadership\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHundreds of people throughout the night [were coming] back and forth, dropping off blankets, water, tea, sleeping bags, chairs,\u201d Lindo said of the strike thus far, police sirens blaring behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge community outpouring of people just coming [and] sitting with us. We had 20 people staying until 2 in the morning with us.\u201d\n\nEver since Woods\u2019 shooting, black and brown San Franciscans have joined forces in an unprecedented way to fight police brutality in their neighborhoods, namely the Mission and Bay View. In recent months, residents have rallied outside of City Hall, circulated petitions, issued demands for justice, and worked to build a strong coalition of invested community members to bolster the movement.\n\nThe strikers wanted to ramp up those efforts.\n\n\u201cI knew that something radical needed to be done,\u201d Gutierrez told Mission Local. \u201cWe march, we go to meetings, they don\u2019t care. They keep on going like nothing.\u201d\n\nAlthough police brutality in San Francisco is a systemic issue involving countless perpetrators, the group is targeting Suhr specifically for routinely failing to hold his officers accountable.\n\nFollowing Woods\u2019 shooting and early calls for Suhr to resign, the chief and Mayor Ed Lee announced police reforms in February. As in other parts of the country, policy changes include de-escalation, firearms and implicit bias training, as well as the creation of an oversight body called the Bureau of Professional Standards and Principled Policing. Every patrol car will be stocked with batons and helmets.\n\n\u201cThis comprehensive package of police reforms will help our sworn officers strengthen their ties with the community and keep our city safe through a cultural change in how we handle conflicts on our streets,\u201d the mayor said at a news conference.\n\nBased on Lee and Suhr\u2019s response to the strike, Lindo thinks that\u2019s an empty promise.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t responded to us at all. The mayor hasn\u2019t stopped by,\u201d he said. Members of the press informed the strikers that everyone in the leaders\u2019 offices is aware of what\u2019s going on. When KTLX asked Lee to comment, he responded that the strikers could send him an email or letter about their grievances.\n\n\u201cThe dismissive attitude, the belief, in his eyes, that this is somehow not serious and not real shows, very blatantly, how he views and feels about this situation,\u201d Lindo said. \u201cWe literally have folks that are tired or fatigued. Someone almost passed out as they were walking. This is serious.\u201d\n\nMission residents, on the other hand, have flocked to the police station to lend their support out of necessity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a point where people are fed up, having seen what\u2019s happening around the country, having seen what\u2019s happening locally,\u201d Lindo said. \u201cWhat the community is saying is we\u2019re not gonna take it anymore. We can\u2019t allow another killing, because it\u2019s already been four in the past year and a half and they\u2019ve all been people of color.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Bernal Heights, a section of the Mission, Lindo noted that his personal fear of the police extends all the way back to his teenage years. When he was 17 years old, he was with a group of six other friends \u2014 all boys of color \u2014 who were targeted by police for simply standing in front of a bank.\n\n\u201cThey swing the doors open, come out, and tell us to sit on the curb and that we have to show them our ID, tell them why we\u2019re there, where we plan to go, and what we were doing,\u201d he said. \u201c[The officer] said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re lucky because I could charge you with loitering as a gang and it would become a federal offense, because you\u2019re doing it in front of a bank.\u2019 This has been the culture and the nature of SFPD through my entire experience. They will find things, or they\u2019ll make it up.\u201d\n\nSimilar encounters occur all the time, and the community is mobilizing to stop them from worse incidents in the future. And minorities in the city, particularly black and Latino residents, are making sure to find common ground in their fight. When Woods, a black man, was killed, activists with the Justice for Alex Nieto Coalition banded with the Woods supporters \u2014 and momentum has picked up since.\n\n\u201cThe African American population has been choked out of this city. It\u2019s less than 3 percent of the population. Just in the past 10 years we\u2019ve lost 10,000 Latinos from the Mission alone,\u201d Lindo said, pointing to additional struggles the two groups groups share besides police brutality: unemployment, poor education, and gentrification in their neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cHistorically I believe the police, the schools, [and] the systems of government have purposefully disenfranchised these communities and relegate them to different corners of any metropolitan city\u2026 In San Francisco we\u2019ve realized our unity is where our strength in organizing and the change is going to come from. We have to be honest with ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe strikers are willing to forgo food to inspire change in the city. And Lindo anticipates that the group of strikers will grow, because college and graduate students nearby pledged to join the strike.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to stand together. We need to link arms,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a coalition that says we can\u2019t divide among ourselves. We hope to set an example for the rest of the country, because our struggles are synonymous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"We hope to set an example for the rest of the country, because our struggles are synonymous.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"We hope to set an example for the rest of the country, because our struggles are synonymous.\"", "title": "Fed Up With Officer Violence, San Francisco Residents Go On Hunger Strike Against Police Chief", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/04/23/3772092/san-francisco-hunger-strike/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/22145413/AP_16104823371586-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We hope to set an example for the rest of the country, because our struggles are synonymous.\"", "title": "Fed Up With Officer Violence, San Francisco Residents Go On Hunger Strike Against Police Chief", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/22145413/AP_16104823371586-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/22145413/AP_16104823371586-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/22145413/AP_16104823371586-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-23T09:42:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Fed Up With Officer Violence, San Francisco Residents Go On Hunger Strike Against Police Chief CREDIT: AP Photo/Eric Risberg People yell for the firing of San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr during a town hall meeting to provide the Mission District neighborhood with an update on the investigation of an officer involved shooting Wednesday.\nThey keep on going like nothing.\u201dAlthough police brutality in San Francisco is a systemic issue involving countless perpetrators, the group is targeting Suhr specifically for routinely failing to hold his officers accountable.\nAnd Lindo anticipates that the group of strikers will grow, because college and graduate students nearby pledged to join the strike.\nUnder Suhr\u2019s leadership there\u2019s been a spate of fatal police shootings of residents of color, including Mario Woods, Alex Nieto, and Amilcar Perez-Lopez.\nAnd minorities in the city, particularly black and Latino residents, are making sure to find common ground in their fight."}
