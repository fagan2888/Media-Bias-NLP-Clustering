All in all profiles were found in 43,000 ZIP codes. But the upstanding residents of three small towns shunned the controversial website. These areas, perhaps unsurprisingly, are sparsely populated and have little access to the Internet.\n\nAn investigation by Gawker found that Nikolai, Alaska: 99691, with a population of 94, according to the 2010 census, had no users. Just over 42 percent of Nikolai\u2019s residents over the age of 15 are married, 12 percent are separated and 4.3 percent are divorced.

There\u2019s quite a few couples, there\u2019s a lot of single guys but then there\u2019s a lot of couples too, though. More males than anything.\u201d\n\nAlaska managed to rack up a second ZIP code devoid of Ashley Madison\u2019s temptation with the town of Perryville, Alaska: 99648 with a population of only 113. One of the main reasons Perryville may have stayed clear of the adultery site, according to one of Gawker\u2019s interviewees, is that just 10 households in the whole town have Internet access.\n\nMoving away from The Last Frontier, the only other ZIP code in the country found to not have any Ashley Madison accounts was Polvadera N.M.: 87828. The New Mexico town has a somewhat larger population than its Alaskan counterparts at 269. A picture of secluded rural life, courthouse employee Betty told Gawker:\n\nIt\u2019s a nice, quiet town. There\u2019s not even a grocery store or anything there. You have to go to Mesilla Park which is a few miles out, there\u2019s a gas station and a convenience store and that\u2019s about it, til you get to Soccoro. There\u2019s no library or anything there, no schools.\n\nSo for now at least, the residents of these three small towns don\u2019t have to worry about swarms of journalists checking their details to find prominent local figures engaged in the murky world of Internet-based cheating.
