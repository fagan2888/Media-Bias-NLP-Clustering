But back in the homeland Correa continues to bash the U.S. comparing \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d to \u201cNazi\u2019s rhetoric before and during World War II.\u201d\n\nWhile Correa\u2019s rhetoric may be confrontational, Ecuador\u2019s cash continues to pour into a variety of PR and lobbying firms in the U.S., in some cases in a very irregular manner.\n\nRecently, Bloomberg Businessweek journalist Paul Barret published a breaking story identifying a Brooklyn-based boutique public relations firm, MCSquared PR., Inc. as the architect of a staged protest against oil conglomerate Chevron, who is in a long-running litigation battle with the Ecuadorean government. According to Barret, MCSquared paid protestors to wave signs and shout slogans during one of Chevron\u2019s shareholders meetings in Midland, Texas this past May.\n\nThe digital newsource Washington Free Beacon discovered that while MCSquared was busy finding ways to wreak havoc on Chevron, it forgot one minor detail\u2014it did not register with the Department of Justice as required by U.S. Law when acting as an agent of a foreign government on U.S. soil. After this news broke, MCSquared scrambled to remedy this error and revealed it had received approximately half a million a month, for a hefty sum of close to $6.5 million in less than one year from the Ecuadorean government.\n\nMCSquared is certainly not the first firm Ecuador has hired to improve its image within the U.S. According to official records within the Department of Justice, Ecuador has spent an estimated $10.5 million in the last five years, through a total of ten PR and lobbying firms with heavy clout inside the beltway. Top firms such as Patton Boggs LLP and Brown Lloyd James Worldwide, among others; have been helping rebrand the Republic of Ecuador, arranging over 685 exchanges with the U.S. government and other important actors from Washington to New York to Miami.\n\nUnlike these other contracts, the MCSquared deal provokes more suspicion. Especially after the Ecuadorean Ambassador in Washington, Nathalie Cely Su\u00e1rez, recently absolved herself and the embassy of any responsibility over the contract, even though her signature is on the dotted line. Cely instead quickly passed the buck to Ecuador\u2019s Secretariat of Communications, whose president Fernando Alvarado Espinel deflected any inquiry by saying \u201cI don\u2019t respond to corrupt reporters.\u201d\n\nThis flippant reaction from the Ecuadorean government towards any questioning of the MCSquared contract only serves to further fan speculation that there may be more to this deal than we know about.\n\nIn examining the contract, we find that MCSquared is receiving approximately $150 thousand dollars a month to conduct various studies, $90 thousand a month on public opinion polls, and a whopping $100k a month to develop a website.\n\nMore interesting, however, is not only what is in the contract, but who signed them. On behalf of MCSquared, it is Ecuador-born Mar\u00eda del Carmen Garay, who leads a team of Ecuadoreans in the U.S. with strong ties to the homeland. For instance, one MCSquared employee is Cynthia Zapata Solis who previously worked for Ecuador\u2019s Ministry of the Environment as recently as 2008.\n\nThis inordinate amount of money being spent on typical PR services, coupled by the fact that MCSquared is run by several Ecuadoreans in the U.S. with strong ties to Correa\u2019s regime\u2014is a cause for concern. Not only because Rafael Correa is just as anti-US and authoritarian as the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, but also because Ecuador has become a haven for money-laundering and organized crime.\n\nThe recent rise of express kidnapping and drug trafficking in Ecuador has prompted some U.S. officials to name Ecuador as the \u201cUnited Nations\u201d of organized crime, and the Paris-based, intergovernmental organization\u2014the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has included Ecuador in its latest list of global money laundering.\n\nThis leads to the question\u2014where is all this money going? Is $100k a month really for just a website? If so, that may be one of the most expensive sites since healthcare.gov. But if not, than whom else is getting a slice of the pie?\n\nIf attention is what Ecuador seeks, perhaps U.S. authorities should grant them their wish and look further into what kind of favors Correa\u2019s cash can curry in the United States and to what end?\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Ger is a political analyst and director of the Center for Investigative Journalism in the Americas (CIJA) based in Washington, DC.
