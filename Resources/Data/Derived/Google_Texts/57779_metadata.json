As supporters of both Muriel Bowser and Mayor Vincent Gray traded chants \u2014 \"A Fresh Start!\" from Bowser's camp, \"Four More Years!\" from Gray's \u2014 both candidates appeared to press the flesh and rally the troops, though minutes apart.\n\nBowser appeared shortly after the polls opened at 7 a.m. to cast her ballot. After departing, Gray arrived, spending time with volunteers. Both sounded confident in their chances.\n\n\"We're pretty confident that the residents want a fresh start in the mayor's office and will come out and vote,\" said Bowser. \"Of course I expect to win,\" said Gray.\n\nThe visit to Precinct 65 was strategic: Ward 4 is rich in voters and regularly sees high turnout. While Bowser has won the precinct in her three ward races, in 2010 Gray defeated then-mayor Adrian Fenty in the precinct and in the ward at large, assuring his victory.\n\nAnd while both candidates pledged to visit polling places in all wards during the day, their official schedules showed where they're focusing their efforts. Bowser is spending most of the afternoon in wards 3 and 4, while Gray will stay east of the Anacostia River, with visibility events at the Anacostia and Benning Road Metro stations during the afternoon rush.\n\n\"We're focused on all eight wards, but obviously we have a higher concentration of supporters in certain wards and certain precincts,\" said Stephen Glaude, the political director for Gray's campaign.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Bowser and Gray are in a statistical dead heat, so voter turnout will be key. More wavering voters say they're willing to side with Bowser, but Gray has a stronger base.\n\nPolls remain open until 8 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Austermuhle", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "It's been months of campaigning and canvassing, and this morning the two front-running mayoral candidates narrowly missed each other at a polling place in one of the city's most contested wards.\r\n\r\nPr", "title": "Primary Scenes: Gray And Bowser Just Miss Each Other In Ward 4", "url": "http://wamu.org/news/14/04/01/primary_scenes_gray_and_bowser_just_miss_each_other_in_ward_4", "image": "http://wamu.org/sites/wamu.org/files/styles/medium/public/images/attach/graybowser.jpg?itok=5oYTLi8x", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "nid": 121538, "google-site-verification": "8AyE7rFVyUE7ZiqFGJ29mxnUk_L6YMXe4KHsLRUvvmQ"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2098\"", "article_summary": "More wavering voters say they're willing to side with Bowser, but Gray has a stronger base.\nWhile Bowser has won the precinct in her three ward races, in 2010 Gray defeated then-mayor Adrian Fenty in the precinct and in the ward at large, assuring his victory.\nAccording to recent polls, Bowser and Gray are in a statistical dead heat, so voter turnout will be key.\nAs supporters of both Muriel Bowser and Mayor Vincent Gray traded chants \u2014 \"A Fresh Start!\"\nThe visit to Precinct 65 was strategic: Ward 4 is rich in voters and regularly sees high turnout."}
