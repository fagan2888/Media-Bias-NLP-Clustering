They include a recycled water project at the Central Park residential development at Chippendale and a recycling scheme at Rosehill that supplies industrial and commercial sites in Western Sydney.\n\nPrivate operators must source \u201csufficient\u201d water through alternative measures such as recycling or stormwater harvesting, rather than buying all water more cheaply from Sydney Water or other public utilities, which could put pressure on supplies.\n\nBut Water Minister Kevin Humphries plans to repeal that rule in the Water Industry Competition Act. He says private operators incur unfair costs that create \u201can unlevel playing field\u201d and dampen competition.\n\nThe change comes as IPART, which is reviewing Sydney Water\u2019s operating licence, says obligations on water usage and efficiency should be scrapped. An issues paper says the targets may be \u201carbitrarily set\u201d and it can encourage Sydney Water to implement water conservation programs \u201cthat are not necessary or uneconomic\u201d.\n\nTotal Environment Centre director Jeff Angel said removing Sydney Water\u2019s conservation targets, while allowing it to sell more water to private operators and boost profits, was a bid to \u201cincrease its attractiveness to potential buyers\u201d.\n\nHe said the water conservation target had been \u201ca critical driver of investment\u201d in managing water demand and \"there is nothing more economically important than having sufficient supplies of water to last out a drought\".\n\nLabor\u2019s water spokesman Peter Primrose said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d that the government was seeking to undermine the development of alternative water sources.\n\nHe said Labor was still examining the bill, but it was clear \u201cprivatisation must be on [the government\u2019s] mind\u201d.\n\nInfrastructure Australia, which advises the federal government, identified Sydney Water as ripe for sale in 2012 to plug an infrastructure funding gap. It also singled out the entire NSW electricity transmission and distribution sector, the partial sale of which the Baird government will take to the election next March.\n\nMr Humphries said the government had \u201cno plans to privatise Sydney Water\u201d. He said water competition laws, drawn up in 2006, came during a major drought, and the new laws would promote competition and \u201ccontinue to protect water-saving measures and to reduce demand on drinking water supplies\u201d. However, he did not detail how this would occur.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "State Politics", "title": "Sydney Water efficiency targets to be scrapped", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-water-efficiency-targets-to-be-scrapped-20140713-zt5w7.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "title": "Sydney Water efficiency targets to be scrapped", "description": "State Politics", "card": "summary", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "State Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7a5a\"", "article_summary": "Water conservation mandates are being abolished and there are warnings Sydney Water is being fattened for sale as the Baird government overhauls water competition laws.\nThe government has introduced a bill that relieves private water companies of their obligation to develop alternative sources of water, such as water recycling.\nAn issues paper says the targets may be \u201carbitrarily set\u201d and it can encourage Sydney Water to implement water conservation programs \u201cthat are not necessary or uneconomic\u201d.\nThe change comes as IPART, which is reviewing Sydney Water\u2019s operating licence, says obligations on water usage and efficiency should be scrapped.\nAt the same time, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has recommended that Sydney Water\u2019s usage and efficiency targets be scrapped, saying they may lead to unnecessary and costly water-saving programs."}
