With GDP growth slowing, prospects for jobless Americans are worsening.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent, but only because so many working age Americans quit looking for work and are no longer counted in the official jobless tally. If the same percentage of adults were in the labor force today as when Presidents Obama took office, the jobless rate would be about 9.9 percent\n\nThe Administration alibis Baby Boom retirements are driving down adult participation. However, nearly one in six men between ages 25 and 54\u2014too old for college and too young to retire\u2014are jobless. Many are simply sitting at home watching ESPN, playing video games and relying on relatives, friends and government benefits for support.\n\nThe Obama recovery has managed only 2.3 percent GDP annual growth, and the economy has added only 6.4 million new jobs on his watch. Whereas during the Reagan recovery, the pace of economic growth was 4.8 percent, and 9.5 million jobs were added through the end of his sixth year.\n\nAmerica has not lost its capacity to innovate and create new products and industries but in a globalized economy, poor government policies block Americans from playing their strengths.\n\nThe nation still enjoys strong comparative advantages in manufacturing, but President Obama refuses to confront China, Japan and Germany about exchange rate and monetary policies that purposefully undervalue their currencies and artificially underprice their exports. And now it seems the president is intent on jamming through congress new free trade agreements that would further open U.S. markets to foreign competition, while countenancing continued currency manipulation and mercantilism abroad.\n\nRestrictions on offshore drilling and onshore pipeline construction continue unnecessary U.S. dependence on foreign oil, divert billions of consumer dollars abroad and rob Americans of millions of jobs.\n\nThe cost of hiring workers is greatly increased by Obamacare health insurance mandates, minimum wages above the federal standard in 29 states and needlessly cumbersome business regulations. Along with threats of government-inspired litigation, those accelerate automation.\n\nAmazon recently purchased Kiva Systems, which makes robots that will permit it to eliminate thousands of jobs at its fulfillment warehouses. Those systems are already at Crate and Barrel and Gap.\n\nAdministration polices have encouraged monopolization in key industries that are major contributors to the Democratic machine\u2014greatly slowing growth and jobs creation.\n\nDodd-Frank lending regulations have proven too costly for smaller banks, and many have sold out to larger banks. Deposits are even more concentrated among \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d Wall Street banks, who often are not much interested in lending to Main Street businesses and homebuyers.\n\nCable companies enjoy considerable freedom to raise internet and TV rates, and have taken the profits to acquire media companies and other businesses instead of enhancing service. For example, Comcast, whose CEO often hosts Obama fundraisers, has used monopoly profits from high cable rates to purchase NBC, where it underwrites political activists like Al Sharpton, instead of investing in systems that could raise internet speeds and support more web-based businesses.\n\nMajor airlines, which are well represented in Washington, have consolidated to individually lock up many inter-city routes. Instead of passing along lower fuel prices by trimming ticket prices and adding flights, airline shareholders and employees are feasting on windfall gains.\n\nAmerican Airlines is urging its pilots to accept a union contract that raises pay more than 20 percent\u2014more than arbitrators awarded.\n\nObama\u2019s lax immigration enforcement and amnesty are increasing competition for jobs. A study by the Center for Immigration Studies, released last June, found foreign born workers are taking the lion share of new jobs, especially those going to prime working age adults between the ages of 16 and 65.\n\nThose forces combine to push down wages.\n\nAverage family income, adjusted for inflation, has fallen from about $57,000 in 2000 to $52,000.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, national columnist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With GDP growth slowing, prospects for jobless Americans are worsening.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With GDP growth slowing, prospects for jobless Americans are worsening.", "title": "PETER MORICI: Anti-growth policies slow jobs creation", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/9/peter-morici-anti-growth-policies-slow-jobs-creati/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/25/unemployment-benefitsjpeg-0aa19.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/25/unemployment-benefitsjpeg-0aa19.jpg", "description": "With GDP growth slowing, prospects for jobless Americans are worsening.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "PETER MORICI: Anti-growth policies slow jobs creation"}, "Author": "Peter Morici", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Business Finance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd891c\"", "article_summary": "Administration polices have encouraged monopolization in key industries that are major contributors to the Democratic machine\u2014greatly slowing growth and jobs creation.\nWith GDP growth slowing, prospects for jobless Americans are worsening.\nThe Obama recovery has managed only 2.3 percent GDP annual growth, and the economy has added only 6.4 million new jobs on his watch.\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, national columnist.\nAmazon recently purchased Kiva Systems, which makes robots that will permit it to eliminate thousands of jobs at its fulfillment warehouses."}
