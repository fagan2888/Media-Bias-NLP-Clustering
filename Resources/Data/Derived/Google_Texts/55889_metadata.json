The attack increases the number killed in the past week to 10.\n\nNkurunziza's controversial third term has set off rounds of political violence in which more than 400 people have died.\n\nBurundi has experienced violent street protests, which boiled over into a failed coup in May and now a rebellion, since the ruling party announced Nkurunziza's candidature for a third term in office in April last year. Nkurunziza won elections in July, which observers said was flawed.\n\nThe international community is concerned that Burundi, which has a long history of coup attempts and civil war, could be sliding into a full blown conflict.\n\nFormer U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Sunday, that the situation in Burundi is \"very delicate.\" Annan blamed Nkurunziza for the crisis and not cooperating with the international community to resolve the conflict.\n\n\"So far, he (Nkurunziza) hasn't shown any indication that he wants a genuine dialogue with the opposition and the international community to find a solution,\" Annan said from the northern Ethiopian city of Bahir Dar, where he was attending a regional security conference.\n\nEarlier this month the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, Democracy and Labor Tom Malinowski described the situation in Burundi as extremely grave after visiting the country.\n\n\"We do not want to see a repeat of catastrophes that have befallen this country in the past and other countries in this region,\" he said.\n\nThere is no question that human rights abuses are continuing, including the detentions of people perceived as opposition sympathizers, reports of people being disappeared and serious attacks by armed groups, said Malinowski.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Elias Meseret contributed to this report from Bahir Dar, in Ethiopia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Burundi: Official says 4 members of ruling party killed - AP News: BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 A Burundi official said Sunday that .05/27/2016 10:16:27AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 A Burundi official said Sunday that four members of the country's", "title": "AP News - Burundi: Official says 4 members of ruling party killed", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/17/burundi-official-says-4-members-of-ruling-party-killed-n2149816", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\108\\2d4e22b6-f16c-4d86-a192-03127352b0ed.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 A Burundi official said Sunday that four members of the country's", "title": "AP News - Burundi: Official says 4 members of ruling party killed", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/17/burundi-official-says-4-members-of-ruling-party-killed-n2149816", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/108/2d4e22b6-f16c-4d86-a192-03127352b0ed.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Burundi: Official says 4 members of ruling party killed, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 A Burundi official said Sunday that four members of the country's ruling party were killed in an attack in continuing violence associated with the extended tenure of President Pierre Nkurunziza.\nThe attack was on supporters of the ruling party who had gathered for an environmental clean-up exercise, said Jerome Ntakarutimana, chief of Mugamba district in Buriri province.\nThe international community is concerned that Burundi, which has a long history of coup attempts and civil war, could be sliding into a full blown conflict.\nAnnan blamed Nkurunziza for the crisis and not cooperating with the international community to resolve the conflict.\nBurundi has experienced violent street protests, which boiled over into a failed coup in May and now a rebellion, since the ruling party announced Nkurunziza's candidature for a third term in office in April last year."}
