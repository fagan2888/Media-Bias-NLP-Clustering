That is, Medicaid managed care entities will be required to cover medically necessary state plan services delivered through telemedicine or store and forward technology, subject to the same conditions that apply in the commercial market.\n\nFinally, the legislation specifies that hospitals with patients receiving telemedicine services can \u201crely on a distant site hospital\u2019s decision to grant or renew clinical privileges or association of the physician,\u201d if certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that \u201c[a]ny physician providing telemedicine services will hold and maintain a valid license to perform such services issued or recognized by the state of Washington.\u201d It is notable that even Washington, a State that now requires coverage for telemedicine, did not extend telemedicine parity to health care providers licensed in other States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under Washington\u2019s telehealth parity law, health plans will be required to cover a service delivered through telemedicine or store and forward technology if also available in person", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Last month, Washington state&amp;nbsp;enacted legislation requiring coverage&amp;nbsp;of medical services delivered through telehealth technology, making it the latest State to join the growing consensus that", "title": "Washington State Enacts Telehealth Parity Law", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/washington-state-enacts-telehealth-parity-law", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/man%20pulse%20readout_0.jpg?itok=ObD0xO0m", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Health, Technology, Washington, Telehealth Parity, Affordable Care Act, Insurance,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Health, Technology, Washington, Telehealth Parity, Affordable Care Act, Insurance,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab4c\"", "article_summary": "Thursday, May 7, 2015Last month, Washington state enacted legislation requiring coverage of medical services delivered through telehealth technology, making it the latest State to join the growing consensus that telehealth is an important component of efficiently delivering health care.\nOne of these conditions is that \u201c[a]ny physician providing telemedicine services will hold and maintain a valid license to perform such services issued or recognized by the state of Washington.\u201d It is notable that even Washington, a State that now requires coverage for telemedicine, did not extend telemedicine parity to health care providers licensed in other States.\nThat is, Medicaid managed care entities will be required to cover medically necessary state plan services delivered through telemedicine or store and forward technology, subject to the same conditions that apply in the commercial market.\nUnder Washington\u2019s telehealth parity law, health plans will be required to cover a service delivered through \u201ctelemedicine\u201d or \u201cstore and forward technology,\u201d if the plan covers the service when delivered in person; the service is medically necessary; and the service is \u201crecognized as an essential health benefit\u201d under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe legislation imposes similar requirements on Medicaid managed care organizations."}
