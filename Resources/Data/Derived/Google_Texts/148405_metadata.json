Starting in the fall of 2015, they will be able to train and compete in their own building.\n\nYoung wrestlers from Green Brook, Long Hill, Watchung and Warren will soon have a year-round home for training and competition.\n\nA ground breaking ceremony will be conducted at 6 p.m.tonight for the Watchung Hills Wrestling Association wrestling facility at 100 Mountain Ave., at Mountain and Stirling Road in Warren \u2014 near Watchung Hills Regional High School, where many of those youngsters hope to have a scholastic wrestling career.\n\nThe building is expected to be completed by the fall of 2015 and will include two bathrooms, a changing and storage area and gym space to hold two 40-by-40-foot wrestling mats, said Marc Hayward, who had been the organization\u2019s president the past five years before becoming recording secretary. Wrestlers from kindergarten through eighth grade will be the beneficiaries of the new space, Hayward said.\n\nHayward said that the organization has already raised 60 percent of between the $350,000 to $375,000 that he estimates it will cost to complete the 110-by-60 square foot steel pole barn building. Because the building will be large enough room for spectators, the organization will be able to host dual, triangular and quad meets, he said.\n\n\u201cThis will get us out of using the middle school (Warren Middle School) for home matches or having to pay the high school or having to wait after the high school practices to practice at night,\u201d Hayward said.\n\nWatchung Hills Wrestling Association athletes were very successful last season, competing in the Raritan Valley, Central Jersey Youth and New Jersey Grade School leagues.\n\n\u201cThis is very, very rare (for middle school programs) to have their own building,\u201d said Hayward, adding that 110 wrestlers were part of the program last winter. \u201cThe success that South Plainfield (high school) has had \u2026this will give us more access for practice than the limited schedule we faced.\u201d\n\nThe Warren Board of Education was given the property many years ago by Warren Township. The wrestling organization asked the Board of Education about a space where it could construct its building. The board sliced a small lot on the corner of Mountain Avenue and Stirling Road, then gave the property back to the township, so a leasing agreement between the wrestling group and Township could be completed, Hayward said. The Watchung Hills Wrestling Assocation met all of the engineering, site surveying and legal fee requirements in order to allow the property to be sub-divided at no cost to the taxpayers.\n\n\u201cWe would not have been successful if we didn't have the strong commitment to youth sport and to the community from Warren Township and the Board of Education,\u201d Hayward added.\n\nStaff Writer Harry Frezza: hfrezza@mycentraljersey.com\n\nDetails\n\nTo learn more about the Watchung Hills Wrestling Association program, visit www.leaguelineup.com/whwa\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1rLBFh4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Young wrestlers from Green Brook, Long Hill, Watchung and Warren will have own home", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Young wrestlers from Green Brook, Long Hill, Watchung and Warren will have own home", "title": "New wrestling facility will benefit youngsters", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2014/07/28/new-watchung-hills-wrestling-facility-will-benefit-youngsters/13293199/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Young wrestlers from Green Brook, Long Hill, Watchung and Warren will have own home", "title": "New Watchung Hills wrestling facility will benefit youngsters", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fdc80cbcef9de4c5fa8b6b91236e88e8623446b3/c=75-0-373-298&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2014/07/28/watchungbuilding3.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Warren, Watchung, Green Brook, Long Hill"}, "article_summary": "The sign marking the new home facility site for the Watchung Hills Wrestling Association in Warren.\nStaff Writer Harry Frezza: hfrezza@mycentraljersey.comDetailsTo learn more about the Watchung Hills Wrestling Association program, visit www.leaguelineup.com/whwaRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1rLBFh4\nA ground breaking ceremony will be conducted at 6 p.m.tonight for the Watchung Hills Wrestling Association wrestling facility at 100 Mountain Ave., at Mountain and Stirling Road in Warren \u2014 near Watchung Hills Regional High School, where many of those youngsters hope to have a scholastic wrestling career.\nWatchung Hills Wrestling Association athletes were very successful last season, competing in the Raritan Valley, Central Jersey Youth and New Jersey Grade School leagues.\nA ground-breaking ceremony at the future home of the the Watchung Hills Wrestling Assocation will take place tonight at 6 p.m. at 100 Mountain Ave., on the corner of Mountain and Stirling Road \u2013 near Watchung Hills Regional High School."}
