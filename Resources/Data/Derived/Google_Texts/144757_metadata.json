You also have a ton of debt, which is leading to stress. You\u2019re the gayest generation, you send your love over email instead of voicemail, and, according to a new poll by the Pew Research Center, you probably hate yourself, too.\n\nMillennials have surpassed baby boomers as the largest generation in the world, and that title comes with a little more stress and self-loathing. According to Pew, 59 percent of millennials think they are self-absorbed. Though that may be true in this age of social media narcissism, just how self-absorbed are millennials? Research has shown that some 53 percent of young Americans aged 18 to 29 are using the photo-sharing site Instagram more than any other generation. A 2014 study asked users to complete a Narcissistic Personality Inventory and found that narcissism was the primary driver of social media updates.\n\nNearly half of the millennials polled also described themselves as wasteful, while 43 percent said they're greedy, and 31 percent said their generation is cynical. Conversely, however, 24 percent of millennials said millennials are responsible, 36 percent said they're hard-working, and only 17 percent thought their generation is moral. Being a millennial is obviously tough, so it\u2019s no surprise that 40 percent of millennials actually don\u2019t categorize themselves as a millennial. Instead, some 33 percent of millennials falsely categorize themselves as \"Generation X,\" which is actually adults 35 to 50.\n\nSo, why do millennials have so much self-loathing? One of the reasons is because millennials are struggling in the real world. They find themselves in debt immediately out of school, but that education they paid so much for hasn\u2019t really paid off in the job world, leading to what has been dubbed, \u201cThe Quarter-Life Crisis.\u201d It could also have to do with the fact millennials are three times more likely to be obese when compared to other age groups. This is because of increased screen time, lack of regular, leisure-time physical activity, and a longer time spent in education and transitioning to adulthood.\n\nHowever, if you believe that not identifying yourself as a member of your supposed \"generation\" means you hate yourself, then millennials actually love themselves more than a certain generation. Just 18 percent of the \u201cSilent Generation,\u201d people born between 1928 and 1945, identify themselves as being a part of that generation, with only two (2!) percent of those \u201cSilent\u201d people stating that the name of their generation is a good fit.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "millennial hate wasteful greedy narcissistic wasteful amoral pew research center", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new Pew Research Center poll has found that millennials think they are amoral, cynical, greedy, narcissistic and wasteful, while some don't even identify themselves as a millennial.", "title": "Millennials Hate Other Millennials", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/millennials-sure-do-hate-other-millennials-according-pew-survey-351294", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/04/millennial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new Pew Research Center poll has found that millennials think they are amoral, cynical, greedy, narcissistic and wasteful, while some don't even identify themselves as a millennial.", "title": "Millennials Hate Other Millennials", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/millennials-sure-do-hate-other-millennials-according-pew-survey-351294", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/04/millennial.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/04/millennial.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-04T11:59:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T11:59:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new Pew Research Center poll has found that millennials think they are amoral, cynical, greedy, narcissistic and wasteful, while some don't even identify themselves as a millennial."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6334\"", "article_summary": "Being a millennial is obviously tough, so it\u2019s no surprise that 40 percent of millennials actually don\u2019t categorize themselves as a millennial.\nHowever, if you believe that not identifying yourself as a member of your supposed \"generation\" means you hate yourself, then millennials actually love themselves more than a certain generation.\nConversely, however, 24 percent of millennials said millennials are responsible, 36 percent said they're hard-working, and only 17 percent thought their generation is moral.\nYou\u2019re the gayest generation, you send your love over email instead of voicemail, and, according to a new poll by the Pew Research Center, you probably hate yourself, too.\nInstead, some 33 percent of millennials falsely categorize themselves as \"Generation X,\" which is actually adults 35 to 50."}
