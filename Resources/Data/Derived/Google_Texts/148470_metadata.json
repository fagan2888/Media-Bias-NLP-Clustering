He\u2019s written several great investing books, but AAAA is my favorite. It\u2019s a must read, particularly if you\u2019re just starting out or want to learn more about passive investing.\n\nIn October of this year at a personal finance bloggers conference I had the chance to talk with Rick. He\u2019s the founder of Portfolio Solutions, which manages more than $1 billion in assets. His investing philosophy, like mine, is one of long-term, passive investing with low cost index funds.\n\nRick was kind enough to agree to an interview for this week\u2019s podcast. We cover a lot of investing topics.\n\nTopics Covered with Rick Ferri\n\nWhy a 100% equity portfolio is ideal for young investors if they can tolerate the volatility\n\nHow investors can change their asset allocation to deal with market volatility\n\nWhat is the 3-Fund Portfolio\n\nWhy passive investing is the ideal philosophy for most investors\n\nHow much should you be saving\n\nHow much do you need to retire\n\nOther Topics Covered in this Podcast\n\nWhy Healthcare.gov\u2019s estimate of insurance premiums misses the mark by a wide margin\n\nHow your FICO credit score affects car insurance premium\n\nThe best cash back credit card for holiday shopping\n\nResources Mentioned in This Podcast\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "In this podcast, we interview investing expert Rick Ferri about how to invest for retirement.", "og": {"site_name": "The Dough Roller", "description": "In this podcast, we interview investing expert Rick Ferri about how to invest for retirement.", "title": "DR 003: How to Invest for Retirement with Rick Ferri", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 250, "identifier": "http://www.doughroller.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/doughroller-podcast250.jpg", "height": 250}, "updated_time": "2013-11-27T16:25:53-04:00", "url": "http://www.doughroller.net/investing/dr-003-invest-retirement-rick-ferri/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In this podcast, we interview investing expert Rick Ferri about how to invest for retirement.", "creator": "@doughroller", "image": "http://www.doughroller.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/doughroller-podcast250.jpg", "title": "DR 003: How to Invest for Retirement with Rick Ferri", "site": "@doughroller", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "516e603053d3baa52910908e3110c88f"}, "google-site-verification": "cRQfABmWkjFRekPP6W1YZzhsIIqUZqgCOsnguoUCdRw", "msvalidate.01": "98530F4D43860ADB0E7DE1CC0EB1BC1D", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DoughRoller/", "section": "Investing", "published_time": "2013-11-23T08:17:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-27T16:25:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business, personal finance, investing, credit, debit, banking"}, "article_summary": "His investing philosophy, like mine, is one of long-term, passive investing with low cost index funds.\nIt\u2019s a must read, particularly if you\u2019re just starting out or want to learn more about passive investing.\nOne of the best books on investing is All About Asset Allocation by Rick Ferri.\nIn October of this year at a personal finance bloggers conference I had the chance to talk with Rick.\nRick was kind enough to agree to an interview for this week\u2019s podcast."}
