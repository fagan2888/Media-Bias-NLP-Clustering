After two years of open enrollment in which the co-ops enrolled fewer people than they had anticipated, 22 of the 23 organizations are losing money and are facing difficult repaying federal loans.One co-op was even shut down this summer \u2013 Iowa\u2019s CoOportunity Health, created with $145 million in federal loans, became insolvent after just two years due to \u201cadverse claims experience.\u201d And in Louisiana, the Louisiana Health Cooperative decided to voluntarily fold at the end of this year as it was \u201cnot growing fast enough to maintain a health future,\u201d according Chief Executive Greg Cromer.In total, the co-ops received $2.4 billion in federal loans to help pay start-up costs and meet individual state requirements. Many entered individual state exchanges hoping to attract consumers with affordably priced plans and local care.Now, Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel Levinson says the co-ops may have difficulty repaying those funds. As such, six of the co-ops are on an \u201cinformal watch list,\u201d though the government is not disclosing which operations are being monitored.\u201cThe low enrollments and net losses might limit the ability of some co-ops to repay start-up and solvency loans and to remain viable and sustainable,\u201d Levinson said in the audit report.Executives with these co-ops say the results are not surprising, however, and it would be unrealistic for industry observers to expect the organizations to achieve a profit in the first years of business.\u201cThis is inherently a risky venture, a tough, tough business,\u201d said Martin Hickey, chief executive of New Mexico\u2019s co-op and chairman of the National Alliance of State Health Co-Ops. \u201cThere will likely be a handful of co-ops that fail. I don\u2019t deny that. But you will probably see the red ink disappear for some plans starting next year.\u201dIndependent agents have been wary of health co-ops from the start. One broker in Nevada told Insurance Business America in 2013 that while the state co-op consistently came in with the lowest-priced plan, he believed the rates would inevitably rise as claims were registered, leaving insureds with a plan far more expensive than what they had counted on.\u201cEverything being equal, if it\u2019s too good to be true, it usually is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might be attractive now, but down the road, they\u2019re going to be very unattractive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/the-financial-wellbeing-of-most-health-coops-isnt-good-federal-audit-23882.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/FatStacksYo.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "According to an audit of health co-ops established under the Affordable Care Act, 22 out of 23 are losing money and failing to grow fast enough", "title": "The financial wellbeing of most health co-ops isn\u2019t good: Federal audit"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to an audit of health co-ops established under the Affordable Care Act, 22 out of 23 are losing money and failing to grow fast enough", "title": "The financial wellbeing of most health co-ops isn\u2019t good: Federal a ...", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/the-financial-wellbeing-of-most-health-coops-isnt-good-federal-audit-23882.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/FatStacksYo.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "According to an audit of health co-ops established under the Affordable Care Act, 22 out of 23 are losing money and failing to grow fast enough", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2d5\"", "article_summary": "But you will probably see the red ink disappear for some plans starting next year.\u201dIndependent agents have been wary of health co-ops from the start.\nIt appears agents who believed the prices attached to plans from health insurance cooperatives were too good to be true had a point.According to the results of a federal audit, the vast majority of co-ops created under the Afordable Care Act are facing financial difficulties.\n\u201cThey might be attractive now, but down the road, they\u2019re going to be very unattractive.\u201d\nMany entered individual state exchanges hoping to attract consumers with affordably priced plans and local care.Now, Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel Levinson says the co-ops may have difficulty repaying those funds.\n\u201cThere will likely be a handful of co-ops that fail."}
