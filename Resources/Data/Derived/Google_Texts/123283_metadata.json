Kremlin-backed media on Monday reported that Russia\u2019s Su-34 fighter-bombers operating in Syria were being armed with air-to-air missiles, for the first time since the Russian air force began operating there in September.\n\nRussian forces in Syria are operating against rebel groups trying to topple that country\u2019s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, as well as against the terror group ISIS. Neither ISIS nor the rebels have the ability to put planes in the air that can threaten Russia\u2019s advanced military aircraft, which leaves little doubt that the addition of air-to-air capability \u2013 announced in banner headlines across Russia\u2019s various government-controlled media portals \u2013 was meant as a message to Turkey.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\n\u201cThe Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers today have for the first time taken on combat mission not only the OFAB-500 air bombs and KAB-500 guided bombs, but also short-and medium-range air-to-air missiles,\u201d said Col. Igor Klimov, spokesman for the Russian Aerospace Forces according to TASS. \u201cThe planes are equipped with missiles for their defense.\u201d\n\nKlimov added that the missiles \u201care equipped with target seeking devices and are capable of hitting air targets within the range of 60 kilometers.\u201d\n\nRussian officials have repeatedly said that they have no intention of going to war with Turkey over the shoot-down, which President Vladimir Putin has described as a \u201cstab in the back.\u201d Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, would be entitled to call on the mutual defense commitments of the powerful alliance, which includes the U.S., Canada and most of Western Europe.\n\nHowever, the addition of new air-to-air weapons on individual planes, as well as the introduction of powerful ground-based anti-aircraft missile systems last week, appear to increase the possibility of another incident, whether inadvertent or retaliatory.\n\nRelated: Obama Paid a High Price to Get Turkey to Fight ISIS\n\nTurkey\u2019s NATO allies are not particularly happy with the decision of Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdo\u011fan attack the Russian plane. (He claims to have ordered the strike himself.) The aircraft, a Su-24 bomber, was reportedly in Turkish airspace for approximately 17 seconds \u2013 a provocation, to be sure, but one seen as far removed from an act of war justifying the use of deadly force.\n\nThe Obama administration has been relatively tight-lipped about the incident. However, presidents Obama and Putin, both in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference on Monday, met for half an hour on the sidelines of the event.\n\nAccording to Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov, \"Obama expressed regret in connection with the incident involving the Russian jet downed by the Turkish Air Force in Syria.\u201d He added, \u201cSyria was discussed in detail, too, and both presidents spoke in favor of moves towards the start of political settlement.\u201d\n\nAlso on Monday, the body of the Russian pilot killed in the attack was returned to Moscow, where it was met by an honor guard and top military officials, in a ceremony widely covered in the Russian media. The very public reception of the pilot\u2019s remains contrasts sharply with the Kremlin-imposed media silence regarding the death of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, where \u2013 despite Kremlin claims to the contrary \u2013 they are supporting armed rebels fighting against the Kiev government.\n\nThe difference in the media treatment of the pilot\u2019s death and the repatriation of his remains suggest that Putin\u2019s administration sees an advantage in stirring up patriotic fervor over the incident, something that would be difficult or impossible to do with regard to the conflict in Ukraine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly a week after Turkish fighters shot down a Russian bomber that crossed into their country\u2019s airspace for a few seconds, resulting in the death of one of its pilots, the tension between the two countries appears not to have eased.
