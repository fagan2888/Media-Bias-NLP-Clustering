He was the bright-eyed twerp whose holiday gift in 2013 was the Gospel of Obamacare around the family fireplace.\n\nWell, Pajama Boy has moved on but his Holy Spirit has not. And where better a place for evangelism and the propagation of faith than on laminated talking-points placemats in the legendary dining halls of Harvard College?\n\nColorful \u201cHoliday Placemats for Social Justice\u201d now provide a \u201cguide for holiday discussions of race and justice with loved ones.\u201d\n\nThanks to the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and the Freshman Dean\u2019s Office, Harvard students can deliver Good News with ideological precision over winter break \u2014 we dare not call it Christmas vacation \u2014 to cretins in the family who resist their Glad Tidings.\n\nThe placemats provide post-Christian litanies and responses in four verses:\n\n1. \u201cYale/Student Activism\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are Black students complaining? Shouldn\u2019t they be happy to be in college?\u201d the placemat puts forward as a possible question. Response: \u201cWhen I hear students expressing their experiences of racism on campus I don\u2019t hear complaining,\u201d the placemat suggests as a response. \u201cInstead I hear young people uplifting a situation that I may not experience. If non-Black students get the privilege of that safe environment, I believe that same privilege should be given to all students.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cHouse Master Title\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did they change the name? What does a housemaster have to do with slavery? It\u2019s not related to that at all.\u201d Response: \u201cFor some, the term master, used to describe stewardship of a group of people (such as a house), is reminiscent of slave masters and the legacy of slavery. The title, \u2018House Master,\u2019 is no longer actively associated with its historical antecedents nor is it used to address House Masters. Given the name is offensive to groups of people, it doesn\u2019t seem onerous to change it. The mastery of a subject is an understandable use of the word. However, within our cultural and historical context, implying mastery of people feels both inappropriate and ill-founded.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cIslamaphobia [sic]/Refugees\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t let anyone in the U.S. from Syria. We can\u2019t guarantee that terrorists won\u2019t infiltrate the ranks of refugees. They\u2019ve already done it in France.\u201d Response: \u201cThe U.S. has been accepting refugees from the war-torn areas around the world for decades. Remember the wars in Central America?\u201d the model response reads. \u201cThey were extremely violent, and the U.S. accepted refugees from all sides of the wars with very strict vetting and not one incident of violence. Racial justice includes welcoming Syrian refugees.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cBlack Murders in the Street\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just listen to the officer? If they had just obeyed the law this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Response: \u201cDo you think the response would be the same if it was a white person being pulled over? In many incidents that result in the death of a black body in the street, these victims are not breaking the law and are unarmed.\u201d\n\nRubrics in the circled center of the placemat \u2014 \u201cTips for Talking to Families\u201d \u2014 advise students to LISTEN, BREATHE, ASK, AFFIRM, and SPEAK.\n\nAnd one may intuit, breathe slowly and speak patiently, clearly, and if possible, monosyllabically, since students are dealing with the uninformed, the feeble-minded, and possibly the crypto-fascist.\n\nWho bears responsibility for this mixture of nonsense and propaganda, at which even The Crimson, the Harvard student newspaper, balked?\n\nWell, of course, blame the university\u2019s diversity warriors \u2014 and there are many on the Harvard payroll. But final responsibility resides with India-born Rakesh Khurana, the Harvard College dean appointed last year.\n\nKhurana is a very slick item, a former business school professor who follows on dean Evelynn Hammonds, a professor of the history of science and of African and African American studies, whose secret spying on deans\u2019 emails led to her 2013 resignation and a plummy post-dean sinecure.\n\nIn an open letter to Harvard students Khurana proclaimed in Dec. 2014:\n\nI have watched and listened in awe of our students, faculty, and staff who have come together to declare with passion, grace, and growing resolve that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and to call for justice, for ally-ship, and for hope.\n\nAnd announced:\n\nThe diversity of our student body at Harvard College should be on the forefront of this paradigm shift.\n\nNo one can be sure what his word ally-ship means. Some Harvard observers wonder what in the world a business school professor is even doing in charge of the College.\n\nBut Khurana being the Voice of Harvard, many other high-level academic administrators slavishly imitate his priorities and this paradigm shift, making diversity Job One on campuses nationwide. His well-advertised concerns illustrate that current college turmoil did not appear from nowhere.\n\nJust last month, Khurana led the move to drop the title of Master from the Harvard houses. There is absolutely no relationship between an academic Master and slavery, but for Khurana the name change was all about \u201cthe social meaning of words,\u201d in other words, feelings, optics and image, as Nicholas Gallagher observed in the Federalist.\n\nI doubt Khurana has many real convictions or much background in history or the humanities. But I have complete certainty that he has a surplus of ambition and is very bright. He knows which way the wind is blowing.\n\nKhurana\u2019s paradigm shift and name changes along with Harvard\u2019s Social Justice placemats provide leading indicators of current campus eruptions, where ideological purity and the propagation of faith never end. The progressive heavens with trumpets of angels in the ether must sound for students and the rest of us in every possible venue, 24/7.\n\nIf the result is the rapidly declining credibility, status, and brand at Harvard and any number of other venerable universities at the Christmas season, the ministers of false gods and bad ideas do not deserve one ounce of our good cheer or sympathy.\n\nUPDATE: Facing intense criticism, Harvard has withdrawn the controversial placemats and in a letter signed by the Deans of Student Life and Freshmen, apologized to its students.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Khurana\u2019s paradigm shift and name changes along with Harvard\u2019s Social Justice placemats provide leading indicators of current campus eruptions, where ideological purity and the propagation of faith never end.\nAnd where better a place for evangelism and the propagation of faith than on laminated talking-points placemats in the legendary dining halls of Harvard College?\nThe title, \u2018House Master,\u2019 is no longer actively associated with its historical antecedents nor is it used to address House Masters.\nAnd announced:The diversity of our student body at Harvard College should be on the forefront of this paradigm shift.\nBut final responsibility resides with India-born Rakesh Khurana, the Harvard College dean appointed last year."}
