The decision came down last week, but emerged in widespread public circulation Tuesday.\n\nThe decision stems from an investigation into possible labor violations during a harvest at an FLDS pecan ranch in Utah in which children and adults may have worked without pay.\n\nIn his ruling, Sam cited the 2014 case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., in which the Supreme Court ruled that a corporation can be exempt from a law\u2014in that case, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employers pay for contraception\u2014that its owners sincerely object to on religious grounds if there is any less restrictive means of achieving the law\u2019s ends. Sam found that prosecutors had other means of getting the information they sought from Steed and thus that he was exempt from testifying.\n\nFLDS, a radical offshoot sect from the mainstream Mormon church, has been under the scrutiny of authorities for years on issues including alleged child labor violations and forced marriages of grown men to underage girls.
