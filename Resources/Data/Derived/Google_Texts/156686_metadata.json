In 2007, David Rutkauskas obtained the rights to the brand. He says this agreement is good news for the future of Rex's Chicken.\n\n\"You know, we started Rex's in 2008 when the economy was tanking because of the Lehman Brothers collapse and people were less likely to take on any risks in business,\" said Rutkauskas. \"Now, 5 years later, we're so excited to be experiencing this incredible breakthrough and the opportunity to partner with the skilled leadership of the Muscogee Creek Nation. It's a huge pleasure to work with them and grow Rex's into something we always knew it could be. This is what I love about being an entrepreneur, creating success from nothing.\"\n\nRutkauskas and his wife, Camille, founded the multi-national chain Camille's Sidewalk Cafe in 1996.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise announced it has purchased the rights to expand Rex's Chicken within the major eight counties of the Creek Nation tribal jurisdiction.", "author": "NewsOn6.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/23503697/creek-nations-business-unit-buys-rights-to-rexs-chicken", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23503697_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise announced it has purchased the rights to expand Rex's Chicken within the major eight counties of the Creek Nation tribal jurisdiction.", "title": "Creek Nation's Business Unit Buys Rights To Rex's Chicken"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23503697_SA.jpg", "description": "Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise announced it has purchased the rights to expand Rex's Chicken within the major eight counties of the Creek Nation tribal jurisdiction.", "card": "summary", "title": "Creek Nation's Business Unit Buys Rights To Rex's Chicken"}, "wnreadableurl": "creek-nations-business-unit-buys-rights-to-rexs-chicken", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2013/09/23", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise announced it has purchased the rights to expand Rex's Chicken within the major eight counties of the Creek Nation tribal jurisdiction.\n\"Our plans are to create [sic] Rex's Chicken initially into our travel plazas,\" said Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise CEO Woody Anderson.\nAccording to a news release, the Tulsa-based restaurant chain's design will be added to the tribe's existing and future travel plazas.\nHe says this agreement is good news for the future of Rex's Chicken.\nPhoto (left to right) of David Rutkauskas, Beautiful Brands and Rex's Chicken CEO; Roger Barnett, Second Chief of the Muscogee Creek Nation; Woody Anderson, CEO of the Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise; and Otto Rutkauskas, CFO of Beautiful Brands."}
