And if they\u2019re stupid enough to take us over that brink, and cost the country billions of dollars, and disrupt people\u2019s lives, they\u2019re going to pay for it in the election.\u201d\n\nBuchanan cut in to counter, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to shut down the government. The Senate will shut it down by refusing to pass a continuing resolution.\u201d\n\nClift dismissed it as \u201ca very convenient way.\u201d She added, \u201cWe know who\u2019s behind the push to shut down the government because they don\u2019t want to fund Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nBuchanan objected, \u201cThey\u2019re not shutting down the government. They\u2019ve never voted to shut down the government. Never.\u201d Clift dismissed this argument as a \u201ctechnicality,\u201d and stating that the Republicans were the ones that got blamed for the previous shutdown.\n\nWhile Buchanan agreed that Republicans took the blame for the most recent shutdown, \u201cthe Democrats are in the tank for Planned Parenthood. They\u2019re going to be united on this issue, and Republicans are not going to vote to shut down the government. Harry Reid and his gang will do it.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buchanan: Republicans Aren't Voting To Shut Down Gov't, Harry Reid And Dems Will", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Buchanan: Republicans Aren't Voting To Shut Down Gov't, Harry Reid And Dems Will", "title": "Buchanan: Republicans Aren't Voting To Shut Down Gov't, Harry Reid And Dems Will - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Buchanan-PP-919-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/19/buchanan-republicans-arent-voting-to-shut-down-govt-harry-reid-and-dems-will/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Buchanan: Republicans Aren't Voting To Shut Down Gov't, Harry Reid And Dems Will", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Buchanan-PP-919-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Buchanan: Republicans Aren't Voting To Shut Down Gov't, Harry Reid And Dems Will - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Pat Buchanan, Planned Parenthood,Abortion, Breitbart TV,Buchanan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "Planned Parenthood", "published_time": "2015-09-19T12:10:02-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERColumnist Pat Buchanan declared, \u201cRepublicans are not going to vote to shut down the government.\nThey\u2019re going to be united on this issue, and Republicans are not going to vote to shut down the government.\nHarry Reid and his gang will do it.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nWhile Buchanan agreed that Republicans took the blame for the most recent shutdown, \u201cthe Democrats are in the tank for Planned Parenthood.\n[Sen.] Harry Reid (D-NV) and his gang will do it\u201d on Friday\u2019s \u201cMcLaughlin Group.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter fellow panelist Eleanor Clift said, \u201cit didn\u2019t work out too well for the Republicans the last time it happened."}
