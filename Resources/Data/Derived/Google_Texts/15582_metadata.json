Main St.\n\nThat\u2019s after considerable work to restore the 125-year-old building, which had been condemned and ordered razed before Jesse and Barkha Daily bought it. The location appealed to them as did the chance to restore the building, including eventually returning its missing spire. The previous restaurant there was Mendini\u2019s on Main.\n\nThe Dailys said the menu will reflect both their backgrounds \u2014 she is from Nepal, he is from Idaho. They met in Milwaukee after each came here to attend college.\n\n\u201cWhat brought us together was our love of food,\u201d Jesse Daily said. He has an engineering consulting firm, Core Consulting, she worked in insurance, and they also manage Thiensville\u2019s farmers market.\n\nBarkha Daily said she expects to get some of her seasonal produce from market vendors for her family recipes. Cheel chef Joe Sandretti, who previously was at Buckley\u2019s restaurant in Milwaukee among other restaurants, is working with her to convert the family recipes to the large batches the restaurant will need.\n\nDishes will represent Nepal, Tibet, Burma and north India. Ingredients and seasonings that distinguish the cuisines include ginger, garlic, fenugreek, clarified butter (ghew in Nepalese), chiles, cumin, mustard seeds and saffron. Some hard-to-find ingredients will be imported from Nepal, including jimbu, a chive-like herb.\n\nThe menu will have a number of small plates, ranging from about $7 to $14, such as the meat- or vegetable-filled dumplings called momos, with dipping sauces.\n\nBigger plates, around $12 to $15, will include ribs; a limited number of feasts, or thali, will be served nightly. The thali encompass seven or eight dishes such as dal, salad, meat, vegetable and rice, likely $30 for two. The thali plates and bowls themselves will be hand-made of bronze.\n\nThe Cheel\u2019s bar will focus on cocktails, particularly classics popular around the 1930s, when the building was a bar. The bar\u2019s staff will infuse liquors and press fruit juices by hand for the cocktails. \u201cWe really want the bar to be an extension of the restaurant,\u201d Jesse Daily said.\n\nThe Dailys have hired Ryan Palkowski, a 15-year veteran of Elsa\u2019s on the Park, as the restaurant\u2019s general manager.\n\nA large deck on the south side of the restaurant will allow guests to dine outside this summer; the Dailys have plans to expand it next year with a second-story deck and garage-top seating.\n\nMadison has Himal Chuli, a food serving food from Nepal. Last year a food truck serving momos rolled on Milwaukee streets; the Flirty Momos owners are looking for a new truck, as well as a brick-and-mortar location.\n\nJournal Sentinel photo", "article_metadata": {"title": "The Cheel will serve Nepalese and American plates", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/262299691.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/taplogo_2048.jpg", "height": 2048}, "type": "article", "description": "<br /><br />A restaurant serving dishes from the Himalayas is due in July in Thiensville, apparently the only such brick-and-mortar restaurant in the Milwaukee area.<br />", "title": "The Cheel will serve Nepalese and American plates"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/taplogo_2048.jpg", "title": "The Cheel will serve Nepalese and American plates", "description": "<br /><br />A restaurant serving dishes from the Himalayas is due in July in Thiensville, apparently the only such brick-and-mortar restaurant in the Milwaukee area.<br />", "card": "summary", "site": "@tapmilwaukee"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ac4\"", "article_summary": "Madison has Himal Chuli, a food serving food from Nepal.\n\u201cWe really want the bar to be an extension of the restaurant,\u201d Jesse Daily said.\n\u201cWhat brought us together was our love of food,\u201d Jesse Daily said.\nThe thali plates and bowls themselves will be hand-made of bronze.\nLast year a food truck serving momos rolled on Milwaukee streets; the Flirty Momos owners are looking for a new truck, as well as a brick-and-mortar location."}
