(Photo: LaVondia Majors / The Tennessean)Buy Photo Story Highlights Residents say better transit is one of their top five priorities for Nashville's future.\n\nTransportation solutions include a comprehensive, regional approach\n\nCommutes are getting ever more challenging in Middle Tennessee\n\nThe SEC Tournament was a boon for Nashville and continues to add to the city's growing cachet.\n\nHowever, if you were one of the thousands of commuters who was stuck in traffic, you probably hoped for a minute that you were somewhere else.\n\nTraffic in Nashville and surrounding communities is already a headache even without all the visitors. It's the price of being in \"It City,\" but there will be a bigger price to pay if we don't invest in our road infrastructure and alternative transportation solutions. Remember that one million more people are expected to move to the region in the next 25 years.\n\nThe 2014 Vital Signs report, produced by the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce and the Nashville Area Metropolitan Planning Organization, documented that about three in five commuters in Middle Tennessee have a drive today that exceeds 20 minutes and one-third of commuters say they are frequently in traffic jams. That is only expected to worsen.\n\nThat's why it's no surprise that Nashville residents listed transit as one of their top five priorities in the three-year NashvilleNext urban planning community process, which drew 17,000 comments, and provides a road map for Nashville's future. The draft plan is scheduled to be released by Metro Government on March 27 for public input and the city's Planning Commission will vote on it this summer.\n\nMore than half of residents in Middle Tennessee counties drive to another county to work, and most of those are commuting into Nashville, which is why a regional approach is essential.\n\nThat approach will be critical to improve bus transportation, add new transit options, fix and build roads, and find innovative ways to improve traffic patterns, keep commuters better informed about road conditions, and help alleviate congestion.\n\nThe list of challenges includes:\n\n\u2022 32 percent of urban roads are congested in Tennessee;\n\n\u2022 The state gas tax hasn't been increased in 26 years so the Tennessee Department of Transportation only has money to maintain roads, not build them;\n\n\u2022 The federal gas tax has not risen since 1997 and the National Highway Trust Fund balance continues to decline;\n\n\u2022 Two out of five roads in Nashville have potholes, cracks or are in distress \u2014 and that reflects the state of our roads prior to the recent snow and ice storms\n\nIn addition, the newly formed Transportation Coalition of Tennessee has called attention to 254 unfunded projects in Tennessee, exceeding $6 billion.\n\nAmong the Middle Tennessee projects identified were State Road 96 from Franklin to Murfreesboro ($82.5 million) and Interstate 40 at the Donelson Pike interchange ($57.5 million).\n\nMiddle Tennessee local leaders \u2013 including the regional Mayors' Caucus and the Metropolitan Planning Organization, among them \u2013 are thinking ahead and have offered solutions and 25-year plans to address these issues.\n\nThey require money, however, from federal, state and local government, and that's where citizens should make their voices known to their lawmakers.\n\nOn transit, 54 percent of Vital Signs report respondents said they would be willing to dedicate more in taxes to expand options, which is going to require money, political will and strategic infill of residential and commercial property to make it more conducive.\n\nAs more people, especially Millennials and those who want to downsize, wish to move in or near the urban core, better transit and more sidewalks and bike paths are essential.\n\nThe Metro Planning Department has estimated that building a high-capacity transit network will cost in the range of $1.4 billion (in traffic) to $7.2 billion (out of traffic), and you can add $1 billion to $2.7 billion to make regional connections.\n\nIn a recent bus ride-along with Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority CEO Steve Bland, editorial board members heard a vision for the future of transit.\n\nEven though the Amp project, which would have connected East Nashville to the West End, is dead, there are other options that can create bus rapid transit across the county to increase frequency. You can learn more and ask your questions in a live chat with Bland on www.tennessean.com on Tuesday, March 17 at 10 a.m.\n\nAs a frequent bus rider who lives the urban experience, I am excited about the possibilities for this community, but it's going to take engaged citizens and thoughtful leaders who follow through with the necessary investments.\n\nInvesting in high capacity transit network\n\n$1.4 billion\n\nCost of in-traffic transit expansion investment\n\n$7.2 billion\n\nCost of out-of-traffic transit expansion investment\n\n(Regional connections will add between $1 billion to $2.7 billion)\n\nNashville Planning Department\n\nLive chats with experts\n\nJoin or replay live chats with experts on different topics at 10 a.m. daily Monday through Thursday at Tennessean.com.\n\nMonday: Live chat with Richard C.
