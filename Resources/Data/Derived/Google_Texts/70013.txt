NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” Carl Stoces, a 70-year-old Monterey, Ind. resident, recently fell off an extension ladder and suffered a traumatic leg injury. He was airlifted to Memorial Hospital in South Bend and had a two-month rehab stay in a nursing home. "The bills that resulted were overwhelming, and the payments would have never been manageable for my fixed retirement income," he says.

Fortunately, a hospital program called CarePayment, which allowed Stoces to finance his payments, started at $54 a month. "I was immediately relieved," he says. "I had no options. For me, it was one of the greatest things that has happened. Now I can pay my bills off, and that's good for me and the hospital."

Of course, financing is a temporary measure - you still have to pay the bills off, sooner or later, and health care bills can really mount later in life. According to Bankrate.com, high medical expenses are the biggest financial worry in for retirees like Stoces.

That's true even for people earning more than $75,000 a year, who are "more concerned about high medical expenses than the overall population."

"Health care costs can be one of the most difficult, yet also most critical, expenses to project in retirement," says Joe Jennings, vice president ofin Baltimore. "Not only do they have the potential to consume a disproportionate amount of a retiree's income, but they have also been rising at a rate much higher than inflation. Another concern is that while life expectancy for retirees continues to rise, many retirees fear they may live longer, but with a lower quality of life due to health-related issues."
