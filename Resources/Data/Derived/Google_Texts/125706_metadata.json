Unless the shutdown ends soon, McKissack's Valentine brew may not be available until 2015.\n\n\"It may really harm us,\" McKissack said. \"We put a lot of money into developing this beer, and now we may have to wait a whole year to make any money off of them.\"", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "McKissack, owner of Buna craft brewery Texas Big Beer, has been forced by the government shutdown to delay the release of two seasonal beers, including a white chocolate porter slated for Valentine's Day.
