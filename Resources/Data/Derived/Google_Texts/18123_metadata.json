Multiple offerings from one company may have the same benefits and cover the same share of a consumer\u2019s costs, but go by different names.\n\n\u201cSometimes the names are downright deceptive,\u201d said Betsy M. Imholz, a lawyer at Consumers Union. \u201cCalling a plan \u2018exclusive\u2019 makes it sound super-duper, but it may mean that you have a very limited choice of doctors or hospitals.\u201d\n\nHubert B. Gesenhues of Las Vegas, a computer technician who has been researching his insurance options, said the names were, for the most part, \u201cmarketing gibberish.\u201d They obscure the fact that many plans do not pay for treatments until consumers have spent thousands of dollars of their own money, he said.\n\nDanielle M. Carpenter, an insurance counselor at the Center for Family Health in Jackson, Mich., said she and her clients did not find the names of health plans particularly useful. The large number of options with similar names \u201ccauses confusion,\u201d said Ms. Carpenter, whose organization has helped 1,400 people choose plans since October.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne insurance industry official, Jon R. Urbanek, a senior vice president at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, acknowledged that \u201ca lot of product names are confusing and hard to navigate.\u201d In many cases, he said, \u201cthey mean more internally to a company than they do to a customer.\u201d\n\nTo help consumers, Mr. Urbanek said, Florida Blue has held 3,000 town-hall-style meetings since July and has greatly expanded its team of agents and brokers.\n\nKaren M. Ignagni, the president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said companies did not sell their plans based on one- or two-word names. Online, she said, \u201cinsurers display detailed information about their benefits, premiums, deductibles and co-payments, data that consumers need at the kitchen table to make their decisions.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina offers plans with names like Blue Advantage Silver 3000, Blue Select Silver 3500 and Blue Advantage Silver 5000. The numbers refer to the amount that a policyholder must pay as a deductible before the plan begins to pay for covered services.\n\n\u201cSilver\u201d plans all have roughly the same value, paying 70 percent of the average overall cost of providing essential health benefits to members. But Shoshanna Sofaer, a professor of health care policy at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York, said the names were \u201cjust branding, just marketing,\u201d and were not used in a consistent way.\n\nThe federal government runs the marketplace for North Carolina, and Michelle Douglas, a spokeswoman for the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurer, said: \u201cWe have no control over the way our products are presented on the federal exchange. On our own website, we provide more information in a more intuitive way.\u201d\n\nOther insurers name their products differently.\n\nIn a number of states, Humana sells a Gold 2500/3500 plan, with a $2,500 deductible and a $3,500 limit on a consumer\u2019s out-of-pocket costs for covered services.\n\nOn the website of the California insurance exchange, each plan has a number indicating what percentage of costs it normally covers \u2014 but that might not be clear to the average consumer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor example, the Health Net Silver 70 H.M.O. is a health maintenance organization that covers 70 percent of costs for a typical consumer. On the company\u2019s website, the same plan has a different name: Community Care H.M.O. Silver $45/$2,000, indicating that it charges $45 for doctor\u2019s visits and has a $2,000 annual deductible.\n\nThe California exchange devised a chart with three columns showing, for each plan, the name on the exchange website, the name on the company website and the name on the insurance card issued to policyholders.\n\nThomas G. Ellison, a nurse in rural Lafayette County, Fla., supports the health care law as a step toward universal coverage and knows more than most people about insurance, having worked in hospitals for three decades. But, he said, the names of the plans available to him are \u201cinsurance doublespeak.\u201d They include Essential, Everyday Health, Predictable Cost, Predictable Cost Plus, All Copay and Everyday Health Premier.\n\nDavid Sandor, a vice president at the Health Care Service Corporation, which offers Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois, Texas and three other states, said, \u201cRegardless of the specific name of an insurance policy, it\u2019s important for consumers to dive in deep and look at the value, which we define in terms of price and the network of doctors and hospitals associated with a plan.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance is complicated even for people who have had it for years. Many people seeking coverage under the new law have not had insurance, and for them, the choices can be particularly challenging.\n\nRebecca Lambert, who owns the Calico Country Store in Martin, Ga., signed up for a plan offered by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, found it was \u201cnot correct for me\u201d and then enrolled in a different plan with a very similar name, Silver Direct Access.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about health insurance,\u201d Ms. Lambert said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had health insurance. I don\u2019t know all the terminology.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act helps consumers compare health plans by classifying them in four categories, from least to most generous: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. In some markets, like Miami, consumers have dozens of choices in the same category.\n\n\u201cToo much choice is no choice at all,\u201d said Jay Angoff, a former Obama administration official who set up the office that regulates health insurance markets. \u201cPeople won\u2019t select the best value if they have to choose between dozens of plans at different metal levels.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140322205751, "twitter": {"description": "As consumers sign up for health insurance in the final days of open enrollment, many find the names of plans unhelpful, confusing and in some cases misleading.", "title": "Names of Health Plans Sow Customer Confusion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/us/names-of-health-plans-sow-customer-confusion.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002782460"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/us/SUB-HEALTH/SUB-HEALTH-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/us/names-of-health-plans-sow-customer-confusion.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002782460", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/us/names-of-health-plans-sow-customer-confusion.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Names of Health Plans Sow Customer Confusion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 22, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Obama  Barack,United States,Advertising and Marketing", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/us/SUB-HEALTH/SUB-HEALTH-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "As consumers sign up for health insurance in the final days of open enrollment, many find the names of plans unhelpful, confusing and in some cases misleading.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/us/SUB-HEALTH/SUB-HEALTH-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "As consumers sign up for health insurance in the final days of open enrollment, many find the names of plans unhelpful, confusing and in some cases misleading.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-03-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Advertising and Marketing", "published": "2014-03-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "23health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140327165407, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/us/names-of-health-plans-sow-customer-confusion.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/us/SUB-HEALTH/SUB-HEALTH-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As consumers sign up for health insurance in the final days of open enrollment, many find the names of plans unhelpful, confusing and in some cases misleading.", "title": "Names of Health Plans Sow Customer Confusion"}, "pdate": 20140322, "des": "Advertising and Marketing", "articleid": 100000002782460, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Names of Health Plans Sow Customer Confusion", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ebc\"", "article_summary": "Karen M.
