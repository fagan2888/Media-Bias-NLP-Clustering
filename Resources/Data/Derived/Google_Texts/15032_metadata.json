That\u2019s apparently hardened the militia leaders\u2019 resolve to continue fighting.\n\nMilitia boss Jose Manuel Mireles, a doctor from Tepalcatepec who\u2019s recovering from plane crash injuries in a Mexico City hideout, says the vigilantes won\u2019t give up their weapons until \u201cthe government assumes its responsibility\u201d and arrests leaders of the feared Knights Templar cartel.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cWhen they re-establish the rule of law in all of Michoacan, then we\u2019ll see how to accommodate all the people who out of necessity have to arm themselves,\u201d Mireles told GlobalPost late Monday.\n\nThat defiant tone was unexpected. Earlier that day, national media had reported that Mireles said he would heed the authorities\u2019 call for the vigilantes to lay down their weapons (mostly assault rifles and grenades).\n\nThe fast-moving events lay bare what\u2019s been a muddled government response to the growing tensions in Michoacan.\n\nBefore, federal officials showed tacit, and at times outright, support for the militias, which call themselves \u201cself-defense\u201d groups. Now, the authorities are rushing to head off the advancing militias, who are clearly becoming Mexico\u2019s big security challenge of 2014.\n\nMexican Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio on Monday said federal forces were taking over security in Michoacan\u2019s coastal lowlands and foothills \u2014 the so-called Tierra Caliente, or Hot Country \u2014 and demanded that the militias turn in their weapons.\n\nThey almost certainly won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf we disarm they will kill us,\u201d Estanislao Beltran, another militia leader, told a radio interviewer Tuesday morning, referring to the Knights Templar.\n\nTaking their name from a medieval order of militant monks, the Knights Templar started several years ago as a cult-like offshoot of a feuding drug cartel.\n\nThe gang vowed to protect villagers from \u201cmaterialism, injustice and tyranny.\u201d\n\nInstead, authorities say, they torment townspeople and local governments with extortion, kidnapping and killing, while dominating parts of the US-bound crystal meth smuggling industry.\n\nSo civilians armed themselves to defend against the gang\u2019s violence. The militia members claim to be farmers and townspeople fed up with the abuse. But many Mexicans accuse the militias of having rival gang connections, too.\n\nAnd many more accuse local government officials of corruption that allows the violence to keep cycling.\n\nMilitia leaders claim that state officials have in fact nurtured the Knights Templar, and that federal officials refuse to go after gang leaders despite knowing where they are.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying the whole government is contaminated,\u201d Beltran said in a radio interview. \u201cBut large parts are colluding with the gangsters.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in GlobalPost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Troops clashed with armed vigilante groups intent on taking on a dangerous meth cartel in Mexico's western Michoacan state.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Dudley Althaus", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Troops clashed with armed vigilante groups intent on taking on a dangerous meth cartel in Mexico's western Michoacan state.", "title": "Mexico's Gang-Torn Hot Country Is About To Boil Over", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/mexicos-gang-torn-hot-country-boil/177080/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11514_Paracuaro_-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-15T09:22:25-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Troops clashed with armed vigilante groups intent on taking on a dangerous meth cartel in Mexico's western Michoacan state.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11514_Paracuaro_.jpg", "title": "Mexico's Gang-Torn Hot Country Is About To Boil Over", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "vigilantes", "published_time": "2014-01-15T08:51:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T09:22:25-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca15d\"", "article_summary": "Mexico\u2019s Gang-Torn Hot Country Is About To Boil OverTroops clashed with armed vigilante groups intent on taking on a dangerous meth cartel in Mexico's western Michoacan state.\nThat\u2019s apparently hardened the militia leaders\u2019 resolve to continue fighting.\nTaking their name from a medieval order of militant monks, the Knights Templar started several years ago as a cult-like offshoot of a feuding drug cartel.\nMilitia leaders claim that state officials have in fact nurtured the Knights Templar, and that federal officials refuse to go after gang leaders despite knowing where they are.\n\u201cIf we disarm they will kill us,\u201d Estanislao Beltran, another militia leader, told a radio interviewer Tuesday morning, referring to the Knights Templar."}
