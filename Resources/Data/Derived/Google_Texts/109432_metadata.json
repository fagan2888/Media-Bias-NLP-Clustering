Robards was charged Wednesday in Tazewell County court with two misdemeanor animal cruelty counts that had been filed Monday.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough for Joachim, of Mapleton, and eight people who joined her to attend Robards\u2019 court appearance and call for felony charges against the woman they believe deliberately let her dogs die.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows you need food and water to survive,\u201d Joachim said outside the Tazewell County Courthouse.\n\nThe group, however, wasn\u2019t aware that the case against Robards, 43, remains under a review that could produce felony charges punishable by prison.\n\nWhile Robards is accused of failing to supply her dogs with adequate food and water, the misdemeanor counts do not allege she caused or intended their deaths.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to investigate to determine whether felony charges are appropriate,\u201d State\u2019s Attorney Stewart Umholtz said after Joachim and the group had left without meeting with him.

I thought she was still living there\u201d in the home at 1509 Howard Court.\n\nBut when a neighbor reported no lights had been on in the house for weeks, Joachim discovered one dog dead there Nov. 24 and the second, hidden under a baby crib, last Friday.
