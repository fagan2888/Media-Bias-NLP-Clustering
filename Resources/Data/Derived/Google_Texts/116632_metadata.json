Duszak is also the Chief Medical Officer of the Neiman Health Policy Institute.\n\nHospital-based radiologists, especially, dodged a bullet because a different King v Burwell decision could have reduced the already low 28% of radiology services in the emergency department that are not reimbursed, according to a paper in the Journal of the American College of Radiology.\n\n\u201cThis ruling, at least, preserves the status quo as it is today,\u201d Duszak said.\n\n\u201cIn a reverse King v. Burwell scenario, CMS and a lot of other people would be scrambling and not moving ahead with other things on the horizon,\u201d Duszak explained. \u201cI think [now], from a point of view from CMS, they are not going to be distracted with an unravel of the ACA, so they will continue to challenge their energies in some of the directions they\u2019ve been going most recently; I think the biggest initiative that\u2019s been put forth is the very ambitious timeframe that\u2019s been outlined for transitioning from fee for service to fee for value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little bit scary for radiologists because right now we really don\u2019t, in my opinion, have very good, robust metrics of value in radiology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can wait for CMS to come forth with some value-based metrics for radiology, but that means having nonradiologists come up with those metrics, or we can collectively be small test tubes of innovation and develop some of our own quality and value-based metrics.\u201d\n\nBetween the CMS value metrics and what congress has done in the SGR fix, Duszak said we are in an environment of full steam ahead in value-based payments.\n\n\u201cThe scary piece about that is the Yogi Berra quote, \u2018if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, any road will get you there\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we all intuitively know what value is, we know it when we see it, but if dollars are going to be on the line, the real challenge is going to be how do we measure this thing called value. We need to start taking it out of the ether, making it less elusive and more tangible.\u201d\n\nInforming CMS\n\nThere is a lot of talk, and skepticism, on the radiology side about proving value, but Zeke Silva, MD, vice chairman of the ACR Commission on Economics, feels confident that the field is well-positioned for the coming health care revolution.\n\nIn the effort to quantify radiology\u2019s value, Silva referred to the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), established by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), or the \u201cSGR fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cMIPS will give each individual physician a composite performance score, which will determine if [physicians] are paid a bonus or imposed a penalty on their fee-for-service payments,\u201d Silva explained. \u201cMACRA gives radiology and the ACR guidance on the general categories and how we can define our place.\u201d\n\nThe MIPS is made up of four performance categories: quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement activities, and Meaningful Use. The physician\u2019s composite score will depend on how they perform in these four categories. As Silva explained, scores will range from zero to 100 and will be compared to a performance threshold, generally the mean or medial for all physicians. Scores above the threshold will likely see a bonus. Negative scores, or those below the threshold, are likely to see a penalty.\n\nThe good news, according to Silva, is the four MIPS categories are largely translations of programs that currently exist.\n\n\u201cFor quality, the current program that exists is PQRS, and the ACR and other organizations have been actively involved in creating PQRS measures that are applicable to diagnostic radiology,\u201d he said. \u201cRadiologists are fairly successful in the PQRS program and the ACR is recognized by CMS as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry, so we are pretty well positioned in the quality category.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the practice quality improvement, we already have to do that for our MOC participation,\u201d Silva said. \u201cSo we are pretty well positioned there as well.\u201d\n\nThe Meaningful Use policy has been statutory for a number of years and is already in Stage 3, Silva explained. Assuming radiology can define its role within the current Meaningful Use system, Silva believes there is reason to be optimistic that by 2019, radiology will be positioned to thrive in that paradigm.\n\nRadiology, it seems, is not in as bad shape as expected. The fourth performance category, however, is where the challenge for radiology really lies.\n\n\u201cResource use is a challenge for us,\u201d Silva said. \u201cCMS began to define resource use metrics with the ACA, which created the value based modifier to look at physician\u2019s resource use on Medicare beneficiaries, see how much physicians spend in the Medicare program, and tie their cost measures to quality, and use that to determine subsequent payment adjustments.\u201d\n\nThese metrics are based on episodes of care, or episode groupers, Silva explained. Episodes can be defined by certain clinical conditions, like COPD, Silva said. Conditions where radiology has a role, as patients with COPD often will receive chest X-rays and CTs.\n\n\u201cRadiology is intimately involved in most of these episodes of care, but we may not be the physician to whom that particular Medicare beneficiary is attributed,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThat\u2019s usually going to be the primary care doctor that\u2019s coordinating patient care and seeing them in a more traditional clinical setting.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for the ACR and radiology, therefore, is to establish quality resource use metrics that are specific for imaging and less about the full episode of care. Silva assured that the ACR has staff and volunteers that dedicate a significant amount of time defining these imaging-specific metrics.\n\nMACRA also addressed alternative payment models (APM), which are less about episodes of care and more about multispecialty models that are responsible for populations of patients. This is another model that radiology has a role in. One of the provisions of MACRA is that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has to define specialty-specific models that are applicable to specialists, and not just conditions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for physicians that contribute to specific aspects of the general health care of the population, but maybe don\u2019t have quite as wide the spectrum of care,\u201d Silva said.\n\nThat\u2019s another challenge for the ACR: defining an imaging-specific APM. Silva sees this as a synthesis of radiology\u2019s data on spending, type, and nature of imaging, and packaging and presenting the model in a form that CMS would be accepting of.\n\nSilva said the Secretary of Health and Human Services has to come out by the end of 2016 with specific criteria for the specialty-specific APMs. The ACR\u2019s strategy is to inform those criteria before they are created, rather than waiting to hear what the government proposes.\n\n\u201cThe ACR recognized a long time ago that this change is happening and while fee-for-service worked well in a number of ways, it has shortcomings that are now being recognized,\u201d Silva said. \u201cWe started to define steps that radiologists could take and Imaging 3.0 is the platform that we use for the concrete steps radiologists need to take to be successful in the next paradigm of quality and physician payment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dc.date": "2015-07-10", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The ACA survives for now; radiology can now put all of its focus on proving value."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d73\"", "article_summary": "Conditions where radiology has a role, as patients with COPD often will receive chest X-rays and CTs.\nAssuming radiology can define its role within the current Meaningful Use system, Silva believes there is reason to be optimistic that by 2019, radiology will be positioned to thrive in that paradigm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for physicians that contribute to specific aspects of the general health care of the population, but maybe don\u2019t have quite as wide the spectrum of care,\u201d Silva said.\nSilva assured that the ACR has staff and volunteers that dedicate a significant amount of time defining these imaging-specific metrics.\nThe fourth performance category, however, is where the challenge for radiology really lies."}
