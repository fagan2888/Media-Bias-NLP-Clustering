Yogi Berra famously said, \u201cit\u2019s never over \u2019til it\u2019s over,\u201d but this race is over. And Buono must know it, because she\u2019s not even attempting a course correction. Here she is straining to compare Christie to buffoonish reality television star \u201cThe Situation:\u201d\n\nHOST: \u201cSenator, one of the most memorable points that I thought came from last night is when they asked you to say something nice about the Governor, and you mentioned that he does well on late night TV. I thought it was a bit of a jab, and I was just wondering though, if you got the opportunity to do some late night TV, wouldn\u2019t you jump at that opportunity to spread your message?\u201d BUONO: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the governor is good with his wisecracks at night, but the fact of the matter is that this election is about more than just reality TV. Do we really need another reality TV show? I mean we already have \u2018The Situation\u2019 do we really need \u2018The Governor\u2019, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nIf only Christie had those abs. Refreshingly, Barbara Buono has no regrets. She doesn\u2019t regret getting snarky in the one moment of the debate that was specifically designed to pause the partisan acrimony. She doesn\u2019t regret a single one of her 154 votes for tax increases. And based on the clip above, she doesn\u2019t regret getting called out as \u201cshrill and petty\u201d by the New Jersey media. Two polls. Two blow-outs. Goodnight, Barb \u2014 and stay classy.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Double down: Buono compares Christie to fist-pumping \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 clown", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Chris Christie minted another YouTube hit by answering a mid-debate cheap shot from Democrat Barbara Buono with grace and magnanimity, leveling her in the process. \u00a0Yogi Berra famously said, &#8220\u2026", "title": "Double down: Buono compares Christie to fist-pumping \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 clown", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2013/10/11/video-buono-doubles-down-compares-christie-to-jersey-shore-character/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-11T15:09:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-11T14:45:44+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde5f\"", "article_summary": "And based on the clip above, she doesn\u2019t regret getting called out as \u201cshrill and petty\u201d by the New Jersey media.\nShe doesn\u2019t regret getting snarky in the one moment of the debate that was specifically designed to pause the partisan acrimony.\nDouble down: Buono compares Christie to fist-pumping \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 clownposted at 11:09 am on October 11, 2013 by Guy BensonChris Christie minted another YouTube hit by answering a mid-debate cheap shot from Democrat Barbara Buono with grace and magnanimity, leveling her in the process.\nShe doesn\u2019t regret a single one of her 154 votes for tax increases.\nDo we really need another reality TV show?"}
