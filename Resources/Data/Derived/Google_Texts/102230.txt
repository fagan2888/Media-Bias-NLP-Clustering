Country music star Sheryl Crow is slated to perform the national anthem during the first Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday, according to host CNN.

"I think most people know that I'm a Democrat," the Grammy-winning singer told CNN, adding that she hopes the candidates talk about the environment.

"I'm fascinated with the process, and I'm going to be excited to actually be there when our candidates debate," she said.

CNN's Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday will last two hours, an hour shorter than the network's Republican debate last month.

The five major Democratic candidates who have declared a bid will participate. The second GOP debate, hosted by CNN last month, had 16 candidates.
