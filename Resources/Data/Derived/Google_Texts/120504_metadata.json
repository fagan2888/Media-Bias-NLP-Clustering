Michael Rogers said on Fox Business Network on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the end, the key to our ability to be effective, I believe, as a nation in cyber, will be our ability to span the divide between the private sector and the public sector or the government.\u201d\n\nThe controversial bill introduced by Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) on Thursday would make it easier for private companies to share information about possible hackers and lines of attack with each other and the government. Backers say it's a critical step to ensure there are no blind spots on the country's networks.\n\nPrivacy advocates, however, fear it would allow companies to send personal and identifying information about everyday users to the government, including agencies such as the NSA.\n\nRuppersberger\u2019s bill has come up twice before in Congress, but failed to reach the finish line. President Obama has pledged to veto previous versions, on the grounds that it does not do enough to protect privacy.\n\nStill, last year\u2019s massive hack at Sony could give momentum for lawmakers looking to bolster the nation\u2019s cyber laws.\n\nThe Obama administration has blamed the hack on North Korea, and Rogers on Friday said he has \u201cvery high confidence\u201d that Pyongyang was responsible, even though many cyber experts remain skeptical.\n\nOn the heels of the recent terrorist attack in Paris, Rogers also raised alarms that terror groups \u2014 such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) \u2014 could develop robust cyber capabilities.\n\n\u201cIt's something I pay great attention to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe ability to use cyber as a tool to achieve specific effects is more than just a nation-state phenomenon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The director also raised fears that ISIS could pose a cyber threat.", "description": "The director also raised fears that ISIS could pose a cyber threat.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The director also raised fears that ISIS could pose a cyber threat.", "title": "NSA chief wants cyber bill to fight hackers", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/229054-nsa-head-wants-cyber-bill-to-fight-hackers", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/special_reports/getty-2009-10-30-cybersecurity-dhs-1_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-09T16:24:13-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/229054-nsa-head-wants-cyber-bill-to-fight-hackers", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The director also raised fears that ISIS could pose a cyber threat.", "card": "summary", "title": "NSA chief wants cyber bill to fight hackers"}, "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-09T16:24-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/229054-nsa-head-wants-cyber-bill-to-fight-hackers", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-09T14:29-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Security Agency, CISPA, Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act,Michael Rogers,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-09T14:29:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T16:24:13-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "NSA chief wants cyber bill to fight hackers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2429\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe ability to use cyber as a tool to achieve specific effects is more than just a nation-state phenomenon.\u201d\nStill, last year\u2019s massive hack at Sony could give momentum for lawmakers looking to bolster the nation\u2019s cyber laws.\n645X363 - No Companion - Full Sharing - Additional videos are suggested - Policy/Regulation/BlogsThe head of the National Security Agency wants lawmakers to pass a contentious cybersecurity bill to help federal officials go after hackers.\n\u201cI think it's a very important first step,\u201d spy agency director Adm.
