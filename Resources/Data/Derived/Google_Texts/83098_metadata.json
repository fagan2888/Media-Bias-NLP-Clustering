In the 1990s, Mr. Chafe was known as Stryder Styafyr in Roesburg, Oregon. According to the FBI, the married man was recruiting 14 to 16-year-old girls to form what he called the \u201cCobalt Clan.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis reported goal was to have sex with these young girls in order to produce a large number of children over which he could rule,\u201d an FBI\u2019s most wanted poster states.\n\nMr. Chafe was arrested on charges of rape, sodomy and sex abuse of two teenage girls with police identifying other victims.\n\nAccording to police, Mr. Chafe moved to New Mexico where he worked as a computer technician during the investigation. Ten days before his scheduled trial in Roseburg, a friend of Mr. Chafe\u2019s that he had gone fishing with in Washington state told authorities that he fell overboard and was missing.\n\nMr. Hasting told reporters that the friend who told authorities that Chafe went overboard has not been charged with a crime at this point, Fox News reported.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019ve got to learn what\u2019s gone on over the last 15 years,\u201d Lt. Gregg Hastings said.\n\nAccording to authorities, Mr. Chafe had been living in a city near Bozeman where he owned a computer business. Detectives found no evidence that he was trying to recruit Montana girls.\n\n\u201cWe have no indication (of that) and we do not have any kind of investigation into charges of that nature,\u201d said Undersheriff Dan Springer of Gallatin County, Montana.\n\nMr. Chafe remains in a Montana jail pending extradition to Roseburg where he will be tried for six counts of third-degree rape, five counts of third-degree sexual abuse and seven counts of third-degree sodomy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Oregon fugitive was arrested in Montana after a 15-year manhunt Oregon state police said on Friday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An Oregon fugitive was arrested in Montana after a 15-year manhunt Oregon state police said on Friday.", "title": "15-year manhunt for suspected rapist ends in Montana", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/18/15-year-manhunt-suspected-rapist-ends-montana/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/18/daniel-chafe-fbi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/18/daniel-chafe-fbi.jpg", "description": "An Oregon fugitive was arrested in Montana after a 15-year manhunt Oregon state police said on Friday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "15-year manhunt for suspected rapist ends in Montana"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Daniel Clement Chafe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde974\"", "article_summary": "According to authorities, Mr. Chafe had been living in a city near Bozeman where he owned a computer business.\nAn Oregon fugitive was arrested in Montana after a 15-year manhunt Oregon state police said on Friday.\nAccording to police, Mr. Chafe moved to New Mexico where he worked as a computer technician during the investigation.\nDetectives found no evidence that he was trying to recruit Montana girls.\nPolice suspect Mr. Chafe faked his death to avoid a trial on child sex-abuse charges, Fox News reported."}
