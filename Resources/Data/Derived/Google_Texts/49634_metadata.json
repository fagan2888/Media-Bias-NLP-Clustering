Yoo, who once argued that the president\u2019s power to act unilaterally is so expansive that the chief executive could order interrogators to crush a child\u2019s testicles, wrote on Tuesday that Judge Arthur Schwab was wrong to \u201creach out and decide the action\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Yoo\u2019s objection to Schwab\u2019s decision is entirely procedural. Yoo, who once argued that the executive can use many forms of torture despite the fact that federal law explicitly forbids such activities, believes that President Obama\u2019s decision to allow immigrants to remain united with their families is executive overreach. Yet Yoo also criticizes Schwab for opining on the immigration policy\u2019s constitutionality when the issue was not properly before his court. As Yoo notes, \u201c[t]his is not a case where the executive order applies, because the Obama administration is not allowing an illegal alien to remain in the country.\u201d Thus, the case presents \u201cno real dispute over the law, because regardless of whether the executive order is constitutional or not, it would make no difference in [this defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d\n\nThough Yoo also says that he \u201csympathize[s] with Judge Schwab on the merits of his decision against President Obama\u2019s executive order,\u201d the actual discussion of legal merits of the immigration policy in Schwab\u2019s opinion is quite thin. Judge Schwab did not cite a single judicial precedent supporting the most crucial part of his analysis, and he ignored Supreme Court decisions stating that the executive has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d on matters of deportation and that federal agencies are \u201cfar better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of [enforcement] priorities.\u201d\n\nSetting aside Yoo\u2019s procedural objections to Schwab\u2019s order, the former Justice Department attorney\u2019s transformation from a proponent of largely unchecked executive power under Bush into a man deeply concerned with government action under Obama is not a new phenomenon. Yoo has argued that the Supreme Court decision upholding much of the Affordable Care Act \u201cdid great violence\u201d to constitutional limits on federal power. Yet, during the Bush Administration, Yoo offered a view that, if followed to its logical conclusion, would grant President Obama the authority to implement many provisions of Obamacare even if Congress had never passed the law in the first place.\n\nDuring the Bush years, Yoo argued that the Constitution permits the president to judge what steps are \u201cnecessary\u201d to prosecute a war. The executive\u2019s power to torture people, he claimed, flowed from the fact that torturing someone is less severe than killing them:\n\nLook, death is worse than torture, but everyone except pacifists thinks there are circumstances in which war is justified. War means killing people. If we are entitled to kill people, we must be entitled to injure them. I don\u2019t see how it can be reasonable to have an absolute prohibition on torture when you don\u2019t have an absolute prohibition on killing.\n\nThis rationale, however, leaves few, if any, limits on presidential power. If torture is permitted because it is a less severe sanction than killing, then requiring someone to purchase health insurance is also a less severe sanction than killing them. So is taxing someone in order to buy insurance for someone else who cannot afford it. Under Yoo\u2019s theory, it\u2019s not at all clear why President Obama cannot simply declare everyone in the United States who lacks health insurance an enemy combatant and then use the full force of the United States military to force them to purchase such insurance.\n\nOf course the idea that millions of Americans could be declared enemy combatants for something that has little to do with their conduct on a battlefield may seem absurd, but Yoo also believes that people labeled \u201cenemy combatants\u201d by the president should be given extraordinarily limited access to due process enabling them to contest their designation. According to one former Bush Administration official, under the actual processes used to evaluate suspected terrorists, \u201cof the initial 742 detainees that had arrived at Guant\u00e1namo, the majority of them had never seen a U.S. soldier in the process of their initial detention and their captivity had not been subjected to any meaningful review.\u201d We now know that many of these detainees were innocent.\n\nSo Yoo seems particularly willing to advocate in favor of expansive powers for presidents of his party and narrow contractions of federal power when Democrats are calling the shots. Until recently, however, Yoo was widely viewed as an outlier even among conservative lawyers. In 2004, the torture memos were repudiated by the new head of the Justice Department office Yoo once worked in. After Yoo returned to Berkeley law school, where he is a tenured professor, the law school came under considerable pressure to fire him for his involvement in justifying torture. Though the law school\u2019s dean, Christopher Edley, defended the school\u2019s decision not to fire Yoo on academic freedom grounds, he criticized the torture memos themselves for reducing \u201cthe Rule of Law to the Reign of Politics.\u201d\n\nToday, however, Yoo looks less and less like an outlier and more and more like a harbinger of a new legal era. Data shows that the best predictor of whether a lawsuit challenging portions of Obamacare will succeed is whether a majority of the judges hearing the case are Republicans. Justice Antonin Scalia authored an opinion that provided a clear rationale for upholding the Affordable Care Act several years before he joined another opinion attempting to repeal the entire law. Judge Schwab rejected Obama\u2019s immigration policy without even feeling the need to cite precedents supporting the core of his reasoning.\n\nYoo\u2019s flexible approach to the law, in other words, is hardly limited to Yoo himself. It is increasingly easy to find on the federal bench.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "When even the torture lawyer thinks you've gone too far, it might be time to rethink.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "When even the torture lawyer thinks you've gone too far, it might be time to rethink.", "title": "Even John Yoo Says The Court Decision Rejecting Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy Is Problematic", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/17/3604612/even-john-yoo-says-that-court-decision-lashing-out-at-obamas-immigration-policy-is-problematic/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Yoo-e1418828047723.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When even the torture lawyer thinks you've gone too far, it might be time to rethink.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Yoo-e1418828047723-321x214.jpg", "title": "Even John Yoo Says The Court Decision Rejecting Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy Is Problematic", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Yoo-e1418828047723.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Yoo-e1418828047723.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T13:46:35+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe2d\"", "article_summary": "Justice Even John Yoo Says The Court Decision Rejecting Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy Is Problematic CREDIT: AP Photo/Susan Walsh, FileA federal judge\u2019s decision declaring President Obama\u2019s newly announced immigration policy unconstitutional has an unexpected \u2014 if somewhat tepid \u2014 critic: torture memo author John Yoo.\nYoo has argued that the Supreme Court decision upholding much of the Affordable Care Act \u201cdid great violence\u201d to constitutional limits on federal power.\nYet Yoo also criticizes Schwab for opining on the immigration policy\u2019s constitutionality when the issue was not properly before his court.\nJudge Schwab rejected Obama\u2019s immigration policy without even feeling the need to cite precedents supporting the core of his reasoning.\nSo Yoo seems particularly willing to advocate in favor of expansive powers for presidents of his party and narrow contractions of federal power when Democrats are calling the shots."}
