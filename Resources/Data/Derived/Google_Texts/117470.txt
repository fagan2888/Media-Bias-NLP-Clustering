Dare County commissioners have voted to spend more than $3 million a year to dredge Oregon Inlet, possibly resolving a problem which has plagued boaters and local officials for years.

The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk reports the commissioners agreed this week to dedicate a share of about $21 million received annually from lodging fees, known as occupancy taxes.

Donnie Potter of the Army Corps of Engineers says the agency is expected to agree to dredge 340 days per year.

Sand tends to fill the marked channel, which is more than 100 feet wide under the Bonner Bridge, forcing vessels south where spans narrow to about 50 feet. Captains have to increase speed to keep currents from pushing the boat into a bridge support.
