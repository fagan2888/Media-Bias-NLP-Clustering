At present, three quarters of Netflix registrations are U.S. based; this move clearly indicates a more global focus.\n\nNeither of these announcements was greeted with much shock, but it\u2019s still worth remembering how close Netflix was to death before its phoenix-like rebirth when it challenged HBO as a provider of top-quality original content.\n\nRelated: 15 Episodes of The Simpsons You Must Binge Watch\n\nIt is that original content that is fueling Netflix\u2019s resurgence. Historically, Q2 has been Netflix's roughest quarter, with members deciding to spend time outside after winter hibernation/binge watching. Couple this with the recent price increase for new subscribers and the termination of Saturday delivery (for those still getting the discs).\n\nInstead of seeing a decline in membership, Netflix saw an increase and a subsequent stock spike. Most analysts agree this was in large part due to the release of a new season of buzz shows - \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d in the spring.\n\nWhile plenty has already been said about Netflix\u2019s future as a \u201ctelevision network,\u201d less attention has been paid to the decreasing popularity of its film catalog. No one really batted an eye when Netflix canceled its Saturday service, partly because the disc-delivery business is dwindling. Some 391,000 subscribers dropped out of receiving discs (either canceling entirely, or selecting streaming only) in Q2. Rather than attempt their ill-fated PR disaster with Qwikster in 2011, Netflix could have just waited for the business to die on its own. But even their back catalog of streaming films seems increasingly like a value add, rather than the reason a subscriber would come on board.\n\nSome of this is certainly due to the license limitations that the library still faces; many of the biggest hits and buzz films aren\u2019t available to stream, as well as a solid number of classics and fan favorites. Additionally, some of it is due to the decreasing importance of film in pop culture. Where once film (meaning a piece of video content that premieres in a cinema) was the height of pop-culture achievement, it is increasingly a carnival ride.\n\nPut another way, would the average American seem more out touch with the zeitgeist if he or she hadn\u2019t seen 2013\u2019s highest grossing film, \u201cIron Man 3,\u201d or didn\u2019t know what \u201cThe Red Wedding\u201d was? In the recently announced Emmy nominations, Netflix received 31 nominations, more than double last year. And this is little more than a decade after it was first considered revolutionary for a cable network to rack up the nominations. The landscape is changing, and fast.\n\nRelated: Did \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Just Kill The Multiplex?\n\nTo this end, Netflix has allocated $7.7 billion toward streaming content (original and archival) and a number that none of its competitors can match. Amazon, which seems most \u201cprimed\u201d to take them on, has a budget for all of its streaming content that is equal to the amount that Netflix spends on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d alone. Additionally, there is a widely held belief that Amazon customers who have signed up for Prime have done so primarily to get free 2-day shipping from the parent company.\n\nOf course, the big elephant in the room is HBO GO, with its 130 million subscribers, but GO (at present) is still very much tied to traditional cable packages and the content is still considered \u201cHBO Programing,\u201d rather than \u201cGo Programming.\u201d\n\nThe success of its original programing (\u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d was the single most watched series in every subscriber territory; the company called it \u201cevery bit of the global media event we had hoped for\u201d) has made Netflix a desirable place for content creators as well. After viewing the creative freedom and substantial budgets that show runners like David Fincher and Jenji Kohan have been granted, others are sure to follow.\n\nOne of the more interesting experiments is bringing Chelsea Handler to a \u201clate night\u201d talk show. In addition to thumbing its nose at the boys club of late night TV, it also thumbs its nose at the idea of late night TV. Ironically based on the next-day-viewing performance of HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, Netflix has realized what many of have been doing with late night TV and DVRs (and before that VCRs) for years now - watching them the next day when we get home from work.\n\nThough this will be Netflix\u2019s first experiment releasing a series incrementally and at a scheduled time, there are no expectations that viewers will watch at this time. But it is just one more sign that Netflix is ready to play with the big boys and be a real live TV network.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This week Netflix made several announcements regarding their streaming properties that", "title": "Why Movies on Netflix Just Don\u2019t Matter Anymore", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/26/Why-Movies-Netflix-Just-Don-t-Matter-Any-More", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07252014_Orange_is_the_New_Black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/26/Why-Movies-Netflix-Just-Don-t-Matter-Any-More", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07252014_Orange_is_the_New_Black.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "This week Netflix made several announcements regarding their streaming properties that", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9759\"", "article_summary": "In addition to thumbing its nose at the boys club of late night TV, it also thumbs its nose at the idea of late night TV.\nTo this end, Netflix has allocated $7.7 billion toward streaming content (original and archival) and a number that none of its competitors can match.\nRelated: 15 Episodes of The Simpsons You Must Binge WatchIt is that original content that is fueling Netflix\u2019s resurgence.\nOne of the more interesting experiments is bringing Chelsea Handler to a \u201clate night\u201d talk show.\nThis week Netflix made several announcements regarding their streaming properties that will forever change the shape of video content consumption."}
