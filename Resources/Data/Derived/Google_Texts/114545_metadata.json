Currently, half of Americans (50%) have a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court, while 39% say they have an unfavorable view.\n\nThe court\u2019s upcoming decisions, on such contentious subjects as same-sex marriage, the death penalty and the Affordable Care Act, have the potential to affect opinions of the court. The court will hear arguments April 28 in cases to overturn state bans on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted March 25-29, 2015 among 1,500 adults, finds no significant partisan differences in views of the court: 54% of Democrats and 50% of Republicans view the Supreme Court favorably.\n\nIn recent years, partisan views of the court shifted following major, end-of-term decisions. In 2012, the share of Republicans viewing the court favorably declined 18 points (from 56% to 38%), after the court\u2019s ruling upholding most parts of the Affordable Care Act; by contrast, favorable opinions among Democrats rose 12 points (from 52% to 64%).\n\nLast year, after the Hobby Lobby ruling limiting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement to provide contraceptive coverage, there was an 11-point decline in the percentage of Democrats viewing the court favorably (63% to 52%). Republicans\u2019 views were largely unchanged (54% before, 53% after).\n\nOver the long term, the public\u2019s views of the Supreme Court have become less positive. In seven of the last eight surveys since April 2012, favorable impressions of the court have been close to 50%, the lowest ratings in 30 years of polling.\n\nViews of Court\u2019s Ideology\n\nThe survey finds that the public continues to have a mixed view of the Supreme Court\u2019s ideology, with a plurality (38%) continuing to say they perceive the court to be \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d About as many call the Supreme Court liberal (26%) as say it is conservative (28%). This balance of opinion regarding the court\u2019s ideological leanings is virtually unchanged since last measured in July 2014.\n\nThere continue to be wide partisan and ideological differences in opinions about the Supreme Court\u2019s ideological leanings. A majority of liberal Democrats (56%) say the court is conservative; just 12% of conservative Republicans say the same. Nearly half of conservative Republicans (48%) see the court as liberal, compared with 8% of liberal Democrats. About four-in-ten conservative Republicans (38%) and 31% of liberal Democrats say the court is middle of the road.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Survey Reports", "datasets": "march-2015-political-survey", "news_keywords": "publications,survey reports", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"url": "http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/20/views-of-supreme-court-little-changed-as-major-rulings-loom/", "site_name": "Pew Research Center for the People and the Press", "type": "article", "description": "As the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions on subjects as same-sex marriage, the death penalty and the Affordable Care Act loom, half of Americans have a favorable opinion of the court, while 39% say they have an unfavorable view.", "title": "Views of Supreme Court Little Changed as Major Rulings Loom"}, "topics": "Supreme Court", "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"\"}", "keywords": "publications,survey reports", "theme-color": "#D1A730", "date": 20150420, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2015-04-20T10:27:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/20/views-of-supreme-court-little-changed-as-major-rulings-loom/", "description": "As the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions on subjects as same-sex marriage, the death penalty and the Affordable Care Act loom, half of Americans have a favorable opinion of the court, while 39% say they have an unfavorable view.", "site": "@pewresearch", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Views of Supreme Court Little Changed as Major Rulings Loom"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "As the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions on subjects as same-sex marriage, the death penalty and the Affordable Care Act loom, half of Americans have a favorable"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15ca\"", "article_summary": "Views of Supreme Court Little Changed as Major Rulings LoomIdeological Divide in Views of Court\u2019s IdeologySurvey ReportPublic views of the Supreme Court are little changed since last summer, following the court\u2019s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case and other end-of-term decisions.\nA majority of liberal Democrats (56%) say the court is conservative; just 12% of conservative Republicans say the same.\nCurrently, half of Americans (50%) have a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court, while 39% say they have an unfavorable view.\nAbout four-in-ten conservative Republicans (38%) and 31% of liberal Democrats say the court is middle of the road.\nOver the long term, the public\u2019s views of the Supreme Court have become less positive."}
