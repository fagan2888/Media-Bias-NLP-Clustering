In spite of their best attempts, the news media have gotten it wrong prediction after prediction on a wide range of business and economic issues in 2013.\n\nJust in the past year, reporters warned of \u201ceconomic doomsday,\u201d thought Healthcare.gov was going to be \u201ceasy\u201d just like Amazon.com, and warned of melting polar ice, even as a new record was set for ice mass.\n\nIn many cases, the failed predictions were an extension of journalists\u2019 standard talking points \u2013 pro-ObamaCare, anti-conservative and sky-is-falling global warming worries. But they should have left the fortune telling to the Psychic Friends Network.\n\nThe MRC\u2019s Business and Media Institute analyzed the worst media mistakes of the year to come up with the 10 most ridiculous or wildly inaccurate media predictions. Here is our list:\n\n1. Healthcare.gov Will Be Like \u2018Amazon\u2019 or \u2018Travelocity\u2019\n\nOr maybe the Edsel? After the disastrous rollout of the ObamaCare website, it could have been easy to forget how much the broadcast and cable networks praised it before the launch.\n\nFor the program to work, it was necessary that many people buy insurance through the website. Unsurprisingly, the cheerleading hosts and guests at the broadcasts networks promoted the federal exchange website, just as they had supported the law before and after it was passed.\n\nOn CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d Sept. 28, Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Gosselin gushed that \u201cit will be a lot like shopping for anything online on \u2013 on Amazon.\u201d Gosselin explained that the signup process would be very simple and said, \u201cYou'll look at the different health insurance plans that are offered in your area and you will pick the one that works best for you and your family and you will hit \u2018buy.\u2019\u201d Unless you can\u2019t get on the site. Or can\u2019t navigate anywhere, or have a cardiac episode when you see the costs of your new \u201cfree\u201d health care.\n\nJust a day before the site launched, CBS\u2019s Jill Schlesinger made a similar comparison saying it would be like \u201cgoing to shop for a flight on Travelocity.\u201d In reality, it was more like winning a \u201cfree\u201d getaway in which you just have to sit through 24-48 hrs of pitches for yet-to-be-built time-shares in a war-torn third-world nation.\n\nIn fact, the media\u2019s left-wing ideologues were so sure that the website would run smoothly that they viciously attacked Republicans for opposing it. CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire\u201d co-host Van Jones said on \u201cNew Day\u201d Sept. 30, that Republicans were part of \u201ccrazy town.\u201d Previously, Van Jones was an environmental advisor to the Obama administration until he resigned because of evidence that he thought the Bush administration had staged the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Ed Schultz praised the website design the same day, blaming right-wing \u201ccommercials\u201d and \u201ctalkers\u201d for spreading confusion. Schultz predicted it would be \u201ceasy.\u201d Schultz said, \u201cIf you go to this website you will find out how easy it is to read, how easy it is to navigate all the information.\u201d He even called it a \u201cgreat guide,\u201d before wiping his sweaty brow with a Sham-Wow!\n\nAfter the Oct. 1 launch of the website, things were so bad that the media couldn\u2019t ignore the failure. The website crashed repeatedly, causing embarrassment for the administration and their infomercial hosts in the media. The president even launched a \u201ctech surge\u201d designed to fix the website by Dec. 1, though it crashed when CNN tried to use it even after that deadline.\n\n2. Well, It Wasn\u2019t for a Lack of Hot Air \u2026 We\u2019ll Have a Disastrous Hurricane Season\n\nClimate alarmism is more than 100 years old and still going strong. But in the last few years the networks have used weather events and forecasts to stoke such fears. Whether it\u2019s a freak snowstorm or drought, tornado or sun shower, raining cats and dogs or raining men (Alleluia!), there is no weather phenomenon that the media won\u2019t chalk up to climate change.\n\nThis year, they embraced predictions of a record hurricane season, and connected those to global warming and climate change. But when the forecast fell flat, the networks said very little about their earlier claims.\n\nABC, CBS, and NBC aggressively hyped how \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d hurricanes would be during the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nOn May 23, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an \u201cera of high activity for Atlantic hurricanes,\u201d with 7 to 11 hurricanes. The next day, \u201cGood Morning America\u2019s\u201d Ginger Zee, practically rubbing her hands in anticipation, touted the prediction, saying \u201cFederal forecasters using the words \u2018extremely active\u2019 to describe what\u2019s gonna happen come summer and fall.\u201d\n\nJust two days later on May 25, NBC reporter John Yang ominously warned of \u201cdevastating tornadoes, searing heat waves, withering droughts and related wildfires, and powerful hurricanes.\u201d Similarly, CBS warned that month that 2013 \u201ccould be a dangerous year along the East Coast.\u201d\n\nABC also predicted future \u201cextreme weather\u201d June 24, saying \u201cscientists say human-caused climate change is already helping shift the planet\u2019s natural balance,\u201d after discussing the devastating Hurricane Sandy.\n\nBut when it came to Atlantic hurricanes, reality was the opposite of forecasts. Rather than an extreme season, the 2013 hurricane season was the slowest in 30 years in terms of hurricane frequency. Rather than the seven to 11 hurricanes predicted, only two storms reached hurricane status.\n\nAs for the claim that hurricane frequency would rise because of climate change, University of Alabama in Huntsville climatologist Dr. John Christy denied any long-term relationship between climate change and hurricane frequency. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at hurricanes starting in the 1850s. There is no trend in hurricanes.\u201d\n\nABC, far from admitting its mistake, completely ignored the subject on the final day of hurricane season. CBS and NBC did address the end of the season, but only briefly: giving a combined total of 44 seconds to the subject.\n\nNBC\u2019s Lester Holt seemed almost disappointed on Nov. 30\u2019s \u201cNightly News,\u201d saying \u201cHurricane season ended with pretty much of a \u2018no show.\u2019 This was as bad as it got \u2026 And neither of those hurricanes made it to the United States.\u201d\n\nHey, you\u2019ll get \u2019em next year, Lester!\n\n3. Government Shutdown Will Wreak Havoc on Our Economy! Or Not\n\nWhen the federal government is the center of your universe, your protector and provider, redistributive transfer pump, and your final arbiter of justice and bringer of light, it\u2019s not surprising that you expect the world to crash down in its absence.\n\nIn addition to blaming conservatives more than three times as often as liberals for the partial government shutdown, both broadcast news and print outlets exaggerated the probable impact on the economy and jobs.\n\nAfter the shutdown, which began Oct. 1, they promoted the high-end estimates of $24 billion in economic damage and paid little attention when the federal government itself eventually released a much more modest estimate of $2 billion and $6 billion. Hey, let someone take away your blankie and see how you react.\n\nABC, CBS, and NBC widely reported that the shutdown had cost the economy $24 billion.\n\nThey cited this specific number five times between Oct. 17 and 24, immediately following the shutdown. Print and online media, such as The Wall Street Journal and The Huffington Post, cited the same $24 billion price tag that came from Standard & Poors (S&P). That was 400 percent to 1,200 percent higher than the government\u2019s later estimate. Well, you know, \u2018prepare for the worst\u2019 and all that \u2026\n\nWall Street Journal\u2019s Steven Russolillo called it \u201cone expensive wound\u201d and emphasized that \u201cit\u2019s about $1 billion more than Google founder Larry Page\u2019s personal net worth.\u201d The Huffington Post boosted the S&P estimate calling it \u201cthe most detailed insight to date.\u201d\n\nWhile the S&P number was repeated, the media generally ignored less pessimistic forecasts from economic consultants like Macroeconomic Advisers or IHS Global Insight. The exception was The New York Times which admitted the S&P estimate was \u201cmore pessimistic\u201d than other alternatives and contrasted it with Macroeconomic Advisers\u2019 $12 billion estimate. The following day, Oct. 18, the Times also mentioned IHS\u2019s more accurate $3.1 billion price tag.\n\nFurthermore, NBC and CNBC predicted that the shutdown would cost American jobs. CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman generated controversy Oct. 22, when he called the weak September jobs data the \u201cSenator Ted Cruz jobs report.\u201d That same day NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d correspondent Ron Mott warned that \u201cthe next one could be even worse.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that the cost and damage to jobs were both overstated. On Nov. 7, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated the shutdown cost between $2 billion and $6 billion. Two of the three broadcast networks ignored the news entirely between Nov. 7 and 10. Only CBS mentioned it. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said in the October jobs report that \u201cthere were no discernible impacts of the partial federal government shutdown.\u201d\n\n4. Maybe They Shouldn\u2019t Spread It So Thick When It Comes to Ice Levels\n\nIce, Ice, baby. The media also use predictions about ice melt and sea ice levels to spread climate fears. The prediction that ice at the North and South poles will melt because of global warming is a classic alarmist prediction, dating at least as far back to Al Gore\u2019s \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d And let\u2019s face it, everybody hates to run out of ice.\n\nIn late 2012 and early 2013, media outlets including NBC and The Independent (UK) hyped predictions of increasing ice melt in both the Arctic and Antarctic. On Dec. 5, 2012, \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor Brian Williams warned of \u201cgreater melting of the Greenland ice sheet,\u201d saying \u201cit is, quote, \u2018unlikely,\u2019 government scientists say, \u2018that conditions can be reversed any time soon.\u2019\u201d The Independent published a similar story on Jan. 7, warning of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d melting in both Greenland and Antarctica that would be \u201cmore rapid and severe than previously expected.\u201d\n\nJust as many other climate change predictions have failed, these worries of increased melting in the Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica were overblown, though neither NBC nor The Independent have admitted their mistakes. Even The New York Times was forced to acknowledge the facts on Sept. 20 describing a \u201csharp recovery\u201d of ice in the Arctic Ocean compared to 2012. In fact, according to the Times, 2013 saw \u201cthe largest one-year increase in Arctic ice since satellite tracking began in 1978.\u201d\n\nAntarctica\u2019s sea ice reached record highs this year, surpassing a 2012 record, and it was no small increase. The Washington Post reported Sept. 23 that the ice experienced an \u201c80 percent of the increase in ice volume.\u201d\n\nStill, you never know who\u2019s going to drop by, so a good host always keeps an eye on the ice bucket.\n\n5. \u2018You Can Keep Your Plan\u2019*\n\nPresident Obama famously repeated the promise that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d while pushing for ObamaCare\u2019s passage. In fact, he made that promise 36 times between 2008 and November 2013. ABC openly defended this prediction in 2009, and other broadcast and print outlets \u201cfailed to scrutinize\u201d the law to evaluate Obama\u2019s claims.\n\nABC\u2019s David Wright dismissed skepticism of the president\u2019s promise on Aug. 11, 2009, \u201cWorld News,\u201d saying \u201cthe bill includes tax breaks and mandates designed to prevent a mass exodus from the current employer-based system.\u201d While Wright acknowledged that the promise was only \u201ctrue for 95 percent of people,\u201d he emphasized that even if some people \u201cend up changing their insurance plans\u201d they wouldn\u2019t need to \u201c[change] their doctors.\u201d He also dismissed conservative \u201cnoise\u201d as making fact checking this claim difficult.\n\nEveryone knows now, thanks to NBC investigations\u2019 findings announced Oct. 28, 2013, that the administration has known that the ObamaCare regulations meant this promise would not come to pass. The White House has known since July 2010.\n\nThe press corps then sounded something like this: \u201cDad, remember what you told me about my hamster when he disappeared? Well, he didn\u2019t really go to Rodent Band Camp, did he?\u201d\n\nIf more journalists had been digging into the law they might have discovered, as NBC eventually did, that the president was wrong. Time\u2019s Mark Halperin admitted as much on \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d Nov. 21. Halperin said that \u201cthe press failed to scrutinize this program,\u201d but blamed \u201cthe flaws of the way the media works.\u201d According to Halperin, the news media would only have scrutinized the law if candidates during the election had discussed it, but he ignored the fact that ObamaCare was still a major issue during the 2012 election.\n\nAs we now know, if you like your plan, you cannot necessarily keep it. Obama clarified that the plan must not have changed since ObamaCare\u2019s passage. That is quite different from his many earlier statements. Even ABC, while admitting that 9 million might lose insurance, was far from the whopping 78 million that could lose employer-sponsored plans, according to a recent analysis by the Manhattan Institute.\n\n6. Still Waiting for the Sequester Sky to Fall\n\nThe networks and other media warned that the sequester, a series of spending cuts that took place on March 1, would devastate the government and reduce essential services. The media predicted increases in violent crime and terrorism, airport delays and meat shortages \u2013 dogs and cats living together! Total anarchy!\n\nThe networks focused on the disastrous claims from Department of Transportation (DOT), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other agency reports. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said Feb. 1 that cuts would mean \u201c7,000 FBI employees not working each day,\u201d resulting in increased terrorist attacks, violent crime and human trafficking. The networks mentioned this prediction seven times between Feb. 19 and Feb. 27. On Feb. 26, NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d even brought on the U.S. Attorney General about the cuts. Eric Holder, who\u2019s apparently preparing for a second career in professional wrestling, told NBC, \u201cThere is going to be pain.\u201d\n\nBetween Feb. 22 and March 1, ABC, CBS, and NBC ran a total of 13 stories highlighting possible airport delays including the prediction of \u201cairport hell\u201d on \u201cWorld News with Diane Sawyer. At least it was \u201cAirport Hell\u201d and not \u201cAirport Hell \u201975\u201d or \u201cAirport Hell \u201977,\u201d both of which lacked the taut writing and wrenching performances of the original.\n\nThe sequester was also supposed to drive up food prices and create meat shortages. Both the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture claimed that sequester would result in furloughs, with the USDA predicting \u201ca nationwide shutdown of meat and poultry plants during a furlough of inspection personnel.\u201d Between Feb. 17 and Feb. 27, ABC, CBS, and NBC touted these fears nine times, including the Feb. 25 \u201cToday Show\u201d report that said the sequester would \u201cjack up prices\u201d of meat.\n\nThankfully, these disasters did not come to pass. Appropriations bills were passed protecting the DOT, while the FBI and FDA managed to cut nonessential expenditures to maintain current personnel and inspection levels.\n\nThe news media talked about the dire consequences of cutting $85 billion in federal spending, but according to Veronique de Rugy, in National Review Online, \u201conly $44 billion of the $85 billion sequester will be cuts in actual federal outlays for 2013.\u201d She also pointed out that \u201cthat number pales in comparison with the projected level of spending that year, the $845 billion deficit, and the $224 billion on interest payments.\u201d\n\n7. The Networks Go \u2018Fiscal Cliff\u2019 Diving\n\nBroadcast networks fear-mongered about the impending \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d throughout 2012.\n\nThe fiscal cliff, a series of tax increases and sequester spending cuts, was scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2013. Despite constant predictions of rising unemployment and recession, the fiscal cliff did not bring about the forecasted \u201cdoomsday\u201d or \u201ceconomic disaster.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, ABC, CBS, and NBC news programs warned of a fiscal cliff-related recession 65 times. They made 30 of these predictions in December 2012 alone. Major Garrett, on CBS\u2019 Dec. 28 broadcast of \u201cThis Morning,\u201d informed viewers about \u201cwarnings of a recession that have rattled Wall Street and consumer confidence.\u201d The networks were the only media succumbing to hysteria. The Huffington Post compared the fiscal cliff to the Mayan apocalypse Dec. 4. And it was just as credible.\n\nThe networks also touted disastrous unemployment predictions. On Aug. 22, the Congressional Budget Office predicted a rise in unemployment from 7.9 percent to 9.1 percent within a year. Over the next four days, ABC, CBS, and NBC repeated it six times. CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning\u201d on Oct. 26 outdid that with a National Association of Manufacturers report predicting 12 percent unemployment.\n\nThe vast majority of fiscal cliff tax increases took effect in January 2013. According to CNN, 77 percent of Americans saw their taxes increase. All in all, taxpayers experienced an average annual increase of $1,257. Tax increases are certainly unpleasant, but they did not have the horrible impact the networks imagined.\n\nDespite the networks\u2019 predictions, there was no recession or skyrocketing unemployment. Unemployment dropped from 7.8 percent in December 2012 to 7.0 percent in November 2013.The stock market also hit record highs, with the Dow surpassing 15,700.\n\n8. Gas Prices Will \u2018Soar\u2019\n\nFool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Time Magazine\u2019s finance reporter Brad Tuttle made two predictions that gas prices would rise significantly in 2013.\n\nIn January, when gas prices were around $3.30 a gallon, Tuttle forecast a rise to $4 per gallon, citing an estimate from the website GasBuddy, and said \u201cdrivers shouldn\u2019t expect prices to get cheaper.\u201d\n\nHis only caveat was that \u201cit\u2019s unwise to wholly trust predictions concerning the price of gas in a given month.\u201d He completely ignored the possibility that prices would actually go down.\n\nHe predicted on July 12 that prices would \u201csoar\u201d through the end of the year and a gallon would cost 25 cents to 30 cents more \u201cover the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nBoth of these predictions failed, according to historical data by AAA. At the time of Tuttle\u2019s January prediction, gas cost $3.30 per gallon. So far this year, gas prices have not gone higher than $3.79. After Tuttle\u2019s July prediction, gas prices did the opposite sinking to a November low of $3.18.\n\nWhile Tuttle was correct that gas price predictions are unreliable, perhaps he should have taken his own advice when it came to year-long forecasts, as well.\n\n9. QE3 Will Sink! Stock Market Stability Scuttled\n\nSince 2008, the Federal Reserve has spent almost $2.3 trillion buying up assets from banks, in a process called quantitative easing. The purpose was to stimulate the economy, although many say it just stimulated Wall Street. Fed policy has received a relative spotlight this year, due to the probable confirmation of the incredibly liberal, stimulus-friendly Janet Yellen.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s actions have become so ingrained in the stock market that investment CEO Barry Sternlicht referred to it as a \u201cheroin addiction.\u201d Widespread predictions that the easing will end, made by CNBC and financial print media, have made the markets as jittery as an Italian cruise ship captain. The instability caused uncertainty on Wall Street and traders to sell off stocks in anticipation of the taper.\n\nAs early as August 2013, financial news outlets predicted that this policy would end or \u201ctaper\u201d as of September 2013. CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman wrote Aug. 28 that it was \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d On Aug. 14, Bloomberg reported that the Fed will \u201cprobably reduce\u201d bond purchases, while the Aug. 6 New York Times said \u201cthe Fed could start tapering as early as next month.\u201d\n\nThe taper did not materialize and the expectations created a dangerous uncertainty. On Nov. 25, USA Today\u2019s Adam Shell said \u201cTaper Terror Stalks [Wall] Street,\u201d explaining how worried the markets were that the Fed would end quantitative easing this December. The problem was that as early as June 20, CNBC\u2019s Jeff Cox reported that \u201cthe stock market sold off aggressively\u201d in preparation for a taper, and The Telegraph\u2019s Philip Aldrick said that \u201ctraders were dismayed by the Fed\u2019s confusing messaging.\u201d\n\n10. CNN Cries \u2018Food Fights!\u2019\n\nCNN Contributor and pseudo-conservative David Frum declared at the end of 2012 that \u201c2013 will be a year of crisis.\u201d Specifically, he predicted a drop in the corn harvest and \u201chigher grain prices,\u201d creating social strife over access to food.\n\nHe asked \u201cWill 2013 bring us social turmoil in Brazil, strikes in China or revolution in Pakistan?\u201d Will Daryl survive this season on \u201cThe Walking Dead?\u201d\n\nFrum even said that the crisis \u201chas already begun\u201d and \u201cwill inescapably confront the next president of the United States.\u201d He blamed \u201cextreme weather\u201d for this coming shortage.\n\nThis prediction, like so many others, was wildly off the mark. While food prices increased between 2011 and 2012, they increased less than in previous years according to the Consumer Price Index. According to the CPI on Nov. 27, the 2013 increase was only between 1.5 to 2.5 percent compared with 3.7 percent in 2011 and 2.6 percent in 2012. Grain or cereal prices, like those Frum\u2019s prediction was about, actually decreased by 1 to 2 percent in 2013. So much for rising grain prices leading to crisis.\n\nThe implications of his prediction were huge. Frum brought up the widespread European revolutions of 1848, saying they were a result of \u201cyears of bad harvests across Europe.\u201d These dire predictions did not materialize, however, despite Frum\u2019s claims that such strife was \u201cinescapable.\u201d And as of the last new \u201cWalking Dead\u201d episode of 2013, Daryl Dixon is still kicking zombie butt.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mrc.org/articles/medias-top-10-most-embarrassing-predictions-2013", "image": "http://www.mrc.org/sites/default/files/images/Fiscal%20Doomsday%20picture%281%29.JPG", "site_name": "Media Research Center", "description": "Print, broadcast or web, the media sure aren\u2019t Nostradamus.
