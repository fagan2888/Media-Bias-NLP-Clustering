Ted Cruz of Texas, who have suggested bombing the Islamic State into oblivion.\n\n\u201cYou would carpet-bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops,\u201d Mr. Cruz said during this week\u2019s GOP primary debate.\n\nStill, Mr. Obama said the Islamic State will be defeated. He stressed, however, that Syrian President Bashar Assad must be removed from power and a successor chosen before the country truly can find peace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. And we\u2019re going to do so by systematically squeezing them, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing, taking out their leadership, taking out their forces, taking out their infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my firm belief, and the belief of the experts in this administration that so long as Assad is there, we cannot achieve that kind of stability inside of Syria. \u2026 So that\u2019s going to continue to be a top priority for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama vowed Friday to destroy the Islamic State, but he differs greatly from Republican presidential contenders who have said they want to \"carpet bomb\" areas in which the terrorist group operates.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama vowed Friday to destroy the Islamic State, but he differs greatly from Republican presidential contenders who have said they want to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d areas in which the terrorist group operates.", "title": "Obama: \u2018There\u2019s only so much bombing you can do\u2019 to defeat ISIS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/18/obama-theres-only-so-much-bombing-you-can-do-defea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/17/Mideast_Turkey_IS_Killing.JPEG-03286.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/17/Mideast_Turkey_IS_Killing.JPEG-03286.jpg", "description": "President Obama vowed Friday to destroy the Islamic State, but he differs greatly from Republican presidential contenders who have said they want to \"carpet bomb\" areas in which the terrorist group op", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: \u2018There\u2019s only so much bombing you can do\u2019 to"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict"}, "article_summary": "Still, Mr. Obama said the Islamic State will be defeated.\nHis answer comes in stark contrast to Republican White House hopefuls such as Sen.
