The team dentist for the Gopher football and hockey teams \u201ctook me under his wing,\u201d Roettger said. \u201cI helped him make mouth guards.\u201d During his clinical year in dental school, Roettger returned to working with the Gophers.\n\nWhen he established a private practice in Stillwater, sports medicine became a niche. \u201cI was one of the few dentists doing sports dentistry,\u201d he said. Serving on the Minnesota State High School League Sports Medicine Advisory Council led to national and international work with the Academy of Sports Dentistry.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we prevent as many injuries as we can,\u201d Roettger said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a really easy job to do.\u201d Custom mouth guards have come a long way in recent decades, Roettger said. \u201cIf you ask 90 percent of people 45 or older, they would say it\u2019s that thing you stick in boiling water, it\u2019s bulky, it makes you gag. If you look at mouth guards that are made by dentists, they have improved immensely.\u201d\n\nRoettger said new studies have shown that specially designed mouth guards can actually improve performance. When cadets at The Citadel worked out with a specially designed mouth guard, \u201ctheir bodies sensed a lot less stress than when they didn\u2019t wear the mouth guard. A less stressed body can be involved in the business of what you have to do in the sport. It\u2019s an interesting link \u2014 one we don\u2019t know a ton about,\u201d Roettger said.\n\nIn 2007, Roettger sold his practice to devote more time to teaching at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry. He began as an adjunct and went full-time in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal job \u2014 what I needed to be doing all along. We\u2019re beginning to change the way we interact with the medical college. I see more problem patients in a week than I saw in my private practice,\u201d he said.\n\nRoettger and his team treat transplant patients whose regimen of immunosuppressant drugs makes them more prone to gum and tooth infections. Radiation for head and neck tumors changes how the bone in the jaw heals. Cardiac infections can be seeded by oral infection. Roettger said, \u201cThere are any number of different places where we are getting ourselves into the medical school.\u201d\n\nIs this the final step on your career ladder?\n\nI don\u2019t have any plans of changing my career ever until I can\u2019t do it well enough any more. I\u2019m in a good place.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best part of your job?\n\nFirst we see patients who had what appeared to be impossible problems. They didn\u2019t even know if they\u2019d survive and now eating a hamburger is a delight. Second, when you see a resident struggling with some clinical issue and then you see the look in their eyes when they get it \u2014 the light turned on, something really has clicked. That\u2019s a very good part of the job as well.\n\nDo you still get to do sports dentistry?\n\nI get to help the Athletic Medicine Department take care of athletes. I\u2019ve liked U of M ever since I was a little kid watching Gophers play football. Every day I come walking into this clinic and can\u2019t believe I have the opportunity to work with these great people. \u25a1", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "my job.", "title": "My Job: Dr. Mark Roettger, dentist", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/my-job-dr-mark-roettger-dentist/306482771/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14337704852441.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14337704852441.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "my job.", "title": "My Job: Dr. Mark Roettger, dentist", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/my-job-dr-mark-roettger-dentist/306482771/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14337704852441.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14337704852441.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "my job."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce3d\"", "article_summary": "If you look at mouth guards that are made by dentists, they have improved immensely.\u201dRoettger said new studies have shown that specially designed mouth guards can actually improve performance.\n\u201cI helped him make mouth guards.\u201d During his clinical year in dental school, Roettger returned to working with the Gophers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a really easy job to do.\u201d Custom mouth guards have come a long way in recent decades, Roettger said.\nIn 2007, Roettger sold his practice to devote more time to teaching at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry.\nmy jobAs an undergraduate biology major at the University of Minnesota, Mark Roettger explored ways of combining his interests in sports and medicine."}
