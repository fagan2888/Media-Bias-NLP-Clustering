A World War II veteran is celebrating his 90th birthday by getting the gift of a lifetime.

Horace Carr is a WWII veteran, Purple Heart recipient and Medal of Valor awardee.

He had no idea what to expect on his 90th birthday.

"A lot of this stuff that is going on here, I didn't know it was going to happen."

Carr was celebrating his 90th birthday with his family Saturday when the women of the New Beginning Church in Southport, Florida presented him with the first-ever Bay County "Quilt of Valor."

Pat Brannon, one of the quilters, said, "It's not something that you can put a dollar amount on. It's something that brings comfort. It let's the person know that they are thought of and they are remembered."

In February, Carr was diagnosed with cancer.

"We wanted to have him have something to look forward to and keep him going," his daughter, Carolyn Smith said."

After months of being ill, Carr finally felt like himself again, just in time for his birthday.

"I didn't think i was going to make it, but I am still here," he said.

During the party, Carr was overwhelmed and humbled by everyone's love and support.

"It's very, very nice it makes me want to cry and I don't do that very often, but it's very tempting. I wish that everybody could have a day like this," he said."

The county commissioner also declared November 30th, Horace Carr Senior day in Bay County.
