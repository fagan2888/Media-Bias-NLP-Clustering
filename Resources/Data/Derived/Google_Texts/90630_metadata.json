(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nAt least five federal agencies are weighing whether to withhold funds from North Carolina in response to a recently enacted state law that blocks protections for gay, lesbians and bisexuals, and prohibits transgender individuals from using bathrooms that are not the same as the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\nThe ongoing reviews at the Education, Transportation, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services departments are not yet complete, and it is unclear how much federal money might be involved. But the Obama administration\u2019s decision to scrutinize what White House press secretary Josh Earnest described as \u201cboth policy and legal questions that are raised by the passage of this law\u201d suggests that the measure signed by Gov. Pat McCrory (R) last month could have major implications for his state.\n\nEarnest said that \u201cindividual agencies are undertaking\u201d the review, and the White House had not issued specific guidance on how to proceed. But he emphasized that President Obama said that \u201censuring that individual Americans are not discriminated against because of who they love is something that the president feels strongly about,\u201d and he was not surprised that North Carolina officials \u201care feeling some pressure\u201d on the issue.\n\n\u201cI can just say that, more generally, this administration is committed to defending and even promoting the equal rights of all Americans, including LGBT Americans,\u201d he added.\n\n[Obama\u2019s quiet transgender revolution]\n\nSeveral corporate leaders, as well as senior administration officials and civil rights activists, have criticized the law, which was passed in response to a Charlotte ordinance that would have allowed transgender people to use restrooms that corresponded with their chosen gender identity. The enacted law went further, by establishing a state definition for protected citizens that excludes lesbians, gays and bisexuals.\n\n\u201cIt's shameful the Obama administration would consider using North Carolina children and families as pawns on a political chessboard in an attempt advance their radical political agenda to eliminate sex-specific bathrooms and locker rooms in schools,\" said Ricky Diaz, a spokesman for McCrory\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nSpeaking in Charlotte last week, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, the city\u2019s former mayor, said the measure \u201cisn\u2019t who we are,\u201d and added that his department was reviewing whether it would prompt a loss in agency funds.\n\nThe Transportation Department sends roughly $1 billion to North Carolina a year, while the Education Department provides more than four times that amount.\n\nDavid Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, noted that a host of federal laws \u2014 from Title IX in the Education Amendments of 1972 to the Affordable Care Act and Violence Against Women Act \u2014 have anti-discrimination language that suggests North Carolina could stand to lose funding on a range of fronts.\n\n\u201cThis North Carolina law is a sweeping law that really undercuts significant federal protections, and the federal government has a responsibility to examine what levers they have, and what authority they have, to ensure that transgender residents in North Carolina have the federal protections they\u2019re entitled to,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State could feel more financial pressure for measure that blocks protections", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "State could feel more financial pressure for measure that blocks protections", "title": "Federal agencies review funding to N.C. in wake of new LGBT law", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-agencies-review-funding-to-nc-in-wake-of-new-lgbt-law/2016/04/04/3e222236-faa6-11e5-9140-e61d062438bb_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/04/National-Politics/Images/Obama-0e620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-agencies-review-funding-to-nc-in-wake-of-new-lgbt-law/2016/04/04/3e222236-faa6-11e5-9140-e61d062438bb_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "3e222236-faa6-11e5-9140-e61d062438bb"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis administration is committed to defending and even promoting the equal rights of all Americans, including LGBT Americans,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\u201cThis North Carolina law is a sweeping law that really undercuts significant federal protections, and the federal government has a responsibility to examine what levers they have, and what authority they have, to ensure that transgender residents in North Carolina have the federal protections they\u2019re entitled to,\u201d he said.\nThe Transportation Department sends roughly $1 billion to North Carolina a year, while the Education Department provides more than four times that amount.\nEarnest said that \u201cindividual agencies are undertaking\u201d the review, and the White House had not issued specific guidance on how to proceed.\nThe enacted law went further, by establishing a state definition for protected citizens that excludes lesbians, gays and bisexuals."}
