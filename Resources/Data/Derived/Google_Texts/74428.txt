In a scary scene at Reliant Stadium during the Sunday Night Football game, Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak collapsed heading to the locker room at halftime.

Kubiak never lost consciousness but was taken off the field on a stretcher. He was later taken to a local hospital for what was called "precautionary reasons." NBC reporter Michelle Tafoya said Kubiak was in obvious pain and had trouble opening his eyes. At one point he tried to sit up but had to lay back down. Tafoya added that Kubiak was talking as he was taken off the field.

[UPDATE] According to Michelle Tafoya, the Texans are reporting that Kubiak did not suffer a heart attack.
