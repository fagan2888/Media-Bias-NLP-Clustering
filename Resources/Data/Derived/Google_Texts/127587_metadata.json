A fumbled kickoff return. A punting miscue.\n\nTrey Edmunds and Virginia Tech cashed in on each of those massive Miami blunders, and all of a sudden, the Hokies very much look like a team capable of winning yet another Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division title.\n\nEdmunds ran for four touchdowns, the first three of them set up by Miami mistakes, and Virginia Tech knocked off the 14th-ranked Hurricanes 42-24 on Saturday night, handing Miami its second straight loss.\n\n\u201cWe ran the ball really hard, had some holes to run in . one of our better offensive performances in a while,\u201d Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said. \u201cOn defense, we played well, had a couple long plays. This was a great win for us.\u201d\n\nEdmunds had scoring runs of 10, 2, 4 and 1 yards for the Hokies (7-3, 4-2 ACC). Logan Thomas completed 25 of 31 passes for 366 yards, giving him consecutive games of 300 yards or more for the first time in his Virginia Tech career, and the Hokies dominated in all sorts of categories.\n\nThey outgained Miami 549-352, piled up 26 first downs to Miami\u2019s 12, went 8 for 14 on third downs compared with a 3-for-12 showing by the Hurricanes, and held the ball for nearly a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nMost importantly, every time Miami gave Virginia Tech a gift, the Hokies made them pay. Miami wore new jerseys with the phrase \u201cDeserve Victory\u201d \u2014 a favorite of coach Al Golden\u2019s \u2014 stitched along the collar.\n\n\u201cReally disappointed,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to win.\u201d\n\nStephen Morris completed 16 of 29 passes for 324 yards for Miami (7-2, 3-2), which saw its seven-game home winning streak snapped and still hasn\u2019t beaten Virginia Tech consecutive times since 2001 and 2002. Morris had an 81-yard touchdown pass to Stacy Coley and an 84-yarder to Allen Hurns, but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\n\u201cLike I was telling the team in the locker room, it\u2019s not over for us,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to still work for.\u201d\n\nVirginia Tech held Miami to 28 rushing yards.\n\nThe win turns the ACC\u2019s Coastal Division into a muddled mess, with Georgia Tech at 5-2 in conference play, Virginia Tech a half-game back (but owning the tiebreaker over the Yellow Jackets), Miami and Duke at 3-2, North Carolina at 3-3 and Pittsburgh at 2-3.\n\nFlorida State has already clinched the Atlantic Division title and spot in the ACC title game on Dec. 7.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re back in there,\u201d Beamer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a shot.\u201d\n\nJoshua Stanford (107) and Willie Byrn (105) both had 100-yard receiving nights for Virginia Tech, helping carve a Miami defense that has allowed 1,066 yards in its last two games \u2014 both blowout losses.\n\nWinning games with help of strong special teams play is nothing new for the Hokies. After all, it\u2019s not called \u201cBeamer Ball\u201d for nothing.\n\nBut the Hurricanes were making it too easy for Virginia Tech.\n\nAfter the Hurricanes took a 7-0 lead on the Morris-to-Coley completion, Miami was primed to get the ball back in Virginia Tech territory following a punt. But Coley fumbled it away at the Hokies\u2019 45 \u2014 after getting hit by punter A.J. Hughes, no less. And five plays later, Edmunds scored his first of the night to tie the game.\n\nRain was falling steadily. The mistakes, from the Miami side, started coming at deluge rates.\n\nThe ensuing kickoff was eerily similar to the punt return, with things going from great to dreadful for Miami in the blink of an eye. Artie Burns fumbled the kickoff return near midfield, Edmunds scored five plays later once again, and the Hokies had the lead. It became 21-7 not long after the third Miami blunder, this one coming when punter Pat O\u2019Donnell\u2019s knee was on the ground as he fielded a low snap at the Miami 17.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t let them get 21 points like that,\u201d Golden said. \u201cInexcusable.\u201d\n\nPlaying without running back Duke Johnson, out for the season with a broken right ankle, Miami struggled offensively. Take away the two long touchdown passes, and the Hurricanes managed only 3.7 yards per play the rest of the night.\n\nPlus, the Hokies never made the mistake that Miami would have needed.\n\nVirginia Tech converted on a third-and-17 late in the half, when Stanford made three Hurricanes miss \u2014 two had a chance at him well short of a first down \u2014 on the way to a 32-yard scoring grab that made it 28-14.\n\n\u201cJust thrilled the way we played offensively,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey did a great job after the catch. \u2026 I think every win is a big win but tonight is especially satisfying.\u201d\n\nA third-and-12 play at midfield in the third quarter summed up the night.\n\nVirginia Tech took a time-out to keep Thomas, whose helmet was knocked off on the previous play, on the field. He found a wide-open Willie Byrn for a first down \u2014 and when Miami\u2019s Ladarius Gunter punched the ball away around the 5, it bounded into the end zone, only to be recovered by Demitri Knowles for a 35-17 lead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trey Edmunds had scoring runs of 10, 2, 4 and 1 yards for the Hokies (7-3, 4-2 ACC).
