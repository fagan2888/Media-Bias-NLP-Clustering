Goodman, Ph.D. (\"The Father of Health Savings Accounts.\"\u2014The Wall Street Journal) has written extensively on healthcare policy for more than three decades. Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute, a non-profit research and educational organization that offers non-partisan solutions to important social and economic problems, he is President of the Goodman Institute.\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-bill-to-replace-obamacare-draws-from-independent-institute-book-300274212.html\n\nSOURCE Independent Institute\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.independent.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "california", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "OAKLAND, Calif., May 24", "description": "OAKLAND, Calif., May 24, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- New Bill to Replace Obamacare Draws from Independent Institute Book.", "author": "Independent Institute", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-bill-to-replace-obamacare-draws-from-independent-institute-book-300274212.html", "image": "http://content.prnewswire.com/images/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "OAKLAND, Calif., May 24, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ --\u00a0A book published by the Independent Institute is the...", "title": "New Bill to Replace Obamacare Draws from Independent Institute Book"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "New Bill to Replace Obamacare Draws from Independent Institute Book", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "Independent Institute, california, Federal and State Legislation, Advocacy Group Opinion, Not For Profit, Health Care & Hospitals, Publishing & Information Services, Books, Health Insurance", "date": "2016-05-24T15:41:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"It minimizes and streamlines the role of the federal government and eliminates perverse incentives caused by federal tax and spending policies and unwise regulations.\"\nJohn C.
