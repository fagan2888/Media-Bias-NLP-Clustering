It may seem counterintuitive, but the rise in liberal pride is crucial to liberals building a long-lasting relationship with moderates and cementing a post-Obama leftward trajectory.\n\n\u201cForty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents now identify as both socially liberal and economically moderate or liberal,\u201d Gallup\u2019s Frank Newport announced on Thursday. That\u2019s up eight points since 2008 and 17 points since 2001. Earlier this year, the NBC/Wall Street Journal polling team deduced that 26 percent of voters overall self-identify as \u201cliberal,\u201d a four point spike since 2011. These new numbers are in line with longer-term trends: last year Pew found a 26-point increase since 1994 in \u201cmostly or consistently liberal\u201d Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama suggested he wished to emulate Ronald Reagan in how he \u201cchanged the trajectory of America.\u201d Is this surge of liberal pride evidence that Obama has succeeded in moving the center of American politics leftward? Or has Obama, aided and abetted by the Bernie Sanders road show, unleashed an epidemic of delusion inside America\u2019s deep blue dots?\n\nFormer Bush Administration aide Peter Wehner last month argued in a New York Times op-ed that Obama moved the Democratic Party too far to the left. While acknowledging that the country is more socially liberal, Wehner points to polls showing Republican edges on the economy and foreign policy. He touts Republican election wins for the House, Senate and state governments, staking the claim that \u201cthe Republican Party is the governing party in America\u201d while Obama is falling short of being a \u201cFranklin Delano Roosevelt-like transformational political figure.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s too dismissive of the liberal revival. Anyone can cherry-pick polls to argue that their side is winning the ideological war. Wehner, for instance, notes that \u201c[s]elf-identified conservatives significantly outnumber self-identified liberals.\u201d But that\u2019s not exactly a new development\u2014it has been the case for at least five decades. And focusing on that data point obscures the fact that, according to the NBC/WSJ poll, \u201cconservative\u201d identifiers have tumbled four points since 2014.\n\nJust comparing \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d identification levels leaves out the big kahuna: the \u201cmoderate\u201d plurality. The ultimate question is: are moderates increasingly overlapping with liberals, and moving the country left?\n\nOn one hand, throughout Obama\u2019s presidency less than a quarter of Americans said \u201cthey trust the government in Washington always or most of the time\u201d\u2014ratings that are at historic lows. And Obama\u2019s biggest liberal policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act, has long struggled to attain majority support.\n\nYet whatever misgivings Americans have about governmental effectiveness, they aren\u2019t dampening the desire to have government do more things. This month a CBS/New York Times poll found that 57 percent want \u201cthe government [to] do more to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.\u201d Last year a Pew poll found that 54 percent believe that raising taxes on the wealthy for government programs would help the poor while only 35 percent bought that \u201clowering taxes on wealthy people and corporations in order to encourage more investment and economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe electorate\u2019s internal tug-of-war between distrusting government and wanting more government comes to a head in this muddled Pew finding from February: 49 percent believe \u201cgovernment aid to the poor does more good than harm\u201d and 44 percent believe the opposite. The left retains the edge, but it is slight.\n\nStill, there is little evidence as of yet that moderates are punishing Democrats for moving left. Following the market crash, moderates broke big for Obama. He won them by 21 points against McCain and 15 points against Romney. The conservative poll drops, the solid numbers we see for government action and the lead Hillary Clinton holds in 2016 trial heats all suggest that moderates are not running away from their implicit alliance with the Left, even if other poll numbers remind us that the alliance is tenuous and not unbreakable.\n\nAt minimum, six years of Obama hasn\u2019t soured America on the idea that active government can help solve tough problems. But why have voters, after electing Obama twice, reversed course in the midterms by giving Republicans more power in Congress and in the statehouses?\n\nIt\u2019s best to not read too much into the midterm results. They were typical for a two-term president. As Larry Sabato explained in Politico Magazine, \u201cEvery eight-year presidency has emptied the benches for the triumphant party.\u201d\n\nThis is even true for our \u201ctransformational\u201d presidents. FDR suffered two horrible midterms, the most painful in 1938 when his attempt to purge Democrats of conservatives backfired, leaving him with an anti-New Deal majority that thwarted additional reforms for the rest of his presidency. Ronald Reagan lost Republican control of the Senate in 1986, dooming his chance to drive the Supreme Court farther to the right. (The following year, the Court added who would become a gay rights hero, Anthony Kennedy, after the Democratic majority torpedoed Reagan\u2019s first choice, the consummate conservative Robert Bork.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Democrats are moving left.
