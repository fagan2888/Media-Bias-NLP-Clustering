Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Wednesday that President Obama showed "such little class" during his Tuesday interview with Jon Stewart on "The Daily Show" discussing the Iran nuclear deal, and said Obama's behavior is a good reason why America shouldn't elect Donald Trump as its next president.

"We already have a president now that has no class," Rubio said of Obama on "Fox and Friends." "I mean, we have a president now that does selfie stick videos, that invites YouTube stars there, people that eat cereal out of a bathtub."

The 2016 presidential hopeful spoke a day after Obama used his "Daily Show" appearance to tease critics of the Iran nuclear agreement, and said no one in the IRS was targeting conservative groups after all.

Rubio also took direct shots at fellow 2016 rival Donald Trump, calling the businessman neither "dignified" nor "worthy" of the presidency.
