In fact, it\u2019s not really a close call.\n\nOnly one company on Sunlight\u2019s list of 20 organizations \u201cthat have lobbied the most\u201d on the subject of the Export-Import Bank since 2008 has been critical of the bank\u2019s methods. That would be Delta Airlines, which is not too keen on the bank\u2019s subsidizing of overseas outfits so that they can purchase Boeing planes more cheaply.\n\nCritics in and out of Congress see the 80-year-old Export-Import Bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans, loan guarantees, credit insurance and working capital to support U.S. export sales, as a bastion of corporate cronyism. They want to see its charter expire Sept. 30, rather than be renewed.\n\n>>> Commentary: Shine the Spotlight on the Left\u2019s Corporate Cronyism Agenda\n\nUnlike Delta, which calls for lawmakers to enact \u201creforms\u201d of the federal agency so that it supports manufacturers \u201cwithout damaging the ability of U.S. airlines \u2026 to compete in the global marketplace,\u201d opponents such as the coalition mounted by Americans for Prosperity say it\u2019s time to pull the plug.\n\nConversely, Boeing stands out as Ex-Im\u2019s most ardent supporter. Sunlight\u2019s report notes:\n\nNot surprisingly, the most active lobbying force in favor of the Ex-Im Bank is Boeing, which has always been the largest beneficiary of the bank\u2019s loan guarantees (an estimated 45 percent of the bank\u2019s activity helps Boeing). Boeing has filed 57 reports mentioning the bank, more than twice as many as Delta (27 reports). Boeing also spends more overall on lobbying than Delta. In 2013, Boeing spent $15.2 million on lobbying, while Delta spent $3million.\n\nSunlight acknowledges that the unexpected defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary in Virginia\u2019s 7th District is widely viewed as a major setback for the bank. And Cantor\u2019s incoming replacement as majority leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he will not support reauthorization of the bank.\n\nIn its analysis, however, Sunlight says the lobbying prowess of Ex-Im supporters should not be underestimated:\n\nCertainly, opponents of the Ex-Im bank appear to be gaining a wider audience. But they are up against the lobbying muscle of companies and industries that have been successfully lobbying in the support of the bank for years, and also have millions of dollars in sales at stake. Which means that, barring a remarkable reversal, the Ex-Im Bank will almost certainly be re-authorized once again this year.\n\nThe agency\u2019s critics see the bank\u2019s expansion of taxpayer liabilities as reason enough for it to be denied reauthorization.\n\n\u201cThe Export\u2013Import Bank (Ex\u2013Im) funnels billions of taxpayer dollars each year to overseas businesses for the purchase of American products,\u201d Diane Katz, research fellow in regulatory policy for The Heritage Foundation, writes in a recent paper. She adds:\n\nThis subsidized financing is supposedly a win-win proposition for exporters and their customers abroad. But rare is a subsidy that does not produce disparity elsewhere. In the case of Ex\u2013Im, the losers include domestic companies that are left to compete against foreign firms bankrolled by the U.S. government.\n\n>>> Watch: McCarthy Says Export-Import Bank Should Close\n\nThe bank and its supporters contend that the agency opens international business opportunities for U.S companies that otherwise would not be feasible. And according to the bank\u2019s 2013 report, the bank\u2019s actions benefited American companies and taxpayers.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, the bank \u201csent a record $1.057 billion to the U.S. Treasury in negative subsidy (or profit),\u201d according to the report. It also said the bank \u201chas a successful recovery rate for transactions that enter default (i.e., 50 cents on the dollar since 1992),\u201d adding: \u201cIn the past three years, the bank recovered more money than it paid out in claims.\u201d\n\nSupporters also note Ex-Im received recognition for having higher lender underwriting standards than other export credit agencies that operate in foreign countries. Last year, it was named \u201cBest Global Export Credit Agency\u201d and the \u201cBest ECA in the Americas\u201d by Trade Finance Magazine.\n\nIn May, however, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released updated figures that show the bank will cost U.S. taxpayers $2 billion over the next decade. Ex-Im advocates object to CBO\u2019s methodology, among them Linda Dempsey, vice president of international affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Export-Import Bank isn't as close to losing reauthorization as political developments indicate, a report from the Sunlight Foundation says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Export-Import Bank isn't as close to losing reauthorization as political developments indicate, a report from the Sunlight Foundation says.", "title": "Report: Don\u2019t Underestimate Export-Import Bank\u2019s Corporate Cronies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140619_ExImSunlight_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-23T12:57:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1melvco"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Export-Import Bank isn't as close to losing reauthorization as political developments indicate, a report from the Sunlight Foundation says.", "title": "Report: Don\u2019t Underestimate Export-Import Bank\u2019s Corporate Cronies", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140619_ExImSunlight_Mooney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism,economic freedom,jobs,transportation", "published_time": "2014-06-23T10:17:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T12:57:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c4c\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the conclusion of the Sunlight Foundation, which analyzed the lobbying efforts of the bank\u2019s corporate beneficiaries.\nWhich means that, barring a remarkable reversal, the Ex-Im Bank will almost certainly be re-authorized once again this year.\nOnly one company on Sunlight\u2019s list of 20 organizations \u201cthat have lobbied the most\u201d on the subject of the Export-Import Bank since 2008 has been critical of the bank\u2019s methods.\nAnd according to the bank\u2019s 2013 report, the bank\u2019s actions benefited American companies and taxpayers.\n\u201cThe Export\u2013Import Bank (Ex\u2013Im) funnels billions of taxpayer dollars each year to overseas businesses for the purchase of American products,\u201d Diane Katz, research fellow in regulatory policy for The Heritage Foundation, writes in a recent paper."}
