But closer examination shows it is surprisingly weak.\n\nThe constitutional text provides that a president, unlike other elected officials, must be a \u201cnatural born citizen.\u201d This language could not mean anyone born a citizen or else the text would have simply stated \u201cborn citizen.\u201d The word \u201cnatural\u201d is a limiting qualifier that indicates only some persons who are born citizens qualify. Moreover, when the Constitution was enacted, the word \u201cnatural\u201d meant something not created by statute, as with natural rights or natural law, which instead were part of the common law.\n\nAt common law, \u201cnatural born\u201d meant someone born within the sovereign territory with one narrow exception. The exception was for children of public officials serving abroad, which does not help Cruz because his parents were not serving the United States when he was born in Canada. The case of John McCain was entirely different because he was born in a U.S. territory (the Panama Canal Zone) and to U.S. parents who were serving the U.S. military.\n\nThe argument for Cruz rests on some old statutes, namely English statutes enacted before the U.S. Constitution and U.S. statutes enacted just after. But neither turns out to be persuasive on closer examination.\n\nThe English statutes extended natural-born status to persons born abroad whose father was any English subject, rather than only a public official. Some argue that the constitutional framers meant to refer to this statutory redefinition of the term \u201cnatural born.\u201d But that position contradicts the ordinary meaning that the word \u201cnatural\u201d indicates a non-statutory meaning. Moreover, Prof. Mary McManamon offers convincing evidence that the Framers meant the common law meaning. James Madison himself said in 1789 that the U.S. used the place of birth rather than parentage. In any event, Cruz\u2019s father was not a U.S. citizen when he was born (again unlike McCain), so these English statutes do not help Cruz.\n\nThe U.S. statute in 1790 provided that \u201cchildren of citizens of the United States\u201d that are born abroad \u201cshall be considered as natural born Citizens.\u201d This has been thought the strongest evidence for Cruz\u2019s position since so many 1790 congressmen had participated in the Constitutional Convention. However, this statute did not say these children were natural-born citizens. It instead carefully said they \u201cshall be considered as\u201d natural-born citizens, suggesting that Congress thought they were not natural-born citizens but should be treated as such. Indeed, there would have been no need to pass the statute if they were already understood to be natural-born citizens.\n\nFurther, when this Act was reconsidered in a few years, Madison himself pointed out that Congress only had constitutional authority to naturalize aliens, not U.S. citizens, and reported a bill that amended the statute to eliminate the words \u201cnatural born\u201d and simply state that \u201cthe children of citizens of the United States\u201d born abroad \u201cshall be considered as citizens.\u201d This indicates that Madison\u2019s view was that children born abroad of U.S. citizens were naturally aliens, rather than natural born citizens, and thus could be naturalized by Congressional statute but should not be called \u201cnatural born.\u201d Congress adopted this amendment in 1795.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The closer you study the Constitution, the weaker Ted Cruz's case squares with the actual meaning of \"natural-born\"", "title": "Ted Cruz is not eligible to run for president: A Harvard Law professor close-reads the Constitution", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The closer you study the Constitution, the weaker Ted Cruz's case squares with the actual meaning of \"natural-born\"", "title": "Ted Cruz is not eligible to run for president: A Harvard Law professor close-reads the Constitution", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/20/ted_cruz_is_not_eligible_to_run_for_president_a_harvard_law_professor_close_reads_the_constitution/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ted_cruz_debate2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The closer you study the Constitution, the weaker Ted Cruz's case squares with the actual meaning of \"natural-born\"", "title": "Ted Cruz is not eligible to run for president: A Harvard Law professor close-reads the Constitution", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ted_cruz_debate2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Einer Elhauge", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Can Ted Cruz be president, Can Ted Cruz run for president, constitution, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Natural-born citizen, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Can Ted Cruz be president, Can Ted Cruz run for president, constitution, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Natural-born citizen, Ted Cruz, Business News, Life News, News, Politics NewsThe argument that Ted Cruz is eligible to run for president initially looked strong, then probable but uncertain.\nIt instead carefully said they \u201cshall be considered as\u201d natural-born citizens, suggesting that Congress thought they were not natural-born citizens but should be treated as such.\nAt common law, \u201cnatural born\u201d meant someone born within the sovereign territory with one narrow exception.\nIndeed, there would have been no need to pass the statute if they were already understood to be natural-born citizens.\nThe English statutes extended natural-born status to persons born abroad whose father was any English subject, rather than only a public official."}
