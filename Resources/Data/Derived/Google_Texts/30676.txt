By the end of his presidency, many Americans came to see George W. Bush as in over his head. Mr. Bush faced intense criticism over the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the Great Recession, and of course, he had long been attacked as not smart enough for America’s top job.

During the 2008 campaign to succeed Mr. Bush, the Democratic nominee, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, played on his own reputation as an intellectual to persuade Americans that he would restore competence to the Oval Office.

However, confidence in President Obama’s ability to do the job has steadily eroded since he was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009.

His reputation has been tarnished by problems with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya; the continuing economic struggles; and the fact that more was added to the national debt during Mr. Obama’s first three years than during Mr. Bush’s full eight, among other things.

Consequently, the president has consistently received low approval ratings since his 2012 re-election. In fact, his second-term numbers have been eerily similar to the ones Mr. Bush had during Round 2.

It looks like things just got worse for Mr. Obama.

Respondents to a June 1-3 Fox News poll – which actually was conducted by one Republican polling firm and a Democratic one – were asked whether Mr. Obama is more or less competent than several previous presidents. Interestingly, 48 said he is less competent than Mr. Bush. Forty-two percent said Mr. Obama is more competent, and 7 percent judged the two presidents’ competence equally.

Considering the big fuss candidate Obama made about Mr. Bush’s supposed incompetence, this must be the ultimate indignity for President Obama.
