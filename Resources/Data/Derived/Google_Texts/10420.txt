The Free Beacon’s Ellison Barber went on Fox News’ The Independents on Monday night to discuss Huckabee’s 2016 ambitions and Harvard professors’ complaints about Obamacare.

Barber said that for Huckabee to become a contender, he will have to do better to overcome the fundraising mismatch he faced his last run.

“He had difficulty in 2008–he had difficulty fundraising. That is his main challenge now. He will spend over next few months talking with different fundraisers and donors. That is what he has to do: You need money for ads and ground game,” Barber said.

Barber said she is interested in how Common Core will play in the primary. Huckabee initially supported now-maligned Common Core. This hot-button issue could be problematic for Huckabee with the Tea Party and social conservatives.

The panel also discussed the regrets of many of the Harvard professors that advocated for Obamacare and fundraised for the Obama’s 2012 re-election.

“I saw that happen with unions as well. In Harvard, they complained about the Cadillac tax–you saw unions do that. They helped get it through… there is a great irony you see popping up here and there.”
