Everybody likes to have fun at the holidays, national politicians included. And so our revered senators and congressmen made some quality dad jokes on Twitter Monday morning. They just "get" it — memes, that is!

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie sent out budget deal analysis in #doge style.

Much bipartisanship. Very spending. Wow. #doge http://t.co/ioD2Jwnyp8 — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) December 23, 2013

For those who are not fluent in "doge," he is a Shibe dog that "speaks" with comic fonts and horrible grammar and loves the word wow.

Rep. Steve Stockman's senate campaign also sent out a doge joke about Sen. John Cornyn, but it's not as good. Stockman is running for Cornyn's seat in 2014.

wow. such obamacare funding. oppose ted cruz. pic.twitter.com/bIgXNNpimi — Rep. Steve Stockman (@StockmanSenate) December 23, 2013

Aside from "wow," the words in the photo are just phrases, not doge-isms. Please get it together, Representative. This cool, millennial meme is dead forever now.

Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul has been making the best dad jokes of all — Seinfeld jokes. He performed the traditional Festivus "airing of grievances" on Twitter this morning, using the opportunity to complain about the budget deal and the Fed. LOL!

He also mentioned cafeteria food and his beloved turtlenecks, just to let you know he's real.

The Senate cafeteria never has burgoo. — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013

Finally, he called out Sen. Cory Booker. Don't worry, Booker "gets" it, too.

U, me & "feats of strength:" Senate floor, name the time MT @SenRandPaul A Festivus grievance re bipartisanship. Booker doesn't RT me enough — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) December 23, 2013

This kind of Twitter banter isn't new for Paul and Booker — both are active on the site and play to young fan bases of libertarians and liberals, respectively. Stockman and Massie are stretching themselves by comparison. And Paul's ribbing may just lead to bipartisan legislation on marijuana:

I know. U told me last week. Here is to a 2014 where we take on the failed war on drugs RT @SenRandPaul: I'm the Senate author of Hemp bill! — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) December 23, 2013

Looks like Booker and Paul found common ground — through lulz! Much win!
