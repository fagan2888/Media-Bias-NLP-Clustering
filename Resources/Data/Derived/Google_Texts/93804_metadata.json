We have to work together and come together as people and have dialogue to make our community stronger.\u201d\n\nThe Tucson Indian Center was founded by 16 individuals who wanted their own organization to provide services for education, housing, health, counseling and recreation for urban Native Americans in Tucson.\n\nIn 1957, the group formed a club and in 1963, the club became incorporated as the American Indian Association, doing business as the Tucson Indian Center, according to the organization's website.\n\nThe original board members were Carlos Antone, Louis Blackwater, Nellie Cachora, Augustine Chico, Andrew Duwyenie, Annie Enos, Hazel Herald, Jim Herald, Lillian Hughes, Mollie Manuel, John B. Narcho, Ray Narcho, Lucille Palimo, Anita Rowles, Ella G. Rumley and David Valenzuela.\n\n\u201cThere are four Tucson Indian Center board members today and three with ties back to the original founding members,\u201d said Palimo (Tohono O\u2019odham), whose grandmother is Lucille Palimo.\n\nPalimo and Bernal both believe one of the reasons the Center has been able to survive is due to the strength of the board, staff and community.\n\n\u201cThe Indian elders had this incredible vision fighting for civil rights before we had a name for it, recognizing Indians can work with Indians and non-Indians,\u201d said Bernal (Chemehuevi). \u201cI think they were so ahead of their time they basically were filled with historical stress and trauma but that didn\u2019t stop them from reaching out to work together.\u201d\n\nBernal said the longevity of the board and staff has also been a key to the success of the center. Tucson Indian Center currently has 20 staff members, one of which is celebrating 37 years of service at the center this year. Bernal has been with the center for 23 years and one of Palimo\u2019s first jobs was working for the Tucson Indian Center in 1976 as a job developer.\n\n\u201cWhen people walk in the door they have a sense of community and family,\u201d Palimo said. \u201cThere\u2019s community involvement and appreciation of the success the center has achieved.\u201d\n\nBernal and Palimo both admit the Tucson Indian Center has endeared some hard times over the years but they were able to bounce back.\n\n\u201cNo doubt we have gone through times where staff had to be laid off but we\u2019ve found other resources,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cAt certain times it was the board\u2019s responsibility to fill those gaps and we\u2019ve been fortunate recently that we haven\u2019t been in those situations we are more solid financially now.\u201d\n\nBetween celebrations, Tucson Indian Center has begun turning the page to look at the next 50 years. Bernal said the board is looking at a permanent land base, a museum, gift shop, performance area, a kitchen to feed people in other words a physical presence where people can say, \u201cThat is the Tucson Indian Center.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think my grandmother would be very proud of how successful the organization has become not just locally but how strong and well known the organization has become across the nation,\u201d Palimo said. \u201cAs well as the relationships with other organization, I feel she would be proud of the center as a whole.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the Tucson Indian Center visit www.ticenter.org or call 520-884-7131.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 50 years, the Tucson Indian Center is still carrying on the mission of its founders in Southern Arizona.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/13/tucson-indian-center-celebrates-50-years-service-152697", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tucson_indian_center_staff_1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Tucson Indian Center Celebrates 50 Years of Service"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-13T12:12-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/13/tucson-indian-center-celebrates-50-years-service-152697", "dc": {"title": "Tucson Indian Center Celebrates 50 Years of Service"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Tucson Indian Center Celebrates 50 Years of Service"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d72\"", "article_summary": "After 50 years, the Tucson Indian Center is still carrying on the mission of its founders in Southern Arizona.\nTucson Indian Center currently has 20 staff members, one of which is celebrating 37 years of service at the center this year.\nInstead of having one big celebration, the Tucson Indian Center decided to have a series of events throughout the year to celebrate their success.\nIn 1957, the group formed a club and in 1963, the club became incorporated as the American Indian Association, doing business as the Tucson Indian Center, according to the organization's website.\nBernal has been with the center for 23 years and one of Palimo\u2019s first jobs was working for the Tucson Indian Center in 1976 as a job developer."}
