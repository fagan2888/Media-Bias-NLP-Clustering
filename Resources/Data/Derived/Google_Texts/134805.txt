“Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered.” — Actress Nina Dobrev, promoting Obamacare with a topless photo in October. Actress goes topless for Obamacare

Well, here’s one way to get attention. Actress Nina Dobrev posted a topless photo of herself on Instagram on Thursday to show her support for Obamacare.

The “Vampire Diaries” star isn’t wearing a shirt in the picture, but she is holding a cardboard sign that reads “#GetCovered” in front of her chest.

In the caption, Dobrev wrote: “Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered ,Because w/o it, youre naked.”

While her approach is certainly unique, Dobrev joins a long list of stars promoting Obamacare on Twitter. Lady Gaga, John Legend, Amy Poehler and Olivia Wilde have all recently tweeted their support.
