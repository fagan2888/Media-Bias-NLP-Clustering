While advocates promised that the design of new insurance markets would transform the way consumers buy health insurance, critics warned that the new market would never succeed. Reed Abelson and Margot Sanger-Katz have had front-row seats to the debate, and the two reporters took a few minutes to discuss when \u2014 and if \u2014 the market would stabilize.\n\nMargot: It\u2019s been a few weeks of bad news about the Obamacare marketplaces. On Friday, we learned that UnitedHealth has decided to pull out of Obamacare marketplaces in two states. The week before, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association put out a paper offering not-too-subtle hints that some members were losing money. Reed, you wrote recently about how surprising stasis in the employer insurance market means we can look forward to much smaller Obamacare marketplaces than most people expected when the health law passed. And the parade of struggling start-up insurer companies has extended to Maine\u2019s Community Health Options, one of the co-ops that had long been held up as one of the most successful. Health insurers need to submit their rates to regulators in the next few weeks \u2014 or decide to exit markets. Should we be worried about a health insurance apocalypse?\n\nReed: I think people have a tendency to catastrophize, especially when it comes to Obamacare. UnitedHealth, which is one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, has only reluctantly embraced the new market, and the company is always held up as an example of why the sky is falling and why Obamacare is going to crash and burn: If United can\u2019t make it, no one can.\n\nUnited has only a small fraction of the individual market, but some of the Blues are also struggling. What is most troubling is the fact that many insurers are losing money. You may not sympathize much with the insurance companies \u2014 and no one does \u2014 but they have to make enough money to pay claims. Do you think those losses are temporary \u2014 or a sign that the market is fundamentally unstable and potentially unsustainable?\n\nMargot: I think some of both. It seems clear that some insurers just made pricing mistakes. I\u2019d include a lot of the nonprofit co-op plans that have gone belly up in that category. United may fall in that category, too, in some places. That doesn\u2019t seem to me like a permanent problem. If everyone priced too low, they can just raise their prices in future years, and it\u2019ll be O.K. That\u2019s not great for middle-class people who pay their own premiums, but most people in the exchanges won\u2019t notice a difference because of the way the subsidies work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese markets also turned out to be more complicated than some insurers expected. Some regulatory choices didn\u2019t go their way. And it does look as if more customers than you might expect are staying enrolled in plans for only part of the year, which makes it hard for the insurers to collect premiums. But I think they\u2019ll probably figure it out.\n\nReed: But isn\u2019t it a vicious cycle? The big players won\u2019t stay in markets unless they can attract enough customers to make it worth their while. Those who say Obamacare is doomed argue that the premiums are just too high for people who don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy. If you are insured and relatively healthy, you may not feel as if the coverage is a good deal. The deductibles are steep, meaning you end up paying for a lot of your care before you see the first dollar of coverage, and you can\u2019t always see your choice of doctor.\n\nThe result is that the market could be too small and therefore too volatile to attract mainstream insurers like United.\n\nHow do you solve that?\n\nMargot: Well, it seems clear that you need some competition in every market to keep prices low. But maybe we don\u2019t need the big carriers to play everywhere. As you noted, United barely showed up in the exchanges in the first place, and customers in most markets still have a lot of choices. The Medicaid-managed care plans seem to be having some success in this market, so maybe they will be a big part of the exchange mix.\n\nI also think it\u2019s worth looking at the states where things are going well and the insurers are making money: California, Vermont, Washington. Those state exchanges made some different regulatory choices early on that got more people into the new markets right away, so their markets stabilized more quickly.\n\nReed: You\u2019re right that you may not need the established players for the market to work. The market may not look the way we thought it would, with the same insurers and same characteristics as the employer market. But one of the reasons insurers are leaving is because of the market\u2019s instability. There\u2019s tremendous churn in this market, with most people switching plans every year to try to find a cheaper alternative.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I know what the business model is for an insurer, if the expectation is that you\u2019re going to keep your customers for only a year. It makes achieving long-term goals like keeping people healthier and focusing on preventive measures much harder because there may be no payoff for the insurer.\n\nMargot: Yes, I think this is one of the contradictions of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s design. The whole idea was that competition between the insurance companies would help to hold down prices, the way it does for, say, electronics or groceries. In order for that system to work, you need people to actually switch plans if their plan starts charging more than the competition. The fact that people are actually switching seems like a sign that this market is functioning as it was designed. But as you point out, all that churn sure makes it hard for an insurer to make money by investing in its customers\u2019 long-term health. But the individual market, pre-Obamacare, also had a lot of churn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReed: Yes, there\u2019s always been churn, but the insurers got pretty good at figuring out which people they wanted to insure by turning away the people who were most likely to cost them the most money. They definitely figured out how to make money.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to smooth all of this out if you insure more people. Do you think there\u2019s opportunity to see the market increase in size? I know insurers in the early years suffered when some states allowed people to keep their existing plans. Those plans that were grandmothered, as it is called.\n\nMargot: My sense from talking to folks in the industry is that the grandmothered plans really wrecked their early calculations. The Obama administration, responding to a political freakout about people whose plans were getting canceled in 2014, let states keep them for a few more years. The result was that healthy people tended to hold onto their old, cheaper plans, while sick people went to the exchanges. You can see how that might make the exchange market unprofitable for new entrants.\n\nI do think the market size is a bit of a chicken-or-egg question. Your story last week on stability in the employer market did such a good job of laying this out. Everyone (including the Congressional Budget Office) expected that employers would start dropping coverage once the marketplaces were up and running. That didn\u2019t happen. It means that Obamacare has been much less disruptive to the status quo than many people thought. But it also means that the exchange markets are smaller and probably more expensive than people thought, too. If prices keep going up, maybe they\u2019ll never grow much. It certainly seems like everyone is cutting down their long-term estimates for exchange enrollment.\n\nReed: The other possibility would be to expand the pool of people who qualify for subsidies.
