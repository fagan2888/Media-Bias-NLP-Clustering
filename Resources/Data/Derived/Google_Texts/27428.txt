Opening statements are scheduled to begin in the civil trial between pro wrestler Hulk Hogan and a popular news website.

Proceedings will start Monday morning in a St. Petersburg courtroom.

Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, is suing Gawker for $100 million for publishing a sex tape of him and the wife of a Tampa radio personality.

A six-member jury will determine if Gawker violated Hogan's right to privacy when it published the video of the former professional wrestler having sex with his best friend's wife. Hogan's attorneys say it garnered 7 million views.

Hogan says the video was made without his knowledge.

Gawker says the publication was a legitimate scoop because Hogan had talked openly about his sex life before, in forums such as Howard Stern's radio show.
