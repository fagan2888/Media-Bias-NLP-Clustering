They recorded a video as their folk musician alter egos while waiting out the strike by the Writers Guild of America, and eventually developed a cult following.\n\nFans of the CBS sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d will recognize Ms. Lindhome as the graduate student infatuated with Sheldon Cooper in a 2008 episode and Ms. Micucci as the ultra-shy girlfriend of Rajesh \u201cRaj\u201d Koothrappali in a seven-episode run in 2013. Both parts are memorable due to the skill each actor used to keep their characters neuroses just short of full-fledged crazy.\n\nEach actor has plenty of other credits, such as \u201cNew Girl\u201d and \u201cHell Baby\u201d for Ms. Lindhome and \u201cScrubs\u201d and \u201cRaising Hope\u201d for Ms. Micucci. Their comedic chops plus the natural chemistry between the two pay off in their understated sitcom.\n\n\u201cGarfunkel and Oates\u201d premiered Aug. 7 with an episode full of slightly off-color silliness that included Ms. Lindome making private information about her boyfriend public and then having the tables turned on her. That episode also featured Ms. Micucci auditioning for a promiscuous role opposite Sir Ben Kingsley.\n\nThe second episode found the duo facing their sex video doppelgangers \u201cGarfinger and Butts,\u201d who form their own folk duo and quickly outpace the success of the originals. Don\u2019t miss real-life rocker John Oates in a low-key and funny role as the porn shop clerk who sells the real-life duo the porn video made by the wannabe pair.\n\nAlthough the show sounds ultra racy, it\u2019s really no more adult than \u201cPortlandia\u201d or many other shows that air on major networks. It\u2019s not fun for the whole family, but it\u2019s certainly appropriate for high school seniors or college age kids.\n\nOne caution: The two played such memorable characters on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d that it might take a minute for viewers to reconcile their new roles. Neither is as ready to go over-the-top as they appeared on that comedy. Here they are both underdogs, but with a charming sweetness. The difference is in their attitudes about life. Ms. Lindhome has a razor sharp, feet-on-the-ground attitude, while her cohort is full of childlike optimism as they sing about pregnancy, social boundaries and same-sex unions.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss the songs from this show as mere background for a sitcom. That would be a mistake. \u201cPresent Face,\u201d about insincere people, and \u201cGood as You,\u201d about same-sex unions, are heartfelt and endearing, if just a touch too saccharine to likely make it onto many play lists. (But considering the popularity of Pharrell\u2019s song \u201cHappy,\u201d that assessment could be way off base.)\n\nJudge for yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re behind in viewing it, just go the IFC website where you have plenty of free videos and episodes that will bring you right up to speed.\n\nBut beware: \u201cGarfunkel and Oates\u201d is addictive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Garfunkel and Oates\" is one of those under-the-radar comedies that viewers likely will stumble upon and then make a regular part of their viewing schedule because it's realistic yet charming.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u2018Garfunkel and Oates\u201d is one of those under-the-radar comedies that viewers likely will stumble upon and then make a regular part of their viewing schedule because it\u2019s realistic yet charming.", "title": "\u2018Garfunkel and Oates\u2019 pair brings sweet cynicism", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/24/garfunkel-and-oates-pair-brings-sweet-cynicism/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/24/8_242014_ap8662111993628201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/24/8_242014_ap8662111993628201.jpg", "description": "'Garfunkel and Oates\" is one of those under-the-radar comedies that viewers likely will stumble upon and then make a regular part of their viewing schedule because it's realistic yet charming.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Garfunkel and Oates\u2019 pair brings sweet cynicism"}, "Author": "Nancy Dunham  -  Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, John Oates, Riki Lindhome, Kate Micucci"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf1b\"", "article_summary": "Each actor has plenty of other credits, such as \u201cNew Girl\u201d and \u201cHell Baby\u201d for Ms. Lindhome and \u201cScrubs\u201d and \u201cRaising Hope\u201d for Ms. Micucci.\nThe creators and stars of this show \u2014 Riki Lindhome, 35, and Kate Micucci, 34 \u2014 first introduced the guitar \u2014 and ukulele-playing Garfunkel and Oates in 2007.\nMs. Lindhome has a razor sharp, feet-on-the-ground attitude, while her cohort is full of childlike optimism as they sing about pregnancy, social boundaries and same-sex unions.\nThat episode also featured Ms. Micucci auditioning for a promiscuous role opposite Sir Ben Kingsley.\nBut beware: \u201cGarfunkel and Oates\u201d is addictive."}
