Christie: Paul is wrong on data collection

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says Sen. Rand Paul’s views on the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures are not only “wrong” but also would make America “weaker and more vulnerable.”

“He’s politicizing America’s national security,” Christie said of Paul on “Fox News Sunday.”

Christie, who like Paul is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said he has no idea whether the Kentucky senator’s ideas are real but that he does know Paul has used them to raise money. “It’s wrong, and his position is wrong,” Christie said.

Paul wouldn’t know his position was incorrect because he’s never had to use it, Christie suggested. His rival, he said, should be using his position to create more critical congressional oversight, and the Justice Department should be prosecuting people in the intelligence community who go too far.

The governor said during his time as a federal prosecutor he put terrorists in jail.

“I can tell the American people you can do this and you can do it well,” Christie said, “and if I’m president, that’s the kind of attorney general I’ll appoint and that’s the type of folks that I will put into my government to make sure that they’re done — protecting civil liberties but protecting the homeland first and foremost.”
