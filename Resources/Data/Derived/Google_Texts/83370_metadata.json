Now a student in Berkeley\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism, Fisher spent the summer of 2013 in Tucson, Ariz., reporting on Operation Streamline, a federal program under which hundreds of thousands of migrant workers have gotten a dose of assembly-line U.S. \u201cjustice\u201d\u2014 and jail terms of up to 180 days \u2014 before being deported with criminal records.\n\nSusan Fang, a San Francisco native studying to become a physician in the UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program, worked this summer to help organize low-income Chinese immigrants to defend San Francisco\u2019s Health Care Security Ordinance. The 2007 law, she says, makes health care accessible to residents who are not eligible for the federal Affordable Care Act, or who would continue to have difficulty obtaining coverage \u2014 such as undocumented immigrants \u2014 but has come under renewed attack from business interests.\n\nAnd Leah Jacobs, a doctoral student in social work at Berkeley, conducted in-depth interviews with people with mental illnesses who have been in and out of San Francisco County Jail, intending to add their voices, and stories, to the quantitative research on what she calls \u201cthis dually stigmatized population.\u201d\n\nFisher, Fang and Jacobs are three of 17 students from six UC campuses who fanned out across the globe this summer under the auspices of Berkeley\u2019s Human Rights Center, which every year sponsors UC students to work with human-rights organizations around the world and, increasingly, here in the United States.\n\nHuman Rights conference The UC Human Rights Fellowship Conference, \u201cHuman Rights Lessons from the Frontlines,\u201d is set for Friday, Nov. 8, from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. at International House. For information, see the Human Rights Center website or call (510) 642-0965.\n\nFriday, on the eve of the center\u2019s 20th anniversary, the cohort will report on their experiences at the UC Human Rights Fellowship Conference, which this year \u2014 the 19th of the center\u2019s flagship program \u2014 will combine short presentations with panel discussions throughout the afternoon. The center, now part of Berkeley Law, receives major support for the program from biotech pioneer Thomas White, a Peace Corps veteran who earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry at Berkeley in 1976.\n\n\u201cOne intention of the program,\u201d explains the center\u2019s Andrea Lampros, \u201cis to tap the energy and expertise of our amazing students at UC Berkeley, and now also across the UC system, to support human-rights organizations around the world.\u201d\n\nSince 1994, when the program began, 244 fellows have researched, witnessed and reported on human-rights issues in 65 different countries. This year alone, students deployed to Canada, Uganda, India, Malaysia, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia \u2014 among other places in need \u2014 to address problems facing such populations as First Nations (Canada), child refugees (Malaysia), orphans and HIV-positive youth (Uganda) and transgender youth and adolescents (San Francisco).\n\nSeven of Berkeley\u2019s 2013 fellows worked in the United States, a reflection of not only their own interests \u2014 personal, academic and professional \u2014 but of a pressing need on the part of largely powerless communities, even in progressive San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an activist. That\u2019s how I see myself,\u201d says Fang. \u201cAnd however I can be an activist, wherever I am, I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d\n\nFang has worked before with the Chinese Progressive Association, sometimes going door-to-door to talk with immigrants. This summer she helped the organization by spreading the word about the importance of the local health ordinance. She also helped mobilize community members to attend hearings on the law, which, ironically, now faces an existential threat from the less inclusive Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that business interests are saying healthcare reform is coming around, so we don\u2019t need the local law,\u201d explains Fang, who provided care to her father, a Medi-Cal patient who died of cancer, when she was younger.\n\nThe obstacles to adequate health care in the city\u2019s low-income Chinese-immigrant community, she says, \u201care very real for me. Those stories could be me.\u201d\n\nJacobs, too, had a personal as well as professional stake in her fellowship project, an effort to flesh out the literature on individuals with mental illness and involvement in the correctional system by gathering human, first-person narratives. In collaboration with Citywide Forensic Case Management, a UCSF-affiliated service provider to that population in San Francisco, Jacobs conducted 19 interviews \u2014 with more to come \u2014 to capture their own perceptions and experiences, with an eye to easing the stresses and strains of community re-entry.\n\n\u201cI initially became interested in this project, and working with Citywide, because I\u2019m the child of an incarcerated person,\u201d she says. As a scholar, she adds, \u201cI\u2019m interested in the disproportionate representation of people with mental illnesses in jails and prisons,\u201d whose numbers are estimated at up to 1 million nationwide.\n\n\u201cIf I were a quantitative researcher and just looked at this person\u2019s arrest, it wouldn\u2019t look like anything that\u2019s connected to their mental illness,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the fact that this person has been institutionalized and disconnected from things that help keep us out of jail \u2014 like being able to have a family, having a support network and being able to handle average life stressors \u2014 that is connected to their mental illness.\u201d\n\nFisher, an immigration reporter who first learned about Operation Streamline on a visit to Tucson, returned as a Human Rights Center fellow \u2014 in partnership with the ACLU of Arizona \u2014 to delve deeper into the program, observing court proceedings and speaking with people picked up by the Border Patrol near Nogales, Mexico.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re exhausted, they\u2019ve just got off the desert, some of the most dangerous territory on the entire border. Days without water and food,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re in a courtroom with chains on their hands and feet.\u201d Brought before a judge in groups of seven \u2014 for hearings that last only a few minutes \u2014 the defendants face near-certain jail time and, once they\u2019re released, deportation.\n\nOne construction worker he met, Fisher says, had come to the United States when he was 12. Now 24 and supporting a wife and child, he was caught attempting to cross the U.S. border after being deported from Nevada.\n\n\u201cInstead,\u201d Fisher says, \u201che\u2019s sucked into this vacuum which is Operation Streamline, and given a criminal record.\u201d And notwithstanding supporters\u2019 claims that the program effectively deters illegal immigration, Fisher says having a record gives migrant workers \u201cno alternative but to return as undocumented.\u201d\n\nFor Fang, who believes \u201caccess to health care is a human right,\u201d her summer experience has \u201creaffirmed my commitment to social justice,\u201d a commitment she plans to continue after she gets her medical degree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy, in a big institution like Berkeley, to become tunnel-visioned,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fellowship helped reopen the windows and the doors to who I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these people change you,\u201d adds Jacobs, describing not just her own experience but likely those of hundreds of UC students who have taken part in the fellowship program over the past two decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they gave me a voice,\u201d she says, referring to people she met who, in many cases, remain in jail only because the city has no place for them to go. \u201cNow I just have to do my best to honor their voices.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Berkeley News", "description": "In 2013, Human Rights Center fellows \u2014 17 students from six UC campuses \u2014 deployed to Uganda, Bolivia and other places in need, to address problems facing such populations as First Nations, child r\u2026", "title": "Giving voice to the powerless, students find their own", "url": "http://news.berkeley.edu/2013/11/05/hrc-fellows-2013/", "image": {"width": 410, "identifier": "http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/hrc410.jpg", "height": 275}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T20:58:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9d4\"", "article_summary": "Human Rights conference The UC Human Rights Fellowship Conference, \u201cHuman Rights Lessons from the Frontlines,\u201d is set for Friday, Nov. 8, from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. at International House.\nFor information, see the Human Rights Center website or call (510) 642-0965.\nThe obstacles to adequate health care in the city\u2019s low-income Chinese-immigrant community, she says, \u201care very real for me.\n\u201cI initially became interested in this project, and working with Citywide, because I\u2019m the child of an incarcerated person,\u201d she says.\nThis summer she helped the organization by spreading the word about the importance of the local health ordinance."}
