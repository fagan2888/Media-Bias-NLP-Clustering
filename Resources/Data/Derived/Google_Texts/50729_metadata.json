But we have a sneaky suspicion that the court's decision isn't all bad news for GOP candidates with their eyes on the White House. For one, it allows them to keep up the drumbeat for a full repeal of the law, which will energize the base (In the latest NBC/WSJ poll, a majority of GOP primary voters - 55 percent - said that the law should be \"totally eliminated,\" and an additional 36 percent said it needs a \"major overhaul.\") And they can make a big-picture argument that a Republican-held White House really is the only way to ensure the end of Obamacare, which remains relatively unpopular with independents, too. (A combined 56 percent of indies say that the law should be gutted or dramatically changed, and just eight percent of ALL Americans say they think it's working well as it is.)\n\nThe other advantage is they can continue to lambast the law without the immediate need to craft a legislative replacement, or at least figure out what to do about 6.4 million Americans who would have been effectively kicked off their health insurance plans. The candidates who are talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare are going to be under pressure to present a tangible alternative. But at least now they can avoid getting hit with ads featuring Americans who can no longer afford care after losing their subsidies.\n\nPOPPING ON NBC POLITICS\n\nNBC's Pete Williams explains the Supreme Court's rejection today of a challenge to the Obamacare law involving federal subsidies for health insurance.\n\nNBC's Perry Bacon looks at the next steps for the Republican party after today's ruling.\n\nGOP 2016 candidates are vowing that the fight against Obamacare isn't over.\n\nNBC's Mark Murray explains how the Supreme Court handed both Obama and the GOP a victory.\n\nNBC's Kelly O'Donnell writes that Chris Christie is poised to announce his presidential run on June 30.\n\nUnivision is ending its relationship with the Miss Universe organization over comments about Mexico made by Donald Trump.\n\nCAMPAIGN QUICK READS\n\nCLINTON: POLITICO writes that hedge-fund billionaire Daniel Loeb deleted a joke about Hillary Clinton's sexuality from his Facebook page.\n\nJINDAL: \"Louisiana Gov.
