But a battle in the FCC about its new open Internet rules has spurred disagreement about how much regulation is needed to enforce those rules.\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is expected to unveil new proposed rules next month that would treat the Internet with regulations similar to traditional telephones, a plan President Obama and other advocates have supported.\n\nBut Republicans and service providers have opposed the regulatory framework, saying the outdated, utility-style regulations would stifle innovation and potentially lead to higher fees for consumers.\n\nRepublicans recently floated a draft proposal in Congress as an alternate path forward and are holding back-to-back hearings on it Wednesday.\n\nThe poll did not ask about which authority should be used to enforce net neutrality rules.\n\nLast November, Obama called on the FCC to use the strongest authority possible to enforce the rules. Republicans came out quickly against his recommendations, with Sen. Ted Cruz Ted CruzEleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo MORE (R-Texas) calling the framework \"ObamaCare for the Internet.\"\n\nThe poll found 39 percent of people said they were less likely to support Obama's recommendation after Cruz's statement \u2014 including 49 percent of Republicans. Another 28 percent said they were more likely, while 33 percent said Cruz's words had no impact.\n\nThe poll surveyed 868 voters from Jan. 13-14 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Service providers have long maintained they are committed to the principles of net neutrality.", "description": "Service providers have long maintained they are committed to the principles of net neutrality.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Service providers have long maintained they are committed to the principles of net neutrality.", "title": "Poll: Voters support broad concept of net neutrality", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/230226-poll-voters-support-broad-concept-of-net-neutrality", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/230226-poll-voters-support-broad-concept-of-net-neutrality", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-21T10:31-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-21T10:31:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "keywords": "Net neutrality, poll,Ted Cruz,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/230226-poll-voters-support-broad-concept-of-net-neutrality", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Service providers have long maintained they are committed to the principles of net neutrality.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: Voters support broad concept of net neutrality"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll: Voters support broad concept of net neutrality"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea1b\"", "article_summary": "More than eight in 10 people agree with the broad concept of net neutrality, according to an automated poll released Wednesday.\nThe poll did not ask about which authority should be used to enforce net neutrality rules.\nService providers have long maintained they are committed to the principles of net neutrality \u2014 that no Internet traffic should receive preferential treatment.\nBut a battle in the FCC about its new open Internet rules has spurred disagreement about how much regulation is needed to enforce those rules.\nThe poll surveyed 868 voters from Jan. 13-14 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent."}
