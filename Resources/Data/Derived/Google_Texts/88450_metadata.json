We\u2019re not closing the health department but we are having to step away from some of the programs we were providing when other people weren\u2019t providing them.\u201d\n\nPasadena is one of only three cities in the state with its own public health department. The department\u2019s clinics serve the under- and uninsured both throughout Pasadena and the region.\n\nPasadena resident Joyce Spencer in a letter to the editor questioned the cuts and the lack of discussion so far.\n\n\u201cThe decimation of this valuable city department seems to be happening very secretively,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe said the cuts and layoffs would \u201cseverely\u201d undermine an inexpensive and grant-funded service that addresses community needs.\n\nThe public will get a chance to address the proposal on June 1, when it\u2019s expected to be presented to the council.\n\nThe proposed cuts largely come in response to the Affordable Care Act, as more people having access to insurance means fewer people who need the department\u2019s services, Mermell said. The expansion of the country\u2019s health care system has also led to the rise of new clinics that can better and more efficiently serve the clients the health department treated previously, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are now able to move onto insurance, which we don\u2019t take, so they can go get coverage elsewhere, which is good for them, but it shrinks our market share,\u201d he said. \u201cThe services we provided made sense at the time, they don\u2019t make sense anymore.\u201d\n\nThe cuts would drop the department\u2019s budget from $16 million to around $11 million, Mermell said. About 37 people could lose their jobs.\n\nMermell said the city is working to move some of those people to different departments, to other vacant positions in the health department and to clinics that partner with the city.\n\nThe health department has already stopped accepting new clients at its pre-natal clinic to avoid having the women switch to a new provider late in their pregnancy. That clinic could close in December to the existing clients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city wants to transition its pre-natal clinic to the Community Health Alliance of Pasadena next door, which is expanding its own services in response to the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019re hoping to find a partnership either with CHAP or another agency for the HIV/AIDS clinic as well, Mermell said.\n\nCouncilman John Kennedy said residents have expectations of the types of services that the department provides, but that those may need to be refined.\n\n\u201cThose are only proposed cuts and they will have a full hearing and debate at the council level, before anything is actually done,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThat will give the residents and the voters of Pasadena an opportunity to provide their testimony, input and recommendations through our deliberative process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PASADENA >> Employees at the Pasadena Health Department might be muttering \u201cthanks Obama\u201d after a proposed budget cut spurred by the Affordable Care Act aims to slash $4 million from the department\u2019s budget by eliminating se", "title": "Proposed budget cut to Pasadena Health Department would eliminate clinics, 37 people", "og": {"url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/government-and-politics/20150509/proposed-budget-cut-to-pasadena-health-department-would-eliminate-clinics-37-people", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.pasadenastarnews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/pasadenastarnews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Proposed budget cut to Pasadena Health Department would eliminate clinics, 37 people"}, "twitter": {"domain": "pasadenastarnews.com", "description": "PASADENA >> Employees at the Pasadena Health Department might be muttering \u201cthanks Obama\u201d after a proposed budget cut spurred by the Affordable Care Act aims to slash $4 million from the department\u2019s budget by eliminating se", "title": "Proposed budget cut to Pasadena Health Department would eliminate clinics, 37 people", "url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/government-and-politics/20150509/proposed-budget-cut-to-pasadena-health-department-would-eliminate-clinics-37-people", "image": {"src": "http://local.pasadenastarnews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/pasadenastarnews.png?052016"}, "site": "@PasStarNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563965297", "iphone": "id503656700", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.pasadenastarnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "pasadena, Local governments", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "pasadena, Local governments"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re not closing the health department but we are having to step away from some of the programs we were providing when other people weren\u2019t providing them.\u201dPasadena is one of only three cities in the state with its own public health department.\n\u201cThose are only proposed cuts and they will have a full hearing and debate at the council level, before anything is actually done,\u201d he stressed.\nUnder the proposed budget, the department\u2019s pre-natal and HIV clinics would close permanently, according to Assistant City Manager Steve Mermell.\nThe department\u2019s clinics serve the under- and uninsured both throughout Pasadena and the region.\nPASADENA >> Employees at the Pasadena Health Department might be muttering \u201cthanks Obama\u201d after a proposed budget cut spurred by the Affordable Care Act aims to slash $4 million from the department\u2019s budget by eliminating services and 66 positions, about half of which are already vacant."}
