A Valley teenager is accused of shooting and killing a man with a gun he thought was unloaded, and police said he made up a story to try to cover it up.

“He didn't deserve to die,” said Catarina Mendoza, who knew the victim.

Mendoza is heartbroken.

“He didn't deserve it. He was meant to spread love in this world, that's what he was good at,” she said.

Mendoza said she learned this while dating Gage Bodenheimer.

“He was good. He was a good person,” said Mendoza. "He was so loving."

Shock, disbelief, pain all emotions Mendoza has been feeling like many of Bodenheimer's other friend after learning he was shot and killed Thursday.

“It’s really saddening," said Ryan Sefton, who said he went to school with Bodenheimer.

“I didn't even believe it at first. It's hard to imagine something that close happening," said Sefton.

“It was a stupid joke that could have been avoided that took his life,” said Mendoza.

Detectives said Nathaniel Thomas shot Bodenheimer in the head while he was sleeping in Thomas’s apartment.

Police said Thomas, who regularly carries a gun, pulled the trigger believing the gun was unloaded, and when the gun went off, detectives said Thomas called 911 to say he had shot an intruder, but police said after talking to witnesses and looking at evidence, they found out the intruder story wasn't true.

“It angers me very much because it could have been avoided. Something so simple could have been avoided,” said Mendoza.

Thomas has been charged with second degree murder.
