Users create a profile as they would on a social network and are able to advertise houses, apartments or rooms for short-term lease.\n\nTourists pay through the website using their bank card or Paypal.\n\nThe Sunday Times of Malta has spoken to several users who advertise accommodation without being in possession of a licence from the MTA.\n\nOn condition of anonymity, one \u201chost\u201d said she did not know if she needed a licence to rent out her property on Airbnb, and she would not apply for one unless instructed to do so.\n\nAsked to clarify the rules, a spokesman for the MTA confirmed that no one was legally entitled to rent out accommodation without a licence.\n\nThe Travel and Tourism Services Act is clear: \u201cNo person shall provide accommodation in a house to tourists unless he shall have previously obtained and is in possession of a licence.\u201d The only exception to this rule is the provision of accommodation to friends and relatives.\n\nAnyone who breaks this law is liable on conviction to a fine of between \u20ac1,164 and \u20ac23,293.\n\nAs of yesterday there were 813 properties in Malta and Gozo listed for rent on Airbnb.com.\n\nThe increasing popularity of private holiday rentals was evidenced in the Central Bank of Malta\u2019s second quarter review, which showed that stays in self-catering apartments, farmhouses and private residences increased by 33.8 per cent over the corresponding period in 2012.\n\nAirbnb users enthuse about the website. Valletta resident Joanna Delia has used it to rent accommodation in London, Paris, Reykjavik and Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cIt seems to satisfy the desire to peep into other people\u2019s homes. It\u2019s affordable and the choice is endless,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother user who leases accommodation in Sliema described Airbnb as \u201crevolutionary\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt allows you to turn unused spaces within your house into profit-making assets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou also get to meet new people and share your experiences with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that you can also vet any prospective guests and say no to anyone you aren\u2019t sure about.\u201d\n\nWith its popularity soaring, Airbnb has already come to the attention of authorities overseas. Earlier this year, a judge in New York fined an Airbnb host $2,400 for violating hotel laws. The ruling was thrown out on a technicality this month.\n\nAirbnb addresses the issue on the frequently asked questions section of its website: \u201cYour state or locality may impose a tax or taxes on the rental of rooms or the related rental fees.\n\n\u201cWe expect all hosts to abide by their local laws, agreements, tax authorities and any other applicable regulations.\u201d\n\nFollowing the successful appeal in New York, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky released a statement saying: \u201cOur hosts are not hotels, but we believe that it makes sense for our community to pay occupancy tax [in New York], with limited exemptions for those who earn under certain thresholds.\u201d\n\nThe MTA said it had received just one complaint about unlicensed rentals on Airbnb in 2012.\n\nAsked whether the tourism authority was concerned about the website, a spokesman replied: \u201cObviously any sort of advertising medium brings about both positive aspects and also concerns.\n\n\u201cThe MTA is aware that such sites are susceptible to people who are inclined to abuse the system.\u201d\n\nTony Zahra, president of the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association, said the MHRA had no problem with new \u201cchannels and trends\u201d in holiday rentals, provided users are properly licensed and registered for VAT.\n\n\u201cIf this does not happen, then it destroys the level playing field and gives non-regulated people an unfair advantage, since regulation carries costs,\u201d Mr Zahra said.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, regulated accommodation is inspected and classified, giving a level of comfort to consumers.\u201d\n\nMr Zahra added that the MHRA has been warning the Government about the proliferation of non-licensed accommodation for the past three years, saying this results in a substantial loss of revenue through fees and taxation for the State.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "tourism,breaking news,medical tourism,travel,aviation,hospitality,cruise,destination,human rights,global", "DC.Title": "Malta property owners making fast buck, breaking law", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "eTurboNews (eTN)", "description": "VALLETTA, Malta - Airbnb is quietly revolutionising the way tourists find accommodation while helping property owners make a quick buck, but users ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde31d\"", "article_summary": "Oct 13, 2013VALLETTA, Malta - Airbnb is quietly revolutionising the way tourists find accommodation while helping property owners make a quick buck, but users not registered with the Malta Tourism Authority are breaking the law.\nValletta resident Joanna Delia has used it to rent accommodation in London, Paris, Reykjavik and Rio de Janeiro.\nThe Sunday Times of Malta has spoken to several users who advertise accommodation without being in possession of a licence from the MTA.\nAirbnb users enthuse about the website.\nAsked to clarify the rules, a spokesman for the MTA confirmed that no one was legally entitled to rent out accommodation without a licence."}
