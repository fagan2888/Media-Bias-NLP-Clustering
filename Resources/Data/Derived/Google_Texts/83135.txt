After watching a clip of some of Carson’s pre-announcement statements, Bernard remarked, “you take one look at him and you say to yourself, ‘well, your ancestors didn’t come here on their free will. So, how is the Affordable Care Act in any way comparable to slavery?’ (a reference to Carson saying ‘Obamacare is really, I think, the worse thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.’) Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina have the same problem, people are going to say ‘who is the real Ben Carson?’ The person who probably went to Yale and University of Michigan for medical school because of affirmative action. And because of social problems, and didn’t end up like many of the black men that we see in prison today in Baltimore, where he came from because of these same social problems.”

Bernard continued, “who is Carly Fiorina, the woman who, in 2008 believed in TARP, believed in the bailouts, said it was necessary, believed in cap and trade.”
