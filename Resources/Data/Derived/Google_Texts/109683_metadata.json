A new community clinic in Linda Vista will be a one-stop shop, with 21 exam rooms and a spacious waiting area for adult patients.\n\nIt's somehow fitting that a community clinic aiming to be a one-stop shop is opening at the site of a former supermarket in Linda Vista.\n\nThe Linda Vista Health Center, at 7011 Linda Vista Road, is part of the San Diego Family Care network, and it's huge: 23,000 square feet. There are 21 exam rooms. A spacious waiting area for adult patients.\n\nSan Diego Family Care CEO Roberta Feinberg said it also has two separate waiting areas for kids.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the germs mixing, so we built the well-child waiting room,\" she said.\n\nThe clinic incorporates a number of distinctive design elements, including soft, pastel colors and a large lobby with vaulted ceilings and lots of natural light.\n\nFeinberg said the advent of Obamacare and the expanded Medi-Cal program created the need for this new clinic.\n\n\"Over the past two years, we have experienced such an enormous influx of uninsured people who suddenly had insurance, and they were all looking for a primary care doctor,\" she said. \"Plus we still serve many, many thousands of uninsured, who for one reason or another, don\u2019t yet have insurance.\u201d\n\nThe Linda Vista area also has a dearth of doctors and other medical providers.\n\nThat's why this health center is designed to fill a variety of needs, including dentistry.\n\nDental director Tomas Juska said they can offer the same services as would any private dentist.\n\n\"From extractions, to root canals, dentures, cleanings, and preventative dental care,\" Juska said.\n\nAnd there\u2019s something else that you won\u2019t find at many other community clinics: a private mental health pavilion.\n\nDr. Gurgiana Stekovski, director of mental health, said patients can get counseling in five different languages, all just steps away from their primary care doctor.\n\n\u201cYou know, if it was at a completely separate facility, sometimes people are hesitant to come in, or to seek help in general,\" she said. \"But here, it makes it easier, it also makes it more comfortable for them, where they feel like it\u2019s OK to ask for help.\u201d\n\nThe Linda Vista Health Care Center opens for business Monday, May 9.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new community clinic in Linda Vista will be a one-stop shop, with 21 exam rooms and a spacious waiting area for adult patients.", "author": "Kenny Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "A new community clinic in Linda Vista will be a one-stop shop, with 21 exam rooms and a spacious waiting area for adult patients.", "title": "Community Clinic To Open In Linda Vista", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/may/03/state-art-community-clnic-open-linda-vista/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2016/05/03/Linda_Vista.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "166445 %##% Community Clinic To Open In Linda Vista", "keywords": "News, Health", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe116f\"", "article_summary": "The Linda Vista Health Center, at 7011 Linda Vista Road, is part of the San Diego Family Care network, and it's huge: 23,000 square feet.\nA new community clinic in Linda Vista will be a one-stop shop, with 21 exam rooms and a spacious waiting area for adult patients.\nIt's somehow fitting that a community clinic aiming to be a one-stop shop is opening at the site of a former supermarket in Linda Vista.\n\"But here, it makes it easier, it also makes it more comfortable for them, where they feel like it\u2019s OK to ask for help.\u201dThe Linda Vista Health Care Center opens for business Monday, May 9.\n\"Plus we still serve many, many thousands of uninsured, who for one reason or another, don\u2019t yet have insurance.\u201dThe Linda Vista area also has a dearth of doctors and other medical providers."}
