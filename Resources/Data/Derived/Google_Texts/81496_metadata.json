Fun runs, auctions and sales of healthier treats are in.\n\nGovernment rules requiring many schools to hold more nutritious fundraisers, along with a trend toward healthier eating in schools, could mean trouble for the long-beloved bake sale. In response, schools are selling everything from fruit to kid-friendly shoelaces.\n\nIn Dallas, physical education teacher Sharon Foster says her school, James Bowie Elementary, stopped selling chocolate bars and started selling Y-Ties \u2014 elastic shoelaces that don\u2019t have to be tied.\n\nParent Susan Fox Pinkowitz said she helped her children\u2019s elementary school, University Park Elementary in Denver, move from a candy-filled annual carnival to a fun run and carnival that offers apples and protein nut bars. She said the new fundraiser brings in as much as $12,000 annually, three or four times the amount raised by the old event.\n\nNot everyone is on board. Missy Latham, a parent in Greenville, South Carolina, says bake sales are profitable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of absurd that one week a year you couldn\u2019t sell something like that without the government mandating that it\u2019s OK,\u201d Latham said.\n\nThe Agriculture Department rules, which kicked in last summer, require all foods sold on school campuses during the school day to meet certain nutrition standards. The rules include fundraisers, if states don\u2019t exempt themselves. In all, 22 states have used the exemptions, according to the National Association of State Boards of Education.\n\nFlorida allows exemptions for five days in elementary schools, 10 days in middle and junior high schools, 15 days in senior high schools, and 10 days in schools that combine those grades. No exempted fundraiser can take place less than 30 minutes after the last meal period.\n\nLast week, Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas said the state would move to exempt fundraisers after she heard that a school couldn\u2019t sell snow cones.\n\n\u201cThe thought that a federal bureaucrat knows better than parents what they can feed their own families is condescending and reprehensible,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nThe federal rules don\u2019t apply to food that is intended to be consumed at home or outside of school \u2014 so kids can still sell fundraiser mainstays like frozen pizza, frozen cookie dough and chocolate bars.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/hfyouth17.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "When it comes to school fundraisers, bake sale tables loaded with sugary goodies are out.\nFlorida allows exemptions for five days in elementary schools, 10 days in middle and junior high schools, 15 days in senior high schools, and 10 days in schools that combine those grades.\nGovernment rules requiring many schools to hold more nutritious fundraisers, along with a trend toward healthier eating in schools, could mean trouble for the long-beloved bake sale.\nParent Susan Fox Pinkowitz said she helped her children\u2019s elementary school, University Park Elementary in Denver, move from a candy-filled annual carnival to a fun run and carnival that offers apples and protein nut bars.\nThe Agriculture Department rules, which kicked in last summer, require all foods sold on school campuses during the school day to meet certain nutrition standards."}
