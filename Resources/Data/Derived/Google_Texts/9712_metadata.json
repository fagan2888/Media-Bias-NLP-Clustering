Rob Portman (R-Ohio), interview on Fox News, Jan. 21, 2014\n\nThis was certainly an eye-popping statistic that the senator offered the other day \u2014 10 times as many people have had their insurance canceled as those who have been able to get insurance. Could it possibly still be true?\n\nThe Facts\n\nCaitlin Dunn, a spokeswoman for Portman, immediately fessed up and said the senator had made a mistake. \u201cSenator Portman knew the updated numbers (2.2 million sign-ups versus about 5 million cancellations), but misspoke given that the ratio had previously been 10-20:1 when the process began,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any alternate data.\u201d\n\nWe do not play gotcha when politicians explain that they made a mistake, especially if they had been speaking on live television. But Portman\u2019s error points out a fallacy of even trying to cite such a statistic.\n\nThe \u201c5 million\u201d canceled plans comes from a list of Americans who received notices that their existing insurance plans were not compliant with the Affordable Care Act and thus would be canceled. But that number has barely budged since October.\n\nSo with the fumbled launch of HealthCare.gov and initially poor enrollment figures, it made for an irresistible talking point: 40 times more people had their insurance canceled than received insurance!\n\nUpdated cancellation map from @Senate_RPC. More than 4.7 million health insurance cancellations in 32 states. pic.twitter.com/tcpZvFDp2m \u2014 Sen. John Barrasso (@SenJohnBarrasso) November 19, 2013\n\nBut, of course, the Web site eventually improved, enrollments picked up and the ratio dropped \u2014 and dropped. For a period, it was 10 to 1. Now, based on the data from the end of December, it\u2019s more like 2 to 1.\n\nYou see where this is going, right? Soon this talking point will be turned on its head.\n\nOn top of that, any sort of ratio comparing canceled plans to plans obtained on the Obamacare exchanges is inherently misleading. As we have previously noted, many people who received notices that their plans were canceled were told they would be automatically enrolled in another plan by the same insurance company. So they were part of the group of people who \u201chad their insurance canceled,\u201d but they still ended up with private insurance anyway \u2014 just not through the exchanges. Thus they would not be listed as part of the 2.2 million.\n\nAnother caveat: the administration\u2019s 2.2 million figure must also be treated with extreme caution. That reflects the number of people who selected a plan, but it is not known if the enrollee actually paid a premium to the insurance company and thus has begun to receive coverage. The government was supposed to quickly receive that information, but administration officials admitted that that part of HealthCare.gov has not been completed yet.\n\nMaking it even more murky is that the law was passed in order to make it easier for people without health insurance to get insured, but anecdotal evidence so far suggests people without insurance have not flocked to the exchanges. There are also numbers for Medicaid enrollees, but as we have noted, those are also fuzzy.\n\n\u201cThere are no hard numbers. No one really knows,\u201d said health policy analyst Robert Laszewki. He said many of the cancellations cited by opponents of the Affordable Care Act have been \u201cdeferred to the end of 2014 (by carrier early renewal options or later the president asking them to defer cancellations) or will take place in each of the 11 remaining months of 2014 as policy anniversaries occur.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nGiven Portman\u2019s admission of error, we\u2019re not going to award Pinocchios. But it\u2019s time for Republicans to retire this talking point. It\u2019s long since passed its expiration date.\n\nNo Rating\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans get in trouble when they compare the number of cancellations with the number of new health plans.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans get in trouble when they compare the number of cancellations with the number of new health plans.", "title": "The phony ratio comparing insurance cancellations to health plans on HealthCare.gov", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/23/the-phony-ratio-comparing-insurance-cancellations-to-health-plans-on-healthcare-gov/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/08/21/National-Economy/Images/112988578-1639.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/23/the-phony-ratio-comparing-insurance-cancellations-to-health-plans-on-healthcare-gov/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare; affordable care act; obama health; gop obamacare; repeal obamacare; rob portman, obamacare fact check; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare; affordable care act; obama health; gop obamacare; repeal obamacare; rob portman, obamacare fact check; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ed8\"", "article_summary": "On top of that, any sort of ratio comparing canceled plans to plans obtained on the Obamacare exchanges is inherently misleading.\nMore than 4.7 million health insurance cancellations in 32 states.\nThe \u201c5 million\u201d canceled plans comes from a list of Americans who received notices that their existing insurance plans were not compliant with the Affordable Care Act and thus would be canceled.\nSo they were part of the group of people who \u201chad their insurance canceled,\u201d but they still ended up with private insurance anyway \u2014 just not through the exchanges.\n(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg)\u201cMore than 10 times as many people have had their insurance canceled, as compared to those who have been able to obtain private insurance.\u201d\u2014 Sen."}
