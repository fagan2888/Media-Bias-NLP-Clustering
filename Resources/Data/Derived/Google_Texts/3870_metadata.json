For those buying private coverage, in particular, it\u2019s possible that another vendor could help make the website easier to use, O\u2019Toole said, pointing to the exchange website in the District of Columbia as an example.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simpler,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cThere are fewer screens. It\u2019s a usability thing. \u2026 Better navigation.\u201d\n\nWhile the request for information would seek submissions from vendors for all portions of the website, state officials said it would be tougher for MNsure to switch away from the complex enrollment and eligibility system it shares with the state Department of Human Services. That system \u2014 which the state now calls the Minnesota Eligibility Technology System (METS) \u2014 continues to cause frustration for counties that use it for managing cases for people with public health insurance coverage.\n\nJust last week, for example, Hennepin County officials said they will need to hire another 92 workers to work on cases within the MNsure/METS system. MNsure officials on Wednesday suggested that changes might be less likely with the eligibility portion of the website than with the shopping portion, which currently is handled by a vendor called Connecture.\n\n\u201cI think we are the only state using Connecture right now, so there are a lot of other solutions out there,\u201d O\u2019Toole said.\n\nA spokeswoman with Connecture did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. MNsure also uses PricewaterhouseCoopers and IBM Curam as outside IT vendors, plus the state\u2019s IT division.\n\nO\u2019Toole said that in a best-case scenario, the request for information process this summer would quickly lead to a formal request for proposals from vendors. If MNsure opts to change a vendor, it would not seek money from the Legislature, O\u2019Toole said, but would work within its current budget.\n\nA new vendor might help with \u201csome of those ticky things that happen that are just frustrating for consumers,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cIt\u2019s the clearing the cache, it\u2019s the not getting the confirmation. \u2026 A big call driver is people just confirming that they\u2019ve enrolled.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "The search might ultimately lead to website changes by the second half of 2017, said Allison O'Toole, the MNsure chief executive.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The search might ultimately lead to website changes by the second half of 2017, said Allison O'Toole, the MNsure chief executive.", "title": "MNsure to seek IT vendor options with eye on improving website", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-to-seek-it-vendor-options-with-eye-on-improving-website/380885861/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144624450679209.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144624450679209.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The search might ultimately lead to website changes by the second half of 2017, said Allison O'Toole, the MNsure chief executive.", "title": "MNsure to seek IT vendor options with eye on improving website", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-to-seek-it-vendor-options-with-eye-on-improving-website/380885861/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144624450679209.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144624450679209.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "health insurance"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "MNsure,website,online,health insurance"}, "article_summary": "MNsure wants to see if switching IT vendors could help improve aspects of the state health insurance exchange\u2019s website.\nIf MNsure opts to change a vendor, it would not seek money from the Legislature, O\u2019Toole said, but would work within its current budget.\nMNsure officials on Wednesday suggested that changes might be less likely with the eligibility portion of the website than with the shopping portion, which currently is handled by a vendor called Connecture.\nA new vendor might help with \u201csome of those ticky things that happen that are just frustrating for consumers,\u201d O\u2019Toole said.\nA lot of those early technical issues have been resolved, but complaints remain with certain aspects of the website."}
