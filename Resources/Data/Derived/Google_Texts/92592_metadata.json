First step to fixing it: wash your hands.\n\nWith proponents of the Affordable Care Act hoping the new law will shift the focus of American health care from cost to quality, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held a hearing on Tuesday that addressed an issue of quality that puts a costly burden, in expenses and lives, on the U.S. health care system.\n\nHealth-care associated infections, or ailments patients acquire during and after treatment, affect about 1 in 20 hospital patients at any given time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That amounts to approximately 1.7 million infections and 90,000 deaths every year, at the steep cost of about $30 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the thorniest health care quality challenges of our time, but we are making significant progress,\u201d Senator Tom Harkin, chair of the HELP committee said during his opening statement. \u201cThe most important lesson of today\u2019s hearing is that these mistakes and tragedies are avoidable.\u201d\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing, members of the health community and advocates for patient safety testified before the committee to detail efforts occurring within the health care system that can significantly reduce health care associated infections.\n\nInfections can be particularly deadly if they lead to a condition called sepsis, during which the immune system responds overwhelmingly to an infection, triggering inflammation and often leading to multiple organ failure as the body goes into shock.\n\nSepsis kills over 200,000 Americans every year, more than AIDS, prostate cancer, and breast cancer combined\n\nRenita Kilby, 50, who sat in the audience during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, barely survived her bout with sepsis, which she developed after an infection during a routine hysterectomy.\n\nKilby spent three weeks in a coma, and later underwent four surgeries, lost hearing in her right ear, and racked up over $300,000 worth of medical bills.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s a senseless thing to have to happen to someone because it can be preventable,\u201d Kilby says. She also depends on a wheelchair because her infection caused intense damage to her spine.\n\nAll infections, experts noted, are extremely preventable and can be reduced through acts as basic as washing hands between patients.\n\n\u201cHand washing is probably the single most important thing that anyone can do to prevent transmission of infections,\u201d Beth Bell, the director of the national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at the CDC, said during the hearing.\n\nIn fact, a trial conducted across 74 intensive care units involving over 74,000 patients found that using antimicrobial soap and applying nasal ointment at the time of admission for all ICU patients led to a 44% reduction in central-line bloodstream infections. Over the past four years, incidences of surgical-site infections have decreased by 20% and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections in hospitals experienced a 54% decline.\n\nBeyond hand sanitation, the federal government and private and local partners are working together to continue reducing and preventing infections that occur during treatment.\n\nThe CDC tracks infections and provides health care facilities and communities across the nation with data to identify issues and measure progress through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the largest monitoring system for healthcare associated infections.\n\nPatrick Conway, the acting director of the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation, testified that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services no longer pays hospitals for additional costs associated with what they consider \u201chospital acquired conditions\u201d or HACs, which include some surgical site infections and urinary-tract infections that are not present upon admission.\n\nPay incentives such as this, Conway said, will help improve the quality of health care for patients inside and outside of the Medicare system. This system is similar to the Medicare readmissions program under the Affordable Care Act, which reduces payments to hospitals with excessive readmission rates.\n\nPanelists also emphasized the importance of private-public partnerships, much like the Patient Safety Movement is a coalition of care-providers, patient advocates and medical technology companies that have joined together to eliminate preventable deaths completely by 2020.\n\nFor Ciaran Staunton, however, Tuesday\u2019s hearing had a more special meaning. His testimony before the committee represented the first time the infection that killed his 12-year-old son Rory, was being addressed publically before the full committee.\n\nOn April 1, 2012, Rory died of multiple organ failure caused by septic shock. Before Rory\u2019s death, the Staunton family, like many Americans, had never heard of sepsis. After, however, the Staunton\u2019s became advocates for awareness in their home state of New York, and pushed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to adopted regulations for detecting the condition, in honor of Rory.\n\nDuring his testimony, Staunton called on Congress to increase awareness of sepsis through nation-wide sepsis education initiative, much like what \u201cRory\u2019s Regulations\u201d do in New York.\n\n\u201cHad we heard of sepsis, we\u2019d have checked for sepsis,\u201d Staunton told TIME. \u201cInformation and awareness costs nothing, but it may well save lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With proponents of the Affordable Care Act hoping the new law will shift the focus of American health care from cost to quality, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held a hearing on Tuesday that addressed an issue of quality that puts a costly burden, in expenses and lives...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Every year about 1 in 20 patients get sick from infections when being treated for something else.
