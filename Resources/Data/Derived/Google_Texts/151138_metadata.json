Photo courtesy of YouTube\n\nWhile the subject of abortion makes headlines on nearly a daily basis, the unintentional end to a pregnancy fails to gain as much public attention. As part of style website StyleLikeU's \"What's Underneath\" project, mother of two and personal stylist Karyn Starr gave us a rare and emotional view into what happens when a woman doesn\u2019t plan on losing her baby but does so anyway.\n\n\"I lost two babies last year, so I feel very lucky that this one has cooked for so long,\" Starr, nine months pregnant, tells the camera. \"I had a pretty late miscarriage at 17 weeks.\"\n\nStarr\u2019s story, which unfortunately is not uncommon, includes the unexpected breaking of her water and home still birth of a perfect yet tiny baby. \u201cIt was one of those moments when you go, \u2018Wow, this is why people go so crazy about all this,\u2019\u201d Starr said.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates that around 15 percent of all known pregnancies will end in miscarriages. Most miscarriages occur during the first 13 weeks of a pregnancy.\n\nThe stylist also explained her emergency D&C, or dilation and curettage, a procedure needed to remove tissue from inside the uterus. \u201cThere are women all over the world that have miscarriages that die because they don\u2019t have access to someone who can give them a clean D&C.\u201d\n\nAlthough about half of all women who experience a miscarriage do not need a D&C, for those who do, it can be life-saving. If pieces of the placenta remain inside of a woman, they may become septic and create a deadly infection.\n\nHear more of her story below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "whats, underneath, project, features, stylist, karyn, starr, who, shares, heartbreaking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mother of two shares her story of miscarriage and highlights the need for sanitary D&C in a video for StyleLikeU's \"What's Underneath Project.\"", "title": "Stylist Karyn Starr Shares The Story Of Her Miscarriage", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-underneath-project-features-stylist-karyn-starr-who-shares-heartbreaking-miscarriage-307914", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/karyn.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mother of two shares her story of miscarriage and highlights the need for sanitary D&C in a video for StyleLikeU's \"What's Underneath Project.\"", "title": "Stylist Karyn Starr Shares The Story Of Her Miscarriage", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-underneath-project-features-stylist-karyn-starr-who-shares-heartbreaking-miscarriage-307914", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/karyn.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/karyn.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-24T15:04:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T15:36:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mother of two shares her story of miscarriage and highlights the need for sanitary D&C in a video for StyleLikeU's \"What's Underneath Project.\""}, "article_summary": "Karyn Starr shares one of her most intimate stories in order to raise awareness on miscarriages.\nAs part of style website StyleLikeU's \"What's Underneath\" project, mother of two and personal stylist Karyn Starr gave us a rare and emotional view into what happens when a woman doesn\u2019t plan on losing her baby but does so anyway.\nThe stylist also explained her emergency D&C, or dilation and curettage, a procedure needed to remove tissue from inside the uterus.\nIf pieces of the placenta remain inside of a woman, they may become septic and create a deadly infection.\n\u201cIt was one of those moments when you go, \u2018Wow, this is why people go so crazy about all this,\u2019\u201d Starr said."}
