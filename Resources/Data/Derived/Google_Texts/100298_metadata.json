(The headline: \u201cHealth Care Fixes Backed by Harvard\u2019s Experts Now Roil Its Faculty.\u201d Wow.)\n\nThe story really originates in November, when the school\u2019s faculty \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d voted against changes to their health plans spurred in part by the Affordable Care Act. The alterations require employees to pay more as a result of cost increases to the university in providing health insurance.\n\nThe Times dug in further:\n\nIn Harvard\u2019s health care enrollment guide for 2015, the university said it \u201cmust respond to the national trend of rising health care costs, including some driven by health care reform,\u201d otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act.

Rosenthal, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, said she was puzzled by the outcry. \u201cThe changes in Harvard faculty benefits are parallel to changes that all Americans are seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cIndeed, they have come to our front door much later than to others.\u201d\n\nRead the whole thing here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The headline: \"Health Care Fixes Backed by Harvard\u2019s Experts Now Roil Its Faculty.\" Wow.", "title": "Latest group to protest Obamacare costs is ... the Harvard...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/05/latest-group-protest-obamacare-costs-harvard-faculty/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-01-05T18:13:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T18:13:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1748\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe changes in Harvard faculty benefits are parallel to changes that all Americans are seeing,\u201d she said.\nThe New York Times has a delicious piece about the Harvard faculty\u2019s response to higher healthcare costs due to Obamacare.\n(The headline: \u201cHealth Care Fixes Backed by Harvard\u2019s Experts Now Roil Its Faculty.\u201d Wow.)\nThe Times dug in further:In Harvard\u2019s health care enrollment guide for 2015, the university said it \u201cmust respond to the national trend of rising health care costs, including some driven by health care reform,\u201d otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act.\nThe alterations require employees to pay more as a result of cost increases to the university in providing health insurance."}
