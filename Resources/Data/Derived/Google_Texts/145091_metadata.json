However, the vote also demonstrated growing opposition to the bank among Republican senators\u2014a trend that has evolved in recent years.\n\nSince 1992, opposition to Ex-Im has grown substantially among Republicans in the House and the Senate. While, in the past, passage of the bank\u2019s reauthorization in the Senate was typically with unanimous consent or voice vote, the last two votes concerning the bank show wavering support from GOP senators.\n\nSimilarly, in the House, opposition to the bank from GOP members has continued to grow.\n\nEx-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nThe Senate held a \u201ctest\u201d vote on Wednesday that measured support for Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization. Sixty-five senators voted against the motion, which would have tabled an amendment reauthorizing the bank for another five years. Thirty Republicans and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont voted to set the amendment aside.\n\nTwo Republicans, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, did not vote. However, both Rubio and Toomey have publicly opposed the bank.\n\n\u201cThis will be a signal to the markets that the Senate is in support of the bank,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of Ex-Im\u2019s biggest supporters, said Wednesday.\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican senators voting in favor of Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization touted the vote as a win for the embattled agency. Ex-Im\u2019s charter expires June 30, and the agency has been a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate who disagree over whether its life should continue.\n\nThe Daily Signal analyzed Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorizations from 1992 through the Senate\u2019s vote last week to track how support for the bank has changed.\n\n>>> What Happens If the Export-Import Bank\u2019s Charter Expires?\n\nIn the Senate, reauthorization was passed through unanimous consent, or with no objection, from 1992 to 2006. Then, in 2012, senators went on record in voting for legislation sponsored by Rep. Gary Miller, R-Calif., that reauthorized Ex-Im through Sept. 30, 2014.\n\nNineteen Republican senators of the 46 that voted opposed the bank\u2019s reauthorization.\n\nIn the House, opposition to Ex-Im has steadily grown among Republicans, as well.\n\nThe lower chamber held roll call votes on reauthorization in 1992, 2002 and 2012. This year, the House hasn\u2019t yet voted on a measure addressing Ex-Im\u2019s future.\n\nIn 1992 and 2002, approximately 23 percent of voting Republicans opposed reauthorization to the bank. In 2012, that grew to 38 percent.\n\nThe House hasn\u2019t yet voted on Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization. However, according to Heritage Action for America, the sister organization of The Heritage Foundation, 93 of the lower chamber\u2019s 246 Republicans\u201438 percent\u2014oppose Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization.\n\nRepublicans in the House, particularly, have begun pushing back against Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization in recent years.\n\nLed by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, the bank\u2019s opponents argue Ex-Im serves as an engine of cronyism and corporate welfare. Additionally, various reports have found that the agency benefits a handful of politically connected, large corporations, namely Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar.\n\nApproximately 30 percent of Ex-Im\u2019s transactions benefited Boeing in 2013, and because of the bank\u2019s continued support of the airplane manufacturer, Ex-Im earned the nickname \u201cBank of Boeing.\u201d\n\nThis year, Hensarling chose not to bring a bill reauthorizing the bank through his committee, though he has held a number of hearings on Ex-Im\u2019s future.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he was open to letting the bank expire and decided not to bring a reauthorization bill before his panel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any crying-out need for a markup,\u201d Shelby told reporters last week. \u201cAfter two days of hearings, it exacerbated some of my concerns.\u201d\n\n>>> Republicans Face \u2018Principled Debate\u2019 Over Export-Import Bank\u2019s Future\n\nAs policymakers on Capitol Hill have been debating the bank\u2019s future, Ex-Im officials revealed that there are currently 31 open fraud investigations and the potential for more indictments stemming from Ex-Im transactions.\n\nJohnny Gutierrez, a former bank loan officer, pled guilty to accepting bribes 19 different times from 2006 to 2013 in April.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A vote for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank demonstrated growing opposition among Republican senators\u2014a trend that has evolved in recent years.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A vote for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank demonstrated growing opposition among Republican senators\u2014a trend that has evolved in recent years.", "title": "Opposition to Export-Import Bank Has Grown Over Time", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150612_ExImVotes_v2.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-15T13:22:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MwEKs5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A vote for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank demonstrated growing opposition among Republican senators\u2014a trend that has evolved in recent years.", "title": "Opposition to Export-Import Bank Has Grown Over Time", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150612_ExImVotes_v2.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-06-15T03:01:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T13:22:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey, Jeb Hensarling, Lindsey Graham, Johnny Gutierrez, Richard Shelby, Ex-Im"}, "article_summary": "Since 1992, opposition to Ex-Im has grown substantially among Republicans in the House and the Senate.\nHowever, the vote also demonstrated growing opposition to the bank among Republican senators\u2014a trend that has evolved in recent years.\nSimilarly, in the House, opposition to the bank from GOP members has continued to grow.\nIn the Senate, reauthorization was passed through unanimous consent, or with no objection, from 1992 to 2006.\nSupporters of the Export-Import Bank cheered last week when the majority of United States senators voted in favor of reauthorizing the embattled agency."}
