Family members arrived at a funeral home in Florida about an hour before the scheduled viewing for their loved one. The family says when funeral staff opened the casket, they made a horrible discovery.





People milled about outside Stephens Lakeside Chapel in West Palm Beach way past the scheduled start of the viewing for Mary Anderson.





"We get here today for her wake and it's not here. They have somebody else in all of her belongings," said Marvel Freeman, Anderson's daughter.





Somebody else in the casket? Marvel Freeman is one of the deceased woman's daughters. Susan Williams is a sister.





"It took us a whole day for us to find what we wanted her to be buried in," said Williams.





"They told me they were going to fix it. How are they going to fix it?" said Freeman





"To take her undergarments and [them] on somebody else. Then, take them off her and put them back on here. Come on, come on. That's not right," said Williams.





A van arrived at the funeral home. The family said Anderson's body had finally arrived from the funeral home's other location. Workers unloaded a casket as crews watched off property.





"Two Marys. Both of their names are supposedly Mary. It's still no resemblance whatsoever," said Freeman.





It was little comfort for family and friend who should be sharing memories of their loved one.





"But they done messed up our whole entire memory of our sister and their mother. It's not fair," said Williams.





Once the viewing did get underway, funeral staff was busy. Despite attempts, the funeral home never responded.
