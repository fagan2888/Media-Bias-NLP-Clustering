"The parade, the food, the bouncies, the people, all sorts of things," attendee, Kaley Shannon says are her favortie parts of Mardi Gras.

The parade kicked off at noon. Hundreds of people lined the streets in hopes to take home a little piece of Mardi Gras.

"It's very exciting to see this many people come down, not just from Meridian, but from outside of Meridian. They come in to town for this. It's awesome to see this many people supporting downtown Meridian and just being in downtown Meridian," says Will Hayes with Meridian Main Street.

A live band performed for the crowd and there wasn't a shortage of food. Mardi Gras staples like gumbo and king cake were provided by vendors.

It wasn't just fun for the people, but for their furry friends as well. A dog costume contest was held before the parade kicked off.

"We come every year. We will lead off the Krewe de Barkus over here with the golf cart. All the dogs with follow and then the rest of the parade will follow behind us," says Angela Mckinny, attendee.

"We've been having this for many years now. It just seems to get bigger and bigger every year. We've kind of changed things up a little bit and I think it is holding a lot more people this year," says Hayes. "We're excited about the weather, of course being this awesome February 6th."

"My favortie part is seeing everyone is the community. It's a beautiful day. The best day we've had in awhile. Great weather for this event. It's a lot of fun," says Tau Iosia.
