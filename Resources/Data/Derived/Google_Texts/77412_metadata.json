Weather is weather and climate is climate.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s little doubt that global climate change is closely linked to the intensity of the current outbreak and the El Nino that\u2019s helped spawn it (and, sadly, the frequency with which we will experience such events in the future).\n\nThis is from a recent story on Bloomberg Business that explored the recent tropical outbreak in New York City:\n\n\u201cA strong El Nino is under way across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and that upsets things in a way \u2018that is much less favorable for outbreaks of cold Canadian or Arctic air,\u2019 said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. In addition, a pattern called the Arctic Oscillation is favoring warmth in the northern U.S\u2026. That said, climate change also plays a role in setting the larger stage, Trenberth said. There is evidence that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared with what existed in preindustrial times has elevated the chances of a mild December in Central Park, said Henson. And that demonstrates why carbon and emissions play such a big role in discussions like the one that just ended in Paris. \u2018So, in a nutshell, this month\u2019s eastern warmth strikes me as the kind of dramatic event that one might expect in a strong El Nino, with record-warm temperatures at least a small bit higher as a result of the overall warming of our climate,\u2019 Henson said.\u201d\n\nThe story goes on to reiterate what we all already knew \u2014 namely, that all of this is devilishly complex and very hard to predict in the short term. But it also highlights the fact that the average high temperature in Central Park in mid-December has gone up a degree in just 10 years. Here in North Carolina in recent days, heat records have been shattered by several degrees. In other words, just as with so many other areas in life, few things are certain, but it\u2019s absurd to ignore data and probabilities \u2014 especially when the very health of the planet and viability of the human species are at stake.\n\nRight now, the data and statistics culled and compiled by thousands of our best scientists indicate strongly that events like the current record-breaking warm weather (and all the problems that tend to come with it) will become more and more likely in the years ahead. That any person who gives a hoot about his or her children and grandchildren could be aware of this truth and not believe that urgent societal action is essential to tackle the problem ASAP (are you listening, Governor McCrory?) is something that remains remarkably difficult to fathom.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Weather is weather and climate is climate.\nThat said, climate change also plays a role in setting the larger stage, Trenberth said.\nAnd that demonstrates why carbon and emissions play such a big role in discussions like the one that just ended in Paris.\nIn addition, a pattern called the Arctic Oscillation is favoring warmth in the northern U.S\u2026.\nHere in North Carolina in recent days, heat records have been shattered by several degrees."}
