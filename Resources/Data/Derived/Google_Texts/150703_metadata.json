The mandate states that employers with 50 or more employees must provide insurance or face penalties.\n\nThe report states that in the short term, dumping the employer would \u201cnot reduce insurance coverage significantly;\u201d that it would reduce projected federal revenue from penalties by about $46 billion; but states the cost of keeping the mandate could affect hiring decisions and wages.\n\nMoreover, the liberal group does not suggest that President Barack Obama could do this unilaterally.\n\n\u201cAlternative sources of revenue would have to be found to compensate for the federal loss of penalties,\u201d the report states. \u201cBoth the elimination of the mandate and creating a new source of revenue to replace it will require legislation.\u201d\n\nThe critique\u2019s source carries pedigree with the left. The Urban Institute began in 1968 as a group of government officials tasked by President Lyndon B. Johnson to monitor the progress of the Great Society in large cities. What began as Johnson\u2019s blue ribbon commission became a private nonprofit liberal group that has advocated universal health care for decades.\n\n\u201cThe most frequent claim is that employers will move to more of a part-time workforce,\u201d the report sates. \u201cFor example, several large firms recently announced that they would be reducing hours for part-time workers to less than 30 (Land\u2019s End, Regal Entertainment, Wendy\u2019s, and SeaWorld).\u201d\n\nThe report states that such anecdotal occurrences have hurt the perception, but said the actual toll might be unclear.\n\n\u201cHowever, even if the ACA\u2019s labor market effects are modest, there will undoubtedly be some distortions created,\u201d the report states. \u201cCreating arbitrary thresholds (e.g., potential penalties for firms of 50 or more workers not providing coverage for employees typically working 30 or more hours per week) for financial requirements will change the employment decisions in some firms, and at least some workers will be adversely affected by them.\u201d\n\nFurther, the Urban Institute goes on to say: \u201cMost employers would not drop coverage if the penalties were eliminated. About two thirds of American workers now have offers of employer coverage when there is no mandate to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn balance, the individual mandate and tax benefits will keep most employers offering coverage regardless of the penalty,\u201d the report continues. \u201cAnd those that drop because of the ACA will have done so because of other provisions in the law (e.g., the Medicaid expansion and income-related subsidies). Few employers will decide to no longer offer\n\ncoverage simply because penalties are eliminated.\u201d\n\n\u2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A bulwark of big government programs and supporter of Obamacare is calling for discarding the employer mandate fearing problems it will cause I the labor market.    \u201cThe requirement\u2019s implications for coverage are small and yet the negative labor market effects of keeping it in place could...", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/05/15/why-this-leftwing-group-wants-to-eliminate-obamacares-employer-mandate/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/600x39969.jpg", "title": "Why This Left-Wing Group Wants to Eliminate Obamacare\u2019s Employer Mandate", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "why, this, leftwing, group, wants, eliminate, obamacares, employer, mandate", "sailthru.tags": "business, government, obamacare, politics, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 60, "gplus-count": 5, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/809736", "categories": "obamacare,business,government,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 31, "description": "A bulwark of big government programs and supporter of Obamacare is calling for discarding the employer mandate fearing problems it will cause I the labor market.    \u201cThe requirement\u2019s implications for coverage are small and yet the negative labor market effects of keeping it in place could...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "A bulwark of big government programs and supporter of Obamacare is calling for discarding the employer mandate fearing problems it will cause I the labor market.    \u201cThe requirement\u2019s implications for coverage are small and yet the negative labor market effects of keeping it in place could...", "title": "Why This Left-Wing Group Wants to Eliminate Obamacare\u2019s Employer Mandate", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/05/15/why-this-leftwing-group-wants-to-eliminate-obamacares-employer-mandate/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/600x39969.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 399}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-05-15T22:45:21+00:00", "twitter-count": 81}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration has already delayed the employer mandate, which is a key part of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\nA bulwark of big government programs and supporter of Obamacare is calling for discarding the employer mandate fearing problems it will cause I the labor market.\n\u201cHowever, even if the ACA\u2019s labor market effects are modest, there will undoubtedly be some distortions created,\u201d the report states.\nThe mandate states that employers with 50 or more employees must provide insurance or face penalties.\n\u201cAlternative sources of revenue would have to be found to compensate for the federal loss of penalties,\u201d the report states."}
