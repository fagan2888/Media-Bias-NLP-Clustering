David Johnson, vice president, senior healthcare consultant with Sibson Consulting.\n\n\u201cThe key takeaway, this is a big deal happening in 2018 and don\u2019t wait until 2017,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNow is the time to begin asking your advisors what to do.\u201d\n\nJohnson explained two important penalties employers face for noncompliance with the ACA: the \u201ccoverage penalty\u201d under section 4980HB and the \u201caffordability penalty\u201d under section 4890HA. Each section carries its own severe monetary penalties, often with complicated implementation formulas and with no offsets \u2014 such as tax deductibility \u2014 to lessen the blow for any companies falling short of implementation.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, principal at FaegrBD Consulting, explained some of the regulatory and legal issues private companies face related to environmental- and energy-related risks. When dealing with those issues, Wheeler explained that is essential to discern between \u201cemergency risk\u201d versus a \u201cplanned risk.\u201d\n\nAn emergency risk is responding to events like an oil spill, while planned risks are regulatory and legislative exposures that many companies need to manage strategically over a longer period. Wheeler added that when it comes to environmental issues, emergency risks can from many different places.\n\n\u201cAn emergency risk is not always your risk, they can be your vendors or suppliers,\u201d he said.\n\nAaron Klein, Director, Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative, Bipartisan Policy Center, added his take on the different in the ways the 2008 financial crisis continues to impact the economy, with a particular focus on the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n\nKlein explained that while private companies may not like dealing with the legilsation\u2019s regulatory fallout, it remains one of the more popular reactions to the Great Recession. \u201cOut of the policy initiatives following the financial crisis, including the ACA \u2014 [Dodd Frank] polls between 55 and 75 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American public is still really made about what happened in the financial crisis and they wanted us to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nOdds of significant corporate tax reform were also discussed. \u201cRepublicans are winning on [the political tax reform approach of] don\u2019t treat the headache, treat the tumor that is causing the headache, while the Administration may decide to make tax reform is a legacy issue, but only corporate tax reform,\u201d explained Andrew Prior, managing director of PWC. \u201cBut either way tax reform is over when you get to the end of calender year 2015 because of the elections.\u201d\n\nAccounting and FASB\n\nIn the day\u2019s closing session, panelists discussed recent efforts to simplify the accounting options available to private companies and the differences they have from their publicly traded counterparts.\n\nBilly Atkinson, chairman of FASB\u2019s Private Company Council, said the organization\u2019s mandate is to offer alternatives that help reduce the cost and complexity of accounting standards for private companies, and to offer alternatives for U.S. GAAP standards that may not be relevant to private company shareholders, lenders or other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe PCC helps set a stage and establish a procedure for FASB to think about the needs of private companies before promulgating new standards,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) established the PCC in late 2012 to collaborate with FASB to identify situations where modifying U.S. GAAP to meet the needs of private companies makes sense.\n\nThe PCC\u2019s efforts fit within the broader context of FASB\u2019s simplification projects. Under the standard-setting process, the PCC reviews suggestions from financial statements preparers, users and auditors, and collaborates with the FASB staff to research issues and potential alternatives.\n\nIf PCC takes on a project, it will develop recommendations for an alternative accounting approach that is ultimately reviewed by FASB for potential adoption.\n\nSo far, successful PCC efforts have addressed private company alternatives for goodwill, common control leasing and interest-rate swap accounting. Ongoing projects include identifiable intangible assets and stock-based compensation.\n\nKirsten Schofield, a PwC assurance partner, suggested private companies consider their strategic plans as well as the accounting implications as they decide whether adopting an alternative standard is in the company\u2019s medium to long-term interest.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re considering the election of an alternative standard talk to your accountants and lenders before you make a final election,\u201d Schofield said. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to remain a private company, you could be a good candidate for these alternatives. If you think you may become a public entity in the near future, and would have to unwind an alternative, you may not be a good candidate.\u201d\n\n\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Private companies face a plethora of regulatory, legislative and accounting challenges as they wind up the current year and face 2015.", "generator": "EventON 2.3.9", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Executives International Daily", "description": "Private companies face a plethora of regulatory, legislative and accounting challenges as they wind up the current year and face 2015.", "title": "Regulatory, Accounting Hurdles Facing Private Companies - Financial Executives International Daily", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 478, "identifier": "http://daily.financialexecutives.org/wp-content/uploads/478704571.jpg", "height": 359}, "updated_time": "2014-10-17T05:30:29-04:00", "url": "http://daily.financialexecutives.org/regulatory-accounting-hurdles-facing-private-companies/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Accounting", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2014-10-15T06:12:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-17T05:30:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "accounting, affordable care act, cfo, compliance, congress, financial reporting, policy, regulation, business, finance, treasury, strategy"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to remain a private company, you could be a good candidate for these alternatives.\nPrivate companies face a plethora of regulatory, legislative and accounting challenges as they wind up the current year and face 2015.\nSo far, successful PCC efforts have addressed private company alternatives for goodwill, common control leasing and interest-rate swap accounting.\n\u201cRepublicans are winning on [the political tax reform approach of] don\u2019t treat the headache, treat the tumor that is causing the headache, while the Administration may decide to make tax reform is a legacy issue, but only corporate tax reform,\u201d explained Andrew Prior, managing director of PWC.\nAndrew Wheeler, principal at FaegrBD Consulting, explained some of the regulatory and legal issues private companies face related to environmental- and energy-related risks."}
