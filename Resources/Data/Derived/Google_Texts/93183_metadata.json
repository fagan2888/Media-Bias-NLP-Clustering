(snip)\n\nJoining her MSNBC colleague Al Sharpton as a tax deadbeat, Melissa Harris-Perry and her husband were hit with a $70,000 tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service. Michael Hewlett of the Winston-Salem Journal reports:\n\nIn an email Wednesday, Harris-Perry said she was unaware of the tax lien but knew about the debt. She said she and her husband paid $21,721 of the debt when they filed their taxes Wednesday. The remaining debt, $48,581, covers a tax period ending Dec. 31, 2013, according to the notice.\n\nIn addition to her gig at MSNBC, Perry holds an endowed \u201cPresidential Chair\u201d at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, which must require her to fly back and forth between North Carolina and New York every week. Such prestigious titled chairs normally carry with them a very handsome salary, and I doubt that she works for free at MSNBC. So her failure to pay what she owes to the IRS was not a matter of keeping starvation from her door.\n\nPerry, a woman of the hard left, is known to castigate the wealthy for not paying their fair share of taxes. But as so many on the left, a personal exemption seems to be granted for herself whenever it is convenient.\n\nPerry has beclowned herself many times in the past, arguing that arson and looting are not violence, tearfully apologizing on-air for allowing Mitt Romney\u2019s multi-racial family to be mocked on her show, asking the head of the DoJ to quack like duck, likening the use of the word \u201cObamacare\u201d to use of the n-word, and of course her famous use of tampon earrings:\n\nHat tip: John Nolte of Breitbart", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/04/irs_puts_70k_tax_lien_on_msnbc_host_melissa_harrisperry.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: IRS puts $70k tax lien on MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8c5\"", "article_summary": "(snip)Joining her MSNBC colleague Al Sharpton as a tax deadbeat, Melissa Harris-Perry and her husband were hit with a $70,000 tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service.\nMichael Hewlett of the Winston-Salem Journal reports:In an email Wednesday, Harris-Perry said she was unaware of the tax lien but knew about the debt.\nThe Internal Revenue Service has placed a tax lien on Melissa Harris-Perry and her husband, James Perry, for about $70,000 in delinquent taxes, according to a notice filed in Forsyth County Hall of Justice earlier this month.\nThe remaining debt, $48,581, covers a tax period ending Dec. 31, 2013, according to the notice.\nSuch prestigious titled chairs normally carry with them a very handsome salary, and I doubt that she works for free at MSNBC."}
