Those with the money have been cutting themselves so much of the money pie that half of us are poor or almost poor now. According to the US Census Bureau, half of Americans are poor, or just on the edge. Fifteen percent (46.5 million) are in poverty, while \u201chalf of Americans are in or near poverty.\u201d On top of that 76% of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nRepublicans constantly talk about how good the poor have it. In 2002 the Wall Street Journal called the poor \u201cLucky Duckies\u201d because they are \u201cthe beneficiaries\u201d of the progressive tax system and pay little or no taxes. But the reality is that it just plain sucks to be poor. It\u2019s actually more expensive not having enough money to get by. Here are nine examples of why it is expensive to be poor.\n\n1. Getting around. When you don\u2019t have the money to get a nice, reliable car you are stuck with time-consuming and not-inexpensive public transportation\u2014if it is available at all. Investment in public infrastructure has declined dramatically since the Reagan tax cuts, and that was a long time ago. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) \u201cInfrastructure Report Card\u201d gives our country\u2019s transit systems a D, saying, \u201c45% of American households lack any access to transit, and millions more have inadequate service levels.\u201d Additionally, \u201cdeficient and deteriorating transit systems cost the U.S. economy $90 billion in 2010, as many transit agencies are struggling to maintain aging and obsolete fleets and facilities amid an economic downturn that has reduced their funding, forcing service cuts and fare increases.\u201d\n\nThe alternative to relying on our crumbling and increasingly expensive-to-ride public transportation systems is finding an old beater to drive. Old cars break down and this costs money. It costs time. It can cost you a job. Lower-priced older cars will often be the ones that use a lot of gas, sometimes getting less than 20mpg. At today\u2019s gas prices and today\u2019s wages you\u2019re eating up an hour or more\u2019s pay every day just to get back and forth.\n\n2. A place to live. When you rent a typical apartment you have to pay the first month\u2019s rent, a security deposit and sometimes the last month\u2019s rent. You have to have a reference and usually a credit report. If you are poor you may not have any of these things, and you have to live somewhere else. That can be expensive. You might be in a week-to-week situation in a budget motel, requiring you to pay with a money order. Money orders cost money so you\u2019re even paying a fee to pay for your place to sleep. A 2012 McClatchy news story, Motel families live in limbo, explained,\n\nThey are not technically homeless. Yet they have no home beyond a week-to-week existence. Though comprehensive statistics are hard to come by, it\u2019s clear that this lifestyle is becoming more common.\u2026 Typically, these families can\u2019t afford the upfront costs of an apartment, so it\u2019s either a motel or a shelter or the street.\u2026 Some families move from motel to motel, often for years, trying to be closer to jobs or to escape the harsh culture that sometimes develops.\n\n3. Eating. Eating when you are poor is a problem. Of course, first is having money to get food at all. Then when you can get food you are faced with food choices that can lead to health problems. If you don\u2019t have fridge or a stove you might depend on cheap fast food. If you don\u2019t have a car (or gas for the broken-down car you have) you depend on what is nearby and local stores in bad neighborhoods are expensive compared to gleaming suburban supermarkets. Never mind buying in bulk at Costco, the membership fee alone is more than you can probably afford.\n\nMeanwhile Congress is cutting food assistance, forcing even more people to rely on local food banks. The problem is so bad that the food banks are overwhelmed, often running out of food completely. But food banks can\u2019t help people who don\u2019t have places to store or cook food\u2014they are out of luck.\n\n4. Banking. If you are poor you either don\u2019t have a bank account (8 percent of American households) or have one that costs so much your money drains away. 28.3% of Americans conduct at least some of their financial transactions \u201coutside of the mainstream banking system,\u201d meaning they have to rely on expensive alternatives like non-bank money orders, check-cashing services, prepaid debit cards and payday loans.\n\nFor the poor, even being lucky enough to have a bank account means high fees. You don\u2019t have enough to meet the minimum balance requirements so you pay a monthly fee that eats away at any money you have. You will pay a fee averaging $6 to cash your paycheck. You will be hit by terrible fees if the money runs out before the month does. Overdraft fees are incredible. A Pew graphic illustrates how the median overdraft for a $36 transaction racks up a median $35 in fees. \u201cIf an overdraft was treated like a short-term loan with a repayment period of seven days, then the annual percentage rate for a typical incidence would be over 5,000 percent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The poor are spending more on basic necessities like shelter, transportation and clothing \u2014 with a smaller paycheck", "title": "8 surprising ways poverty is absurdly expensive", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The poor are spending more on basic necessities like shelter, transportation and clothing \u2014 with a smaller paycheck", "title": "8 surprising ways poverty is absurdly expensive", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/03/8_surprising_ways_poverty_is_unbearably_expensive_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/poor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The poor are spending more on basic necessities like shelter, transportation and clothing \u2014 with a smaller paycheck", "title": "8 surprising ways poverty is absurdly expensive", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/poor.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dave Johnson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Capitalism, expensive, Greedy, Money, Politics, Poverty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc69d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Capitalism, expensive, Greedy, Money, Politics, Poverty, Politics NewsIt takes money to make money, they say, but if you don\u2019t have money you lose money.\nFifteen percent (46.5 million) are in poverty, while \u201chalf of Americans are in or near poverty.\u201d On top of that 76% of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\nHere are nine examples of why it is expensive to be poor.\nMoney orders cost money so you\u2019re even paying a fee to pay for your place to sleep.\nIt\u2019s actually more expensive not having enough money to get by."}
