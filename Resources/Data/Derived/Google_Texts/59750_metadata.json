Our broad legislative reach and their tax policy depth will enable us to offer our clients a comprehensive capability to lobby on the most complex tax matters,\" said Gordon Taylor, a principal at Ogilvy, in a statement. Ogilvy will acquire GDS clients, including Deltic Timber Corporation, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the National Association of Water Companies, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and two clients registered through Capitol Counsel.\n\nOgilvy had a tough 2012, with top lobbyists like John O\u2019Neill, Elena Tompkins, Drew Maloney, Justin Daly and others leaving the shop. But the firm is once again growing in terms of both personnel and clients. At the end of 2013, the firm reported more than 40 clients, including heavy hitters like Verizon, Viacom, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and Nike.\n\nGOOD TUESDAY AFTERNOON where it\u2019s been 375 years since the adoption of the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut \u2014 a document that some consider the first written constitution.

He co-founded the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates in 2000. Enron, the energy company that collapsed in scandal, was among his clients. He has not been a registered lobbyist since entering the Bush administration in 2007, but he continues to have corporate clients at his private firm. The Democratic Party of Virginia has been pressing for him to disclose his current clients and who paid him speaking fees in recent years. One lobbying client that Gillespie will likely face fire over is a coalition, funded by insurance companies, that suggested in 2007 the possibility of an individual health care mandate as part of a broader health care solution. Gillespie is adamant that he never personally supported such a mandate and notes that he has consistently opposed Obamacare. Republican allies of Gillespie respond that the new governor, McAuliffe, also founded a lobbying firm and prevailed in November despite that firm\u2019s work for tobacco companies, the lead industry and companies that wanted to dump waste. http://politi.co/1eGe21w\n\nALSO: A K Streeter faces the voters tonight.
