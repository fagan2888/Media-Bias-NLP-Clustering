The Dow Jones Industrial Average in May climbed to an all-time high, only a few months before shedding hundreds of points in one of the worst sell-offs the index has seen in years.\n\nThe Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the first time since 2006, and Congress managed to get just enough passed in the form of spending and budget legislation to avoid completely shutting down the government. But ports out West ground to a halt in the midst of an employment dispute, shutting down some of the nation's busiest trade hubs and contributing to gross domestic product shortfalls and inventory accumulation.\n\nWith more interest rate hikes expected and a presidential election on the way, 2016 is likely to be just as action-packed. John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial, expects the economy will continue to grow as consumer spending and wage gains continue to ramp up.\n\nCanally recently spoke with U.S. News about his forecast for the economy and the stock market. Excerpts:\n\n[READ: Older Workers to Dominate Labor Market by 2024]\n\nWhat should we expect out of the economy next year?\n\nThe things that'll be constant will be housing and the consumer. Those are going to follow over into 2016 and be as strong as they were in 2015. Housing's not a very big part of GDP \u2013 only about 5 percent \u2013 but it has added to growth pretty much since the housing market bottomed out in 2011. That, in and of itself, isn't enough to propel the economy. But if you add housing to consumer spending, it's closer to 75 percent.\n\nUSN&WR\n\nWe think the things still in place to help the consumer [spending] in 2015 will be there in 2016. For example, there's household net worth, which is if you add up everything people own \u2013 their houses, their cars, their boats, their planes, their yachts \u2013 and subtract out what they owe on all those things, that's about $85 trillion in the U.S. \u2013 the highest it's ever been. It's $20 trillion or so higher than it was at its prior peak in 2007, and it's $40 trillion or so higher than it was back in 2009, during the worst of the recession.\n\nSo households feel a lot wealthier, and that's driven by stock market gains, by people saving a little bit more, by people paying down debt and by home prices going up. All those things have driven up net worth. So the underpinnings are there for solid consumer spending.\n\nWhat negatives are expected to carry over into next year?\n\nCapital spending has been a disappointment the whole business cycle, starting back in 2009. Of course, you had the oil price collapse that crushed capital spending in the oil and gas industry. And while that's not a huge part of the overall economy, it did spread to a lot of parts of capital spending. That's likely to get worse before it gets better in 2016.\n\nA very strong dollar, though not as strong as in 2015, is likely to curtail exports. But there are some caveats. Europe has now found footing, thanks to quantitative easing by the eurozone. China seems to be easing [as well]. But exports aren't going to be a big plus.\n\nWhat should we expect out of the Federal Reserve? It looks like the Federal Open Market Committee is expecting to raise rates roughly four times next year.\n\nIf you traveled across the country and talked to business owners, one of the things you heard over the last couple of years was, 'Well, we don't want to do anything until we have clarity on the Fed.' Consumers said the same thing. Now we have clarity on where the Fed's going. The rate hike's out of the way, so now it's time to act on that. We think businesses and consumers will do that next year.\n\nWe're still looking at three or four more Fed rate hikes, inflation accelerating a bit, oil staying where it is now. By the end of 2016, the feeling around markets and the economy is going to be a lot like these last 12 months. It's not going to feel great, it's not going to look great.\n\nThis isn't the kind of environment where the economy grows at 3 percent and stocks are up 10 percent and bond markets are up 5 percent. We're not forecasting a recession for this year or the year after, but at this point in the cycle, it's more and more difficult to generate growth for companies and for the economy.\n\n[RELATED: It Does Not Pay to Be a Woman]\n\nAnalysts weren't thrilled when domestic monthly job growth fell short of the threshold of 200,000 additions in March and April and then August and September. But is slower growth something the market needs to get used to?\n\nI think so. One of the things that caught my attention this year that I hadn't taken into account before were some of the things Fed speakers were saying during the September/October/November period ahead of the December [FOMC] meeting. They were saying net job growth between 125,000 to 150,000 per month was sufficient for them to raise rates. They make the point that, at this point in the business cycle, a lot of the low-hanging fruit is gone. You have somewhat of a skills mismatch. The economy's added a great deal of jobs since the end of the downturn.\n\nI think that 125,000 to 150,000 range is what we have to get used to [even though] 200,000 is still that magic number. People see something below that and panic because we're slowing down. But enough Fed officials have said they're OK with 150,000 that eventually people are going to get used to 150,000. Seven or eight Fed speakers have gone out of their way to say that they expect the labor market to slow.\n\nI don't think that's going to have a huge impact on wages, because the labor market's already tight. Wages are going to be running much closer to 3 percent growth than 2 percent by the end of [next] year, and that should push up overall inflation. And that's good news for the consumer sector \u2013 that allows them to save more, spend more and pay down some debt.\n\nIf we get to a period of time where it's three or four or five months in a row where we're adding less than 100,000 [jobs], I think then you get concerned.\n\nStock market volatility has been a staple of 2015, especially with respect to the Fed's rate hike. Now that liftoff is out of the way, will the market swings ease up?\n\nIf you look back at the past rate hike cycles going all the way back to 1950, you tend to get volatility a couple of months before and a couple of months after the first Fed rate hike, and then markets generally go higher.\n\nIn fact, during nine of the last 10 rate hike cycles going back to 1950, stocks were about 10 percent higher a year after the first rate hike than they were on the day the Fed hiked rates. But if you go back a year before that first hike, stocks were up about 20 percent on average. So stocks are going to be up by less \u2013 that's one of the reasons why we're not projecting a whole lot of gains in the market next year. But I think volatility will continue until the market can get used to the Fed's pattern and cadence on rate increases.\n\nBut we're definitely in the final half of the business cycle. There are some indicators that say we're on the early side, some that say we're on the late side. But generally, it looks like we're in the middle to the late part. Generally, what you see there is an increase in volatility. And we think that's going to continue, not just around the Fed, but around oil prices and what's going on in emerging markets and the divergences of central banks. And there's still a big divergence between what the Fed says about rates and what the market says about rates. So that's a source of volatility there.\n\nI think if we're driving home in our cars at the end of the day and we turn on the radios, if the market's down a lot, you're going to hear 'Triple digit losses in the Dow.' But you have to remember that triple digit losses now are average. That only feeds the volatility and feeds the fear. The average listener is going to hear 'triple-digit loss' and think, 'Wow, that's a bad day,' and they'll take some action there.\n\n[RELATED: Housing Sector Sends Mixed Signals as New Home Sales Soar]\n\nHow will the presidential election factor into market performance?\n\nThe typical pattern in an election year is that the market swings up 10 percent to down 10 percent over the course of the year and doesn't really move higher until the result of the election is known, either via polls showing a candidate way up or via an election result. There's been a fourth-quarter rally in every election year since 1950 \u2013 except in 2008, and that was largely because we were in the Great Recession.\n\nWe don't know who the candidates are going to be or what their fall election platforms are going to be. Right now, they're kind of running at extremes on the far left and the far right. We don't know what they're going to come with when they have to run nationally. So the markets don't really know what to expect, and that's another reason for volatility.\n\nI have to say, though, the markets aren't paying much attention to the election right now. And they really won't until summer-ish when the nominees are more well-known. Post-primaries and pre-convention, somewhere around there.\n\nChina was a regular topic of conversation among economists this year. Its stock market swings spooked investors around the world, and its cooling economic growth has raised concerns of a global trade slowdown. What should be expected out of China next year?\n\nI think the one lesson we learned in 2015 relative to China was that we probably shouldn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to Chinese stock markets. They were a pretty poor indicator. Chinese stocks went up 140 to 150 percent between mid-2014 and mid-2015, and nobody said anything about it. Then when Chinese stocks went down by 30 percent to 40 percent between June and August, all of a sudden that was an indicator of a global recession.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Report [News]", "title": "Ask an Economist: What's on the Agenda for 2016?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "With a new year around the corner, an economist forecasts what's in store.", "title": "What Should Consumers Expect in 2016?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015-12-28/ask-an-economist-whats-on-the-agenda-for-2016", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a1/e4/5c5bcd6b4e41b508524424c26fd7/151228reportecon2016-editorial.econ2016.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "With a new year around the corner, an economist forecasts what's in store.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ask an Economist: What's on the Agenda for 2016?"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 28, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Andrew Soergel,The Report [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "With a new year around the corner, an economist forecasts what's in store."}, "article_summary": "We're still looking at three or four more Fed rate hikes, inflation accelerating a bit, oil staying where it is now.\nI don't think that's going to have a huge impact on wages, because the labor market's already tight.\nUSN&WRWe think the things still in place to help the consumer [spending] in 2015 will be there in 2016.\nAnd we think that's going to continue, not just around the Fed, but around oil prices and what's going on in emerging markets and the divergences of central banks.\nWith more interest rate hikes expected and a presidential election on the way, 2016 is likely to be just as action-packed."}
