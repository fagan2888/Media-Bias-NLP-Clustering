Judge Jeanine Pirro was on fire Saturday night when she described the frustration all Americans feel over the failed debut of the Affordable Care Act’s health care exchanges.

Conservatives are incensed because hundreds of millions of dollars have been flushed down the toilet, and everyone else is frustrated over the inability to even log on to the system, she said.

Pirro also railed over the fact that “Obamacare navigators” aren’t even given basic background checks before the public turns over its most private information.

“An outstanding warrant? No problem,” she said. “In the midst of a bankruptcy? No problem.”

Identity theft, anyone?

“We have spent $400 million on a system based on a 10-year-old technology that will need to be overhauled, from a company from Canada with a French name, who, by the way, doubled their profits in one quarter, so that none of us can sign up for this miraculous health care, which so many of us need,” she said. “This isn’t a glitch. It’s a damned disaster.”

Pirro also said the debacle was not only predictable, it was predicted — by the Government Accountability Office.

The final irony? “If you can’t sign on, you’ll make new friends — with the IRS,” she said.
