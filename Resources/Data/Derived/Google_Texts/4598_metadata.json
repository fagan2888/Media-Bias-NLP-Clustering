After all, they\u2019ve got to make up for all the vacation time they\u2019re not taking during their working days.\n\nNearly two-thirds of pre-retirees recently polled by the TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies said that they wanted to travel more in retirement, making that a more popular goal than spending time with friends or taking up new hobbies. \u201cOne of the top things our clients are looking for in retirement is the freedom to travel and investigate the world and have different experiences,\u201d says Brad Stark, co-founder of Mission Wealth in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\nTravelers age 50 and older planned to take four to five trips this year, spending a total $120 billion, according to AARP. More than half said they\u2019d save money specifically for travel, but 51 percent also said that costs were the biggest barrier to travel.\n\nThe TransAmerica poll found that only 34 percent of American workers are confident that they\u2019ll be able to retire with a financially comfortable lifestyle, a finding echoing dozens of other recent retirement surveys and reports.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean those visions of retirement travel are just pipe dreams, but it does mean that you\u2019ll need a plan to make it work. These seven tips will help you reach your objective:\n\n1. Start planning before you retire. Rather than just saying \u201cI want to travel in retirement,\u201d think about what that would actually involve. \u201cYou need to know how grand the aspirations are, because ultimately, that will impact how expensive the travel will be,\u201d says Joe Jennings, wealth director at PNC Wealth Management.\n\nRelated: How to Fund the Retirement Travel Bug\n\nGetting as specific as possible about your travel plans will not only make you more likely to properly prepare, but they\u2019ll also motivate you to actually travel rather than just talk about it. Americans who have a savings plan with specific goals are nearly three times as likely to save successfully than those without specific goals.\n\n2. Plan for the \u201cno-go years.\u201d Retirees often think that they\u2019ll be able to travel throughout their retirement, but planners say that most people tend to slow down once they hit advanced years. Consumers over aged 70 told AARP that health concerns are the biggest thing preventing them from taking the trips that they want.\n\nDon Roy of New England Wealth Advisors says he asks clients to think of travel in retirement in three phases, \u201cthe go-go years, the slow-go years, and the no-go years.\u201d Travel funds in the third phase often get redistributed to cover health care expenses or other costs that tend to hit in old age\n\n3. Calculate costs -- and factor in inflation. Once you\u2019ve decided what kind of travel you\u2019d like to do in retirement, do some research to get a sense of how much such trips would cost. A weeklong trip to Europe for a couple can run $5,000 for flight and airfare alone, while a big, multi-generational trip could run three times that. The cumulative cost of annual vacations over the course of a long retirement can easily reach six figures.\n\nGive yourself a cushion of at least 20 percent and allow for inflation. If you end up with too much money, you can always upgrade your trip. \u201cPeople have a tendency to underestimate the costs of travel, and that\u2019s where problems arise,\u201d says Kathleen Hastings, a certified financial planner and portfolio manager with FBB Capital Partners.\n\n4. Downsize early. Funding your travel budget, of course, has to happen after you\u2019ve met all the non-discretionary obligations in your budget like housing and health care costs, which tend to grow disproportionately to income in retirement. If you don\u2019t have enough cash to make that happen, you\u2019ll need to decide whether travel is worth making big lifestyle changes, such as taking on part-time work or downsizing your home.\n\nMoving to a smaller home or one in a less expensive area could save you hundreds each month. (You can get a sense of how much with this calculator from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.) The sooner you make that move, the longer you\u2019ll be able to stash that extra money in your travel fund.\n\nRelated: Retirement Nomads: How One Couple Makes It Work\n\n5. Travel while everyone else is working. One of the great things about retirement is that you\u2019re not beholden to anyone else\u2019s schedule. That means that you can take late morning flights or book a room in the off-season to realize substantial savings.\n\nIt\u2019s usually cheaper to fly between Monday through Wednesday, rather than Thursday through Saturday. Flying from or to a smaller airport or on a connecting flight also usually costs less. You might also save money buying two one-way tickets as opposed to a round trip. The more flexible you are, the sweeter deal you\u2019ll find.\n\nBe sure to ask about discounts when booking. Whether you\u2019re booking a hotel room, renting a car or even buying a plane ticket, many travel vendors offer discounts for AAA or AARP, veterans or other groups. If you qualify, be sure to ask if a discount exists.\n\n6. Consider insurance. If you\u2019re taking a large trip, spring for travel insurance. Health issues that could derail a planned trip become more common among older travelers, and travel insurance lets you recover some of the cost of a trip missed for a medical reason.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be overseas for a long period of time, you may also want to get a travel health insurance plan that covers costs in the country to which you\u2019re traveling. Some Medicare supplemental insurance plans provide this kind of coverage, but most do not.\n\n7. Manage your rewards cards. Especially as a retiree, you shouldn\u2019t be taking on debt to pay for discretionary items like a vacation. However, if you have the funds to cover the cost of the trip, using a rewards credit card to pay for the vacation (and paying it off in full when the bill comes) is an easy way to earn cash back or travel rewards you can apply to your next vacation. \u201cManaging your miles and hotel loyalty programs can also save you some money,\u201d says Larry Rosenthal, president of Rosenthal Wealth Management Group.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The dream of traveling in retirement -- whether that means relaxing on a beach or hiki", "title": "Want to Travel When You Retire? 7 Tips on How to Pay for It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/17/Want-Travel-When-You-Retire-7-Tips-How-Pay-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07192011_Retirement_myths_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/17/Want-Travel-When-You-Retire-7-Tips-How-Pay-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07192011_Retirement_myths_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The dream of traveling in retirement -- whether that means relaxing on a beach or hiki", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1421\"", "article_summary": "More than half said they\u2019d save money specifically for travel, but 51 percent also said that costs were the biggest barrier to travel.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean those visions of retirement travel are just pipe dreams, but it does mean that you\u2019ll need a plan to make it work.\nRelated: How to Fund the Retirement Travel BugGetting as specific as possible about your travel plans will not only make you more likely to properly prepare, but they\u2019ll also motivate you to actually travel rather than just talk about it.\nIf you\u2019re taking a large trip, spring for travel insurance.\nRather than just saying \u201cI want to travel in retirement,\u201d think about what that would actually involve."}
