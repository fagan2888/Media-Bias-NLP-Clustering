The farm bill needs to pass. The immigration bill is hugely important to the economy. So I'm hoping that coming out of this, we can find the places where we can work together.\u201d\n\nBut striking a different note was Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who said, \u201cthe real problem is that we\u2019re continuing to spend money that we don\u2019t have on things that we don\u2019t need. There\u2019s tremendous amounts of waste and fraud. We have to protect the promises made to the American people and we can do that \u2013 but we can do that (by) spending a whole lot less money than we\u2019re doing today.\u201d\n\nCoburn also reflected on the impasse that ended Wednesday when both houses of Congress passed a bill to allow discretionary spending to continue until Jan. 15, after Republicans finally conceded that they lacked the votes to force Obama to accede to cuts or delays in the landmark 2010 health insurance law, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think focusing on Obamacare takes you away from the larger picture,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cWe have a $128 trillion of unfunded liabilities (for programs such as Medicare) and the total net worth of our country is $94 trillion \u2013 and we have another $17 trillion worth of debt\u201d\n\nOn ABC\u2019s This Week, former Florida governor Jeb Bush voiced similar sentiments about the just-ended standoff: \u201cIt was a mistake to focus on something that couldn't be achieved\u2026. I would argue that allowing Obamacare to be implemented, two things would happen. One, it would be so dysfunctional if it was implemented faithfully that it would be clear for more people. Or\u2026 it couldn't be implemented because the government is not capable of doing it. It looks like that, the latter rather than the former, may be happening. But that was all crowded out by a miscalculation of using something that shouldn't be used, the debt ceiling limit and the continuation of the budget.\u201d\n\nCoburn also contended that Obamacare \u201cis going to fail on its own right\u2026. The sick people are signing up, the healthy aren\u2019t -- and they\u2019re not going to because the deductibles are so high and the costs are going to be high. And the penalty is not great enough to force them to do it.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Charles Schumer, D- N.Y. said there\u2019s \u201chuge interest\u201d in enrolling for coverage under Obamacare: \u201c19 million individual visits to the website, that\u2019s huge. Close to 500,000 people already filing applications, even with the computer glitches.\u201d\n\nHe said the problems with the Obamacare HealthCare.gov enrollment portal \u201cwill be fixed\u201d in a matter of weeks. \u201cIf you need health care, the fact that you couldn\u2019t get on the computer right away isn\u2019t going to stop you two or three weeks from now when they\u2019re fixed\u2026.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC NewsTreasury Secretary Jack Lew said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that President Barack Obama will keep trying to undo or ease the cuts in spending that he reluctantly signed into law as part of the Budget Control Act in 2011.\u201cThere's no question that the deep spending cuts that are part of sequestration are holding back the economy,\u201d Lew said.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/treasury-secretary-says-obama-will-keep-trying-ease-spending-cuts-f8C11426772", "type": "article", "image": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC NewsTreasury Secretary Jack Lew said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that President Barack Obama will keep trying to undo or ease the cuts in spending that he reluctantly signed into law as part of the Budget Control Act in 2011.\u201cThere's no question that the deep spending cuts that are part of sequestration are holding back the economy,\u201d Lew said."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC NewsTreasury Secretary Jack Lew said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that President Barack Obama will keep trying to undo or ease the cuts in spending that he reluctantly signed into law as part of the Budget Control Act in 2011.\u201cThere's no question that the deep spending cuts that are part of sequestration are holding back the economy,\u201d Lew said.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}, "title": "Treasury secretary says Obama will keep trying to ease spending cuts - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-20", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/treasury-secretary-says-obama-will-keep-trying-ease-spending-cuts-f8C11426772", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Other"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfb1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere's no question that the deep spending cuts that are part of sequestration are holding back the economy,\u201d Lew said.\n\u201cThere's a lot we need to do to build and grow this economy,\u201d Lew said.\nHe indicated that Obama still had ambitions to increase federal spending in some areas.\nBy Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC NewsTreasury Secretary Jack Lew said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that President Barack Obama will keep trying to undo or ease the cuts in spending that he reluctantly signed into law as part of the Budget Control Act in 2011.\nOne, it would be so dysfunctional if it was implemented faithfully that it would be clear for more people."}
