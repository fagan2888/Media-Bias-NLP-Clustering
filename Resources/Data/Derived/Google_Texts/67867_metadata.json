Castor promised her betrayal would help Mark, and they could be together again. Maybe I should have seen this coming; Gracie was looking very serious and almost mournful most of the episode leading up to her apologetic, confessional goodbye call to Cosima.\n\nHands down, though, the biggest jaw-dropping moment of the episode is when we finally learn that the Castor original is\u2026\u2026[drum roll]\u2026..Mrs. S\u2019s mom. WHAT?!?!? As if that weren\u2019t enough of a twist, Mrs. S\u2019s mom, named Kendall Malone, is also the Leda original. She\u2019s a chimera \u2013 she absorbed a male twin in the womb when she was formed and has two cell lines. (This really happens and, by many reports, isn\u2019t as rare as once believed.)\n\nTatiana Maslany as Sarah, Maria Doyle Kennedy as Mrs. S, and Alison Steadman as Kendall Malone in \u201cOrphan Black\u201d BBC America\n\nAll of this prompts tons of questions which may or may not get answered next week: Siobhan Sadler is Sarah\u2019s adoptive mom, but is she now also a genetic sister? (And possibly brother? So confusing.) Does Mrs. S herself have genetic material that could potentially be used for a cure? We still don\u2019t know why Siobhan tracked down Sarah and Felix at an orphanage in the first place or what made her run from London. Just how did she initially get involved in all this?\n\nAs for our clones, we don\u2019t see Rachel or Krystal this episode. But we do finally see Mark again when he swoops Judas Gracie into a hug. Meanwhile, Rudy is starting to glitch.\n\nA clone-by-clone breakdown of the rest:\n\nSARAH: In London. Traveling with Mrs. S and Felix, she visits Mrs. S\u2019s old stomping grounds, where the three share pints \u2013 and a song! \u2013 at The Bayonette. Mrs. S has a great voice. Who knew? Early on, courtesy of Mrs. S\u2019s friend Terrance, we learn the meaning of the mysterious \u201cH46239\u201d number \u2014 it was a prisoner ID number, from before Britain changed the numbering system in the 1980s. Who is the prisoner? Terrance apparently finds out but is tortured to death by creepy Ferdinand and his creepier bushy-eyebrowed, bald henchman before he can he can pass along what he learned. Or maybe not. What does he whisper to Mrs. S with his final breaths? We have to assume it is the secret Sarah susses out after calling a number she finds in Terrance\u2019s phone. Mrs. S had told Felix and Sarah they are leaving London and to wait for her at the pub. But Sarah is convinced Castor is getting closer which is all the more reason to push on.\n\nTatiana Maslany as Sarah in \u201cOrphan Black\u201d BBC America\n\nHer investigations eventually lead her to the address of one Kendall Malone, convicted of aggravated homicide in 1981 and paroled in 2007. With Felix standing lookout, Sarah breaks into the Malone residence. Does she plan to kill the Castor original as Felix fears and Mrs S. has vowed to do? She does have a gun. Or does she just want to try to collect some genetic material or maybe talk? An older woman with a knife finds Sarah snooping through the house and thinks she\u2019s a junkie out to rob her. Then, at about the time we learn that this woman is in fact Kendall Malone, Mrs. S comes in, tells Sarah to put down the gun and tells the woman, \u201cHello, Mother.\u201d (Finding out this lady was Siobhan\u2019s mom was the second time of the night that I yelled at my TV screen in surprise. The first was the Gracie reveal. The third was finding out that Mrs. S\u2019s mom is the both the Castor and Leda originals. Mind blown.) Mrs. S doesn\u2019t back down from her determination to kill the Castor original, even if it is her own mother. But Sarah stops her. \u201cSo, if your mom has two cell lines, she\u2019s our original too. We need her. She\u2019s Leda.\u201d\n\nTatiana Maslany as Helena in \u201cOrphan Black\u201d BBC America\n\nHELENA: Unleashes her inner assassin. She\u2019s been \u201cwalking a new path,\u201d trying to set aside her murderous ways \u2014 even if she has to be reminded from time to time to, oh, not teach Gemma Hendrix how to gouge out someone\u2019s eyes. She seems truly happy in her new life with the Hendrix family. But she isn\u2019t naive. She knows something is up with \u201cdrug dealers and money, money, money, tsk-tsk.\u201d Upon learning Donnie did all this for his family, though, she softens \u2013 up until the moment she learns that Jason Kellerman\u2019s henchman took her nitrogen tank. She tells Donnie about her babies, and he promises to get them back. \u201cAlison won\u2019t like this,\u201d Helena says. Donnie responds that he doesn\u2019t care: \u201cIt\u2019s a dad decision, for the family, and you\u2019re a part of it now.\u201d But Donnie, unsurprisingly, bumbles through returning the pills, stupidly asking for a refund. After he takes too long, Helena comes to his aid. She is trying \u2013 poorly \u2014 to impersonate Alison. (She blames her accent on a cold, one of those really nasty ones that, as Donnie says, \u201cmesses with your syntax.\u201d) As they are leaving with Helena\u2019s eggs, Pouchy\u2019s niece makes a fatal mistake: she says she knows where Gemma and Oscar go to school. If Alison is the mother hen, Helena is the momma bear ready to turn deadly to her protect her children \u2013 or the children of her sisters. \u201cDid you threaten babies?\u201d Helena shoves Donnie out the door with the nitrogen tank. \u201cYou should not threaten babies.\u201d She emerges from Pouchy\u2019s covered in blood, wielding what looks to be the paper-cutter blade that threatened Donnie\u2019s nose two episodes back. \u201cI got refund,\u201d she tells him, handing over a huge bag of cash.\n\nCOSIMA: Made a mistake. She finally starts to suspect Shay may not be what she seems to be, and that suspicion nearly gets Shay killed. (If we hadn\u2019t seen Shay in the \u201cnext time\u201d previews, I\u2019d almost think Delphine killed her anyway. Shay, post-interrogation, knows too much, and Delphine seemed really fond of caressing that razor blade, even after Cosima told her the mole wasn\u2019t Shay.)\n\nALISON: On the campaign trail. And she now has a freezer full of a LOT of drug money.\n\nMiscellaneous thoughts, factoids and observations:\n\n*This week\u2019s episode-title Eisenhower quote: \u201cAs we peer into society\u2019s future, we \u2014 you and I, and our government \u2014 must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\u201d\n\n*In genetics, a chimera is an organism with genetically distinct cells. In Greek mythology, the Chimera was a fire-breathing monster usually depicted as part lion, goat and snake. Could this be what Prof. Duncan meant in his clue about \u201cthe beast, the cursed\u201d?\n\n*Mrs. S\u2019s mom went to prison for killing John Sadler, with whom Siobhan eloped at a young age. We learned a while back that John died after getting gardening shears through the throat during a drunken fight. But, until tonight, we didn\u2019t know who exactly killed him.\n\n*More dancing clones please! First there was last season\u2019s clone dance party, then Donnie and Alison\u2019s ultra-hilarious twerking scene and now we have Helena delightfully donning goggles and an apron, dancing around the Hendrix garage to \u201cYou Baby\u201d by The Turtles. Maybe the Clone Club should start its own dance team.\n\n*One of the envelopes Sarah sees addressed to Kendall Malone has a return address that appears to be from a J. Clement. There is a Jody Lynn Clement who is an art director on the show. Coincidence or sly Easter egg?\n\nNEXT WEEK: The season finale!!", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Speakeasy's latest recap of BBC America's clone drama,\"Orphan Black.\"", "title": "\u2018Orphan Black\u2019 Season 3, Episode 9, \u2018Insolvent Phantom of Tomorrow\u2019: TV Recap", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/06/13/orphan-black-season-3-episode-9-insolvent-phantom-of-tomorrow-tv-recap/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IW981_0613or_P_20150612123337.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "\u2018Orphan Black\u2019 Season 3, Episode 9, \u2018Insolvent Phantom of Tomorrow\u2019: TV Recap", "description": "Speakeasy's latest recap of BBC America's clone drama,\"Orphan Black.\"", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Jennifer Hodson", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Speakeasy's latest recap of BBC America's clone drama,\"Orphan Black.\"", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-14T02:00:26-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/06/13/orphan-black-season-3-episode-9-insolvent-phantom-of-tomorrow-tv-recap/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-89396", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Speakeasy's latest recap of BBC America's clone drama,\"Orphan Black.\"", "title": "\u2018Orphan Black\u2019 Season 3, Episode 9, \u2018Insolvent Phantom of Tomorrow\u2019: TV Recap", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/06/13/orphan-black-season-3-episode-9-insolvent-phantom-of-tomorrow-tv-recap/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IW981_0613or_P_20150612123337.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-89396", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-13T04:26:45-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Traveling with Mrs. S and Felix, she visits Mrs. S\u2019s old stomping grounds, where the three share pints \u2013 and a song!\nDoes Mrs. S herself have genetic material that could potentially be used for a cure?\n*Mrs. S\u2019s mom went to prison for killing John Sadler, with whom Siobhan eloped at a young age.\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough of a twist, Mrs. S\u2019s mom, named Kendall Malone, is also the Leda original.\nHands down, though, the biggest jaw-dropping moment of the episode is when we finally learn that the Castor original is\u2026\u2026[drum roll]\u2026..Mrs. S\u2019s mom."}
