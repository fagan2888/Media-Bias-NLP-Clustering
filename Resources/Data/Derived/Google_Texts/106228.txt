Jabril Trawick scored six consecutive points to hand Georgetown (12-5, 4-2 Big East) a 37-36 lead, and Copeland followed with the Hoyas’ next seven to make it 44-38 with 12:38 left. The Bulldogs rallied to go up 48-47, the first of 10 lead changes over the final 8:48.

Roosevelt Jones’ layup gave Butler its final lead with 12 seconds left before Copeland followed with his big 3-pointer. Jones then drove down the floor but Smith-Rivera shadowed him and rejected Jones’ layup.
