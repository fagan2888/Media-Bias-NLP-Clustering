Chivukula spoke to the gathered attendees about the state of his campaign, saying that he considered himself to have a good shot at winning the seat to represent New Jersey\u2019s 12th Congressional District.\n\nChivukula, a Democrat, is vying for the seat that is currently occupied by Rep. Rush Holt, also a Democrat. Holt announced several weeks ago that he would not seek re-election this year, and Chivukula announced shortly afterward that he would seek to claim the seat for himself. Other Democrats have also entered the fray, however, including New Jersey Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, State Senator Linda Greenstein, and local businessman Brian Hughes.\n\nChivukula\u2019s campaign has run on the tenets of economic growth, educational reform, and defending the Affordable Care Act. Last month, he announced that he would support the legalization of marijuana, which was proposed by New Jersey Senator Nick Scutari. He also announced that he would support initiatives to increase the number of students getting into STEM fields, and will work to alleviate poverty throughout his district.\n\nThe 12th Congressional District covers Middlesex and Somerset counties, the latter of which is where he resides. It also includes portions of Mercer and Union counties, as well as Princeton, Monroe Township, East Windsor, and South Brunswick.\n\nAn engineer by training, Chivukula is originally from Nellore, India. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Guindy Engineering College in Chennai, and his master\u2019s degree in the same field from the City College of New York. He is also a graduate of the Emerging Leaders Program at the University of Virginia.\n\nChivukula is currently a New Jersey State Assemblyman, a seat for which he has consistently won re-election every two years since 2001. He previously ran for the US House of Representatives, for New Jersey\u2019s 7th Congressional District, in 2012, but lost that race to Republican Leonard Lance.\n\nFor now, Chivukula is hoping to raise one million dollars for his campaign, which he says will be enough to buy him air time and push him over the edge for the June 3rd Democratic primary.\n\nTo contact the author, email to editor@americanbazaaronline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey Congressional candidate Upendra Chivukula held a fundraiser for his campaign at the Hampton Inn in Stamford, Connecticut, during which the campaign received over $5,000 in donations.", "og": {"site_name": "The American Bazaar", "description": "New Jersey Congressional candidate Upendra Chivukula held a fundraiser for his campaign at the Hampton Inn in Stamford, Connecticut, during which the campaign received over $5,000 in donations.", "title": "CT fundraiser for NJ congressional candidate Upendra Chivukula raises more than $5,000 - The American Bazaar", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 582, "identifier": "http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Upendra-Chivukula-slider.jpg", "height": 216}, "updated_time": "2014-04-18T08:37:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2014/04/10/ct-fundraiser-nj-congressional-candidate-upendra-chivukula-raises-5000/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey Congressional candidate Upendra Chivukula held a fundraiser for his campaign at the Hampton Inn in Stamford, Connecticut, during which the campaign received over $5,000 in donations.", "title": "CT fundraiser for NJ congressional candidate Upendra Chivukula raises more than $5,000 - The American Bazaar", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Upendra-Chivukula-slider.jpg?fit=582%2C216", "creator": "@ambazaarmag", "site": "@ambazaarmag", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 1161740282, "pages": 306602469441616}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/www.americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-54e9586cv1_site_icon.png?fit=270%2C270", "keywords": "CT fundraiser,Upendra Chivukula,congressional candidate,fundraiser program,local community", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/americanbazaaronline", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Upendra Chivukula", "published_time": "2014-04-10T11:20:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-18T08:37:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "congressional candidate, ct fundraiser, fundraiser program, local community, upendra chivukula"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3a6\"", "article_summary": "By The American Bazaar StaffNEW YORK: New Jersey Congressional candidate Upendra Chivukula held a fundraiser for his campaign at the Hampton Inn in Stamford, Connecticut, during which the campaign received over $5,000 in donations.\nChivukula is currently a New Jersey State Assemblyman, a seat for which he has consistently won re-election every two years since 2001.\nOther Democrats have also entered the fray, however, including New Jersey Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, State Senator Linda Greenstein, and local businessman Brian Hughes.\nLast month, he announced that he would support the legalization of marijuana, which was proposed by New Jersey Senator Nick Scutari.\nHolt announced several weeks ago that he would not seek re-election this year, and Chivukula announced shortly afterward that he would seek to claim the seat for himself."}
