SALT LAKE CITY -- Republican frontrunner Donald Trump will be in Salt Lake City for an event Friday evening, and several hours prior he took to Twitter to promote the rally while also taking a shot at Ted Cruz.

Trump will be speaking at the Infinity Events Center in Salt Lake City at 7 p.m., and while some Utahns are ready to show their support, others plan to protest. Friday afternoon he tweeted about the rally while claiming members of The LDS Church don't like liars and calling out Ted Cruz as such.

"Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary" the candidate tweeted.

Watch FOX 13 for live coverage of Trump's event at 7 p.m. The event will also be streamed live on FOX13now.com. FOX 13 News' Max Roth spoke with some of the folks waiting in line Friday afternoon, see the video above for his report.

After the jab at Cruz, who will be in Utah for several events on Saturday, Trump set his sights on Romney. The former Massachusetts Governor said Friday he would vote for Cruz in Utah, where Romney resides, and has previously drawn ire from Trump for promoting a Republican nominating strategy of anyone but Trump.

Primaries for both Republicans and Democrats in Utah will be held Tuesday.
