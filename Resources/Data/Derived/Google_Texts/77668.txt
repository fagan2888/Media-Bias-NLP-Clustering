Eye in the Sky, the highly praised new thriller from Oscar-winning director Gavin Hood starring Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, and the late Alan Rickman, is expanding from 123 sites to 1,027 this weekend.

This "quintessential modern war film" takes viewers into the secretive world of military operations, forcing the audience to wrestle with the moral, legal, and political questions surrounding a single drone mission.

Hood sat down with Reason TV's Meredith Bragg for an in-depth discussion about the film and the urgent need for a national conversation about drone warfare.

Approximately 11 minutes.

Produced and Edited by Meredith Bragg.
