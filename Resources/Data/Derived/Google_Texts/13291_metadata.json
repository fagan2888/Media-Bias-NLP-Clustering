Happening just before the United Nations holds a summit on climate change, the real goal of the march is to show convening world leaders that climate change isn\u2019t just a policy issue that matters only to scientists and policy wonks. The idea is to show that climate action is a populist movement, too\u2014and one that\u2019s capable of making some noise.\n\nWhile it might not get the same level of attention as the summit itself, the march is no mere sideshow. Elected officials often treat climate change as an isolated policy area\u2014a distraction from the broader economic, humane, and stability challenges of our time. Environmentalists have tried and failed to change that perception, working within the political system and on their own. This march represents a different approach. It\u2019s bringing in religious groups, labor unions, students, and social justice organizations\u2014in order to show that support for fighting climate change is broad. In many ways, this effort mirrors the (so far) successful grassroots tactics of bringing attention to environmental and climate concerns like the Keystone XL pipeline and the growing fossil fuel divestment movement.\n\nThe People\u2019s Climate March just has an even more ambitious target.\n\nRemember, the next year is a critical one for fighting climate change. We know that at some point, very soon, humans will need to slow their use of fossil fuels if we hope to contain global warming to a manageable level. Somehow that needs to be balanced with China and India\u2019s interests in economic and population growth. Climate experts and poorer countries hit hard by extreme weather want a binding global deal to reach emissions targets. To get there, there will be another UN meeting in Peru in December, leading up to Paris in 2015, where\u2014activists hope\u2014an agreement can be finalized.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Why an upcoming demonstration in NYC is so important", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "What the largest climate march in history can and can't do.", "title": "Climate Change Is About to Have a Populist Moment", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/8dcdfcc03375614aedb2f30d405ad8b5b6bbcef0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119421/nyc-peoples-climate-march-what-expect", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What the largest climate march in history can and can't do.", "title": "Climate Change Is About to Have a Populist Moment", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/8dcdfcc03375614aedb2f30d405ad8b5b6bbcef0.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@rebleber", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/8dcdfcc03375614aedb2f30d405ad8b5b6bbcef0.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Climate Change Is About to Have a Populist Moment\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119421/nyc-peoples-climate-march-what-expect\",\"section\":\"QEDaily\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-12T12:28:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119421,\"author\":\"Rebecca Leber\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"QEDaily\",\"Politics\",\"QED\",\"Climate\",\"Climate Change\",\"United Nations\",\"New York City\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "QEDaily", "published_time": "2014-09-12"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ee1\"", "article_summary": "Nine days from now, on September 21, organizers of the largest climate change march in history expect at least one hundred thousand of people to join the People\u2019s Climate March in New York City.\nIt\u2019s bringing in religious groups, labor unions, students, and social justice organizations\u2014in order to show that support for fighting climate change is broad.\nThe People\u2019s Climate March just has an even more ambitious target.\nRemember, the next year is a critical one for fighting climate change.\nHappening just before the United Nations holds a summit on climate change, the real goal of the march is to show convening world leaders that climate change isn\u2019t just a policy issue that matters only to scientists and policy wonks."}
