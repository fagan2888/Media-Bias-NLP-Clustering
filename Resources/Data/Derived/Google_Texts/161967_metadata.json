His signature achievement, on the other hand, failed its tech tests. Draw your own conclusions, says Lloyd Green.\n\nIf the train-wreck rollout of Obamacare teaches us anything, it\u2019s that President Obama is just not that into governing. While the president\u2019s 2012 campaign was the handiwork of technology\u2019s best and brightest, Obamacare looks more like a taxpayer-funded redheaded stepchild.\n\nAccording to \u201cInside the Cave,\u201d the postmortem on the Obama campaign's technology operations, repeated testing and excellence were the rules of the road for the president\u2019s reelection efforts. Chiding the Romney campaign for its never-tested ORCA debacle, the Obamaites were deservedly praised for their persistent meticulousness: \u201cObama 2012 didn\u2019t have the magic of hope and change. What it did have was a relentless focus on operational excellence and massive scale.\u201d\n\nToo bad the campaign didn\u2019t mentor Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and her minions on the need for testing or the necessity of making sure the Obamacare portal worked before it was unleashed on the world. Apparently, HealthCare.gov was only tested at the last minute, and then it failed miserably and crashed when \u201cjust a few hundred people tried to log on simultaneously.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Department of Health and Human Services had added to the system\u2019s woes when it demanded in September that visitors to HealthCare.gov create accounts \u201cin order to browse its insurance offerings\u201d and then rescinded that directive. At the campaign, things were different.\n\nThere was \u201cconstant testing to handle outages and heavy loads.\u201d There was also foresight. On October 21, 2012, the campaign tech team \u201cconducted a drill known as \u2018Game Day\u2019 that helped them address several worst case scenarios. The following week, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the US and caused critical infrastructure to go offline, but because they had prepared for the worst, the team was able to keep the site up.\u201d\n\nThe campaign had even prepared for Amazon\u2019s data center crashing in the midst of the storm: \u201c\u2018Game Days\u2019 were disaster preparedness exercises where DevOps simulated nightmare scenarios, such as a catastrophic database failure or Amazon\u2019s East Coast data center going offline.\u201d\n\nOne might conclude the folks who gave us Obamacare never read \u201cInside the Cave,\u201d and if they did, they readily ignored its lessons. A key government contractor, CGI, was described as having as its \u201cultimate aim\u201d establishing \u201crelations so intimate with the client that decoupling becomes almost impossible.\u201d Apparently, it low-balled demand and only \u201cbuilt the shopping and enrollment applications to accommodate 60,000 users at the same time.\u201d\n\nIn all fairness, however, CGI had been developing software to allow consumers to shop on the site anonymously but was told by federal officials in September to \u201cdeprioritize\u201d that function, according to The Wall Street Journal. As for the government agency in charge of the project, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS), it \u201cassumed the role of managing the 55 contractors involved and had not ensured that all the pieces were working together.\u201d\n\nThe contrast with those entrusted with the campaign could not have been starker. Again, in their own immodest but accurate words: Obama for America \u201cdidn\u2019t hire your typical political staffer. They went directly to Silicon Valley and to data analysts in the Fortune 500 and academia. One used to work at Pixar. Another was a high-energy particle physicist.\u201d\n\nA senior federal career civil servant explained things to me this way, \u201cCMMS was not able to simply recruit the best and brightest firms in Silicon Valley.\u201d Unlike the federal government, \u201cthe campaign was not hobbled by the hundreds of pages of Federal Acquisition Regulations in hiring government contractors.\u201d At best, contrasting the campaign to the government was akin to \u201ccomparing apples and oranges.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s stipulate, the Obama campaign rocked. It was awesomely awesome in its awesomeness. Obamacare? More like used tinker toys in a world of killer apps and drones.\n\nAnd while the GOP is now disfavored, if not despised, by most Americans who also want to dislodge John Boehner from the House speakership, activist government overall isn\u2019t doing too well, either. According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, \u201cFifty-six percent of Americans say the Web site problems are part of a broader problem with the law\u2019s implementation.\u201d\n\nAll of this raises a few more questions, such as whether the federal government can do more than collect taxes, make transfer payments, wage war, and engineer the reelection of incumbents. How wrong is the Tea Party, irate and ill-tempered as it may be, in its critique of government operations? And what was Obama telling us about himself, his vanity, and his view of the country, as he delivered his 2008 acceptance speech before a replica of a Greek temple?\n\nWell, at Monday\u2019s Obamacare event, POTUS was definitely not looking like Zeus. Rather, he seemed more like a carny barker trying to hawk a Ronco Vegematic as he touted the supposed merits of the Affordable Care Act. Like the guy trying to sell you knives at 2 a.m., the president was telling people to dial in to an 800 number for even faster results, and then the switchboard clogged, sending callers back to the website.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Obamacare, Technology, Department of Health and Human Services, u.s. poli, 2012 Election, Kathleen Sebelius", "publicationDate": 201310230945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The 2012 Obama campaign deservedly tooted its own horn for meticulous tech prep.
