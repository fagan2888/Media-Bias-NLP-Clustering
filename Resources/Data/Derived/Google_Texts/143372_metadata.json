Governor Anthony Brown has won the Democratic primary to become that party\u2019s nominee for Governor of Maryland.\n\njust so we're all clear, Maryland Democrats chose the guy who failed to build their Obamacare website to be governor http://t.co/DQDG4gdFyc \u2014 Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) June 25, 2014\n\nYes, that Anthony Brown. He had one job as Lt. Governor which was meant to cement his credentials for becoming Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s successor. In the end Maryland spent at least $125 million to build a non-working web site only to abandon it and start over using software Connecticut used to build theirs. He \u201cexplained\u201d his role in the project during one of the primary debates.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t very cooperative with the press though.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JGreenDC/status/481606931665408000\n\n.@JGreenDC @conncarroll I hope Hogan can rip Brown for ObamaCare but we are talking MD voters here. Smh. \u2014 Spencer Irvine (@SpencerIrvine) June 25, 2014\n\nVoted today in Maryland Primary. It is disheartening to see low voter turnout in a state that so desperately needs to vote out Liberals:-( \u2014 Pat White Foster (@patfo49) June 24, 2014\n\n@JGreenDC it's so ridiculous. No wonder there's a mass exodus to NoVa. \u2014 Spencer Irvine (@SpencerIrvine) June 25, 2014\n\nSad.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Dems nominate guy who botched state Obamacare exchange to be MD governor - twitchy.com", "og": {"site_name": "twitchy.com", "description": "He had one job.", "title": "Dems nominate guy who botched state Obamacare exchange to be MD governor - twitchy.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/anthony-brown.jpg", "url": "http://twitchy.com/jimj-3633/2014/06/24/dems-nominate-guy-who-botched-state-obamacare-exchange-to-be-md-governor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "twitchy.com", "description": "He had one job.", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/anthony-brown.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dems nominate guy who botched state Obamacare exchange to be MD governor - twitchy.com"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/largetile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/widetile.png", "article": {"section": "US Politics", "tag": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-06-24T22:35:12+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd60bc\"", "article_summary": "Governor Anthony Brown has won the Democratic primary to become that party\u2019s nominee for Governor of Maryland.\n@JGreenDC @conncarroll I hope Hogan can rip Brown for ObamaCare but we are talking MD voters here.\njust so we're all clear, Maryland Democrats chose the guy who failed to build their Obamacare website to be governor http://t.co/DQDG4gdFyc \u2014 Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) June 25, 2014Yes, that Anthony Brown.\n\u2014 Spencer Irvine (@SpencerIrvine) June 25, 2014Voted today in Maryland Primary.\n\u2014 Spencer Irvine (@SpencerIrvine) June 25, 2014Sad."}
