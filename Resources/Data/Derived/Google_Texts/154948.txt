The Bay High School Million Dollar Band is hoping to bring one of the biggest names in pop music to Panama City, without playing a single note.

How? By winning Good Morning America's "ROAR With Katy Perry" contest.

Schools submit a two minute video of students performing their rendition of Perry’s new song "Roar." Perry will perform a concert at the winning school on her birthday, October 25. The concert will also be broadcast on "Good Morning America."

Nick Efstathiou, Director of the Million Dollar Band and latest winner of the NewsChannel 7’s Golden Apple award, and his staff came up with the concept. They’re also responsible for the filming and editing.

Efstathiou’s wife, Kelly, who is the Auxiliary Director of the band, sent us this brief synopsis of the video:

“Champions come in all shapes, sizes and personality types, from the “know-it-alls,” and “better thans,” to the “team players,” and “go getters.” The trick is coming together as a team and blending those differences to create something greater than the individual. When all is said and done; the greatest champion finds that they are only as powerful as their weakest link. Excellence is achieved when the strongest reach down to pull up the weak, when the negative is transformed into something positive, and teamwork rules the day. Only then can those individual voices unite to become a ROAR!”

Kelly Efstathiou says their video reflects what the Million Dollar Band is all about.

“No matter how different, difficult, inexperienced or rough around the edges one might be, there is a place for everyone in our program,” said Kelly Efstathiou.

It appears Bay High has some stiff competition based on Katy Perry's reaction to an entry from Lakewood High School in Lakewood, Colorado.

Perry's third record, Teenage Dream, is the first album recorded by a female artist in history to produce five number-one hits ("California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)". Michael Jackson's 1987 album, Bad, is the only other record to produce 5 number one songs.

Perry’s fourth album, Prism, which contains the Billboard Hot 100 number 1 single "Roar", is scheduled for release next month.
