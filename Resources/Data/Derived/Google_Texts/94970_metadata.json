Voters last month waited in line for up to five hours to cast ballots and well into the night at the sharply reduced number of polls.\n\nIn its letter, the Justice Department cites reports of \"a disproportional burden in waiting times ... in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations.\"\n\nThe Justice Department set an April 22 deadline for a response.\n\nFollowing the election, officials said their decisions on polling places were based on recent voting patterns and an increasing number of mail-in ballots.\n\nKaren Osborne, county elections director, denied there was any intent to rob voters of their rights and said officials would comply with the Justice Department request.\n\n\"This is a request for information,\" Osborne said in a brief interview on Monday with Reuters. \"We are going to gather the information, and we will get it together by the 22nd, and we will make it public.\"\n\nThe state formally certified the election on Monday and candidates have five days to contest the results. In the Republican contest, Donald Trump won, while in the Democratic contest, Hillary Clinton won. An attorney for Democrat Bernie Sanders has said his campaign is considering a challenge.\n\n(Reporting by David Schwartz in Phoenix; Editing by Curtis Skinner and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "PHOENIX (Reuters) - The U.S.", "title": "Justice Department in civil rights probe of Arizona election", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Justice-Department-civil-rights-probe-Arizona-election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Justice-Department-civil-rights-probe-Arizona-election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "PHOENIX (Reuters) - The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Justice Department set an April 22 deadline for a response.\nThe Justice Department made the request in a letter dated April 1.\nIn its letter, the Justice Department cites reports of \"a disproportional burden in waiting times ... in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations.\"\nKaren Osborne, county elections director, denied there was any intent to rob voters of their rights and said officials would comply with the Justice Department request.\nFollowing the election, officials said their decisions on polling places were based on recent voting patterns and an increasing number of mail-in ballots."}
