The report states that there has been an 84 percent decrease in lead present in outdoor air. Lead exposure in particular is dangerous to human health, and has been linked to impaired brain development in children. The report also cited the removal of some 1.5 million tons per year of arsenic, benzene, lead, and nickel from stationary and mobile sources.\n\nThese examples of air toxins have been associated with cancer as well as damage to overall health, such as the immune, respiratory, neurological, reproductive, and developmental systems, the EPA noted. Despite an increase in population and cars, the air quality has improved in recent years: \u201cIn spite of the twentieth century\u2019s steep population rise, massive industrialization, and the nationwide proliferation of the modern automobile, the air we breathe is cleaner than it has been in decades,\u201d Drew Thornley, a policy analyst, wrote on the Manhattan Institute\u2019s website.\n\nThe EPA report \u201cgives everyone fighting for clean air a lot to be proud of because for more than 40 years we have been protecting Americans \u2014 preventing illness and improving our quality of life by cutting air pollution \u2014 all while the economy as more than tripled,\u201d EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in the press release. \u201cBut we know our work is not done yet. At the core of EPA\u2019s mission is the pursuit of environmental justice \u2014 striving for clean air, water, and healthy land for every American; and we are committed to reducing remaining pollution, especially in low-income neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nRecently, NASA released images that also showed positive changes in U.S. air quality. Using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), scientists were able to detect significant improvements in the air between 2005 and 2011 \u2014 with nitrogen dioxide decreasing the most. Nitrogen dioxide, NASA states, is one of six common pollutants the EPA regulates in order to protect human health \u2014 it can harm the respiratory system and can also assist in forming other air pollutants like ground-level ozone and particulates.\n\n\u201cAir pollution has decreased even though population and the number of cars on the roads have increased,\u201d the NASA report said. \u201cThe shift is the result of regulations, technology improvements, and economic changes, scientists say.\u201d\n\nThis improvement in air quality has been linked to the Clean Air Act, which was created after decades of heavy air pollution that caused people to perish from the toxins. This includes the 1952 \u201cKiller Fog\u201d in London, which killed 3,000 people, and enveloped the city in smog so thick that buses couldn\u2019t run without a guide leading the way while holding a lantern. The Clean Air Act dictates that the EPA regulates the amount of air pollution present anywhere in the U.S. Unlike the worsening air pollution in China, the U.S. has been cleaning up its act in order to prevent air toxin-related health issues, like asthma, cancer, respiratory problems, or cardiovascular disease; meanwhile, the EPA continues to work against air pollutants in cities across the country to keep the positive trend in motion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "epa, air pollution us, air toxins", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Air pollution has actually been decreasing in the U.S., despite the fact that the amount of cars, and industrialization, has been increasing.", "title": "Breathe Easy: Harmful Pollution Is Declining", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/harmful-air-pollution-us-declining-though-number-cars-isnt-299478", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/23/air-pollution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Air pollution has actually been decreasing in the U.S., despite the fact that the amount of cars, and industrialization, has been increasing.", "title": "Breathe Easy: Harmful Pollution Is Declining", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/harmful-air-pollution-us-declining-though-number-cars-isnt-299478", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/23/air-pollution.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/23/air-pollution.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-23T16:06:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-23T16:06:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Air pollution has actually been decreasing in the U.S., despite the fact that the amount of cars, and industrialization, has been increasing."}, "article_summary": "The Clean Air Act dictates that the EPA regulates the amount of air pollution present anywhere in the U.S.\n\u201cAir pollution has decreased even though population and the number of cars on the roads have increased,\u201d the NASA report said.\n\u201cThe shift is the result of regulations, technology improvements, and economic changes, scientists say.\u201dThis improvement in air quality has been linked to the Clean Air Act, which was created after decades of heavy air pollution that caused people to perish from the toxins.\nDespite the fact that the U.S. has seen an increase in automobiles, industrialization, and population, the EPA reports that air quality has been improving across the country.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report recently that shows progress in lowering toxic urban air across America."}
