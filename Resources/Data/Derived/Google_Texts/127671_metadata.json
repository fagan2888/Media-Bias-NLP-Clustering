The bottom-line results were even worse as the company reported an adjusted net loss of $0.28 per share for the period. Analysts expected a profit of $0.95 for the quarter, so this was an enormous miss that really took the market by surprise.\n\nGuidance for the coming year was also weaker than many had predicted. The management team is forecasting that revenue will come in between $20 billion to $20.6 billion, which translates into earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.80, both below what the market was looking for.\n\nNow what: The surprise quarterly loss mixed with its tepid guidance for 2016 have traders dumping other hospital stocks today as well. For example, shares of Tenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC), a Texas-based hospital operator, are down more than 9% today, even though it isn't scheduled to report results until next week.\n\nCommunity Health Systems CEO Wayne T. Smith had this to say about the quarter:\n\nThe results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were affected by a number of factors, including volume weakness compared with a strong fourth quarter a year ago when we experienced higher emergency room visits and admissions attributed to respiratory illness and the flu.\n\nHe also noted that the company recorded a $169 million increase in its allowance for doubtful accounts during the period, which was a major drag on its earnings.\n\nShares of Tenet Healthcare and Community Health Systems have been absolutely mauled over the last few months. Both stocks have plunged more than 64% since reaching their peak last summer.\n\nThe huge sell-off indicates that investors have lost faith in Community Health Systems' ability to deliver on its promises, which makes sense given that it has come up short of its earnings expectations two quarters in a row. Investors have hit shares so hard that they are currently trading hands for roughly four times expected 2016 earnings.\n\nIf the company is able to meet or exceed its guidance, then today's price could prove to be a great buying opportunity. However, until we see tangible signs that it can right the ship, I'm content to watch this stock from the sidelines.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "12:22", "date": "2016-02-16T17:22:00Z", "description": "A surprise quarterly loss mixed with lower-than-expected guidance cause shares to plunge.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Brian Feroldi", "promo": "A surprise quarterly loss mixed with lower-than-expected guidance cause shares to plunge.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "A surprise quarterly loss mixed with lower-than-expected guidance cause shares to plunge.", "title": "Why Shares of Community Health Systems Inc.
