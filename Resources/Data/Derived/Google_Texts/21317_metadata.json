Richard Morrissette, D-Oklahoma City, wanted to know why more consideration wasn\u2019t given to rescinding a 0.25-percent cut in the top personal income-tax rate that went into effect Jan. 1 and to accepting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expanded Medicaid matching funds.\n\nRep. Jason Nelson, R-Oklahoma City, said the Legislature was \u201cleaving revenue on the table\u201d and should have coupled alcohol modernization with an increase in wine and beer taxes.\n\nNelson predicted that cuts to the Department of Human Services will lead to new lawsuits similar to the one that resulted in court-ordered changes to the state\u2019s child welfare system.\n\nResponding to Morrissette, Sears said the Republican leadership did not believe it could muster the three-fourths majorities in the House and Senate to roll back the tax cut.\n\n\u201cWe had that discussion at great length,\u201d Sears said.\n\nHe said expanded Medicaid was never considered much of an option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been supportive of it in our caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from our constituents is that they don\u2019t want to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe budget agreement includes a $200 million highway bond issue that frees up the same amount of cash for use elsewhere.\n\nUnder questioning by Minority Leader Scott Inman, D-Del City, Sears readily admitted that he wanted a $300 million bond issue but was outflanked on the issue by Senate leadership.\n\nSenate Bill 1616 passed 16-10, with Nelson and two other Republicans joining the seven Democrats present in opposition.\n\nVoted down in the committee was House Bill 3215, an attempt by Speaker Jeff Hickman, R-Fairview, to move up the sunset date for a wind generation tax credit from 2021 to 2018. The measure would have had no impact on the budget year that begins July 1 but would have saved an estimated $300 million over 10 years once it went into effect.\n\nEarlier in the day, the full House delivered a resounding defeat to a measure that would have raised the documentary stamp tax for property transfers from 75 cents to a $1 per $500 in value and changed its definition from a \u201ctax\u201d to a \u201cfee.\u201d\n\nSupporters of HB 3217 argued that the assessment is more properly described as a fee because most of the increase would be used to update software used by county assessors. Rep. Dennis Johnson, who presented the bill, said 60 of the state\u2019s 77 county assessors are using old software and as a result are undervaluing real estate.\n\nOpponents asserted that the bill\u2019s primary purpose was to raise operating revenue rather than replace the software and that it violated the state constitution\u2019s ban on revenue bills in the final five days of a session.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "sears,bond issue,republicans,democrats,revenue,house,jason nelson,oklahoma city,real estate,earl sears,oklahoma,bartlesville,richard morrissette,department of human services,appropriations and budget chairman,speaker,jeff hickman,dennis johnson,oklahoma house of representatives,senate,agreement,leadership,capitol_report,homepagelatest,government,local,state,politics,randykrehbiel,news", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "\"This is the most remarkable journey I've been through in my life,\" said House Appropriations and Budget Chairman Earl Sears, R-Bartlesville.", "title": "House committee grudgingly advances budget bills", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/capitol_report/house-committee-grudgingly-advances-budget-bills/article_615bd304-d8a0-555e-a6c0-38f0b81c989d.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/30/430c8b99-b4a7-586d-b56a-5c19db1badfd/574514862e81b.image.jpg?resize=500%2C623", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@rkrehbiel"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "sears,bond issue,republicans,democrats,revenue,house,jason nelson,oklahoma city,real estate,earl sears,oklahoma,bartlesville,richard morrissette,department of human services,appropriations and budget chairman,speaker,jeff hickman,dennis johnson,oklahoma house of representatives,senate,agreement,leadership,capitol_report,homepagelatest,government,local,state,politics,randykrehbiel,news", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/randy.krehbiel"}, "description": "\"This is the most remarkable journey I've been through in my life,\" said House Appropriations and Budget Chairman Earl Sears, R-Bartlesville."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the most remarkable journey I\u2019ve been through in my life,\u201d said House Appropriations and Budget Chairman Earl Sears, R-Bartlesville.\nRemember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!\nUnder questioning by Minority Leader Scott Inman, D-Del City, Sears readily admitted that he wanted a $300 million bond issue but was outflanked on the issue by Senate leadership.\nIf you feel you are currently subscribed please click on the button to attempt to find your account.\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us."}
