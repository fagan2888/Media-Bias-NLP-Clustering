Bill Cassidy (R., La.) got the backing of a major small business group on Wednesday, which has ditched its past support for Sen. Mary Landrieu (D.) due to her support of Obamacare.\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) endorsed Cassidy for Senate, and said its 4,200 Louisiana members \u201cwill be out in force\u201d for the Congressman this fall.\n\n\u201cOur members support the candidates who support small business, and Congressman Cassidy\u2019s record speaks for itself,\u201d said Lisa Goeas, NFIB vice president for Political and Grassroots, in a press release. \u201cCassidy has earned a 97-percent lifetime NFIB voting record in the U.S. House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nThe organization said it is supporting Cassidy for his votes on energy policy, the National Labor Relations Board, family leave, and his support for delaying the individual mandate in Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Mary Landrieu voted against repealing Obamacare,\u201d Goeas said. \u201cShe voted against an amendment that would have protected individuals and small-business owners from higher taxes. She voted against permanently eliminating the estate tax, which makes it harder for people to pass their family businesses to their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cLouisiana\u2019s Main Street communities, businesses and families are tired of empty campaign promises, and simply can\u2019t afford six more years of Mary Landrieu,\u201d she added.\n\nThe NFIB launched a candidate website and will air radio and online ads in support of Cassidy.\n\nThe group previously endorsed Landrieu in 2008, and gave her the \u201cGuardian of Small Business\u201d award that year.\n\nRecent polling has given Cassidy a slight edge in the close race this year.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Rep.
