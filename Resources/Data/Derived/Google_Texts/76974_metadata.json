That hashtag referred to a tax hike of roughly $2,200 the average middle class family would face if the tax cuts were not extended.\n\nThe #GetCovered hash tag urges uninsured people to share their stories of buying newly affordable coverage through the federal marketplace or through state marketplaces, though some tweeters have mocked the hashtag with phrases like \u201c#GetCovered with egg on your face,\u201d referring to the rocky rollout.\n\nTopsy ran a keyword analysis of tweets using the #GetCovered hashtag to determine whether the tweets were positive or negative. A score of 50 out of 100 essentially means there are an equal number of positive and negative tweets, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nThe sentiment score for #GetCovered has hovered around 80 out of 100 since HealthCare.gov launched Oct. 1 and was at about 90 out of 100 on Tuesday. (See the graph below).\n\nThe sentiment scores for #My2K and #40dollars, a follow on campaign to extend the payroll tax cut, both veered up and down wildly during their first months but averaged at or below sentiment scores of 50 out of 100, according to Topsy\u2019s analysis.\n\nThis story has been corrected to note that Get Covered USA launched the #GetCovered hash tag, which was later adopted by the White Housee. It has also been uppdated to clarify Topsy's business model. The company offers social analytics for multiple platforms, not just Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Marks", "description": "The #GetCovered hashtag is faring better than other White House hashtag campaigns.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "The #GetCovered hashtag is faring better than other White House hashtag campaigns.", "title": "Hashtag Campaign: One Place the Obamacare Rollout Exceeds Expectations", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/health/2013/10/hash-tag-campaigns-one-place-obamacare-rollout-exceeding-expectations/72497/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/23/102313hashtagNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The #GetCovered hashtag is faring better than other White House hashtag campaigns.", "creator": "@Joseph_Marks_", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/23/102313hashtagNG/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Hashtag Campaign: One Place the Obamacare Rollout Exceeds Expectations", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-23T19:59:40Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/23/102313hashtagNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Hashtag Campaign: One Place the Obamacare Rollout Exceeds Expectations", "keywords": "hashtags, healthcare.gov, twitter, social media, white house", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/23/102313hashtagNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "hashtags,healthcare.gov,twitter,social-media,white-house,channel-nextgov->-health,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "The #GetCovered hashtag is faring better than other White House hashtag campaigns."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37da\"", "article_summary": "Topsy ran a keyword analysis of tweets using the #GetCovered hashtag to determine whether the tweets were positive or negative.\nThat hashtag referred to a tax hike of roughly $2,200 the average middle class family would face if the tax cuts were not extended.\nThe #GetCovered hashtag is faring significantly better than similar White House Twitter campaigns, Topsy found, including the #My2k campaign urging Congress to extend Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class but not for the wealthiest Americans.\nA score of 50 out of 100 essentially means there are an equal number of positive and negative tweets, according to a spokeswoman.\nThis story has been corrected to note that Get Covered USA launched the #GetCovered hash tag, which was later adopted by the White Housee."}
