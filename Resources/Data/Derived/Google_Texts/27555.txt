LOS ANGELES (AP) — Craig Ferguson approached his first TV game show host’s job with a subversive attitude. Then came the simple matter of his wardrobe for “Celebrity Name Game.”

“I thought, ‘I’m not going to wear a suit. I’m going to break that rule,'” Ferguson said. Wrong decision, he quickly realized, after taping the first few episodes of the syndicated daytime show debuting Monday.

“When I watched the shows back, I couldn’t tell who was in charge,” he said.

On came the business suit, fitted over the sly, irreverent style that his nighttime fans know from CBS’ “The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,” which began airing in 2005.

He wouldn’t have tackled a game show without the opportunity of making it his own, Ferguson said.

“I liked this one because the format was loose and it left a lot of room for playing around and improvisation,” he said. “And it’s a new format, which meant that people weren’t in love with the game itself and wouldn’t get mad at me if I started messing around with it.”

The challenge, Ferguson said, is to mess around while still observing the rules of the game. He’s getting the hang of it as he tapes 180 episodes in a three-month production window, with hopes that the show is renewed so he can do more mischief.

Courteney Cox is confident he’s right for the job. The “Cougartown” and former “Friends” star is an executive producer on the show along with her ex-husband, David Arquette.

“Craig is the perfect host,” Cox said. “He is hilarious, irreverent and so spontaneous. He is unflappable and really enjoys himself, which is contagious for everyone around him.”

The show, based on the board game Identity Crisis, pairs celebrities with contestants to figure out — using improvised clues — the names of actors, singers, athletes, politicians and other famous folk.
