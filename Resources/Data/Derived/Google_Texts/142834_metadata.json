That won't leave hospitals much room to raise prices, he said, because \"so much of it is determined by what the federal government does.\"\n\nBut Dr. Scott Gottlieb, resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC it's only a matter of time before health insurance costs to consumers go higher.\n\n\"Health insurance costs [to consumers] haven't gone up because the plans are being hollowed out,\" he said\u2014arguing people are getting less coverage than they used to before Obamacare.\n\n\"Eventually the rising costs because of the monopolization of the hospitals is going to catch up,\" said Gottlieb, who served as an advisor at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2004.\n\nCMS, a division of the Health and Human Services Department, is responsible for government health-care programs, including Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare-driven consolidation among health insurers won't lead to higher costs, Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove tells CNBC.", "author": "Matthew J.
