Court proceedings opened on Thursday in the guardianship case filed by Bobby Brown that seeks to place him in charge of daughter Bobbi Kristina's $20 million estate.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports "no answers have emerged" and the court had no comment following the first-day actions.

According to the International Business Times, both Brown and Cissy Houston, Bobby Kristina's grandmother, were in the DeKalb County Courtroom for the hearing. Bobbi Kristina received the estate through her mother Whitney Houston's will, and her mom Cissy Houston has vowed to fight Bobby Brown "to the grave" to retain control over it.

The only daughter born to Brown and Whitney Houston had remains unresponsive with what is been described as "irreversible brain damage" since being found face down in the bathtub of a home she shared with boyfriend Nick Gordon in late January. She has since been moved to a long-term care facility.

"Since day one, all of the Houstons have been waiting for Bobby to try and get Bobbi Kristina's money and they knew it was just a matter of time," a source told Radar. "No one is surprised that he is making a grab for her money."

Georgia-based estate planning and probate attorney Steve Worrall has no direct involvement with the case but told The Constitution, if granted, Brown's actions could allow him the chance to "codify" his legal status as it relate to his rights to make decisions about his daughter's health care.

As her father, Worrall reasoned, "it would be appropriate for him to apply for guardianship, conservatorship or both. Once (Brown) is appointed as guardian he would have the authority to handle her person. A conservator would have the authority to make financial decisions. Certainly somebody needs to handle her financial affairs."

Whitney Houston was 48 when she was found dead in a Beverly Hills hotel room in April 2012. TMZ later reported authorities found she had drugs in her system at the time of her death.
