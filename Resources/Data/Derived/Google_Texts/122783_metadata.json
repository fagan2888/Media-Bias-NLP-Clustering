Van Garderen, who lives in Aspen part-time, dropped out of the Tour de France\u2019s 17th stage July 22 while sitting in third place overall after suffering from exhaustion brought on by a respiratory illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we anticipated was a possibility,\u201d said Shawn Hunter, CEO of the Pro Challenge. \u201cAnd although we\u2019re disappointed he won\u2019t be defending his title, we understand his needs to compete in the grand tour based on the results of the Tour de France.\n\n\u201cWe wish him the best and look forward to having him back.\u201d\n\nTeams entering the Pro Challenge will begin filing rosters to race officials Wednesday night and over the next few days. Hunter, who promised another field filled with cyclists who raced in the Tour, said roster announcements could come as soon as Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is 100 percent my decision. It would be nice to go out and try to win the USA Pro Challenge again,\u201d van Garderen wrote in a statement. \u201cBut after what happened at the Tour, I need to prove myself on a bigger scale.\u201d\n\nVan Garderen was poised to finish on the podium at the Tour, cycling\u2019s pre-eminent race, after finishing fifth in 2012 and 2014. He last raced the Vuelta in 2010. Australian cyclist Richie Porte, who served as Tour winner Chris Froome\u2019s primary domestique, is expected to join BMC next year, a move that would put pressure on Van Garderen to produce better results at the world level. Winning the Pro Challenge a third time wouldn\u2019t do much for his stock.\n\n\u201cDue to his illness and withdrawal from this year\u2019s Tour de France, we had an opportunity to reconsider what was best for Tejay in the coming months,\u201d said Jim Ochowicz, president and general manager of van Garderen\u2019s BMC Racing team. \u201cThe management team supports Tejay\u2019s decision to participate in this year\u2019s Vuelta.\u201d\n\nConflicts on the race calendar are common and allow teams to send riders to different events. The Giro d\u2019Italia, the first world tour race of the season, conflicts with the Tour of California. The Vuelta \u2014 the last of the cycling season\u2019s three grand Tours \u2014 begins Aug. 22 with a 4.6-mile team time trial at Porto Banus and ends Sept. 13. The USA Pro Challenge starts Aug. 17 in Steamboat Springs and ends in Denver on Aug. 23.\n\n\u201cBut after looking at the route and considering what happened at the Tour, all things just seemed to point in the direction that the Vuelta was the path to take,\u201d van Garderen wrote in the statement. \u201cThe more I have thought about it, the more excited I am about doing it. It is a great new challenge.\u201d\n\nThe field at the Pro Challenge has been deeper than the Vuelta in years past, Hunter said. Twice in the last four years, the winner of the Tour de France has competed at the Pro Challenge and foregone the Vuelta. That\u2019s mostly because of the difficulty of riding two three-week races with limited recovery time between.\n\nVan Garderen is the United States\u2019 top cyclist and has numerous ties to Colorado. He was raised in Great Falls, Mont., but spent his senior year at Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins \u2014 where this year\u2019s sixth stage ends \u2014 after his father moved there to start an architecture firm. He lived in Boulder before moving to Aspen, his wife\u2019s childhood home, where he lives outside the cycling season.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty\n\nOriginally, because of a reporting error, the date that Tejay van Garderen dropped out of the Tour de France was incorrect.
