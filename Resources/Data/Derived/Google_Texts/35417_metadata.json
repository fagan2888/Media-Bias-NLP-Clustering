This, after all, is a man who just got a used car to tool around in. Last May, during a Vatican radio message, he called atheists \u201cprecious allies\u201d and told them, \u201cDo good: we will meet one another there.\u201d Now, in a letter to nonbelievers in La Republica, signed simply \u201cFrancesco,\u201d the pope continues on his apparent quest to make Vatican higher-ups go a little bit apoplectic.\n\nThe letter was a response to the paper\u2019s editor Eugenio Scalfari, and a call to spark \u201ca sincere and rigorous dialogue\u201d between Christians and atheists. Obviously, the man whose work uniform includes a big pointy hat isn\u2019t going to go all, \u201cMaybe this God thing is a bunch of hooey.\u201d But what Francis did offer was a seemingly sincere and respectful attempt to find common ground. \u201cThe question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one\u2019s conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up one\u2019s mind about what is good and evil.\u201d Oh right! Free will! Always a good idea.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an open letter, the pontiff reaches out to a nonbeliever", "title": "Pope Francis woos atheists again", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In an open letter, the pontiff reaches out to a nonbeliever", "title": "Pope Francis woos atheists again", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/12/pope_francis_woos_atheists_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/pope_francis4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an open letter, the pontiff reaches out to a nonbeliever", "title": "Pope Francis woos atheists again", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/pope_francis4.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Catholicism, pope francis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfeb\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Atheism, Catholicism, pope francis, Life NewsIn just his first six months on the job, Pope Francis has distinguished himself as the pontiff most likely to go rogue.\n\u201cThere is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one\u2019s conscience.\nThe letter was a response to the paper\u2019s editor Eugenio Scalfari, and a call to spark \u201ca sincere and rigorous dialogue\u201d between Christians and atheists.\nListening to it and abiding by it means making up one\u2019s mind about what is good and evil.\u201d Oh right!\n\u201cThe question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience,\u201d he wrote."}
