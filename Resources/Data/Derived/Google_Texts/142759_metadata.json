But how many really think about where that food comes from?\n\nDairy farmer Robert A. \u201cRob\u201dKoithan, 59, a fifth-generation dairy farmer, and his wife, Krisann \u201cE. Kris,\u201d 56, think about it every day and clearly see an end to their family farm.\n\nThe small dairy farm has been in business since 1853, and with no family members willing to take on the tough farming life, it will cease operations when Rob retires in a few years.\n\nThe Koithan Farm was recently one of only nine farms to be recognized in the Northeast by Dairylea Cooperative Inc. for producing top-quality milk throughout 2012.\n\n\u201cIt gives us good satisfaction that our hard work pays off,\u201d Rob Koithan told the cooperative.\n\nHis family farm\u2019s raw milk was rated and tested on industry criteria that include a somatic cell count, a standard plate count (tests for infections,) no water added and no growth inhibitors. The Milk Quality Management Award Program rates all Dairylea Cooperative members from across the Northeast. Dairylea is a farmer-owned agricultural marketing and service organization with more than 1,200 member farms from across the Northeast, selling more than 6 billion pounds of raw milk annually.\n\nKoithan said his high-quality milk gets the couple a premium price when it is sent to Cuba Cheese, which buys all of its milk, but he also noted that quality is also important because the family, which includes seven daughters, drinks the unpasteurized raw milk.\n\n\u201cMilk is the best and cheapest food for everybody,\u201d Koithan said.\n\nThe Koithan farm on Route 425/Shawnee Road also produces apples, pumpkins and pears sold at a roadside stand to supplement the family income, which sadly is not keeping up with inflation, according to the Koithans.\n\nRob Koithan was asked about the family operation.\n\nHow many cows do you have?\n\nI have 30 milk and dry cows combined and probably 35 more calves and heifers that don\u2019t get milked yet. About 65 head all together. We produce about 870,000 to 900,000 pounds of milk a year, generally about 2,400 pounds of milk each day.\n\nHow do you feel about your cows?\n\nI love my cows. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ve gone from almost milking cows in the stone ages. I can remember when we hit 40 pounds (of milk) per cow, and now we\u2019re up to 80 with the same cows. I\u2019ve done things to make things easier, like buy a pipeline, better machinery. The pipeline was so you don\u2019t have to dump buckets. I did that after my father retired in 1992, because (Kris) would milk for us, and three cows would fill a 65-pound can, and she couldn\u2019t dump it. (Kris said it was her anniversary present).\n\nWhat\u2019s a typical day like for you?\n\nGet up at 10 to 5 (a.m.). walk over here, do a lot of things, milk the cows, she feeds them. Clean the stables, bed them, and around 8 a.m. we eat breakfast. Then I gotta bring hay and straw over. Every other day I gotta clean the heifer pen. Once a week I grind feed. When I am picking apples \u2013 for a month that\u2019s all I do. (He said he milks them all again at about 4 p.m. every day as well).\n\nWere you surprised to be chosen for this award for milk quality?\n\nNo. I have been getting this award for six years in a row. Five from Upstate (milk cooperative), and then I switched cooperatives to Dairylea. Every tank is checked. It is pasteurized after it is sent out, but we are drinking it raw, right out of the tank. It\u2019s kind of like an apple. I wouldn\u2019t want to eat a rotten apple, and I wouldn\u2019t want to sell a rotten apples to somebody.\n\nIs this your family\u2019s farm?\n\nYes. We\u2019ve been out here since 1853. I make my living with the dairy.\n\nDo people realize the work involved in running a family dairy farm? There seems to be a lot fewer farms like this.\n\nI\u2019m the last one left on 425, from North Tonawanda down to the lake. You go back maybe in the \u201960s, there was maybe like 30 dairies on this road. We\u2019re probably down to like thirtysomething dairy farms in the whole Niagara County. The small family farm is going to be a thing of the past.\n\nSo are you the end of an era?\n\nMy kids and nobody else\u2019s kids want to work 15 hours a day, seven days a week, almost every day of the year. And I don\u2019t even make minimum wage \u2013 the two of us together. Is there something wrong with this? You don\u2019t get any pension or any health insurance. (Kris noted that she was unable to look at plans and register online for the Affordable Care Act and was in the midst of filling out 19 pages of paperwork that had to be mailed for health insurance coverage.)\n\nWhy are farms like yours facing these issues?\n\nCongress controls the price of what I get in the milk, and they don\u2019t have a clue. We get paid half of what it should be, plus inflation. I can net more on a gallon of cider than I gross on a gallon of milk, and I got 10 times more work and equipment that I put into making a gallon of milk. There\u2019s something wrong. The price of milk hasn\u2019t changed much in 30 years in the store. Bottled water costs more than milk.\n\nAre your expenses going up?\n\nYou\u2019ve gotta know what ethanol\u2019s done to people. It\u2019s great if you are growing corn to produce ethanol, but what if you buy corn to feed the pigs or chickens or cows or beef animals? When I used to pay $2.40 a bushel for corn for years and years and all of a sudden I am paying $6.40 and the price of milk doesn\u2019t go up. What\u2019s Congress think?\n\nSo are you unhappy?\n\nKris Koithan says: The thing that makes us happy is when we can spend time with our family.\n\nRob Koithan says: I have good kids. I don\u2019t have kids staying out, on drugs, getting into trouble. Ask any company who hires my kids. They\u2019ve never seen kids work like my kids. I used to enjoy working every day with my father since I was about 5. He\u2019s got Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, and it\u2019s hard for me to have worked with somebody every day of my life, to somebody who you don\u2019t even know if he knows who you are.\n\nIs there something that you do find positive about working on your farm?\n\nI\u2019m with (Kris) all day. We took our kids in the barn with us and on the tractor, so we were always with them. That\u2019s something a lot of parents don\u2019t do. I do enjoy it. I don\u2019t have to drive out on the roads every day to get to work. I don\u2019t have a boss. And I can\u2019t fire myself.\n\nKris Koithan adds, laughing: No matter what I do. No matter how bad a job I do. I can\u2019t get myself fired either.\n\nRob Koithan gets the last word: If everybody spent a week on a farm \u2013 and bring their kids \u2013 they would know what real work was.\n\nKnow a Niagara County resident who\u2019d make an interesting question-and-answer column?
