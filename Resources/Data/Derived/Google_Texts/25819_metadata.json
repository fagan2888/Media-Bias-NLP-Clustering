So, why does Hobby Lobby have such a problem with contraception? Well, Hobby Lobby believes that some forms of widely used contraception (like the morning-after pill) amount to abortion \u2014 a concept not exactly embraced by conservative Christian groups \u2013 and that offering these options is an infringement on their Constitutional rights.\n\nLike most fundamental Christian arguments, however, Hobby Lobby\u2019s argument is filled with contradictions, least of all is the fact the retailer, through their 401(k) plans, allows its employees to invest in pharmaceutical companies that make morning after pills or similar products. There\u2019s also science, which totally gets in the way of Hobby Lobby\u2019s argument. You see, morning-after pills don\u2019t cause abortions; they prevent pregnancies from even happening. According to Susan Wood, a professor of health policy at George Washington University and a former assistant commissioner for women\u2019s health at the FDA, \u201cThese products are not abortifacients. And their only connection to abortion is that they can prevent the need for one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut go look for consistency in religion,\u201d George Carlin once said.\n\nFurther calling out Hobby Lobby\u2019s contradictory and archaic thought process, is comedian Tim Heidecker, who sent out the following tweet concerning the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. to his 401,000 followers this morning.\n\ncan someone start a \u201cboycott Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.\u201d petition? it\u2019s very existence goes against the word of God. make it real and good. \u2014 timheidecker (@timheidecker) July 2, 2014\n\nSocial media expert, ad writer and comedy writer Jesse Alkire answered the call. He posted a Change.org petition in less than 30 minutes. Drawing inspiration from Leviticus \u2013 the part of the Bible anti-gay protesters (and other horrible people) refer to when they want to prove \u2018God hates fags\u2019 \u2013 Alkire laid out the bit about shellfish being an abomination to God. The petition reads:\n\nLeviticus 11:10 \u2014 But anything in the seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is detestable to you. If the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. recklessly chooses to go against the wishes of our Lord, then we as Christians can stand against the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., as is our right as AMERICANS but most importantly CHRISTIANS.\n\nThe Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. openly proliferates the seafood lifestyle, which is unnatural and dirty, as stated by the Bible. If the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. continues to flaunt their immoral \u201cvalues\u201d while making a mockery of this country\u2019s CHRISTIAN beliefs, then we can choose to not do business with them, because we as CHRISTIANS will NEVER be forced to support something we don\u2019t believe in.\n\nIt\u2019s satire at its best, but will it change the minds of those who support Hobby Lobby\u2019s decision to deny women contraception coverage? Not likely. Fundamentalist Christians don\u2019t care about reason or progress or humanity. They don\u2019t care to hear a logical, fact-based argument against their beliefs. Any moderately intelligent person who has read Leviticus or studied the reason for its inclusion in the Bible realizes that some of Leviticus makes sense based on historical context and the story of The Exodus. God (if you believe in that sort of thing) doesn\u2019t hate gay people. God was trying to rebuild the Israelites\u2019 society after that whole Egyptian enslavement thing. And two dudes having sex will do nothing to add to a population. So, maybe God hates inefficiency. And people who don\u2019t understand biology. And if God exists, he/she/it probably hates Hobby Lobby.\n\nSign up to get funny daily videos and headlines delivered to your inbox every day!\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the weekly Laughspin Podcast on iTunes or on SoundCloud for all the latest comedy news, audio clips and more!
