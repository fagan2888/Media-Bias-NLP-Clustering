Because the formula that previously designated Texas as an area with a discriminatory history whose voting changes were subject to federal \u201cpre-clearance\u201d was invalidated by the Supreme Court in June, the DOJ can no longer use Section 5 to challenge laws that dilute minority voting, as it did when a federal court blocked Texas\u2019 redistricting map in 2012. As a consequence, within hours of the Supreme Court ruling, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott moved to reinstate a voter ID law and redistricting map that were previously blocked for discriminating against blacks and Latinos.\n\nUnder another section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 3, states can be brought back under the pre-clearance requirement if the court finds new evidence of intentional discrimination. Judges Orlando Luis Garcia, a Clinton nominee, and Xavier Rodriguez, a George W. Bush nominee, agreed with the Justice Department that its new Section 3 claim was timely and appropriate, because it did not become relevant until after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June decision. Their ruling hinted that they would entertain the Section 3 argument, writing, \u201cafter Shelby County, circumstances changed significantly, since \u00a73(c) became an issue for the first time.\u201d They noted that the Justice Department should be allowed to intervene because it has a \u201cdirect interest in the construction and application of \u00a7 3(c) that was not present until after the Shelby County ruling.\u201d\n\nThe Judge who dissented, Jerry Smith, was sitting on assignment from the very conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where he became famous for partisan questioning of DOJ lawyers during Affordable Care Act arguments about whether President Obama believes in the concept of judicial review. He then ordered the lawyers to write a three-page single-spaced letter explaining what Obama meant when he made a comment about judicial review during a political address. He argued in his dissent that the motion was not timely.\n\nAs the majority points out, Section 3 lawsuits have historically been rare and there is little precedent to refer to. The court\u2019s decision allowing DOJ to intervene will, if nothing else, provide guidance on how courts may apply this section and set a precedent for allowing Justice Department intervention in cases post-Shelby.\n\n(HT: Election Law Blog)", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A federal court is giving the Department of Justice its chance to argue that even after a punishing U.S. Supreme Court ruling, there are other means for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A federal court is giving the Department of Justice its chance to argue that even after a punishing U.S. Supreme Court ruling, there are other means for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.", "title": "Federal Court Allows DOJ To Make New Voting Rights Arguments In Texas", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/24/2675451/federal-court-allows-doj-to-challenge-texas-redistricting/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/texas.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A federal court is giving the Department of Justice its chance to argue that even after a punishing U.S. Supreme Court ruling, there are other means for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.", "creator": "@NicFlatow", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/texas.png", "title": "Federal Court Allows DOJ To Make New Voting Rights Arguments In Texas", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/texas.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/texas.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-24T18:21:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Federal Court Allows DOJ To Make New Voting Rights Arguments In Texas CREDIT:In the first positive signal since U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling would not deter him from enforcing the Voting Rights Act, a federal panel ruled Tuesday that the Department of Justice could intervene in a lawsuit to make its case.\nBecause the formula that previously designated Texas as an area with a discriminatory history whose voting changes were subject to federal \u201cpre-clearance\u201d was invalidated by the Supreme Court in June, the DOJ can no longer use Section 5 to challenge laws that dilute minority voting, as it did when a federal court blocked Texas\u2019 redistricting map in 2012.\nUnder another section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 3, states can be brought back under the pre-clearance requirement if the court finds new evidence of intentional discrimination.\nThe court\u2019s decision allowing DOJ to intervene will, if nothing else, provide guidance on how courts may apply this section and set a precedent for allowing Justice Department intervention in cases post-Shelby.\nAs a consequence, within hours of the Supreme Court ruling, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott moved to reinstate a voter ID law and redistricting map that were previously blocked for discriminating against blacks and Latinos."}
