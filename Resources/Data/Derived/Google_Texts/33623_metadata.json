According to the CDC, 18 in 100 women will become pregnant using only condoms.\n\nThis is why many women turn to less straightforward\u2014but more effective\u2014birth control methods. Like progestin pills. Or Depo-Provera shots. Or copper intrauterine devices.\n\nIf these terms sound like science fiction to you, you\u2019re not alone. The nitty gritty of what female contraception is and how it works can be confusing to the women who put it in their bodies\u2014so it makes sense that men would be a little fuzzy on the details.\n\nBoth people in a sexual relationship are responsible for preventing unwanted pregnancies, though, so to empower those readers who don\u2019t happen to have vaginas\u2014and help them be as supportive as possible to their female partner\u2019s needs\u2014we\u2019ve compiled this quick guide. Now join us on a path to contraception enlightenment.\n\nWhat are all the birth control options for women?\n\nThe most popular types of female birth control are oral contraceptives (\u201cthe pill\u201d), intrauterine devices (IUDs), shots, and implants\u2014so those are the ones we\u2019ll cover.\n\nEach method comes with its own set of pros and cons, and a woman will generally decide which is right for her with her doctor. Sometimes finding the right option can be a process of trial and error, based on how a particular method affects her body.\n\nHow do these methods work, exactly?\n\nOne word: Hormones! Bear with me as we get a little eggy and spermy.\n\nThere are two types of oral contraceptives, and both contain hormones: The \u201ccombination pill\u201d contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, and the \u201cminipill\u201d contains only progestin. Women who take the combination pill need to remember to take it every day, and women on progestin-only pills need to take it at the same time every day.\n\nGenerally speaking, estrogen prevents the body from releasing an egg to be fertilized. But combined, estrogen and progestin do other cool things as well, like thicken the mucus inside a woman\u2019s cervix (which makes it harder for sperm to enter)! And thin the lining of her uterus (which makes it harder for a fertilized egg to attach to it)!\n\nFor women who\u2019d prefer not to take a daily pill, there\u2019s the birth control shot. Formally known as Depo-Provera, the shot contains a hormone similar to progesterone and is injected once every three months.\n\nIf your partner is not planning to have a baby for several years, she may opt for a longterm option like an IUD or implant. IUDs are little T-shaped devices that are inserted into the uterus. They come in both hormonal and non-hormonal varieties\u2014plastic IUDs release hormones, copper IUDs do not\u2014and prevent pregnancy for three to 12 years, respectively. (How do the non-hormonal copper IUDs work? Basically, the copper causes a woman\u2019s uterus and fallopian tubes to produce fluid that is toxic sperm. Pow!)\n\nFinally, implants are matchstick-sized rods that are inserted into the upper arm. They release the hormone progestin and are effective for up to three years.\n\nWhat happens if your girlfriend is on the pill and forgets to take her daily dose\u2014or runs out?\n\nIt\u2019s a fact of life for women on the pill that, every now and then, they will forget to take a dose or run out. I personally have trouble remembering to refill my prescription (despite CVS auto-calling me twice a day), and I inevitably end up in panic mode almost every single month.\n\nIf your partner forgot to take her combination pill in the morning and it\u2019s now evening, she can simply take the missed pill\u2014and if you want to have sex, no backup method is needed. However, if she\u2019s on progestin-only pills, be sure to use a backup method like a condom or diaphragm, because with that pill, timing really matters.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have condoms lying around, offer to go get some. Whatever you do, try not to get too annoyed that she forgot\u2014simply figure out a solution together. Trust us, she\u2019s already stressed by her mistake, and stress is the opposite of sexy time.\n\nIf your girlfriend is on the shot and forgot to get her last dose\u2014i.e., it\u2019s been more than 12 weeks since her last injection\u2014make sure to use a backup method during sex. When the shot is not received on schedule, roughly 6 in 100 women will get pregnant.\n\nWhat if you find out that your girlfriend forgot to take her birth control after you had sex?\n\nIf your partner realizes she forgot to take her birth control and you already had sex (again, mistakes happen), you have a few options for preventing pregnancy. If she\u2019s on the combination pill and only forgot to take one pill, odds are she\u2019s not pregnant\u2014and she can just take the missed pill as soon as she remembers.\n\nIf she forgot to take a pill for more than two days, however, or she\u2019s on progestin-only pills, there\u2019s a chance she could be at risk for pregnancy. Bear in mind that when taken \u201cperfectly,\u201d both the combination and progestin-only pill are more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy\u2014but when taken \u201ctypically,\u201d they\u2019re only 91% effective.\n\nIf you\u2019ve entered a situation where pregnancy can happen, you can turn to emergency contraception, also known as Levonorgestrel pills, but most commonly known as Plan B. Emergency contraception is now available over-the counter (although some states make it easier to obtain than others), and it can be used up to five days after unprotected sex. However, the sooner the better\u2014it\u2019s less effective on days four or five.\n\nIf you (and she) decide to get Plan B, offer to go with your partner to the pharmacy. No one likes to buy it alone, and some pharmacy workers have that judgy look. Be supportive, don\u2019t play the blame game, and offer to split the cost, which is roughly between $35 and $65.\n\nAlso, the morning-after pill tends to cause side effects like nausea, headaches, and an overall \u201cI feel like crap-ness,\u201d so don\u2019t just have her take it and peace out. Text her to see how she\u2019s doing throughout the day. Remember, it\u2019s both of your responsibilities, and however stressed you\u2019re feeling, she\u2019s probably feeling that times a hundred.\n\nWhat if your girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to take hormonal birth control any more?\n\nFor some women, pumping hormones into their body can cause negative side effects such as bleeding between periods, nausea, weight gain, breast tenderness, mood swings, and headaches. It can also cause more serious side effects\u2014while rare, these can include blood clots, stroke, and depression.\n\nIf the side effects are bad enough, your partner may decide that she no longer wants to take hormonal birth control. If that\u2019s the case, your job is to be supportive. We get it, unprotected sex is fun and one of the perks of birth control\u2014but if your partner feels it\u2019s upsetting her body more than it should, she should be able to ditch it worry-free.\n\nAt this point, she may choose to get a copper IUD\u2014or she may want to start having protected sex with the use of condoms or a diaphragm. (For the uninitiated, a diaphragm is a shallow, dome-shaped silicone cup that can be inserted into the vagina up to 24 hours before having sex. It prevents sperm from entering the uterus, but works even better with spermicide. Note that diaphragms do require a prescription.)\n\nWhat if your girlfriend is worried about the cost of her birth control?\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are required to cover prescription contraception at no cost. So if you\u2019re girlfriend is still paying for birth control\u2014and some women have indeed reported being charged, since some insurance companies have failed to comply\u2014she shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nIf your partner is still paying, offer to help her figure out what\u2019s up with her insurance company. And if she\u2019s currently uninsured, offer to help split the cost, which can range from $0 and $50 per month.\n\nWhat if your girlfriend needs to see an OBGYN about her birth control?\n\nLike the dentist, going to the OBGYN is the opposite of fun. You get poked and prodded and scraped and have to talk about \u201chow many partners you\u2019ve had.\u201d I personally always feel better if my boyfriend goes with me because he distracts me in the car with funny stories and takes me for frozen yogurt or tacos afterward. Other women prefer to go it solo.\n\nYour job is to ask. Offer to go to the doctor with her if you have the time\u2014or if you can\u2019t make it or she\u2019d prefer to go by herself, text her while she\u2019s there with a \u201cgood luck\u201d or \u201clet me know if you need anything\u201d (if she\u2019s the kind of woman who appreciates that sort of thing). The little stuff helps many of us feel like we\u2019re not in it alone\u2014and we shouldn\u2019t be.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "A guide to the pills (and more) women put in their bodies to prevent pregnancy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "A guide to the pills (and more) women put in their bodies to prevent pregnancy.", "title": "What every man should know about birth control", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/190574/boyfriends-guide-to-birth-control/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/150903-bc-men.gif?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just because you have a penis doesn't mean you're not responsible for preventing pregnancy.", "title": "The boyfriend's guide to birth control", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/190574/boyfriends-guide-to-birth-control/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/150903-bc-men.gif?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "birth control, girlfriend, contraception, the pill, iud, implant, Depo-Provera, pregnancy, condoms"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda614\"", "article_summary": "What if you find out that your girlfriend forgot to take her birth control after you had sex?\nIf the side effects are bad enough, your partner may decide that she no longer wants to take hormonal birth control.\nThe most popular types of female birth control are oral contraceptives (\u201cthe pill\u201d), intrauterine devices (IUDs), shots, and implants\u2014so those are the ones we\u2019ll cover.\nWhat are all the birth control options for women?\nWhat if your girlfriend needs to see an OBGYN about her birth control?"}
