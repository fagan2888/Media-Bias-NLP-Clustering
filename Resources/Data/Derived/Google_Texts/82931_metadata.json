As others have noted, the increased risk associated with eating bacon and the other foods listed in the WHO report is scant\u2014something along the lines of an increase of one percentage point (from five percent to six percent). The WHO itself clarified this point in the wake of the fatalistic headlines caused by its report.\n\nThe WHO report estimates that 34,000 out of 56 million annual deaths worldwide may be attributable to eating processed meats. That\u2019s 0.06 percent of all deaths worldwide.\n\nThe molehill of risk has real-world implications. In fact, it could lead to a mountain of regulations and litigation\u2014beginning right here in America.\n\n\u201cWill the Golden State now require steaks, chops, and burgers to have such labels?\u201d asked Reason\u2019s Ron Bailey last month, in the wake of the WHO report.\n\nSure enough, reports emerged last week that the report would spur a clash in California.\n\nWhy California? As Bailey and I feared, there\u2019s already talk of moving meat onto California\u2019s list of cancer-causing foods under the state\u2019s Proposition 65 law\u2014a list that already includes some chicken, cereal, crackers, cookies, bread, French fries, and potato chips.\n\nI was in Santa Monica last month and joked with colleagues about the Prop 65 warning that appeared right next to the entrance to the hotel. \u201cChemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm[,] may be present in foods or beverages sold here,\u201d the sign reads.\n\nWhich chemicals? Which foods? Who knows? While you\u2019ll see these signs at virtually ever grocer, corner store, and coffee shop in California, it\u2019s largely not because the warnings are necessary or meaningful but because the state\u2014or even private individuals or their heroic lawyers\u2014can sue those who fail to display these worthless signs.\n\nThe overwarning caused by Prop 65 in California, I\u2019ve noted before, is as outrageous as it is unhelpful. It\u2019s as absurd as it is counterproductive. \u201cThe nation\u2019s breadbasket now wants us to fear bread,\u201d I wrote in a 2010 law-review article that focused in part on the idiocy of applying Prop 65 to food, something\u2014as I also note in the article\u2014that Prop 65 was never intended to do.\n\nBut perhaps the activists I noted earlier would be smart to look at the foods already on California\u2019s Prop 65 list, which includes several vegan offerings, including coffee, roasted asparagus, canned pumpkin, black olives, roasted nuts, and prune juice. The government says those vegan foods cause cancer. That\u2019s no reason for meat eaters to take a victory lap. Instead, it\u2019s another reason to question the ineffectiveness of Prop 65 and of hysterical reports masquerading as science.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "What happens when warnings about processed meat's cancer risk collides with California's absurd Prop 65 (over)warning law?", "title": "Eat Food and Die", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/11/14/eat-food-and-die", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14474325004336.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What happens when warnings about processed meat's cancer risk collides with California's absurd Prop 65 (over)warning law?", "title": "Eat Food and Die", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14474325004336.jpg", "creator": "@baylenlinnekin", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-11-14T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/baylen-linnekin"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe nation\u2019s breadbasket now wants us to fear bread,\u201d I wrote in a 2010 law-review article that focused in part on the idiocy of applying Prop 65 to food, something\u2014as I also note in the article\u2014that Prop 65 was never intended to do.\nInstead, it\u2019s another reason to question the ineffectiveness of Prop 65 and of hysterical reports masquerading as science.\nThe overwarning caused by Prop 65 in California, I\u2019ve noted before, is as outrageous as it is unhelpful.\nI was in Santa Monica last month and joked with colleagues about the Prop 65 warning that appeared right next to the entrance to the hotel.\nThe government says those vegan foods cause cancer."}
