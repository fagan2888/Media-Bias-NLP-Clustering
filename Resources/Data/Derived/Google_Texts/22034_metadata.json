It may be partly a signal to the administration to get this train moving, but it\u2019s no doubt also a reckoning with reality. Obamacare is not attracting the uninsured, and if the administration would stop changing the rules long enough for insurers to get a handle on who is in the exchange population, they\u2019d no doubt find that population is far more sick and expensive than it was supposed to be.\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini told CNBC on Wednesday that Obamacare has failed to attract the uninsured, and he offered a scenario in which the insurance company could be forced to pull out of program. The company will be submitting Obamacare rates for 2015 on May 15. \u201cAre they going to be double-digit [increases] or are we going to get beat up because they\u2019re double-digit or are we just going to have to pull out of the program?\u201d Bertolini asked in a \u201cSquawk Box\u201d interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cThose questions can\u2019t be answered until we see the population we have today. And we really don\u2019t have a good view on that.\u201d He said that so far, Obamacare has just shifted people who were insured in the individual market to the public exchanges where they could get a better deal on a subsidy for coverage. \u201cWe see only 11 percent of the population is actually people that were firmly uninsured that are now insured. So [it] didn\u2019t really eat into the uninsured population.\u201d For Obamacare to work better, it needs more flexibility and choice of insurance programs, Bertolini said. \u201cWe need to make it a lot more simpler for people. There needs to be more choice. When you get more choice, you make it more of a market and you get more people in the program.\u201d\n\nBertolini\u2019s comments illustrate the bind the insurance industry is in\u2014and, yes, they jumped in with Obama on this deal expecting a bunch of people to be forced to buy their product. Obamacare has failed in such a way as to force them to raise rates dramatically. If they raise rates dramatically, the very administration that needs them to stick with the program will be calling them bad apple patent medicine salesmen because vilifying them will be the only hope for politically extricating itself from its policy failure, at least temporarily. And, in the meantime, the industry can\u2019t even get a handle on who is in the exchanges because the administration keeps changing the rules every five minutes. A couple of industry folks told me last week, even if the news about the make-up of the exchanges is bad, it\u2019d be better to figure it out, get some experience with the population, and gauge what can be done for cost containment. Obama\u2019s short-sighted game of switcheroo doesn\u2019t allow much actuarial science to take place.\n\nAs to Bertolini\u2019s prescription for more choice and market forces, something like this, perhaps?\n\nThis week, health care analyst and Obamacare opponent Megan McArdle went to the Upper West Side and debated the proposition that Obamacare is already doomed\u2026and won. Her analysis, coupled with Bertolini\u2019s message should be chilling to Obamacare fans:\n\nObamacare\u2019s exchange facility was conceived as a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d: guaranteed issue, community rating, mandate. Guaranteed issue means that an insurer can\u2019t refuse to sell you a policy. And community rating means that they can\u2019t agree to sell you a policy \u2014 for a million dollars. The problem is that if you set things up this way, it makes a lot of sense to wait to buy insurance until you get sick, at which point premiums start spiraling into the stratosphere and coverage drops. Enter the mandate: You can\u2019t wait. You have to buy when you\u2019re healthy or pay a fine\u2026 Unfortunately, whenever someone has voiced discontent with the way things are going, the administration has taken a hacksaw to another leg. For example, some folks who had policies they liked before were being forced to drop them and buy new policies they didn\u2019t like so much. That caused an outcry, followed by an emergency grandfathering rule.\n\nMcArdle offers a timeline for Obamcare\u2019s demise, stipulating that its few popular provisions will survive:\n\nMany of the commentators I\u2019ve read seem to think that the worst is over, as far as unpopular surprises. In fact, the worst is yet to come. Here\u2019s what\u2019s ahead: \u00b7 2014: Small-business policy cancellations. This year, the small-business market is going to get hit with the policy cancellations that roiled the individual market last year. Some firms will get better deals, but others will find that their coverage is being canceled in favor of more expensive policies that don\u2019t cover as many of the doctors or procedures that they want. This is going to be a rolling problem throughout the year. \u00b7 Summer 2014: Insurers get a sizable chunk of money from the government to cover any excess losses. When the costs are published, this is going to be wildly unpopular: The administration has spent three years saying that Obamacare was the antidote to abuses by Big, Bad Insurance Companies, and suddenly it\u2019s a mechanism to funnel taxpayer money to them? \u00b7 Fall 2014: New premiums are announced. \u00b7 2014 and onward: Medicare reimbursement cuts eat into hospital margins, triggering a lot of lobbying and sad ads about how Beloved Local Hospital may have to close. \u00b7 Spring 2015: The Internal Revenue Service starts collecting individual mandate penalties: 1 percent of income in the first year. That\u2019s going to be a nasty shock to folks who thought the penalty was just $95. I, like many other analysts, expect the administration to announce a temporary delay sometime after April 1, 2014. \u00b7 Spring 2015: The IRS demands that people whose income was higher than they projected pay back their excess subsidies. This could be thousands of dollars. \u00b7 Spring 2015: Cuts to Medicare Advantage, which the administration punted on in 2013, are scheduled to go into effect. This will reduce benefits currently enjoyed by millions of seniors, which is why they didn\u2019t let them go into effect this year. \u00b7 Fall 2015: This is when expert Bob Laszewski says insurers will begin exiting the market if the exchange policies aren\u2019t profitable.\n\nEmphasis mine, and Mark Bertolini\u2019s.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Downfall.", "title": "Aetna CEO: We might have to pull out of ObamaCare because it\u2019s not attracting uninsured", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/23/aetna-ceo-we-might-have-to-pull-out-of-obamacare-because-its-not-attracting-uninsured/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T02:21:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-24T02:32:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "Aetna, exchanges, health care, implementation, insurers, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94e6\"", "article_summary": "So [it] didn\u2019t really eat into the uninsured population.\u201d For Obamacare to work better, it needs more flexibility and choice of insurance programs, Bertolini said.\n\u201cWe see only 11 percent of the population is actually people that were firmly uninsured that are now insured.\nThis year, the small-business market is going to get hit with the policy cancellations that roiled the individual market last year.\nThe company will be submitting Obamacare rates for 2015 on May 15.\nThis week, health care analyst and Obamacare opponent Megan McArdle went to the Upper West Side and debated the proposition that Obamacare is already doomed\u2026and won."}
