In a 2013 study commissioned by Pfizer Canada and reported by the Chicago Tribune, 88% of real estate agents surveyed said houses belonging to smokers were more difficult to sell. One-third also estimated that having a regular smoker in the home could reduce resale value by 20% to 29%.\n\nMore productivity\n\nSmoking breaks cost employers about $3,077 per employee per year in lost wages, according to the 2013 Ohio State University paper \u201cEstimating the cost of a smoking employee,\u201d coauthored by Berman. Taking several smoking breaks a day can be a productivity killer, says 32-year-old ex-smoker Jesse Gaddis, who started the e-cigarette company Bedford Slims after quitting.\n\nAfter a smoking break, \u201cyou don\u2019t just go right back to your task,\u201d says Gaddis, who lives in Brooklyn, New York. \u201cYou ease back into it.\u201d This adds up over the day, he notes.\n\nSmoking employees with a range of different incomes earn an average of 17.5% less than non-smokers, according to a 2013 study by the Federal Reserve of Atlanta.

It\u2019s an experience she won\u2019t soon forget. \u201cI just remember feeling ashamed,\u201d she says, noting that she couldn\u2019t eat anything for days afterwards. The gum disease, caused by smoking, was completely preventable.\n\nCurrently, 16 million people suffer from smoking-caused illnesses, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

But in 2015, Affordable Care Act policies will start charging smokers up to 50% more in monthly premiums. For those trying to lower their medical bills, quitting smoking is a great place to start.\n\nThe final price tag\n\nWhen you factor in increased life insurance and homeowners insurance costs, as well as the price of cigarettes, you realize smoking can easily set you back upwards of $10,000 a year\u2014and that doesn\u2019t take unexpected medical events into consideration.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease, which can be caused by smoking, is one of the top reasons families declare medical bankruptcy. The report also found that out-of-pocket expenses for treating heart attacks and strokes, which can also be caused by smoking, often exceed $20,000.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just affect you,\u201d says Gaddis of the costs associated with smoking. \u201cIt affects everyone around you.\u201d\n\nNeed help quitting?\n\nCall the National Cancer Institute\u2019s toll-free hotline and get advice from a counselor.

But instead of thinking about the daily routine you\u2019re missing out on, just think about how much you could replace that with, suggests Irwin, who returned to graduate school to earn her Doctor of Psychology degree after leaving her smoking habit behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a sweet freedom when you\u2019re off those stupid things,\u201d she says.\n\nEmbed this on your own site:\n\nVia:\n\nNerdWallet\n\n\n\nHealth Insurance:\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services data, a mid-tier health plan under the Affordable Care Act costs an average of $328 per month, reports NBC.

At State Farm Life Insurance, for instance, a smoking 33-year-old woman with a 20-year term life insurance package and $100,000 of coverage would pay $282 annually. A nonsmoking woman of the same age would pay $154 for the same package.\n\nCigarettes:\n\nThe average cost of a pack of cigarettes in the U.S. is $5.51 per day, according to the American Lung Association.
