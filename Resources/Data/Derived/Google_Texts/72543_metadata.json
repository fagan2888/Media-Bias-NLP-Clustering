However, it's unclear whether he knew about the physical and psychological effects he was dealing her. Delaware State Police\n\nA Delaware pediatrician was sentenced to three years in prison on Friday for using the controversial torture technique known as waterboarding on his 12-year-old stepdaughter.\n\nAlthough he once appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Melvin Morse, a 60-year-old celebrity pediatrician proved that he wasn\u2019t as kind-hearted as the beloved talk show host. He was sentenced to three years in prison and two years of probation upon being released after a jury convicted him of one count of waterboarding the young girl in the bathtub, and five misdemeanor counts of forcing the girl\u2019s head under a faucet with running water and threatening punishment, the NY Daily News reported.\n\nBut she endured more than that. She told authorities that she was waterboarded after vomiting into a cat\u2019s litter box \u2014 a result of being forced to drink too much milk. Morse, as well as the girl\u2019s mother, would also force her to stand with her arms extended for a long amount of time and would isolate her in her room without food, or conversely, force-feed her. The actions of the girl\u2019s caregivers were brought to the attention of police after she ran away to a friend\u2019s house one day in July 2012 and Morse picked her up, spanking and dragging her across the driveway by her ankle \u2014 police subsequently arrested him.\n\nThe mother was also charged with a handful of misdemeanor charges, which she pleaded guilty to while also agreeing to testify against Morse. Her daughter is now in foster care. Although Morse apologized profusely to the girl during his court appearance, she said in a letter delivered by her therapist that \u201che needs to feel what it\u2019s like to be a prisoner. I was a prisoner at home with him.\u201d\n\nWaterboarding's Effects on the Body and Psyche\n\nWaterboarding, for many people, became familiar during former President George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Its use among Guantanamo detainees sparked controversy as some people questioned its legality and whether it was humane, while others felt that the detainees deserved whatever the CIA dealt. But even a soon-to-be-released Senate report supposedly claims that it may have been illegal under the definition of torture determined by the Bush-era Department of Justice. If it\u2019s considered that harsh for adult detainees, the effects are surely worsened for a young girl.\n\nWaterboarding is so harsh because it simulates the effects of drowning upon its victims. It usually involves strapping the victim to a board or plank, covering their face in a cloth, and soaking it in water. The wet cloth then sticks tightly to the victims face, making it difficult to breathe without getting water into the mouth and nose as well.\n\nAfter hours of waterboarding, there\u2019s no doubt that some of the water has gotten in the lungs. This can lead to hypoxia \u2014 a deficiency of oxygen to organs \u2014 and eventually organ failure, according to Scientific American. If the water is dirty, it can further harm the body, causing pneumonia or pleuritis, which is the inflammation of the lungs. And because it\u2019s so frightening and stressful, it can cause blood pressure to rise, and trigger heart attacks and the like.\n\nThe effects go deeper than just the physical, affecting the victim\u2019s psyche as well. \u201cThis is an utterly terrifying event,\u201d Allan Keller, director of Bellevue/New York University School of Medicine Program for Survivors of Torture, told Time. \u201cPsychologically, this can result in significant long-term post-traumatic stress, and produce anxiety and depression.\u201d\n\nAlthough the young girl was only waterboarded once \u2014 it\u2019s done countless times on detainees \u2014 the cumulative psychological effects of everything her parents put her through are sure to take a toll on her. But at least she can rest-assured that Morse is getting his time in prison. \u201cIt totally vindicates her,\u201d chief trial prosecutor Melanie Withers said, according to ABC News, \u201cand that\u2019s what this has all been about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "waterboarding, torture, effects of torture, child abuse, melvin morse, psychological effects of waterboarding, physical effects of waterboarding, doctor waterboards stepdaughter", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A pediatrician was sentenced to three years in prison Friday for waterboarding his young stepdaughter.
