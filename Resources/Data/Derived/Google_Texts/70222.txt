Walnut Street, Third and St. Catherine streets, counts 29 “daughter” churches that are still active

The church plans a 200th year homecoming celebration Oct. 18 with a worship service, lunch and more

As Walnut Street Baptist Church in Old Louisville celebrates its 200th anniversary this year, it’s paying tribute not only to Walnut Street but also to more than 52 “daughter” churches it sponsored or “fostered” through the years.

The church counts 29 of those daughters as still active, and members of those churches joined in a rousing two-hour “Living the Legacy” anniversary service Aug. 1 at Walnut Street, 1143 S. Third St. at St. Catherine Street.

Some sang in a 100-member-plus combined choir, and the Mass Choir from Green Street Baptist Church — one of the daughters — at 519 E. Gray St. east of downtown performed on its own, directed by Chris Fenner and Ronn Norfleet.

Green Street member V. Pauline Taylor said that Walnut Street is dear to the hearts of her church’s members. “We are one of the branches of their tree,” she said.

Worship leaders

Among the others who helped lead the service were the Rev. Mark Williams, Walnut Street’s senior pastor; pianist Albin C. Whitworth, music minister at Deer Park Baptist; Gene Sutherland, retired music and senior adult minister at Walnut Street and now interim music minister at Living Hope Baptist Church on Bardstown Bluff Road; the Rev. Robert Smith, former associate professor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville and now a teacher at Beeson Divinity School at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala.; former Walnut Street pastor the Rev. Rusty Ellison; and the Rev. Daniel Jeon, pastor of the Chinese Mission at Walnut Street.

The benediction was delivered by the Rev. Kris Billiter, pastor of Eastpoint Community Church, 13420 Eastpoint Centre Dr. east of Anchorage, Walnut Street’s latest daughter church. It began meeting in 2014 and will hold its formal launch service September 13.

The Rev. Jim Cobban, pastor of First Baptist Church Middletown, spoke about “Walnut Street Through the Years” as his church was celebrating its 95th anniversary. Cobban, also a former Walnut Street ministerial staff member for 17 years, recalled serving on an Old Louisville Crime and Safety Committee and helping form the Old Louisville Neighborhood Coalition and Old Louisville Neighborhood Council.

Ellison talked about “sending people from this place” and “extending” the church’s reach across Jefferson County.

Walnut Street Baptist has been celebrating all year and also plans a 200th anniversary “homecoming” gathering Oct. 18. It will start with a 10:30 a.m. worship service followed by lunch and other activities, said Kathy Dehoney Evitts, 200th anniversary team leader.

History

Walnut Street Baptist was founded by 13 “believers” in a home as First Baptist Church in 1815, according to a church history. By the late 1820s, the congregation had grown significantly, and African American members wanted to form their own church, which ultimately became Fifth Street Baptist.

In 1849, First Baptist united with its daughter church, Second Baptist, formed in 1838, to become Walnut Street Baptist.

The first sanctuary was at Fourth and Walnut streets. That property was sold in 1900, and the church moved to the “suburbs” at Third and St. Catherine, dedicating a new sanctuary (which remains today) in 1902.
