He has espoused the benefits of child labor in Third World countries. And he is reported to have made fun of how people of Japanese descent cannot pronounce his brand\u2019s name. (He denied that last one.)If it seems incredible that a company honcho would say such brand-damaging things, consider this: Wilson is far from an isolated case\u2014although many, remarkably, live to tell the tale. Here, a rogue's roundup of other high-ranking executives opening their mouths only to insert their feet.", "og": {"url": "http://www.adweek.com/news-gallery/advertising-branding/7-times-ceos-said-really-dumb-customer-alienating-things-165318", "type": "article", "image": {"width": 150, "identifier": "http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/general-thumbnail/2015_Jun/chip-wilson-hed-2015.jpg", "height": 84}, "site_name": "AdWeek", "title": "7 Times CEOs Said Really Dumb, Customer-Alienating Things"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "fb": {"admins": 507972634, "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "keywords": "Advertising & Branding", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Adweek", "section": "Advertising & Branding"}, "viewport": "width=1028"}, "article_summary": "7 Times CEOs Said Really Dumb, Customer-Alienating Things Departing Lululemon chief isn't the only one to go way off-message"}
