(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--While the industry braces for open enrollment \u2013 and the additional 11 to 13 million Americans expected to be seeking insurance this year \u2013 new research by Valence Health shows that traditional commercial health plans might soon face increasing competition from alternative payers. The study, \u201cU.S. Attitudes Toward Health Insurance and Healthcare Reform,\u201d revealed that more than a third of Americans are open to trying insurance plans offered through hospitals, health systems or state-run Consumer Oriented and Operated Plans (CO-OPs).\n\nThe survey of more than 550 respondents, ages 18 to 60+, included men and women with varying household incomes (ranging from under $25,000 to over $150,000) and political views (Democrats, Republicans, Independents and others). Designed to gauge perceptions of the commercially insured, the survey also included some input from those covered by other payers, including Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe may be about to see a major shift in the way Americans choose to buy health insurance,\u201d said Kevin Weinstein, Valence Health Chief Marketing Officer. \u201cIf only five percent of insured Americans actually try new insurance options, that translates to nearly 10 million people who account for more than $20 billion in healthcare spending. Imagine if we start to educate the majority of people who said they were still unsure about their options. We are talking about creating a huge monetary shift in the industry.\u201d\n\nKey Survey Findings\n\nNew Insurance Options\n\nMore than 31% of respondents said they were very or somewhat likely to purchase health insurance through their local hospital or health system .\n\nof respondents said they were very or somewhat likely to . 23% said hospital-sponsored plans would be less expensive , and higher quality than traditional insurance plans, and 39% said provider-sponsored health plans would offer more coordinated care (see Chart 1: Provider-sponsored plans).\n\nsaid hospital-sponsored plans would be less , and higher quality than traditional insurance plans, and 39% said provider-sponsored health plans would offer more coordinated care (see Chart 1: Provider-sponsored plans). More than 43% said they were very likely or somewhat likely to consider switching to the CO-OPs (see Chart 2: CO-OPs).\n\nChoosing Health Insurance\n\nMore than 39% said they were very unlikely to use online insurance exchanges ; majority prefer insurance through employers.\n\nsaid they were ; majority prefer insurance through employers. Less than 10% said they are willing to accept salary increase or stipends to purchase out of pocket health insurance.\n\nPerception of \u201cObamacare\u201d\n\nWhile a majority of respondents were for \u201cObamacare,\u201d a majority also thought that insurance rates would rise due to health reform.\n\nPrioritizing Cost and Coverage\n\nAccording to the report, most of Americans\u2019 health insurance choices are driven by plan benefits and price, as opposed to physician choice (see Chart 3 Top 10 Priorities). Coverage of emergency room visits and hospital stays were the top priorities, while the insurance company\u2019s \u201cbrand name\u201d held the least importance.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that we may be shifting away from the era where big brand, commercial insurance companies take the largest piece of the pie,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cConsumers are open and ready to try smaller, local systems, not only because it\u2019s potentially easier on the wallet, but also because they perceive it to be more convenient and may lead to better overall patient healthcare outcomes.\u201d\n\nNeed for Education\n\nWhen asked specific questions about their options under healthcare reform, or Obamacare, a majority of the respondents said they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d or were \u201cunsure,\u201d revealing not only that Americans are open to learning, but need more education about their options.\n\n\u201cConsumers are playing a greater role in their own healthcare, which is a trend that will only grow in the future,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cAmericans want more options for healthcare and we have an opportunity to empower them with the information they need to make financially prudent choices that meet their personal healthcare requirements.\u201d\n\nThe complete research findings are available at http://valencehealth.com/resources/white-papers.\n\nTweet This: Study from @ValenceHealth shows nearly a third of Americans may choose non-commercial #healthinsurance plans next year http://bit.ly/1eEkRPS\n\nAbout Valence Health:\n\nValence Health provides healthcare organization solutions for value-based care, helping them better manage their patient populations and accept financial responsibility for the quality of the care they provide.
