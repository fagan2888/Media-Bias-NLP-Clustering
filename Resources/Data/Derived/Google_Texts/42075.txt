IBM is out to debunk myths about millennials. With so many out there, its study designed to do so is more of a starting point on debunking than the final word. But, given the depth of the research (nearly 2,000 respondents with one-on-one interviews and social media information collection included), the study’s overarching theme is worth noting: millennials aren’t much different than other generations in their hopes, dreams and expectations around work.

In fact, the results indicate that, if anything, today’s young workers are pretty similar to their elders’ outlook on work when they were young. They tend to seek direction from their bosses; they're mobile because they’re ambitious to move beyond their initial jobs; they’re moderately interested in social justice through work; they want to believe their bosses are ethical and fair and willing to be honest with them.
