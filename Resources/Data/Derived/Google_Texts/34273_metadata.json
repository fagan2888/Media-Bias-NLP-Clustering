Hobby Lobby \u2014 that for-profit businesses could have religious rights \u2014 was groundbreaking and, for many, alarming. A year later, the question on everyone\u2019s mind remains: How far do those religious rights go? Knowledge@Wharton spoke with Amy Sepinwall, Wharton professor of legal studies and business ethics, about two papers she authored on the limits of that ruling, how the law might evolve, and where courts ought to draw the line. The two papers are: \u201cConscience and Complicity: Assessing Pleas for Religious Exemptions After Hobby Lobby\u201d and \u201cCorporate Piety and Impropriety: Hobby Lobby\u2019s Extension of RFRA Rights to the For-Profit Corporation.\u201d\n\nAn edited transcript appears below.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: I understand the research papers you published recently tie back to an op-ed you wrote for The Washington Post about whether a corporation can have a conscience.\n\nAmy Sepinwall: That\u2019s right. And subsequent to that, there were two theoretical articles that followed after the court issued its decision in the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case, which is the jumping-off point for questions about corporate conscience.\n\nHobby Lobby, as I\u2019m sure you know, involved a large chain of craft stores that was owned by the Green family. They had incorporated. The Green family has objections to certain contraceptive devices, but under the Affordable Care Act, employers have to provide their employees with health insurance, and that health insurance has to include all 20 FDA-approved contraceptive devices. Four of those are ones the Hobby Lobby owners believe have the potential to cause embryo destruction, so they didn\u2019t want to fund an insurance plan that included those. And they were asking \u2014 not that they as individuals get an exemption from having to fund these methods of contraception \u2014 but instead that the corporation itself get an exemption. And they invoked as the legal hook for their plea the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: In terms of the research you were doing, what were you really looking for? What were you going after?\n\nSepinwall: One of the really interesting questions in all of this is the place of the corporation when it comes to religious exercise and religious freedoms Twitter . There are lots of churches that are incorporated. There are Catholic hospitals that are incorporated. We don\u2019t seem to have too much trouble acknowledging that they should have rights of religious exercise, but what about for-profit corporations? What is it that the for-profit corporation is for? And is that an appropriate platform or venue for individuals to be seeking to express their religious beliefs? Or instead, should we say, \u201cLook, your religious beliefs are private. Feel free to do what you\u2019d like in your home, but you can\u2019t be imposing those beliefs on your employees.\u201d Or, you can\u2019t be using them to guide this entity that is, first and foremost, an entity aimed at making money.\n\n\u201cIs [a for-profit corporation] an appropriate platform or venue for individuals to be seeking to express their religious beliefs?\u201d\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: How much of this discussion relies on the fact that the Hobby Lobby case involved a family-owned company? How much does the ruling that companies may have religious rights depend on the idea that they may be family-run operations?\n\nSepinwall: The Court was at pains to underscore the fact that the decision in the case \u2014 which allowed Hobby Lobby to claim these rights of religious freedom \u2014 applied only to closely held corporations \u2014 so, family-owned corporations. You might think that the decision isn\u2019t going to have a lot of reach as a result of that. And typically when we think of corporations, we do think about these large, publicly traded corporations.\n\nBut in fact, there are closely held corporations that employ thousands and thousands of employees. The J.W. Marriott Corporation, which owns Marriott Hotels; Cargill is another one that has a lot of employees \u2014 the number of employees who might be affected is potentially very large. A lot of small and medium-size enterprises tend to be not publicly traded, and the decision would apply to them as well.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: It\u2019s hard to believe that when you\u2019re talking about a family owned business that the family\u2019s beliefs wouldn\u2019t come into play somehow. But for the most part, when you think about family-owned businesses, you\u2019re talking about smaller entities. You\u2019re talking about an operation where the people who own the company have probably a fairly solid relationship with the people who are in the warehouses, doing the work, whatever it might be. So, to have that not be a part of it is a little surprising to me.\n\nSepinwall: Right. And I am largely in agreement. In the case of Hobby Lobby, you\u2019re right that the religious beliefs permeated other facets of the business too. Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t sell shot glasses. And it\u2019ll hold prayer sessions.\n\nThis case was not a pretext to get out of having to pay for contraception for women. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the owners sincerely believed that these methods of contraception were wrong. At the same time, Hobby Lobby employs over 20,000 employees, and the health insurance covers not just the employees but the employees\u2019 family members too. So, the number of women who were potentially going to not have coverage for their contraception was very large.\n\nWith all of that said, the government was able to provide a work-around so that Hobby Lobby didn\u2019t have to subsidize the contraception and women wouldn\u2019t have to pay out of pocket to get contraception. Given that the government was able to arrive at this compromise such that women were not going to bear the costs of the owners\u2019 religious observance, I think it makes very good sense to proceed in a way that honors their religious convictions.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: Right. So, going forward, now that the Hobby Lobby case has set the bar, what are the areas that need to be looked at as potential areas for religious exemption?\n\nSepinwall: I think where we\u2019re really seeing the impact is in cases involving businesses that don\u2019t want to have to participate in gay weddings. There is this concern that the Supreme Court is going to rule very imminently that states either have to allow gay marriage or, if not, that they have to recognize gay marriages that are legal in other states. The response among those who oppose gay marriage is, \u201cOK, fine, maybe gay marriage is legal, but we don\u2019t want to have to facilitate it in any way. So, I\u2019m a florist, I\u2019m a baker of wedding cakes, I\u2019m a wedding photographer \u2014 don\u2019t make me participate.\u201d Because of this, you see these Religious Freedom Restoration Acts being enacted at the state level in Indiana and Arkansas, which have attracted a great deal of media and public attention.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: If memory serves, there was a baker in Indiana who objected to doing a cake for a gay wedding ceremony. And the bakery received unbelievable backlash. It really didn\u2019t have to involve the government in any way. The community around them really made their statement. I think they boycotted the baker.\n\nSepinwall: Right. There has been a tremendous amount of public outcry in the face of these efforts on the part of wedding vendors to not participate. I mean, everyone from Miley Cyrus to MC Hammer is getting in on the game \u2014 tweeting their opposition. And the Indiana story broke right around the time of the NCAA championship game, which was going to be held there, so there was a lot of public attention in light of that, too.\n\n\u201cThere are Catholic hospitals that are incorporated. We don\u2019t seem to have too much trouble acknowledging that they should have rights of religious exercise.\u201d\n\nBut the relationship to Hobby Lobby is one where these bakery owners or florists are saying, \u201cLook, what I do is expressive in a certain way and I don\u2019t want to have to be lending my expressive, my artistic capacities to this enterprise with which I disagree.\u201d And there\u2019s, I think, some sympathy that the claim should garner. Imagine, for example, that you\u2019re a wedding singer and you\u2019re being asked to bless the union through your music and you oppose gay marriage.\n\nAt the same time, I think the relevant legal precedent in the way that we as a polity should be thinking about this is the case of Loving vs. Virginia, which was a case challenging what was, in Virginia at the time, a law prohibiting interracial marriage. And that law had as its motivating ideology not just the idea that the races shouldn\u2019t be mixing, but that the races shouldn\u2019t be mixing because one is superior to the other. These wedding vendors want to be able to say, look, we\u2019re not opposed to gays and lesbians. One in particular was a florist in Washington who was asked to provide the flowers for a gay wedding ceremony. And she said, look, one of the members of the couple was someone who had been a customer of hers for 20 years. She liked him a lot. But she just couldn\u2019t as a matter of conscience provide flowers for this ceremony that she opposed.\n\nI think the way to think about that is to say, if instead it were an interracial couple, we would have great difficulty thinking that someone could legally enact their opposition to interracial marriage by turning away customers. And that seems to be the way we should think about gay marriage as well.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: In some respects I think that this is also just an issue of time. As you mentioned with interracial marriage, obviously there were people that did oppose it. I think that there are still probably some that do. But there are probably far fewer people that do than 20 or 30 years ago. As time goes on, we\u2019ll see these types of beliefs change. And, as you said, the Supreme Court will have its influence as well.\n\nSepinwall: I think that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s really been remarkable how quickly attitudes about gay marriage have changed. It\u2019s been remarkable and wonderful. And some of the commentary in this area is that these claims of religious freedom are not really about religious freedom. They\u2019re about trying to find a space from which to argue against practices that one doesn\u2019t like. It\u2019s about trying to undermine gay marriage, not just trying to prevent one\u2019s soul from being wrapped up in enterprise that one doesn\u2019t believe in.\n\nOn this question of time, the Supreme Court is poised, as I said, to rule on whether states have to legalize gay marriage. And the conservative justices seem to be focusing on that piece, saying, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not really for the Court. This should be a matter of popular opinion. We should just wait until society as a whole is ready to embrace gay marriage.\u201d So, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how that dynamic ends up informing the decision.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: It is an interesting and important piece for the Court to think about, because of how important it is to our society right now.\n\n\u201cAs it currently stands, the law doesn\u2019t ask courts to think very much about what the implications are going to be for third parties.\u201d\n\nSepinwall: I think that\u2019s right. There was another one of these cases involving a wedding vendor \u2014 this time, a New Mexico photographer who didn\u2019t want to participate in a lesbian commitment ceremony. She took her case to the Supreme Court of New Mexico and lost, so she was not allowed to deny service to gays or lesbians. And then she asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take her case, and they declined to do so. So the U.S. Supreme Court hasn\u2019t yet rung in, but I think in the legal community it\u2019s expected that at some point the Court is going to have to get involved in these questions.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: Even a year later, the Hobby Lobby case is still something that is very much talked about. And it\u2019s going to be continually talked about because of how important and how groundbreaking it was.\n\nSepinwall: That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the first case to recognize that corporations \u2014 for-profit corporations \u2014 have rights of religious freedom. It potentially affects thousands and thousands of people. The worry is that it\u2019s not just going to be employers who object to contraception, but employers who object to other kinds of health treatments \u2014 that it\u2019s going to extend beyond health care benefits to other kinds of benefits or employment practices: whom we hire, whom we fire, and on what grounds.\n\nWashington, D.C., had a law pending that was going to overturn a prohibition on businesses from firing women because they had had abortions. The House voted in favor of this law that would make it okay for businesses to fire women because they\u2019d had abortions. And it didn\u2019t get beyond the House.\n\nKnowledge@Wharton: You said this has the chance over the next few years to play into other areas. Is there a natural stopping point, beyond which the courts will have to say, this was not what the Hobby Lobby decision meant?\n\nSepinwall: It\u2019s a great question, and one of the pieces that I [wrote] is related to this. It\u2019s a worry that as it currently stands, the law doesn\u2019t ask courts to think very much about what the implications are going to be for third parties. In the Hobby Lobby case, what burdens are women going to be made to bear if we do grant this exemption?\n\nNowhere in the tests that the courts apply are they asked to think about what it\u2019s going to mean for other people who aren\u2019t before the court right now if we grant an exemption. But I think that question is one that needs to figure centrally in judicial deliberations about this. If courts are made to think about how much of a burden they impose on other people by granting an exemption, and if they\u2019re also given guidance that they shouldn\u2019t impose too much of a burden on third parties, then I think we create a stopping point. And the stopping point becomes, no, we can\u2019t give you this exemption, because if we give it to you, it\u2019s going to unfairly burden these other people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A year after the Hobby Lobby decision, a big question remains: How far do corporate religious rights go?", "og": {"site_name": "Knowledge@Wharton", "description": "A year after the Hobby Lobby decision, a big question remains: How far do corporate religious rights go?", "title": "Is There a Limit to Corporate Religious Freedom?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hobby-lobby.jpg", "height": 440}, "url": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/after-hobby-lobby-is-there-a-limit-to-corporate-religious-freedom/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A year after the Hobby Lobby decision, a big question remains: How far do corporate religious rights go?", "title": "Is There a Limit to Corporate Religious Freedom?", "image": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hobby-lobby-560x440.jpg", "creator": "@WhartonKnows", "site": "@WhartonKnows", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "robots": "noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"admins": 1653092227}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/knowledgeatwharton", "section": "Featured"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business, education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe3b\"", "article_summary": "And some of the commentary in this area is that these claims of religious freedom are not really about religious freedom.\nThe response among those who oppose gay marriage is, \u201cOK, fine, maybe gay marriage is legal, but we don\u2019t want to have to facilitate it in any way.\nKnowledge@Wharton: Even a year later, the Hobby Lobby case is still something that is very much talked about.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Burwell v.
