Re: "Fact Check: Barto's abortion-funding claim unsupported," Sunday:

To say that the accounting gimmick under the Affordable Care Act, by which the $1 charged per month to cover elective abortions, ensures taxpayers are protected from subsidizing abortions is laughable.

The only way to ensure Arizonans are fully protected from having their tax dollars subsidize abortions is to prohibit abortion coverage from being purchased on the Obamacare exchange. Seventeen other states have passed laws just like Senate Bill 1318 to ensure their tax dollars do not subsidize elective abortions.

Nearly 90 percent of individuals purchasing health coverage on the exchange are receiving a subsidy, averaging $264 a month. This is taxpayer dollars given each month to nearly 90 percent of individuals purchasing coverage on the exchange. This leaves the average monthly premium to be $82.

Those participating in the abortion-funding plans pay a mandatory minimum $1 per month for abortion coverage. (The GAO Report shows no health plan provider is charging more than $1).

Giving most purchasers $264 of taxpayer money each month and then asking for $1 back to cover the abortion coverage is all the evidence needed to show we are subsidizing elective abortions.
