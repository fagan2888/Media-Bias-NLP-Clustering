Jim Sensenbrenner James SensenbrennerFor suburban women, addiction is a key election issue Dems amp up charges of voter suppression in Wisconsin Top Republican warns of discrimination at the polls in November MORE (R-Wis.), the original author of the Patriot Act \u2014 would extend through 2019 three expiring provisions of the post-9/11 security law, including the contested measure that the NSA has relied on to sweep up millions of people\u2019s phone records without a warrant.\n\nAt the same time, however, the bill would effectively end the bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records, limit other types of collection, add a new expert panel to the secretive court overseeing intelligence operations and add new measures of transparency.\n\nInstead of collecting all the phone records itself, the bill would force the NSA to search through private companies\u2019 databases using a \u201cspecific selection term.\"\n\nThe legislation is expected to easily pass the House later this week after a 25-2 vote in the Judiciary Committee last month, but its future remains unclear in the Senate.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill MORE (R-Ky.) has repeatedly expressed his support for the NSA\u2019s current program and objected to efforts to kill it.\n\nThe Freedom Act \u201cwill neither keep us safe nor protect our privacy,\u201d he said on the Senate floor last week.\n\nThe White House appeared to rebut those arguments on Tuesday. While the legislation would make various reforms, it said, it does that \u201cwhile maintaining authorities to conduct more targeted collection.\u201d\n\nThe hands of NSA reformers appeared to have been strengthened last week, following a sweeping court ruling declaring the NSA program, illegal. However, McConnell and other GOP opponents have refused to yield in their opposition to the bill, setting up a heated battle as the end-of-the-month deadline draws nearer.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The administration is putting its weight behind the surveillance reform effort.", "description": "The administration is putting its weight behind the surveillance reform effort.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The administration is putting its weight behind the surveillance reform effort.", "title": "White House 'strongly supports' NSA reform bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/241740-white-house-strongly-supports-nsa-reform-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obamabarack_042115getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/241740-white-house-strongly-supports-nsa-reform-bill", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-12T12:29-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-12T12:29:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "keywords": "National Security Agency, Patriot Act, USA Freedom Act,Jim Sensenbrenner, Mitch McConnell,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/241740-white-house-strongly-supports-nsa-reform-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The administration is putting its weight behind the surveillance reform effort.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House 'strongly supports' NSA reform bill"}, "dcterms.title": "White House 'strongly supports' NSA reform bill"}, "article_summary": "The White House is putting its full weight behind legislation putting limits on U.S. surveillance and renewing key portions of the Patriot Act.\nBefore the House votes on the USA Freedom Act this week, the Obama administration said on Tuesday that it \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the bill and wants the Senate to follow the House's lead.\nThe White House appeared to rebut those arguments on Tuesday.\nThe Freedom Act \u201cwill neither keep us safe nor protect our privacy,\u201d he said on the Senate floor last week.\n\u201cThe USA Freedom Act's significant reforms would provide the public greater trust and confidence in our national security programs and the checks and balances that form an integral part of their operation,\" the White House added."}
