As noted, $31.266 million of the 2012 notes will remain outstanding following this exchange. The catch is select holders of these 2014 notes will be allowed to convert this debt into shares of Amarin at a price equivalent to $2.60 per share, though the release notes that this applicable exchange needs to be conducted at 110% of the applicable exchange price, or $2.86, if conducted after Jan 19, 2018.\n\nNow what: \"Now explain that in English, please!\" Simply put, Amarin's subsidiary exchanged debt which could have been redeemed as early as 2017 for new debt which can't be redeemed until Jan. 19, 2019 at the earliest. While that's typically a good thing, Amarin also allowed the noteholders of these 2014 notes the ability to exchange their debt for shares of Amarin -- if shares move above $2.86 for a pre-specified period of time, that is. For current shareholders, that means the likelihood that bondholders are going to flood the market with convertible shares and dilute existing investors if there's a considerable rally in Amarin's share price.\n\nAdmittedly, though, Amarin shareholders have much more pressing things to worry about, such as the need for a cardiovascular outcome study with Vascepa if Amarin has any hope of expanding its indications for its FDA-approved drug. With the company burning through its cash and Vascepa sales essentially capped in the near-term, this is a company I'd strongly suggest you avoid.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:01", "date": "2014-05-15T17:01:00Z", "description": "A", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_control-21_control_100", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "A \"switch-a-roo\" at Amarin's subsidiary gives existing shareholders indigestion.
