Nate Parsons said. \u201cHe could have fell asleep, he could have had an undiagnosed medical condition. We\u2019re unable to prove either.\u201d\n\nThe April 14, 2014, collision occurred in Orland, about 100 miles north of Sacramento. The dead were five high school students from the Los Angeles area, three chaperones, and the drivers of the FedEx tractor-trailer and the bus. The bus was full of prospective Humboldt State University students heading for a campus visit, and two of the chaperones were engaged to be married.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol released the results of its investigation at a news conference after the agency met with family members of those killed in the collision.\n\nEvans \u201chad sufficient time off,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cThat day he had been working approximately eight hours at the time of the collision. But he had between eight and 10 hours of sleep the night before.\u201d\n\nCarla Haywood, whose daughter Mattison died while chaperoning students on the bus, says the investigation didn\u2019t still address their central question of why the truck driver left the road. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly wondering what happened, questioning what could have been prevented,\u201d said Haywood, 63 of Chino.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials: Probe faults truck driver in fatal bus collision", "title": "Officials: Probe faults truck driver in fatal bus collision", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Officials: Probe faults truck driver in fatal bus collision", "title": "Officials: Probe faults truck driver in fatal bus collision", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/22/officials_probe_faults_truck_driver_in_fatal_bus_collision/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/california-bus-crash.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials: Probe faults truck driver in fatal bus collision", "title": "Officials: Probe faults truck driver in fatal bus collision", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/california-bus-crash.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Lee Myers and Fenit Nirappil", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The underlying cause of the crash is the FedEx truck driver, Tim Evans, 32, \u201callowing his vehicle to travel across the median in an unsafe turning movement,\u201d Sgt.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The California Highway Patrol faulted a truck driver for a fiery head-on collision with a bus carrying high school students to a college visit.\nThe dead were five high school students from the Los Angeles area, three chaperones, and the drivers of the FedEx tractor-trailer and the bus.\nWe\u2019re unable to prove either.\u201dThe April 14, 2014, collision occurred in Orland, about 100 miles north of Sacramento.\n\u201cThat day he had been working approximately eight hours at the time of the collision."}
