In Massachusetts, meanwhile, officials want to reconcile Obamacare with the reforms the state pioneered under then-Gov. Mitt Romney, which imposed an individual mandate on residents years before the federal law.\n\nAnd Arkansas, which two years ago engineered a new way expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, now may try to test the broader law. A health care pioneer in Little Rock says the waiver program offers a chance to move able-bodied people away from entitlement programs and into the private, \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d insurance market.\n\n\u201cWhy would you not?\u201d said Sen. David Sanders, the Republican leading the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s the part of Obamacare that lets you waive Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama uses Thanksgiving address to scold Americans over Syrian refugees\n\nFormally known as a \u201cSection 1332 waiver,\u201d the provision was designed to let states act as laboratories for health reform. Waivers would last five years and could be renewed, but would have to get approval from the administration.\n\nBut states, who would have to apply by mid-2016 to be vetted in time for 2017, say HHS hasn\u2019t issued specific guidance on what states can and cannot do under the program.\n\n\u201cIf states have a plan they would like to discuss, we\u2019ll work with them. We\u2019ll update the guidance as needed,\u201d said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nFor now, states are relying on limited information about what\u2019s in-bounds and what\u2019s not. They can waive specific parts of the law, including the insurance mandates on individuals and employers.\n\nBut states cannot let insurers turn away customers with pre-existing medical conditions, or run afoul of four so-called guardrails: the new model must cover at least as many people as Obamacare, provide coverage that\u2019s just as comprehensive as what consumers found on the exchanges, curb out-of-pocket spending in line with the exchange model and not increase the federal deficit.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t really addressed the substance of it,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who closely tracks the health law. \u201cThis is an important issue, and if they have no final rules in place, and there\u2019s just guidance, that can very easily be changed by a future administration.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who authored the waiver provision, asked HHS last week to update him on where things stand. He wants to know if specific reforms sound promising, how the program might work alongside waivers granted under Medicaid and if safeguards are in place to check states who might undermine Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe law must be used to move forward, not back,\u201d he wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n\nHawaii is the only state so far to propose a waiver that can be submitted to the Obama administration next year, making it a test case for how the program\u2019s guardrails will be applied.\n\nThe draft, published in September, says a 1974 law informally known as \u201cPrepaid\u201d goes further than Obamacare\u2019s rules on employers. Hawaii requires any business with one permanent worker to purchase health coverage \u2014 not just large employers \u2014 and defines full-time work as 20 hours instead of Obamacare\u2019s 30, so it would just as soon waive the Small Business Options Program (SHOP) to cut costs and avoid confusion.\n\n\u201cIn their view, the ACA was kind of watering down provisions that were already in place and had been working well,\u201d said Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe administration said it has no comment on Hawaii\u2019s proposal, as its still up for public comment at the state level.\n\nAnalysts said it\u2019s not surprising to see blue states that embraced Obamacare take the first steps to draft a waiver, since that what its framers envisioned.\n\nMassachusetts, which wrote the template for Obamacare with its 2006 state health law, is considering a series of technical changes, such as making it easier for employers to report whether they provide adequate health coverage.\n\nA health care task force in Minnesota said it\u2019s looking at ways to pay for populations that bounce between programs, such as from the state Medicaid program to private plans on the state\u2019s Obamacare exchanges, known as MNSure.\n\nRed states, meanwhile, face practical and political hurdles. Their goals for reform often don\u2019t comport with Obamacare, and it might not be worth expending political capital on health reform before they know if a Republican or Democrat will take the White House.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of states are waiting to see what the presidential campaign looks like, and who will win, before they go too aggressively,\u201d said Stuart Butler, a conservative thinker and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSome conservatives say the waiver program offers false hope, and that full repeal of the 2010 law is the only path forward.\n\nStill others see it as a sound plan B, saying it makes sense to plan instead of waiting on Capitol Hill Republicans who\u2019ve yet to vote on a comprehensive alternative to Obamacare.\n\nIn 2013, Arkansas found a way to place newly eligible Medicaid recipients into Obamacare\u2019s private-plan exchange, while paying for it with an influx of federal funds that most states had used to expand their traditional Medicaid programs.\n\nNow Mr. Sanders wants to go further, revamping Medicaid so that the able-bodied poor are treated as regular exchange customers \u2014 leading to a more robust, consumer-driven marketplace \u2014 and sicker patients on a managed-care track that\u2019s tailored to individual needs.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s room, even with this administration, to get where we want to go,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama faces a major decision on Obamacare over the next year as states begin to apply for waivers to the sweeping law, pressuring the administration to either welcome or resist experimentation with his top domestic achievement.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama faces a major decision on Obamacare over the next year as states begin to apply for waivers to the sweeping law, pressuring the administration to either welcome or resist experimentation with his top domestic achievement.", "title": "Obamacare waivers present dilemma for administration", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/26/obamacare-waivers-present-dilemma-for-administrati/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/16/b13ef5e61541ef0c700f6a7067004619.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/16/b13ef5e61541ef0c700f6a7067004619.jpg", "description": "President Obama faces a major decision on Obamacare over the next year as states begin to apply for waivers to the sweeping law, pressuring the administration to either welcome or resist experimentati", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare waivers present dilemma for administration"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "David Sanders"}, "article_summary": "And Arkansas, which two years ago engineered a new way expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, now may try to test the broader law.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t really addressed the substance of it,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who closely tracks the health law.\nWaivers would last five years and could be renewed, but would have to get approval from the administration.\nSome conservatives say the waiver program offers false hope, and that full repeal of the 2010 law is the only path forward.\nIn Massachusetts, meanwhile, officials want to reconcile Obamacare with the reforms the state pioneered under then-Gov."}
