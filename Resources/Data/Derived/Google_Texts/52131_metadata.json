That\u2019s what Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been doing ever since he was elected President of Turkey in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be a dictator when you\u2019ve been a member of NATO since 1952, part of the Council of Europe in 1949, which is now the European Union, and a major strategic ally of the United States\u2014first during the Cold War and now in the war against ISIS. For many months, Erdogan declined to join the coalition fighting the terrorists, and Turkey was considered a nominal ally in the war against terror.\n\nRelated: The Two ISIS Battles That Could Change the Face of the Middle East\n\nThen, last summer, Turkey joined the U.S. led campaign against ISIS. As a result, the terror group began targeting Turkey, and the U.S. government last September authorized the voluntary departure of 900 family members of personnel stationed at Incirlik air base and the U.S. consulate in Adana. On March 29, all U.S. military families in southern Turkey were evacuated.\n\nLast summer also witnessed the end of a ceasefire between the Turkish government and the Kurdish separatists. Yet Turkey\u2019s current problems are not to be blamed on security issues only. They are the results of Erdogan\u2019s national security and foreign policy decisions. Despite its strategic location, Erdogan\u2019s decisions have reduced Turkey\u2019s status in the world arena.\n\nErdogan has a master plan\u2014as a diehard Islamist, he wants to revive the glory of the Ottoman Empire, restore Islamic rule, and purge the country of undesirables\u2014especially the Kurds. Turkey considers the Kurds (whether Turkish Kurds, Syrian Kurds, or Iraqi Kurds) the main threat to Turkish national security. The Kurds want autonomy, and independence is viewed as endangering Turkey\u2019s sovereign unity. Turkey has anxiously observed the gains Syrian Kurds achieved over the last few years. For Turkey, ISIS is the lesser of two evils compared to the Kurds.\n\nRelated: Families of U.S. personnel ordered to leave parts of Turkey amid security concerns\n\nTurkey has maintained a backdoor channel with ISIS for years. This channel helped secure the release of dozens of Turkish diplomats and drivers who were taken hostage by ISIS when the terror group captured Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, in June 2014. In return, Turkey released a group of ISIS detained operatives. Turkey also turned a blind eye on ISIS\u2019s oil trade with its southern provinces and on jihadists crossing the Turkish \u2013 Syrian borders to join the fight against the Syrian government. Many of them eventually joined ISIS.\n\nTurkey\u2019s alliance with the U.S. led campaign against ISIS came with a price: unleashing a renewed crackdown on its own Kurds. The Kurdish fighters are the best (and the only, in the case of Syria) reliable forces on the ground in the fight against ISIS.\n\nAbout a month ago, the Syrian government launched a major assault on Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city to the north to weaken the rebels and claim their territory. The Syrian Kurds took advantage of the government campaign to expand their area of control in order to connect a Kurdish pocket in northwest Syria with the rest of the Kurdish territories in northern Syria by the Turkish border. The Syrian Kurds tried to control a strategic town called Azaz, located 25 miles to the north on the supply line to Aleppo.\n\nThat gave Turkey the incentive they needed to launch an air attack on the Syrian Kurds to prevent them from capturing the city. Turkey\u2019s shelling of the Syrian Kurds was condemned by most of the world, including the United States and the United Nations\u2019 Security Council. Moreover, Turkey arranged for hundreds of Syrian Sunni Arab fighters to cross its border to Turkey then come back to Syria from another border center, to the town of Azaz, to join the fight against the Kurds. The Turkish bombardment of the Kurds has jeopardized the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Syria because the Kurds then began looking for support from the Syrian government and even from Russia.\n\nRelated: Suicide bombing exposes divisions tearing at Turkey's stability\n\nThe Iraqi Kurdish forces have recently regained ground around Mosul with the help of US air strikes. Yet, last December, a Turkish army battalion was deployed to the north of Mosul over the protests of the Iraqi government, the United States, and the United Nations. Iraq also threatened to fight the Turkish invaders. The Americans publicly said that the Turkish deployment was not part of the US-led coalition against ISIS. None of these actions could persuade the Turks to back off.\n\nTurkey claimed that its forces in northern Iraq protected the Iraqi Sunni forces from attacks launched by ISIS. But Turkey\u2019s interests in Iraq are similar to its interests in Syria. The Turkish government wants to make sure that the Kurds will not expand their territories in the Arab Sunni regions or the Turkmen areas. Turkey also wants assurance that it will have a say in Mosul\u2019s political structure after the liberation. This week, ISIS and Turkey have exchanged artillery bombardment in the Mosul area. On Tuesday, an Iraqi politician from Mosul accused Turkey of shelling Mosul indiscriminately.\n\nErdogan and Ottoman Dreams\n\nFor a number of years, the Turkish president Erdogan was viewed as an able diplomat who built a bridge between the Islamic world and the West. Yet the longer his tenure, the more frustrating his policies were for his people, the Middle East and the world. Somewhere during his years in power, he had a dream: he envisioned himself as an Ottoman Sultan, able to control the Middle East from Baghdad to Casablanca. The problem is that no one has awakened him from the dream.\n\nRelated: Turkey Says Brussels Attacker Deported In 2015, Belgium Ignored Warning\n\nWhen a Turkish newspaper criticized him, he nationalized it. When the Judiciary investigated his actions, he fired the judges. He sent his army to punish the Kurds in Turkey. His military downed a Russian fighter after violating the Turkish airspace for a few seconds, yet he wasn\u2019t shy about sending his unwelcomed army to Iraq. http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/25/Two-ISIS-Battles-Could-Change-Face-Middle-East\n\nErdogan has engaged in a regional conflict with Egypt and Saudi Arabia for crushing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, yet he did not hesitate to silence the protests in his own country. His country\u2019s relations with Israel, Syria, Iraq and Iran have suffered the consequences of his polices. Turkey\u2019s relations with the U.S. have suffered as well. President Obama said recently that he was disappointed with Erdogan\u2019s leadership. Erdogan has assumed applause would follow, rather than the long line of cold shoulders.\n\nErdogan has compromised his country, now in crisis with itself and the rest of the world. Despite its hopes of manipulating geopolitics to its own favor, Turkey\u2019s fashioned role as an outlier with an independent agenda has caused the region and the world to think the Ottoman Empire is a bad dream best left between the covers of history books.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you want to be a dictator, the first thing you do is control the press in the count", "title": "Turkey Is Playing a Dangerous Game With ISIS as It Seeks Islamic Glory", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/Turkey-Playing-Dangerous-Game-ISIS-It-Seeks-Islamic-Glory", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR49V5V%20%281%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/Turkey-Playing-Dangerous-Game-ISIS-It-Seeks-Islamic-Glory", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR49V5V%20%281%29.jpg", "creator": "@AlhamdaniRiyadh", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you want to be a dictator, the first thing you do is control the press in the count", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Turkey considers the Kurds (whether Turkish Kurds, Syrian Kurds, or Iraqi Kurds) the main threat to Turkish national security.\nFor Turkey, ISIS is the lesser of two evils compared to the Kurds.\nThe Syrian Kurds tried to control a strategic town called Azaz, located 25 miles to the north on the supply line to Aleppo.\nTurkey has anxiously observed the gains Syrian Kurds achieved over the last few years.\nThat gave Turkey the incentive they needed to launch an air attack on the Syrian Kurds to prevent them from capturing the city."}
