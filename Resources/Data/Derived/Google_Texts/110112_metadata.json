But they also wanted to keep sucking up federal health-care dollars.\n\nSo when the feds finally said: Fine, if you don't want our health dollars, we won't give you our health dollars, they flipped out.\n\nGov. Rick Scott vowed to sue. Suddenly, he was no longer ranting about federal health-care money ... he was desperate for it.\n\nHouse Republicans weren't sure what to do. So they staged a secret meeting where they passed out talking points for members to parrot. This way, if a pesky constituent asked why they were making such a mess, they could respond with prattle like: \"We will continue to listen to new ideas ...\"\n\nSenate Republicans \u2014 the grown-ups in the room \u2014 tried to offer solutions. But the two sides (from the same party) can't even agree on a budget. So now they're talking about a special session so that taxpayers can fund another round of this unproductive insanity.\n\nWelcome to government in the sunshine \u2014 where leaders keep secrets from the people they represent and where working-class families are the victims of political warfare.\n\nIn this case, it's 800,000 low-wage workers who will lose out if the House refuses to accept Medicaid money.\n\nThe money is there to help them. That's what the Affordable Care Act is about. And most states have already accepted it \u2014 including ones led by Republican governors like Arizona's Jan Brewer, who said: \"It's pro-life; it's saving lives; it is creating jobs; it is saving hospitals.\"\n\nFlorida business leaders agree, even if Florida has to fund 10 percent of the costs. The expansion has been touted by hospitals, pastors, nonprofit leaders and business execs who say the expansion will help families and generate 70,000 new jobs.\n\nSenate Republicans also want to accept the money. (Proving this isn't about left vs. right. It's about solutionists vs. obstructionists.)\n\nBut House Republicans simply cannot get past the fact that this is \"Obamacare\" money. So they want to refuse insurance for others \u2014 even while enjoying taxpayer-subsidized plans of their own.\n\nAnd now things are getting even messier.\n\nSee, the federal June 30 deadline for accepting Medicaid money is approaching. And if Florida doesn't take it, we'll also lose existing federal money that subsidizes hospitals around the state \u2014 more than $1 billion a year.\n\nHouse Republicans view it as a threat. It's actually financially savvy.\n\nThe existing money primarily reimburses hospitals for unpaid ER bills from the poor and uninsured \u2014 which is a wickedly ineffective way to provide health care. It's cheaper for people with insurance and Medicaid to visit doctors and clinics.\n\nThat's why the feds are basically saying: We're giving you the money to provide citizens cheaper, preventive health care. If you won't give them that, we're not going to clean up your mess by spending tax dollars on costlier ER care.\n\nThis is what fiscal conservatives should want.\n\nIt's like offering to pay for your daughter's insurance plan and having her say: No thanks, Dad. I'd rather you just pay for my ER bills instead.\n\nYou'd tell her: No way. Well, Rick Scott is that defiant daughter, suing federal taxpayers to keep welfare-for-hospital-ER's going.\n\nRealizing that might not work, House Republicans are now talking about dipping into state reserves to try to patch together a budget.\n\nFiscal conservativism indeed.\n\nListen, I know not everybody likes Obamacare. Heck, there are parts of it I don't like \u2014 and parts that conservatives like Jan Brewer and Florida Senate President Andy Gardiner don't like either.\n\nBut that ship has sailed. The Affordable Care Act is now the law of the land.\n\nThe money is being spent. Now, it's just a question of which states are going to take it \u2014 to provide health care to working families \u2014 and which states are going to make people suffer and wreck their own budgets to make a political point.\n\nsmaxwell@orlandosentinel.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Secret meetings, threats, lawsuits \u2014 a Florida meltdown", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Tallahassee melted down last week.", "title": "Secret meetings, threats, lawsuits \u2014 a Florida meltdown", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-florida-medicaid-obamacare-scott-maxwell-20150425-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-553bf344/turbine/os-florida-medicaid-obamacare-scott-maxwell-20150425", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Florida, Medicaid, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Rick Scott", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/83386651", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-25", "Description": "Secret meetings, threats, a lawsuit \u2014 it's a Florida Medicaid meltdown", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Florida, Medicaid, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Rick Scott"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd288a\"", "article_summary": "And if Florida doesn't take it, we'll also lose existing federal money that subsidizes hospitals around the state \u2014 more than $1 billion a year.\nThat's why the feds are basically saying: We're giving you the money to provide citizens cheaper, preventive health care.\nThe existing money primarily reimburses hospitals for unpaid ER bills from the poor and uninsured \u2014 which is a wickedly ineffective way to provide health care.\nSuddenly, he was no longer ranting about federal health-care money ... he was desperate for it.\nIn this case, it's 800,000 low-wage workers who will lose out if the House refuses to accept Medicaid money."}
