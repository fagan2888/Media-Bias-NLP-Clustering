New regulations, industry consolidation, and a shifting patient relationship, are changing the way they manage their organizations,\u201d said John Webb, vice president, industry strategy and alliances, Workday.\n\n\u201cWith Workday, healthcare providers will have the people, financial, and supply chain insights they need, all in in one system built on a flexible foundation from which they can continually adapt and grow in a dynamic industry,\u201d Webb said.\n\nThe company is working with healthcare providers on developing niche-specific capabilities, and has already announced a partnership with the Community Health Services of Georgia, a non-profit coordinating long-term care services in the State of Georgia and existing Workday customer to expand the platform\u2019s feature set.\n\n\u201cOur world today is more complex than ever before. New regulations resulting from the Affordable Care Act, evolving patient dynamics, ambitious growth plans, and increased competition for talent, are creating new challenges for our organization and workforce,\u201d said Angela Hammack, vice president, special projects, Community Health Services of Georgia.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Workday, we will be able to help design a system that not only meets our future needs, but one that truly addresses the challenges facing healthcare providers today. As an existing Workday customer, we\u2019ve already benefited from the power of one system, and can only imagine the possibilities that come with collaborating on new features and applications that help support our whole ecosystem,\u201d Hammack said.\n\nLike many niche sectors healthcare is dominated by just a handful of IT vendors, but in recent months big cloud vendors like Box, IBM and Google have all moved to increase their visibility in the sector through partnership, acquisition, and the development of industry-tailored offerings.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "angela hammack,erp,georgia,hcm,john webb,workday", "google-site-verification": "ZanYC4l4Ha5PhlC3qzZcONLIU7bqQPCEDpckXX6EZNQ", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "description": "Workday is looking to extend its human capital management and financial services applications to the healthcare sector and plans to launch as early as September this year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.0.1"}, "article_summary": "Workday is looking to extend its human capital management and financial services applications to the healthcare sector and plans to launch as early as September this year.\n\u201cHealthcare providers are dealing with a significant amount of complexity.\nThe company said it will combine its financial management and HCM cloud services with Workday Inventory, a recently launched supply chain management tool, and tailor the combined platform specifically for the needs of healthcare providers.\nNew regulations, industry consolidation, and a shifting patient relationship, are changing the way they manage their organizations,\u201d said John Webb, vice president, industry strategy and alliances, Workday.\n\u201cBy partnering with Workday, we will be able to help design a system that not only meets our future needs, but one that truly addresses the challenges facing healthcare providers today."}
