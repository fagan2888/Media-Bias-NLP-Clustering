Here they discuss genre, gender and the politics of \u201crealism.\u201d Who defines what is real and what is fantasy? Do genre labels classify authors\u2019 identities rather than the stories they choose to tell?\n\nRene Denfeld is the author of \u201cThe Enchanted,\u201d winner of numerous awards and accolades, including a prestigious French Prix, an ALA Medal for Excellence in Fiction, a Texas Lariat Award, the Oregonian\u2019s No. 1 Book of the Year, long listed for a Carnegie award, and finalist for the Flaherty-Dunnan prize. \u201cThe Enchanted\u201d was inspired by her work with men on death row. Rene currently works as the chief investigator for an indigent defense firm, and is the happy mom to three kids she adopted from foster care.\n\nStephanie Feldman\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Angel of Losses,\u201d is a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, winner of the Crawford Fantasy Award, and a finalist for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. It arrives in paperback in June. Stephanie teaches fiction writing at Arcadia University and lives outside Philadelphia with her family.\n\nStephanie Feldman: I heard you say that the book started with the voice and the idea of enchantment, but did you ever try writing fiction about prison in a strictly realist voice?\n\nRene Denfeld: That\u2019s a great question, because to me, \u201cThe Enchanted\u201d is a realist novel. The narrator believes he lives in a magical, enchanted place. He may be in a death row dungeon, but to him it is enchanted. That\u2019s his reality. The charging golden horses that live underground, the little men in the walls \u2014 they are as real to him as the stone that surrounds him.\n\nIn my work as a death penalty investigator, I often deal with people who have a much different sense of reality than I do. Their reality might be shaped by mental illness, or terrible poverty, or often, by a lifetime of horrific abuse. But it is their reality. When someone tells me they see something I don\u2019t see, I remind myself, \u201cThis person is seeing something that maybe I am missing.\u201d I am not there to pass judgment on their reality. I am there to listen to it, to hear it, to accept it.\n\nIt\u2019s a very narrow, dominant culture view to look at something like a death row prison from the outside \u2014 from the position of someone with a full belly and a safe home \u2014 and assume your view is, in fact, the reality. To do so misses so many important truths, like how being inside can change one\u2019s sense of time, or how inmates find hope while waiting for death, or how even the very concept of death changes when you are going to be killed. Fantasy and dreams and storytelling are signs of hope. Can you imagine a life without stories? Without dreams? I am fascinated by our ability to respond to despair with our imaginations.\n\nSo, long answer short: \u201cThe Enchanted\u201d is a realist depiction of both the life of a death row inmate, one that captures his ability to find magic and joy even in the midst of horror.\n\nAnd how about for you? In \u201cThe Angel of Losses,\u201d both real and imagined folk tales play a significant role in the search for identity. Do you feel the inclusion of myth and magic makes a book more or less realistic? Has the concept of realism in literature been defined by a very narrow, predominately male-dominated literary culture?\n\nFeldman: I also believe that the fantastic is often the most honest way to capture reality. My book is interested in identity and history, and how they\u2019re socially constructed in tandem. I thought about how family, national and ethnic history informs who we are, but mostly I worked backward, wondering what our self-image has to say about what came before, or how preceding generations made sense of what came before.\n\nI\u2019m also fascinated by how we can recover history that\u2019s been lost (records destroyed, stories untold). And if you\u2019re building history, you start with meaning, not facts. Your narrator\u2019s vision of the prison tells me as much about life there as the details I might read in a journalistic account.\n\nI think many writers and readers adhere to a hard line in literature between fantasy and realism, a border that\u2019s never made much sense to me. One reader expressed frustration with my book \u2014 she didn\u2019t know whether it was \u201cfantasy\u201d or not. Things happen in the book that don\u2019t happen on our earth. (That I know about, anyway.) But the relationships are real; the love and frustration and self-destructive anger that animate them are real. The European past it describes is also very real, as it lives in our imaginations, as it informs my identity and how I think of myself \u2014 even if it includes an angel and a wizard.\n\nGenre labels frustrate me, because genre itself is so porous. But I do find myself returning to the word \u201cfantastic\u201d (or, when I\u2019m feeling particularly literary, \u201cfabulist\u201d). Even then, \u201cfantastic\u201d isn\u2019t telling people what the book is; it\u2019s telling people what the book isn\u2019t. To me, \u201cfantastic\u201d just means unlimited. So maybe you\u2019re right that this has something to do with the greater status quo. One part of society defining what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t; what\u2019s allowed in art, and life, and what\u2019s forbidden.\n\nDenfeld: The concept of genres frustrates me, too. I\u2019ve been told \u201cThe Enchanted\u201d is genre bending \u2014 it is difficult to pigeonhole. But aren\u2019t many good books? I fear writing to genre. If you sit down and think, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a thriller,\u201d or \u201cI am going to write a mystery,\u201d it seems that would limit you. You\u2019d end up throwing away everything that didn\u2019t fit the box. That would be an excellent way to stifle writing an authentic truth.\n\nIn \u201cThe Enchanted,\u201d I gave my narrator free rein to tell me what he was thinking. Lots of what he said surprised me, but as I wrote it down, I could see the truth in it. At one point he talks about how time is different on death row. Not just the passage of time, but the meaning of it. Time, he says, \u201cis measured in meaning.\u201d Once locked, men lose the meaning inside time \u2014 they are untethered to the past as well as a future. They quite literally lose all sense of time. As I was writing that section I instantly recognized that I had observed this with men on death row, but until that moment, it had not risen to my consciousness.\n\nI love the concept of using writing to make sense \u2014 of what came before, of what we are and the meaning of those around us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two authors on using fairy-tale elements to explore trauma & memory, and why \"Is this real\" is a loaded question", "title": "Writing to genre stinks: Two debut novelists on the hard line between fantasy and realism \u2014 and why it doesn\u2019t make sense", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Two authors on using fairy-tale elements to explore trauma & memory, and why \"Is this real\" is a loaded question", "title": "Writing to genre stinks: Two debut novelists on the hard line between fantasy and realism \u2014 and why it doesn\u2019t make sense", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/writing_to_genre_stinks_two_debut_novelists_on_the_hard_line_between_fantasy_and_realism_and_why_it_doesnt_make_sense/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/feldman_denfeld.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two authors on using fairy-tale elements to explore trauma & memory, and why \"Is this real\" is a loaded question", "title": "Writing to genre stinks: Two debut novelists on the hard line between fantasy and realism \u2014 and why it doesn\u2019t make sense", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/feldman_denfeld.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rene Denfeld and Stephanie Feldman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Fantasy, realism, the angel of losses, the enchanted, Writers and Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc81b\"", "article_summary": "At one point he talks about how time is different on death row.\nHere they discuss genre, gender and the politics of \u201crealism.\u201d Who defines what is real and what is fantasy?\nHe may be in a death row dungeon, but to him it is enchanted.\n\u201cThe Enchanted\u201d was inspired by her work with men on death row.\nI think many writers and readers adhere to a hard line in literature between fantasy and realism, a border that\u2019s never made much sense to me."}
