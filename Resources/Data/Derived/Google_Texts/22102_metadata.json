Long working hours were also associated with an increased chance of coronary heart disease, but this association was found to be weaker than that for a stroke.\n\nThe analysis was the largest study conducted thus far of the affiliation between working hours and cardiovascular health, including data on more than 600,000 individuals in Europe, the U.S., and Australia.\n\nResearchers believe the constant triggering of the stress response from overwork induces the stroke, often resulting in sudden death. In addition, behavioral activities that stem from the longer hours also contribute to the heightened chance of a stroke.\n\nEmployees who work longer hours are found to rely more on heavy alcohol consumption as a way to reduce stress, but drinking only increases the risk for all types of strokes. In addition, more time at a desk means long periods of physical inactivity, which can increase the risk of stroke.\n\nA study by Credit Loan shows that employees worldwide are working more than 40 hours per week. The U.S. leads the pack with the highest percentages of overtime workers \u2013 85.8 percent of males and 66.5 percent of females.\n\nSomeone ought to tell Jeb Bush before he repeats what he said early in the campaign -- that Americans need to put in more hours at work.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Putting in long hours at the office might impress your boss, but they\u2019re certainly not helping your health. \u00a0\u00a0 A new study published in The Lancet found that individuals who worked 55 hours per week or more had a 1-3 times greater risk of a stroke compared to those who worked 40 hours a week.
