Kondo has been the subject of a movie in Japan, and the waiting list for her services, once three months, is so extensive she has temporarily stopped accepting clients.\n\nHer \u201cKonMarie Method,\u201d as she calls it in the diminutive and illustration-free volume, encourages a rapid, dramatic and transformative one-time organizing event \u2014 completed methodically and lovingly in no more than six months. It\u2019s not an ongoing battle against clutter.\n\nKondo sees \u201ctidying\u201d as a cheerful conversation in which anything that doesn\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d is to be touched, thanked and ceremonially sent on its way to a better life elsewhere, where it can discover a more appreciative owner.\n\nThe result can be life-changing, she says. Clients suddenly find themselves surrounded by things that provide clarity, unencumbered by belongings that carry past baggage (unwanted gifts, clothes that no longer fit) or anxieties about the future (does anyone need more cotton swabs than there are days of the year?). Even her book, she says, should be discarded when no longer needed.\n\nPart of what makes her method unusually speedy is that instead of de-cluttering room by room, she tackles a household by subject, starting with what\u2019s easiest to part with. So, all the clothes, then all the books, then documents, then miscellany and, last and most difficult, photos and mementos.\n\nInstead of deciding what to discard, she says, the focus should be on what to keep: which few things spark sufficient joy or are truly necessary.\n\nHow to contend with family unready to join in the celebratory purge?\n\nIf possible, carry bags out of the house yourself. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to let your family know the details of what you throw out or donate,\u201d she writes, although she advises against secretly disposing of other people\u2019s things. \u201cYou can leave communal spaces to the end. The first step is to confront your own stuff.\u201d\n\nAfter joyfully relegating mountains of unneeded or unloved belongings to the trash or charity, she turns to organizing what\u2019s left.\n\nThe key is storing things mostly in drawers, arranged so that everything can be seen at a glance and nothing is stacked, a practice decidedly unkind to items at the bottom.\n\nSo T-shirts and socks are rolled and arranged like sushi in a bento box.\n\nClosets are meticulously arranged to fit everything from electric fans (at the bottom) and spare blankets (on top) to carefully arranged clear drawers of beloved belongings and a shelf or two with a few joy-sparking books. Papers and documents are filed.\n\nKondo says she has been obsessed with \u201ctidying\u201d since she was 5, opting to arrange shoes and pencils in school when other kids played on the playground. She began communing with her belongings in high school and, after years of work at a Shinto shrine, realized her calling as a professional consultant on attaining the joy of minimalism.\n\n\u201cThe inside of a house or apartment after de-cluttering has much in common with a Shinto shrine \u2026 a place where there are no unnecessary things, and our thoughts become clear. It is the place where we appreciate all the things that support us,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is where we review and rethink about ourselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cTidying Up\u201d: Japanese book on de-cluttering transforms ugly chore", "title": "\u201cTidying Up\u201d: Japanese book on de-cluttering transforms ugly chore", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/28/tidying-up-japanese-book-on-de-cluttering-transforms-ugly-chore/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128__20141129_C2_FE29AHTIDYp2.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128__20141129_C2_FE29AHTIDYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-28T16:59:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T17:02:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf70f\"", "article_summary": "Kondo\u2019s book, \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,\u201d is a best-seller in Japan, Germany and Britain and was recently published in the United States.\nInstead of deciding what to discard, she says, the focus should be on what to keep: which few things spark sufficient joy or are truly necessary.\nSo, all the clothes, then all the books, then documents, then miscellany and, last and most difficult, photos and mementos.\nKondo sees \u201ctidying\u201d as a cheerful conversation in which anything that doesn\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d is to be touched, thanked and ceremonially sent on its way to a better life elsewhere, where it can discover a more appreciative owner.\nIt is the place where we appreciate all the things that support us,\u201d she says."}
