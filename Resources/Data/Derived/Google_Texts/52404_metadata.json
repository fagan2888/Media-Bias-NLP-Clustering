What we\u2019re seeing, in part, is a cost of going post-policy for mainstream conservatives.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the dynamic that may send Republicans over a cliff \u2013 with Republicans in Congress threatening to shut down the government (or possibly default the government by failing to extend the debt limit) unless Democrats surrender the Affordable Care Act \u2013 something which apparently absolutely no one, including the Republicans involved, believe will work. Instead, most people, and especially those Republicans who lived through Newt\u2019s Folly back in 1995-1996, are certain that the GOP will bear most of the blame if there is a government shutdown.\n\nSo if most Republicans think it\u2019s a lousy idea, why did the House just pass a Continuing Resolution that takes exactly the path that Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and their allies at Jim DeMint\u2019s Heritage told them to take?\n\nThe dynamic that drives much of what congressional Republicans do is very simple: They are terrified of being labeled squishes, RINOs or, even worse, liberals. In any objective sense, of course, this is nonsense; polarization in the House is at record levels, meaning that there\u2019s a clear divide between even the most moderate members, with the most liberal Republican easily more conservative than the most conservative Democrat. Nevertheless, politicians are paranoid by nature, and in a world in which conservative Utah Sen. Bob Bennett was defeated for renomination, there\u2019s enough evidence available in recent memory for them to act on that paranoia.\n\nIn practice, what that means is that mainstream conservatives try to avoid allowing any distance between themselves and whoever can plausibly call themselves \u201cTrue Conservatives\u201d and get away with it.\n\nBut here\u2019s where \u201cpost-policy\u201d comes in.\n\nRemember, Republicans have mostly just given up on developing real, conservative public policy. We saw that in the 2012 campaign, in which Mitt Romney couldn\u2019t be bothered to come up with a tax plan that came close to adding up. We\u2019ve seen it in the failure to come up with a \u201creplace\u201d bill on healthcare reform as part of their promised \u201crepeal and replace\u201d plan. Unlike in Ronald Reagan\u2019s era, or even Newt Gingrich\u2019s era (or perhaps more to the point, unlike in Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency), there\u2019s no conservative policy agenda beyond just rejecting everything Democrats want.\n\nSimply put: When you\u2019ve reduced your entire movement to saying \u201cno\u201d to Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi, is it any surprise that whoever shouts \u201cNO\u201d the loudest will wind up defining what counts as \u201cconservative\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here\u2019s the real reason the right-wing nut from Texas is able to tell his party where to go", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s bullying formula", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Here\u2019s the real reason the right-wing nut from Texas is able to tell his party where to go", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s bullying formula", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/21/ted_cruzs_bullying_formula/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/ted_cruz_jw.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here\u2019s the real reason the right-wing nut from Texas is able to tell his party where to go", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s bullying formula", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/ted_cruz_jw.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jonathan Bernstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, Editor's Picks, Obamacare, policy, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, Texas, The Right, U.S. Senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aca, Editor's Picks, Obamacare, policy, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, Texas, The Right, U.S. Senate, Politics NewsWhy is Ted Cruz so successful at bullying the Republican Party?\nTed Cruz and Mike Lee and their allies at Jim DeMint\u2019s Heritage told them to take?\nRemember, Republicans have mostly just given up on developing real, conservative public policy.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing, in part, is a cost of going post-policy for mainstream conservatives.\nUnlike in Ronald Reagan\u2019s era, or even Newt Gingrich\u2019s era (or perhaps more to the point, unlike in Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency), there\u2019s no conservative policy agenda beyond just rejecting everything Democrats want."}
