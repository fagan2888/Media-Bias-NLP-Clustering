On Sunday, MSNBC’s Alex Witt spoke to Tracy Martin, the father of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder in the summer of 2013.

In a heartbreaking conversation Martin pointed the similarities between his son’s death and the killing of Michael Brown — especially attempts to smear the character of these deceased teens.

Martin explained that sometimes he would wonder: “Is my son on trial? Or is his killer on trial?”

He also had a wise and important response to Witt’s questions of how to end the “alienation that many young black men feel” and the antagonization they face at the hands of the police.
