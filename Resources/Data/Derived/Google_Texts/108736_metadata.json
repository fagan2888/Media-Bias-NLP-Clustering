Alessandro Bianchi / Reuters\n\nIn May, government officials in Paraguay refused to allow a 10-year-old pregnant girl who had been raped by her stepfather the ability to have an abortion. The girl, who is now 11, has now given birth to a baby girl, according to CNN.\n\nWhile the girl and her child are reportedly in good health, the event reopens the debate over Paraguay\u2019s draconian abortion laws \u2014 which don\u2019t allow anyone to have an abortion unless it puts the mother\u2019s life at risk. Abortion is considered a crime in nearly all other cases. Earlier this year, officials decided the pregnancy did not put the girl\u2019s life at risk, despite protests from human rights groups.\n\n\u201cParaguayan authorities decided to gamble with the girl\u2019s health, life, and integrity despite overwhelming evidence that this pregnancy was extremely risky and despite the fact that she was a rape victim and a child,\u201d according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, as well as the stepfather who raped her repeatedly, have been arrested \u2014 charged with child neglect and rape/abuse of a child, respectively.\n\nParaguay is one of the many developing countries that sees scores of young girls under the age of 14 with pregnancies. Many of these girls are survivors of rape and sexual abuse. In 2013, the UN released a report that found that two million births a year occur to young mothers under the age of 14, and many are faced with serious health complications later in life.\n\n\u201cToo often, society blames only the girl for getting pregnant,\u201d the UN stated. \u201cThe reality is that adolescent pregnancy is most often not the result of a deliberate choice, but rather the absence of choices.\u201d\n\nThe baby girl was delivered by C-section and weighs about 6.6 pounds. According to a psychologist speaking to CNN, the young mother is supposedly in good psychological condition. But Guadalupe Marengo, deputy director for the Americas at Amnesty International, believes that\u2019s not the case \u2014 not even one bit. \u201cThe physical and psychological impact of forcing this young girl to continue with an unwanted pregnancy is tantamount to torture,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "11, year, old, paraguay, girl, denied, abortion, gives, birth, baby, after, rape", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Paraguay officials denied the girl a right to have an abortion, so she has had to undergo a pregnancy and childbirth at age 11.", "title": "11-Year-Old Girl Denied Abortion, Gives Birth To Baby After Rape", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/11-year-old-paraguay-girl-denied-abortion-gives-birth-baby-after-rape-347922", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/14/paraguay.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paraguay officials denied the girl a right to have an abortion, so she has had to undergo a pregnancy and childbirth at age 11.", "title": "11-Year-Old Girl Denied Abortion, Gives Birth To Baby After Rape", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/11-year-old-paraguay-girl-denied-abortion-gives-birth-baby-after-rape-347922", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/14/paraguay.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/14/paraguay.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-14T14:17:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T14:17:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Paraguay officials denied the girl a right to have an abortion, so she has had to undergo a pregnancy and childbirth at age 11."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fcc\"", "article_summary": "Young mothers abound in Paraguay, a country that has some of the strictest abortion laws in the world.\n\u201cThe physical and psychological impact of forcing this young girl to continue with an unwanted pregnancy is tantamount to torture,\u201d he said.\nParaguay is one of the many developing countries that sees scores of young girls under the age of 14 with pregnancies.\nThe girl, who is now 11, has now given birth to a baby girl, according to CNN.\nEarlier this year, officials decided the pregnancy did not put the girl\u2019s life at risk, despite protests from human rights groups."}
