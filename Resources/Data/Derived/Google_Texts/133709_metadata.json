Jeanne Shaheen is pushing legislation that could lead to the replacement of former president Andrew Jackson\u2019s face on the $20 bill with a woman.\n\nThe Women on the Twenty Act would set up a committee of citizens tasked with recommending a choice to the treasury secretary, The Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nA similar effort has been pushed by lobbying group Women on 20s, which wants to see new $20 bills by the year 2020 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of opportunities that we sometimes don\u2019t think about to point out the significant contributions women have made in U.S. history,\u201d the senator said, AP reported, \u201cAnd this is one of those opportunities.\u201d\n\nWomen on 20s conducted an online survey of more than 230,000 participants to determine four final contenders for the new $20 bill: former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, abolitionist Harriet Tubman, civil rights activist Rosa Parks, and former Cherokee Nation Chief Wilma Mankiller, AP reported.\n\nBut the winner of the poll might not necessarily end up on the new bills.\n\n\u201cWe are not under any illusions that the person who comes out of our polling will be the person who ends up on a bill because there is a process and that process usually involves empaneling a group of experts to make certain design choices,\u201d Susan Ades Stone, the executive director of Women on 20s, told Mediaite on Friday.\n\nThe $20 bill is already overdue for a redesign, bills are supposed to be redesigned every ten years to prevent counterfeiting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue for that reflection to include the contributions of women,\u201d Ms. Shaheen said in a statement on her website. \u201cThe incredible grassroots support for this idea shows that there\u2019s strong support for a woman to be the new face of the twenty dollar bill.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Ms. Shaheen told Mediaite that the goal to put a woman on the $20 bill specifically did not have anything to do with President Jackson\u2019s face currently being on the bill, but that the main objective in choosing the $20 was to take the \u201copportunity to make a bigger impact,\u201d because the $20 is seen and used more frequently than the $50 or $100 bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Hampshire Democratic Sen.
