Paul Ryan of Wisconsin would seem like an ideal choice of conservatives to be the next House Speaker.\n\nA gifted conservative policy maker who has chaired both the House Budget and Ways and Means Committees, and was the Republicans\u2019 2012 vice presidential nominee, the 45-year-old Ryan would bring a combination of strategic thinking and deal-making skills to the job that few others could match.\n\nRelated: House conservative group would 'look favorably' on Ryan for speakership\n\n\u201cI think he checks every box,\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), the conservative leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee who has expressed interest in the speakership himself. \u201cHe\u2019s got the great experience, he\u2019s a visionary, he understands the institution. He\u2019s a great spokesperson.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd one of the things that people love about him is that he puts his family first,\u201d Chaffetz added during an appearance today on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program.\n\nOne of Ryan\u2019s crowning achievements was a two-year bipartisan budget deal that he and then-Democratic Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated in late December 2013 following a 16-day government shutdown. Ironically, it is probably one of the reasons Ryan may not pass muster with many of the 40 Freedom Caucus conservatives who forced Boehner to retire and then last Thursday toppled heir apparent, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\nThe Ryan-Murray agreement secured a two-year truce in the longstanding budgetary warfare between Republicans and Democrat. It was a rare example of a form of legislative stagecraft that was once the norm on Capitol Hill but has fallen into disfavor with many Republican conservatives who prefer confrontation and brinksmanship to compromise and give and take.\n\nRelated: Right-Wing Rebels Bring Down McCarthy, Another \u2018Establishment Hack\u2019\n\nAlready, some conservatives are taking pot shots at Ryan for compromising GOP principles and hard-earned gains in negotiating the budget deal with Murray. Others reportedly are complaining that Ryan had the audacity that same year to predict publicly that the House would eventually pass immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants \u2013 which was heresy among many Republicans.\n\nAll eyes are on Ryan this weekend as he confers back home with his wife and political advisers on whether he should enter the race for Speaker, despite near unanimity among analysts that it may be the worst political job in town because of the unruly majority. The topic of Ryan\u2019s dilemma dominated the Sunday talk shows, with many arguing that Ryan offers the House Republicans their best chance of salvation from political chaos and public ridicule heading into months of crucial budget and legislative negotiations.\n\nRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that he would be \u201cokay\u201d with Ryan as the next speaker although, \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t want it very badly.\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, head of the Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Sunday that some of his members \u201cwould look favorably\u201d on Ryan -- provided he is willing to embrace reforms that would diminish the leadership\u2019s powers and strengthen the hand of rank and file members.\n\nBut former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) \u2013 who was forced out of office by rebellious members of his own party years ago, cautioned Ryan about seeking the speakership, even if it appears he can easily attract the 218 GOP members needed for election as speaker.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan: 10 Reasons He'd Make a Good Speaker\n\n\u201cI think Paul should be very cautious,\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cHe is the most prestigious member of the House on the Republican side and he has the best future. He\u2019s still very young. It\u2019s easy to get 218 on the first vote, but then you get to keep the government open through a continuing resolution and then you get to the debt ceiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, by Christmas you resemble John Boehner\u201d to conservative rank-and-file members who are in no mood to cut deals, Gingrich said. \u201cThese things are hard.\u201d\n\nRyan is a true standout in Congress. He gradually rose to prominence in the House as the chairman of the House Budget Committee after years as a legislative aide and speechwriter, think tank analyst, marketing consultant and junior House member from the small town of Janesville, Wisconsin, where his wife and three young children live.\n\nHe was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jack Kemp, the late Republican lawmaker and football star from upstate New York who combined a belief in supply side economics with compassionate conservatism. But Ryan was also a big fan of the works of Ayn Rand, a champion of laissez faire capitalism.\n\nRelated: Congressional Odd Couple Finally Strikes a Budget Deal\n\nAfter the Republicans won control of the House in 2010, Ryan unveiled the groundbreaking \u201cRoadmap for America\u2019s Future\u201d \u2013 a highly controversial blue print for sharply reducing government spending and overhauling many social programs and entitlements. He advocated privatizing Medicare and converting Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states.\n\n\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney tapped Ryan to be his running mate in the 2012 presidential campaign after the two men went to great pains to confer secretly before word could slip out. After the Republicans went down to defeat in the general election, Ryan decided to stay out of the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, he shifted his attention to setting the groundwork for a major overhaul of the federal tax code after the 2016 election.\n\nBut first, he was called upon to work out an armistice with the Democrats after the yearlong budget battle that led to the government shutdown in the fall of 2013. Although they were very different in political outlook and style, the liberal Murray and conservative Ryan met repeatedly in private and successfully hammered out an agreement to avert the possibility of another government shutdown or a first-ever default on the U.S. debt.\n\nThey did so by agreeing to cancel the automatic across-the-board spending cuts and caps mandated by the Budget Control Act to enable the GOP to claim more spending on defense and enable President Obama to gain more money for his prized domestic programs.\n\nRelated: Murray and Ryan Race the Clock for New Budget Deal\n\nThe landmark budget deal boosted overall spending by $63 billion over a two-year period yet also achieved $85 billion of savings and $23 billion of long-term net deficit reduction. It was a classic example of bipartisan give and take that produced an agreement that eventually won solid approval in the House and Senate.\n\nIn some ways, the Ryan-Murray budget deal is a model for a new budget agreement that the White House and Congress must strike by early December to avoid another government shutdown and possible default. But for 62 conservative Republicans, who wanted to preserve the spending caps to achieve even more budget savings, Ryan had let them down and they voted against the final deal in December 2013.\n\nJoe Miller, a Republican conservative maverick and commentator who almost defeated Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in 2010, tweeted today that \u201cPaul Ryan is the Absolute Worst Choice for Speaker.\u201d\n\nMiller wrote that Ryan has used \u201chis leverage and respect to sabotage conservatives on every last budget fight of our time,\u201d including his work on the Ryan-Murray budget deal.\n\n\u201cHe forged the Ryan-Murray budget deal, which actually countermanded the few budget victories we\u2019ve had over the past few years,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe was a wet blanket over the effort to defund Planned Parenthood. There is nobody in the conference who feels stronger about the need to preemptively announce he will not \u2018default\u2019 or \u2018shut down the government\u2019 than Ryan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With a nearly 17-year-career in Congress highlighted by his groundbreaking\u00a0 plans for", "title": "Not So Fast, Paul Ryan\u2014Some Conservatives Don\u2019t Like Your Budget Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/11/Not-So-Fast-Paul-Ryan-Some-Conservatives-Don-t-Your-Budget-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Ryan%20Murray%20budget%20deal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/11/Not-So-Fast-Paul-Ryan-Some-Conservatives-Don-t-Your-Budget-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Ryan%20Murray%20budget%20deal.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With a nearly 17-year-career in Congress highlighted by his groundbreaking\u00a0 plans for", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b3a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe forged the Ryan-Murray budget deal, which actually countermanded the few budget victories we\u2019ve had over the past few years,\u201d Miller said.\nOne of Ryan\u2019s crowning achievements was a two-year bipartisan budget deal that he and then-Democratic Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated in late December 2013 following a 16-day government shutdown.\nRelated: Right-Wing Rebels Bring Down McCarthy, Another \u2018Establishment Hack\u2019Already, some conservatives are taking pot shots at Ryan for compromising GOP principles and hard-earned gains in negotiating the budget deal with Murray.\nIn some ways, the Ryan-Murray budget deal is a model for a new budget agreement that the White House and Congress must strike by early December to avoid another government shutdown and possible default.\nRelated: Paul Ryan: 10 Reasons He'd Make a Good Speaker\u201cI think Paul should be very cautious,\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News Sunday."}
