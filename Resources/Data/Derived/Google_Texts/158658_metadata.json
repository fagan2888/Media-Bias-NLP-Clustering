And like every other Florida State victory this season, it was a blowout.\n\nThe quarterback they call Famous Jameis became the youngest Heisman winner and the second straight freshman to win the trophy Saturday night, earning college football\u2019s most prestigious individual trophy award with a performance so dominant even a criminal investigation couldn\u2019t derail his candidacy.\n\n\u201cI cannot explain the feeling that I have inside right now,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI\u2019m so overwhelmed. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nWhen his name was announced, he popped from his seat and quickly made his way to his mom and dad for hugs and kisses. He smiled and laughed through most of his acceptance speech.\n\nHe talked about trusting in the \u201cprocess\u201d on the field and in life and \u201cafter all the things I\u2019ve been through this past month.\u201d He got choked up a bit when talking about his parents.\n\n\u201cWhen you see your mom and you see your dad and they\u2019ve been struggling through this whole process and now you see a smile on their face, it comforted me,\u201d he said later.\n\nWinston received 668 first-place votes and 2,205 points. He finished 1,501 points ahead of Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron for the seventh-largest margin of victory in Heisman history, despite being left off 115 of the 900 ballots returned.\n\nNorthern Illinois quarterback Jordan Lynch was third, followed by Boston College\u2019s Andre Williams, Texas A&M\u2019s Johnny Manziel and Auburn\u2019s Tre Mason.\n\nManziel was the first freshman to win the Heisman last year, and was trying to join Ohio State\u2019s Archie Griffin as a two-time winner. Instead, Winston made it two redshirt freshman winners in the 79-year history of theHeisman. He also became the youngest winner at 23 days short of 20.\n\nThe 19-year-old also was investigated last month for a year-old sexual assault complaint, but no charges were filed and the case was closed four days before Heisman votes were due.\n\n\u201cI really believe that people actually just trusted me. People obviously saw us play. But that comes from my team, too,\u201d Winston said.\n\nWinston is the nation\u2019s top-rated passer and has led the top-ranked Seminoles (13-0) to a spot in the BCS championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. The former five-star recruit from Bessemer, Ala., made college football look easy from his very first game. On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston went 25 for 27 for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how truly intelligent he is,\u201d Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher said. \u201cHe always wanted to know why he had success or why he had failure so he could either repeat it or fix it.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much failure on the way to becoming the third Seminoles quarterback to win the Heisman. The last was Chris Weinke in 2000.\n\nWinston and Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the Tallahassee Police Department last December.\n\nThe dormant case was handed over to the state attorney\u2019s office for a full investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of rape. Winston\u2019s attorney said the sex was consensual.\n\nDuring three weeks of uncertainty, Winston continued to play sensationally, while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves. If voters were looking to Manziel or McCarron or Lynch or Williams or even Marcus Mariota of Oregon to give them a good alternative to Winston, it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe Heisman Trust mission statement says: \u201cThe Heisman Memorial Trophy annually recognizes the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a statement that has put the Heisman in awkward situations before. In 2010, Cam Newton played the season under the cloud of an NCAA investigation. He had also had legal troubles while in college. But like Winston, there was no doubt he was the best player and he won the award.\n\nReggie Bush had his 2005 Heisman stripped after the NCAA determined he had violated its rules during that season. But the Heisman trust did not ask Billy Cannon and O.J. Simpson to return their Heismans after they were sent to prison.\n\nThe accusations against Winston were serious and documents released by the police with the accuser\u2019s allegations were not flattering to him. It probably explains why so many voters left him out of their top three. Last year, Manziel appeared on 92 percent of the ballots. Winston appeared on 87 percent this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own opinion,\u201d Winston said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a numbers game and I was blessed to have the majority vote.\u201d\n\nThere was no doubting his on-the-field credentials. Winston is on pace (190.1) to break Russell Wilson\u2019s record for best passer efficiency rating in a season and set FBS freshman records for yards passing (3,820) and touchdown passes (38). Florida State\u2019s average margin of victory is 42 points, and Winston has spent most of the Seminoles\u2019 fourth quarters resting.\n\nThe investigation has taken some of the shine off Winston\u2019s Heisman coronation, at least for some people. But if the question is simply who was college football\u2019s best player in 2013, Famous Jameis was the clear answer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jameis Winston has won the Heisman Trophy, making the Florida State quarterback the second straight freshman to win the award.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jameis Winston has won the Heisman Trophy, making the Florida State quarterback the second straight freshman to win the award.", "title": "Jameis Winston wins Heisman Trophy by a wide margin over AJ McCarron", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/14/jameis-winston-wins-heisman-trophy-wide-margin-ove/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/13/heisman-trophy-footballjpeg-07a73.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/13/heisman-trophy-footballjpeg-07a73.jpg", "description": "Jameis Winston has won the Heisman Trophy, making the Florida State quarterback the second straight freshman to win the award.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jameis Winston wins Heisman Trophy by a wide margin over AJ McCarron"}, "Author": "Ralph Russo", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Johnny Manziel, Archie Griffin"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jameis Winston left voters no choice but to give him the Heisman Trophy.\nAnd like every other Florida State victory this season, it was a blowout.\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how truly intelligent he is,\u201d Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher said.\nFlorida State\u2019s average margin of victory is 42 points, and Winston has spent most of the Seminoles\u2019 fourth quarters resting.\nA female student at Florida State accused Winston of rape."}
