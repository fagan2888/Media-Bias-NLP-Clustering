Ted Cruz want to fund all of the government except Obamacare.\n\nLet me say that again. A group of Republicans in the House and a handful of Republican senators are being blamed for a shutdown of government because they propose to fund all of government except for Obamacare. And they are the ones forcing a shutdown. Right?\n\nPlease, explain that again! If Congress passes a budget that finances all of government except Obamacare, and the president vetoes that bill, the resulting shutdown is the fault of Republicans?\n\nThat, my friends, is the logic of Orwellian doublespeak. And therein lies the real problem. We have a problem not with the budget debate but with how we allow the liberal media to frame the budget debate \u2013 and every other policy debate as well.\n\nThis argument over funding Obamacare is a perfect illustration of the power of the progressive media to define the issues and limit our choices. Half the Republicans in Congress \u2013 and probably in Denver and Albany and Sacramento as well \u2013 are afraid to open the newspaper each morning.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before with the federal budget debate. We saw two brief shutdowns in the \u201980s under Reagan and another one in the \u201990s under Clinton. In each case, when the dust settled, all government workers got full paychecks. No federal employee ever lost a single dollar of salary. Everyone went back to work, and the government kept growing, same as before the manufactured \u201ccrisis.\u201d\n\nConcerned about the impact of illegal aliens on the United States? Don\u2019t miss Tom Tancredo\u2019s book, \u201cIn Mortal Danger: The Battle for America\u2019s Border and Security\u201d \u2014 and with your purchase get a free copy of \u201cMinutemen: The Battle to Secure America\u2019s Borders\u201d!\n\nNow, in case you are confused about it, this impending shutdown has nothing to do with the sequester. The sequester is, of course, the law of the land, part of a compromise plan agreed to in 2011 when we saw a confrontation over raising the debt ceiling. The sequester requires annual automatic reductions in spending that will happen each year until a better plan is adopted. Those automatic reductions are supposed to be so painful that it forces members of Congress to agree on a more rational budget reduction.\n\nWell, we can see how well THAT compromise with the Obama White House worked out. The sequester is still with us, and a more rational plan for long-term spending reduction is as far away as ever.\n\nWhy are we in this budget mess? Is it because Republicans have refused to compromise on spending cuts? No. Republicans have agreed to a series of \u201cbudget compromises\u201d over the last 40 years, since 1982. That was when President Reagan agreed to TEFRA, the \u201cTax Equity and Fiscal Responsible Act.\u201d That beautiful compromise was a whopping and immediate tax increase on the promise by Democrats to enact \u201ctwo dollars of spending cuts for each dollar of tax increase.\u201d The result? The tax increase went into effect but the promised spending cuts didn\u2019t happen.\n\nSo, who can blame anyone for being skeptical of Obama\u2019s proposal to \u201ctax now, cut later,\u201d which is STILL the Democrat plan for repealing the sequester and adopting another compromise budget.\n\nHere is what the mainstream media is not telling the American people about the budget battles in Congress: There is no budget congressional Democrats will support that actually reduces federal spending. They are willing to negotiate only the rate of increase in spending, not a reduction in spending.\n\nAt bottom, the current showdown is not an argument over Obamacare. It is an argument over the \u201cinevitability\u201d of the growth of government and a test of the credibility of representative democracy.\n\nIf you believe the progressive media and the Democrat mantra, the growth of government cannot be reversed. In their eyes and in their lexicon, the only permissible debate is over the rate of growth of government, not its direction. Repealing Obamacare would be an admission that the growth of the federal government can be reversed. To the progressives in Congress and their allies in the media, that is heresy of the highest order.\n\nThis is obviously not only a federal issue. Governors and state legislators also have a stake in this battle. Republican governors should have been at the Capitol cheering on Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, but they are strangely silent. When I am governor of Colorado, that will change.\n\nI salute and applaud Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and the House conservatives who are willing to wage this fight to defund Obamacare. These noble patriots are willing to incur the wrath of the New York Times, the scorn of John McCain and the ridicule of Republicans who are always willing to fight the next battle, but not this one.\n\nWelcome to the club.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2013/09/the-medias-government-shutdown-doublespeak/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "According to the dominant news media, we all should be worried about a possible shutdown of the federal government next week because House Republicans and Sen.
