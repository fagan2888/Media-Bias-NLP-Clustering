Recently, the company's revenue growth has been dampened by incentives paid to clients.\n\nFor the period ended Sept. 30, the company posted earnings of $977 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with $1.02 billion, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included a $50 million after-tax charge related to the termination of a U.S. employee pension plan.\n\nExcluding that charge, per-share earnings were 91 cents.\n\nRevenue grew 1.6% to $2.53 billion, or 8% excluding currency impacts.\n\nAnalysts had projected 87 cents a share in profit and $2.54 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nLike rival Visa, MasterCard processes electronic payments on its network, but doesn't collect interest or set interest rates.\n\nIn the latest quarter, purchase volume grew 12%, on a constant-currency basis, to $852 billion. Processed transactions grew 12% to 12.3 billion, while cross-border volumes grew 16%.\n\nGross dollar volume grew 13%, in terms of local currency, to $1.2 trillion.\n\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Chelsey Dulaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mastercards-revenue-dented-by-rebates-2015-10-29", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "MasterCard's revenue dented by rebates"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "MasterCard's revenue dented by rebates", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-29T08:20:00-04:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Chelsey Dulaney", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mastercards-revenue-dented-by-rebates-2015-10-29", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "43FF8F0A-7CF7-42DA-A138-31D8EB881D0F"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda400\"", "article_summary": "Payment-card network MasterCard Inc. on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its third quarter, though an increase in rebates and incentives dented revenue growth.\nRevenue grew 1.6% to $2.53 billion, or 8% excluding currency impacts.\nAnalysts had projected 87 cents a share in profit and $2.54 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\nIn the latest quarter, purchase volume grew 12%, on a constant-currency basis, to $852 billion.\nProcessed transactions grew 12% to 12.3 billion, while cross-border volumes grew 16%."}
