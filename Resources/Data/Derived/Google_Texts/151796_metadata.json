Joe has worked extensively in several areas of disability policy and practice. He is now a Senior Health Policy Analyst at Health & Disability Advocates (HDA) here in Chicago. His Huffington Post essay \u201cDebunking the Disability Trap\u201d is a valuable look, from the inside, at the opportunities and the employment barriers that people really face when they rely on federal disability programs. We\u2019re accustomed these days to hearing about Medicaid\u2019s many shortcomings and the perverse incentives associated with public disability benefits. Entwisle\u2019s story provides a valuable reminder that such programs support a worthy path to independence and well-being for millions of people.\n\nJoe and his dad Charles Entwisle met me last Friday to discuss what he regards as widespread misperceptions about the lives and capabilities of people who live with significant disabilities or functional impairments. We met on the street in the Loop and wandered into the Harold Washington Library to find some quiet space to talk. Joe deftly maneuvered the tight spaces in his high-tech wheelchair, which he operates through a combination of sips and puffs into an air-tube. Using a special stylus he holds in his mouth, he operates his Android phone with similar dexterity on various forms of social media.\n\nNow 41, Entwisle was rendered quadriplegic at the age of 16 in a wrestling accident. He brings a distinctive, occasionally ribald perspective on the value of Medicaid, the complex gaps in disability policy and the comic possibilities of the tiny aisle wheelchairs used for commercial air travel. Below is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nHarold Pollack: Let\u2019s start with some basic details. As the picture makes clear, you\u2019re in a sip-and-puff wheelchair.\n\n\n\nJoe Entwisle: It all runs on sip-and-puff. It\u2019s pretty basic technology. Hard puff goes forward. Soft puff goes right. Soft sip goes left. Hard sip goes backwards. ... It\u2019s a pretty wonderful technology. It gets me ready to go.\n\nHP: We parked on a winter day in Chicago around the corner and maneuvered through the semi-cleared sidewalks, etc. I take it you\u2019re very agile with that.\n\nJE: Oh yeah. I can get anywhere, in the woods, across grass and wherever I need to go. It really is good technology.\n\nHP: It\u2019s also $45,000. How do you pay for things like that?\n\n\n\nJE: Fortunately, I\u2019ve got insurance through my employer, which is really good. I have a secondary insurance which actually comes from my dad\u2019s policy. He was a federal employee at the time I had my injury. Within the federal coverage, if you\u2019re injured as a minor that coverage stays with you \u2026\n\nAnd then I have Medicaid as a wrap-around. It helps cover the long-term care cost which would otherwise be pretty much devastating.\n\nHP: Do you need Medicaid now to cover some things that aren\u2019t covered in your other insurance?\n\n\n\nJE: Particularly on the long-term care side, for attendant care. Medicaid is huge. It\u2019s a payer of last resort. Medicaid really is the only payer of any resort when it comes to long-term care.\n\nHP: Do you have attendant care that would help you with things right now?\n\nJE: Yeah. I\u2019ve got somebody who comes up 4 in the morning. Then if I\u2019m at home, I do a lunch round at one o\u2019 clock. Then I have somebody who comes to put me to bed at around 10 o\u2019 clock at night \u2026\n\nHP: You telecommute a lot. But you also come down on the train from southern Milwaukee to the Chicago Loop, cruise the mile to work, and put in a regular work-day quite often.\n\n\n\nJE: Yeah. I get dropped off at the train station, which is what I normally do. Today's an exception with subfreezing temperatures, which is why I drove down. Usually catch the train at the airport to downtown. In Chicago, it\u2019s roughly a mile to the office. I just walk the rest of the way down. It\u2019s really pretty short. It seems like a quick commute. Especially with the technology these days, I can work all the way down on the train. An hour and 20 minutes is pretty efficient to get from Milwaukee airport to downtown Chicago.\n\nHP: Just to put out on the table some things people will be curious about, tell me about your injury.\n\n\n\nJE: I had an injury at wrestling practice -- which was fortunate because if it was during a match it would screw up your record. It\u2019s one of those injuries where crazy things happen. I had a football coach who begged me not to wrestle over the prospect of football scholarships. That was the plan to go to college. I\u2019d wrestled since I was 5, and it\u2019s a sport I love. It made me a much better football player. Athletics were my passion.\n\nHP: You\u2019re a very solid-looking guy. I can see you as a football player.\n\n\n\nJE: I feel rather doughy at this point.\n\nHP: We all do.\n\n\n\nJE: I was on a vent for about nine months. For some reason, I was able to get my lungs back, which wasn\u2019t expected. I\u2019m a C 4-5 quadriplegic as result of spinal cord injury. I graduated with my high school class, went to college, grad school. At some point, you make a decision about what you want to do with your life. For me, the injury wasn\u2019t going to change my goals. It\u2019s up to you on choosing what you do.\n\nHP: That injury was 25 years ago. Charles, that must have changed your life quite a bit as well.\n\n\n\nCharles Entwisle [Joe\u2019s father]: Yeah. It was definitely a shock. We were almost inundated. The city of Glendale where we lived was good to us. They held all kinds of fundraisers for Joe. They got him his first van with the lift and everything so he can get around. He ended up in summer school that year and catching up what he lost. He went back and ended up graduating with his class and went on with his bachelor\u2019s at Whitewater and went to Madison for a masters in rehab psych.\n\nHP: Joe, maybe we\u2019d start with your current job. What do you do for a living?\n\n\n\nJE: I\u2019m a senior policy analyst for Health & Disability Advocates here in Chicago. I\u2019m really proud to work for an organization that does so many incredible things. Most of my own focus has been around health-care policy and employment policy, particularly as it relates to employment and individuals with disabilities. We\u2019ve done a lot of work with states in designing Medicaid Buy-in programs.\n\nHP: Many readers won't know what a Medicaid Buy-in program is. Can you explain that?\n\n\n\nJE: Two pieces of legislation -- the Balanced Budget Act and the Ticket to Work -- authorize states to build these Medicaid Buy-in programs. Medicaid buy-in programs allow people with disabilities to buy into Medicaid as if it were a regular insurance program. Basically states started to understand that the (Medicaid) programs that provide access to long-term care all required individuals to have to meet two qualifications: (1) to be medically needy, but also (2) financially needy. It\u2019s that \u201cfinancially needy\u201d piece that has continually kept people impoverished. It\u2019s required poverty in order to stay alive. To get access to services, you\u2019ve got to be really dirt poor.\n\nThe feds and states now realize that there are advances in technology, advances in medicine, and that with those advances you can have a significant medical condition, a significant disability, without diminishing your capacity for full-time competitive employment. If you look at what it costs to keep people on programs and to keep them impoverished, states have been literally financially cutting off their noses to spite their face, as a way to keep people out of programs. When you require access to long-term care, Medicaid is often your only option.\n\nHad the Affordable Care Act have been around before my injury, I would have faced a different situation. My insurance at that time provided access to some of the long-term care pieces, at least to the attendant care. But this pretty quickly evaporated because I exhausted the lifetime expenditure cap on these attendant services. At that point, my only access to care was through Medicaid. For many people, in order to survive, that\u2019s the option.\n\nI should also explain some other things. Social Security operates two separate programs for individuals living with disabilities: SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) and SSI (Supplemental Security Income).\n\nThese are two different programs each with their own rules. SSDI eligibility is linked with your work history. SSI eligibility comes by nature of being medically and financially needy. SSDI offers a more generous cash benefit. However, the SSI side, which is a base safety net program, has better work incentives. It also comes connected to a much better insurance program (Medicaid) than the SSDI program does (Medicare). It is somewhat odd that you have better work incentives and health care with SSI, despite a number of ways those benefits come attached with pitfalls. Regardless, SSI has always made full-time work an option for me ever since I graduated from school.\n\nHP: So you are currently an SSI recipient? That\u2019s what pays for your attendant care and related services?\n\n\n\nJE: Yes, of course you have to monitor your resources and your income. You\u2019re always better off working if you are on SSI. There\u2019s almost no scenario where you\u2019re not better off working on SSI. Under the \u201ctwo for one\u201d formula, for every $2 you earn, they reduce your cash benefit by $1. Since SSI cash benefits are limited, you gradually wean your way off the cash component of the program. In my work history, I exceeded twice the SSI benefit a long time ago. So I receive help with my health care, but no cash benefit.\n\nEvery state has federal administrative arrangements called 1619(a) and 1619(b) programs within SSI. 1619(a) means you weaned your way off a part of the cash benefit but you still retain some cash benefit. With 1619(b) you\u2019ve eliminated the cash benefit, but you retain your connectivity to health care. Now, every state has a cap. The average is usually around $30,000. There\u2019s a formula I can go into that\u2019s really boring. The main point is that these allow you to work and to maintain your connectivity with Medicaid benefits, even if you might have reduced or zero cash benefits as your earnings rise over time. Social Security has put many of the basics into the Red Book, which gives you an overview of work incentives. (More specific information on SSI work incentives can be found here.)\n\nYou can also ask for what\u2019s called the individual threshold. Basically, what Social Security has done is pretty smart. They\u2019ve said if you have medical costs that are so exorbitant that your income is too low to cover these costs, then you can actually ask for a higher income threshold than what the traditional state limit would allow.\n\nIn my situation, the nature of my disability imposes costly demands on long-term care. At that point, you can earn a pretty significant amount of income without losing SSI supports, i.e. Medicaid. I have been fortunate in the work I have been able to pursue while maintaining my connectivity to the health services I need.\n\nFor a lot of folks who work competitively, it\u2019s really about the access to long-term care. This is where Medicaid Buy-ins come in. These programs allow you to buy into Medicaid much as you would a traditional health insurance program. You\u2019re buy into Medicaid and paying premiums, which allows you to have higher income and asset caps than other Medicaid programs. Forty-three states have buy-in programs and each state makes determinations on income and asset eligibility.\n\nHP: Now you are subject to stringent asset limits on your savings and your wealth.\n\n\n\nJE: Correct. Excluding my house and my car, I must suppress my liquid assets to remain below a $2,000 cap.\n\nHP: That asset limit seems pointless and gratuitously harmful in your situation. One either finds various strategies to work around the requirement, or it prevents people from planning their futures. You can\u2019t prepare for your retirement. If you have children, you can\u2019t properly save for their college, all that kind of stuff.\n\n\n\nJE: The reality for someone in my situation is that retirement usually isn\u2019t an option. You work until you die, literally. A friend of mine is a perfect example. It\u2019s almost creepy the similarities in our life. Both of us had a spinal cord injury at 16. Both of us were injured wrestling. Both of us are policy analysts. He\u2019s a really good guy. He\u2019s 63 years old. He started working for the state many years ago. Yet because of the odd rules around Medicaid eligibility and the differential treatment of earned and unearned income, he literally cannot retire. He knows he has to work until he\u2019s dead or until some rules change. As soon as he starts to draw unearned income (retirement), he\u2019s not going to be eligible for health-care programs or he\u2019ll have to spend down to essentially $710 a month. He could no longer afford his house. He could no longer afford even the taxes on the house.\n\nHP: These asset limits seem especially perverse when low-income adults who get coverage today because of the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion don't face the same limits. That seems very hard to justify.\n\n\n\nJE: It does. ... In one way I understand where these requirements come from. People who have the means to pay for long-term care should do so. Yet the reality is that very few people could ever afford to do it. Fortunately there are many ways to think about how we balance out the system. It\u2019s exciting to see incentive options within the Affordable Care Act that might revamp long-term care.\n\nFor example, the Balancing Incentives Program provides an alternative to traditional long-term care service delivery methodology. Our state eligibility assessments have always been about: How does this person fit into a nursing-home level of care. They\u2019ve always been targeted to nursing home placement. Yet the reality is: (1) nursing home services are very costly and (2) the outcomes and satisfaction for people are often horrific.\n\nHP: How does ACA actually change these arrangements?\n\n\n\nJE: It gives states a number of options (see this wonky overview) to rebalance choice between community care and nursing home care and to change the way they deliver services. States that can shift in the direction of greater community care and can receive slightly higher federal Medicaid matching rates, which is a powerful incentive.\n\nStates also have options to change the way they assess eligibility. Wisconsin is a great state to look at as far as how they have designed their assessments. These have traditionally been done by nurses. It\u2019s a really long and laborious, expensive process.\n\nThere are more flexible ways to do that. Wisconsin has coordinators who provide assessments in the community based on a functional screen: people\u2019s ability to perform various activities of daily living (ADL and IADLs, in the language of such things). Not only do these assessments look specifically at the strict healthcare medical needs, these also explore what\u2019s actually required to meet your needs in daily life. It also seeks to infuse employment issues into everything that you do. These sorts of improvements allow you to redirect services towards more flexible options, and to really target community options first. On top of that, it infuses employment at each step of the way, which is the largest cost-saving component states can implement over the long-term.\n\nHP: What does that mean when you say \u201ccommunity first\u201d practically?\n\n\n\nJE: For eons, long-term care services and entitlements have been targeting nursing homes, moving people towards the nursing homes to that level of care. If you need some significant assistance, then you should be in a nursing home. ... At this point, really it\u2019s so much cheaper to keep people in their own homes, living on their own. The health outcomes are better, and individual life satisfaction is incomparably better. Particularly with advances in technology and medicine, people can live the same life that they had before, just with different ways of getting around.\n\nHP: ACA also included the CLASS Act -- Community Living Assistance Support Services. Many people in the disability community were excited by CLASS. Unfortunately, the CLASS Act imploded and was repealed.\n\n\n\nJE: This was an immense disappointment. CLASS was finally an option where you could look at freeing yourself from being tied to so many of the strings that come with Medicaid. The honest reality is that Medicaid isn\u2019t just health insurance. For many folks, it\u2019s really a health-care loan. In many states, there is estate recovery that comes attached to Medicaid, particularly in long-term care services. It\u2019s a piece that\u2019s being whittled down regarding health-care reform, but it\u2019s there.\n\nHP: So you can stay in your home while you are receiving services. But after you die, the value of your home is often legally available to repay Medicaid for the services that you required \u2026\n\n\n\nJE: Correct.\n\nHP: One of the tensions in CLASS was that the disability community was very excited about it, but nobody else was.\n\n\n\nJE: Right. Most people don\u2019t know what they have to lose. Everyone is temporarily able-bodied. ... People don\u2019t realize that, especially when they\u2019re young. When I was 16, it would have never occurred to me that that disability would ever be a part of my future. You don\u2019t realize quite how fragile life is.\n\nYou never think that things like that are going to happen, but they happen all the time. \u2026 As we age, these are natural aspects of living. If CLASS could free people from insecurity, and from the indignities of Medicaid asset tests, that would just be an unbelievable gift. Yet people take all of that for granted.\n\nHP: How do you spend your workday?\n\n\n\nJE: One of the things I really love about my job is it never seems to be the same day twice. We work with partners and states on many different issues. Some of it\u2019s working on seamless supports to make sure that there\u2019s no wrong door when folks present for services, that employment is the primary driver across services when people come in to receive benefits, etc. I like to think we take a policy approach of working smarter and not harder based on policy options available ...\n\nFor a long time, we\u2019ve had a pretty strong legal team. We were one of the last organizations that actually pick up law suits against the state itself. \u2026 We have had a great deal of experience and found a lot of success in bringing everyone together: Not just individuals who receive services, but also other stakeholders, people who deliver services, decision-makers at the state level and others. We put these disparate groups together in a room to figure out where the pitfalls, where the essential issues lie, and a couple of special things blossom from that.\n\nYou get the big picture as well as the specifics of all the issues, where things are right, not just from one individual, from everyone in the room. It becomes a greater understanding and sometimes a bit of a unifier, too. A colleague once told me: \u201cEverything that happens gets done based on relationships.\u201d I think he\u2019s right in a lot of ways. The ability to bring everyone together in a room, figure out what the issues and the gaps are, do some cluster mapping around on what the gaps are, and establish policy to fill those pieces. It\u2019s part of that old feedback methodology of policy analysis: You analyze, build, implement, assess, repeat. You keep going through that circle until you get it right.\n\nHP: We haven\u2019t talked much about the Americans with Disabilities Act. How does that make itself felt in your life?\n\n\n\nJE: One huge benefit of the ADA has been to expose the American public to the pertinent issues. The biggest particular piece for me has been nondiscriminatory access to transportation, to hotels, the curb cuts and so on. These provisions aren\u2019t perfect or ironed out well. They\u2019re still huge in people\u2019s lives \u2026\n\nFor me, when it comes to access to jobs, I find the ADA somewhat interesting because it makes some employers nervous about lawsuits.\n\nI worked with some states that have done polling with affected businesses to say what kind of accommodations they are making for folks. The results are surprising, because many go far beyond what\u2019s actually required in the ADA. And really, as an individual with a disability, I see my disability as a value-added credential. I found a way to work around any barriers in everything I do. I think it makes me a better employee. I work really hard to do what I do because I want to be better each and every day, which actually has little to do with disability.\n\nNow, there\u2019s another piece that\u2019s part of the mix where I\u2019ve seen \u2026 where paternalism has really taken hold, and has diminished people\u2019s skills because they don\u2019t get good management saying: \u201cYou\u2019re putting out a terrible product.\u201d It\u2019s something that terrifies me every day. I worry that somehow, someone\u2019s not going to tell me, \u201cThis is not going to cut it\u201d to somehow protect my feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating. You have this fear that because you have a disability that someone would treat you differently regarding work expectations. Bill Russell put equality in the finest statement ever, especially when it comes to employment. He said, \u201cYou know you\u2019ve reached equality when you get fired for the same reasons as everyone else.\u201d He\u2019s so spot-on.\n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t be hired if they can\u2019t perform the essential function of the job. This is crystal clear in ADA, and it\u2019s true whether somebody has a disability or not. \u2026 Someone with a disability is usually used to being pretty flexible around many areas of life . Not everyone, of course. ... But there are a lot of obstacles that arise unexpectedly that you\u2019re used to working around which tends to make you actively think as a troubleshooter.\n\nWe talk about these issues in the \u201cbeyond the label\u201d campaign. We all have different aspects of our lives that get labelled, whether you\u2019re the loud guy who talks too much at parties or the person who dresses funny. It doesn\u2019t change the way you do your job, and that\u2019s true of disability itself as well.\n\nHP: Those ads are pretty funny. You tap into a comical dimension in many of your comments, including the logistics of traveling. You\u2019ve done a lot of traveling in your work.\n\n\n\nJE: Yeah, I\u2019ve been a little bit of everywhere.\n\nHP: How do you do that? If you want to go to Philadelphia for a day, how do you do that?\n\n\n\nJE: Philadelphia has the worst airport in the U.S., I swear to God, but please don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. Essentially, it\u2019s all about planning ahead. Some airlines are better than the others. Southwest has always been amazing. It just kills me that Midwest Express is gone.\n\nYou let the airline know that you\u2019re a disabled passenger. American is really good. It is one of the few airlines where if you go on the Web site and you check the box that says \u201cDisabled Passenger,\u201d someone will actually call you. I almost thought I was being punked the first time it happened. I heard: \u201cWe heard you\u2019re a disabled passenger. What can we do to help?\u201d I'm like, \u201cWho is this, really?\u201d\n\nSure enough, they were all about making sure things were prepared for your flight. Basically it's making sure the airlines understand your needs (transfer assistance, lifting help, aisle chair, etc.) to make sure that help is available when you arrive. Not only does it make your flight and transfer easier, it expedites loading, which is a win-win for everyone.\n\nWhen I travel, they transfer me onto an aisle chair, which I always joke and say that it\u2019s the thong version of a real wheelchair. They are seriously tiny chairs, as in thin enough to glide easily down an airplane aisle. The first time I saw one, I thought, \u201cI'm 6\u20194\u201d and I go about 240. Where do I put my other butt cheek?\u201d\n\nI also have a hard time getting my shoulders through the aisles. Chairs aren\u2019t made to carry broad shoulders. But that\u2019s where you end up going. They strap you in, Hannibal Lecter style. They put cross straps across your arms, across your legs, and then they transfer you onto the plane itself. Once on board, they stow your wheelchair down with the cargo and you\u2019re off.\n\nIt takes some extra planning. You may have to find a rental car that's accessible, especially if you have a problem getting access to public transportation. Finding accessible cabs is another interesting process, particularly when you are quite tall. It requires a lot of extra planning, but it\u2019s all quite worth it.\n\nMany people say, \u201cWow, it\u2019s a big pain in the ass to fly anywhere.\u201d It still beats the hell out of driving there. The drive to Hawaii is a nightmare. I've probably got the right body content to float there, but I\u2019ll take the plane.\n\nHP: That\u2019s probably a good place to end it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joe Entwisle was rendered quadriplegic at the age of sixteen in a wrestling accident.
