The finding comes with a few grains of salt \u2014 the \u201cdefinitely voting\u201d crowd comprises only a quarter of the total respondents, which would prefer a Democratic Congress by a 50 to 43 percent margin \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly an indication that those who are most motivated to cast a ballot are ready for something other than the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nAnd as Harvard IOP Director Maggie Williams put it, it\u2019s evidence that millennials are \u201cpolitically up-for-grabs.\u201d\n\nThe poll builds on previous numbers that found President Obama falling out of favor with the under-30 demographic. At least 59 percent of those surveyed disapproved of the president\u2019s handling of the economy, health care, the budget deficit, foreign policy, and immigration. And his administration\u2019s domestic centerpiece, the Affordable Care Act, has only a 39-percent approval rating. 57 percent disapprove.\n\n\u201cThe Obama-Reid agenda has hurt millennials by reducing our opportunity to achieve our American Dream. This poll confirms what our modeling has been showing all along: that Millennials are sick and tired of the false promises from Democrats,\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams said. \u201cMy generation is poised to vote against the status quo and for a better future by voting for Republicans.\u201d\n\nWhile the GOP\u2019s near-term prospects among the millennial vote is looking up, the party still faces longer-term work to build its brand \u2014 as do Democrats. Congressional Republicans and Democrats both face disapproval ratings of at least 60 percent, and young adults continue to be disenchanted with the political system. A majority blames the all-encompassing term \u201call of them\u201d in Washington, D.C. for current political gridlock. 53 percent say they would \u201crecall and replace\u201d all of Congress. And only 1 in 10 say that their member of Congress represents his or her constituents above all other interests.\n\n\u201cBoth parties should re-introduce themselves to young voters, empower them and seek their participation in the upcoming 2016 campaign and beyond,\u201d Harvard IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe said.\n\nFor more on the poll and its methodology, check it out here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A poll released Wednesday found that the nation's youth still supports change.
