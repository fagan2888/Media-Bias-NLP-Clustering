Some weren\u2019t even born yet.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t dampen their enthusiasm for meeting the man who now is better known for his post-presidency humanitarian work than his White House years.\n\n\u201cThis was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to come and see him in person,\u201d said Dr. Tarik Walker, 45, who works at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. \u201cHe\u2019s been a tremendous role model for me.\u201d\n\nCarter visited the Tattered Cover Book Store on East Colfax Avenue to promote his new book, \u201cA Full Life: Reflections at 90,\u201d a memoir looking back on a career of public and private service. After losing his bid for re-election, Carter dedicated his life to fighting for human rights and the eradication of diseases in the Third World. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the few ex-presidents that doesn\u2019t just go out and play golf,\u201d said Lisa Wulf, of Colorado Springs, who came to the event with her husband. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our heroes.\u201d\n\nThe Wulfs voted for Carter in both presidential elections.\n\nCarter remained true to his reputation as a peacemaker, speaking briefly with reporters about President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed deal to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Carter severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 1980 after a violent takeover of the American embassy in 1979.\n\nCarter praised the nuclear deal and said the time has come to reopen an embassy in Iran. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us have full relations with the Iranian people,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch calls for peace have been controversial to some, but not to the waves of supporters Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a very moral individual \u2026 not just in his presidency, but in his post-presidency,\u201d said Brian Liberatore, 35. \u201cHe set the bar for the post-presidency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former President Jimmy Carter draws a big crowd at Denver book store", "title": "Former President Jimmy Carter draws a big crowd at Denver book store", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/26/former-president-jimmy-carter-draws-a-big-crowd-at-denver-book-store/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726__jimmy-carterp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726__jimmy-carterp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T18:02:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:53:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After losing his bid for re-election, Carter dedicated his life to fighting for human rights and the eradication of diseases in the Third World.\nMost of the 700 people who went to see former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday weren\u2019t old enough to vote when he lost his re-election bid in 1980.\nCarter severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 1980 after a violent takeover of the American embassy in 1979.\nCarter praised the nuclear deal and said the time has come to reopen an embassy in Iran.\nCarter remained true to his reputation as a peacemaker, speaking briefly with reporters about President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed deal to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons."}
