He ended his story with the phrase \u201cit\u2019s just the way things are.\u201d\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be. And that wasn\u2019t my experience growing up.\n\nBoth of my parents are of European descent, born and raised in the Bible Belt of north Louisiana. Up until I was 9, we lived in Baton Rouge. Although I was too young to really understand what it meant, Baton Rouge \u2014 like many Southern cities in the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 was racially divided, with separate restrooms and drinking fountains for white and \u201ccolored\u201d (our polite term for \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d back then).\n\nHowever, during my early years, as my father was finishing his degree at LSU while my mother was working full time as a teacher, they hired a \u201ccolored\u201d woman to come to our home and care for my eldest younger sister and me.\n\n\u201cOllie Mae\u201d or \u201cMae,\u201d as we called her, was a wonderful woman who doted on us like we were her own, cooked the family meals, took us to her church choir practice, and made sure we knew we were always protected and loved. She always seemed joyful in her work, and we all felt \u2014 my parents included \u2014 that she was family.\n\nMy paternal grandparents ran a general store in the small town of Cotton Valley, La. During the \u201950s and \u201960s, Cotton Valley\u2019s population was two-thirds \u201ccolored.\u201d My siblings and I all retain fond memories of that little town, where my grandparents\u2019 store was the center of activity.\n\nThe majority of their customers were \u201ccolored,\u201d as were two of their most trusted employees, brothers Pat and Snyder. When our family would make our summer visits to Cotton Valley, we older siblings always wanted to participate in the family business by working in the store. Our grandparents made sure we knew Pat and Snyder were our supervisors. They taught us how to stock shelves, bag groceries and weigh produce, and generally kept us out of mischief. To us, they were family.\n\nWhile our grandparents worked long hours at the store, a \u201ccolored\u201d woman, \u201cGussie Mae,\u201d took care of their housework and made their meals. She also watched over my younger siblings during our visits to Cotton Valley. We all loved Gussie Mae. She was family.\n\nTo most of his customers, our grandfather was \u201cMr. Ralph.\u201d In my memory, he seems to have been colorblind and \u2014 now, looking back \u2014 maybe not much of a businessman. Any regular customer coming up to the checkout counter could request to \u201ccharge\u201d a purchase; a ticket would be written up by the cashier and filed. I can remember a few times witnessing a regular coming in and pleading hard times. My grandfather would take the charge tickets, tear them up, and tell that person not to worry, things would get better. All of his customers were family.\n\nWhen he passed in 1968, my grandfather had long been an active member in the small, all-white Methodist Church. When mourners of color began entering the church and taking seats near the front pews, the pastor became alarmed and made mention of it to my father. My dad\u2019s response was that if people couldn\u2019t sit wherever they felt comfortable, he would have the service held out on the lawn. My dad felt the people of Cotton Valley mourning his father\u2019s death \u2014 no matter their color \u2014 were family.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, I drove my young family from the Twin Cities to visit my grandmother in Cotton Valley and to see what was left of the store they had heard so much about. My grandmother insisted we stop by to call on Gussie Mae. When we did, we were greeted at the door like prodigals. Gussie rushed to her phone to call Snyder, the surviving brother of my grandparent\u2019s two loyal employees.\n\nOne of my prized possessions is a picture of all of us during that visit. It\u2019s a picture of a family.\n\nA little over four years ago, my eldest daughter and her husband chose to start their family by adopting. They originally were thinking of adopting two siblings, but when a trio of Ethiopian children from the same family became available, they fell in love with them at first sight. In January 2010, I met three young grandchildren, 3, 6, and 9, at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport. And, like my daughter and son-in-law, I instantly fell in love. Of course, their skin is darker than mine \u2014 darker than that of their parents, or of their cousins, to whom they have become so close. But they are my family.\n\nThe situation in Ferguson is a sad echo of a past many Americans experienced. But not all of us. Not my family. And it doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cjust the way things are.\u201d If you believe as I do that most of the world\u2019s problems are rooted in ignorance and intolerance of others, it\u2019s up to you to take the steps toward understanding and acceptance. It\u2019s what we do when we are family.\n\nMichael Riddle is a musician and songwriter living in Coon Rapids.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My youth in Louisiana differed from another recent writer's in Ferguson, Mo.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "My youth in Louisiana differed from another recent writer's in Ferguson, Mo.", "title": "Counterpoint: Racism isn't always the way it is, or was", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-racism-isn-t-always-the-way-it-is-or-was/272227461/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140866215464717.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140866215464717.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "My youth in Louisiana differed from another recent writer's in Ferguson, Mo.", "title": "Counterpoint: Racism isn't always the way it is, or was", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-racism-isn-t-always-the-way-it-is-or-was/272227461/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140866215464717.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140866215464717.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "La."}, "news_keywords": "Ferguson, Mo.,Louisiana,Baton Rouge,Cotton Valley, La."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32f8\"", "article_summary": "My dad felt the people of Cotton Valley mourning his father\u2019s death \u2014 no matter their color \u2014 were family.\nMy grandmother insisted we stop by to call on Gussie Mae.\nWe all loved Gussie Mae.\nMy paternal grandparents ran a general store in the small town of Cotton Valley, La.\nWhile our grandparents worked long hours at the store, a \u201ccolored\u201d woman, \u201cGussie Mae,\u201d took care of their housework and made their meals."}
