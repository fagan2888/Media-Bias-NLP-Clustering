REUTERS/Jason Reed\n\n4037469\n\nMassachusetts and Vermont officials will withhold payments from the contractor behind the states\u2019 malfunctioning Obamacare exchanges, the Boston Globe reported Thursday.\n\nCGI Group is the main contractor in charge of both Massachusetts\u2019 and Vermont\u2019s state exchanges, as well as the federal site HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cCGI has consistently underperformed, which is frustrating and a serious concern,\u201d said Jason Lefferts, a spokesman for the Massachusetts exchange. \u201cWe are holding the vendor accountable for its underperformance and will continue to apply nonstop pressure to work to fix defects and improve performance.\n\nMassachusetts officials have paid $11 million of its $69 million contract with CGI but will not dole out any more dough until the website is functioning properly, according to Lefferts.\n\nVermont has already paid $18.6 million of its $82.6 million bill to CGI, but is still in talks to decide what the bottom line will be. Exchange officials are currently withholding a $5.1 million payment in return for CGI missing important deadlines and are disputing over $1 million in charges due to \u201cincomplete work.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts officials already worked with a similar health care system to Obamacare, but were stymied when trying to comply with Obamacare\u2019s updates. The new exchange website has been unable to determine eligibility for different insurance plans and struggled to set up accounts and passwords.\n\nFor Vermonters it was even worse: customers were not able to purchase coverage online until early December, a paltry record only beat by the country\u2019s worst Obamacare marketplace.\n\nBut while Vermont and Massachusetts are blasting now-infamous CGI, they\u2019re not the first state to withhold payments. Oregon\u2019s utterly failed exchange has withheld $20 million from contractor Oracle and already has attorneys reviewing the bungled launch.\n\nEven after the deadline to buy insurance for January 1 coverage, Oregon\u2019s state exchange still cannot support online purchases. Cover Oregon officials shifted to paper applications as they abandoned hope that the site would be functioning before the deadline to buy insurance for January 1.\n\nOracle, a massively successful IT company run by billionaire Larry Ellison, has received $43 million so far, but Cover Oregon\u2019s then-director Rocky King announced in late November that the exchange had refused to make any payments in the past two months and interim director Bruce Goldberg said in December that the exchange is withholding payment.\n\nWhile contractors told officials the site was 80 percent finished, just 10 percent was finished correctly \u2014 and the entire site wasn\u2019t tested until the fall.\n\nBut it appears that while Oracle is taking some hits. Amid Cover Oregon\u2019s fiasco, King took \u201cmedical leave\u201d and the Carolyn Lawson, chief information officer at Oregon\u2019s health department and the primary official overseeing the exchange roll-out, resigned for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle failed to deliver its product as promised, King admitted before taking leave that exchange officials were aware the site would be delayed due to significant problems, all while presenting a rosy picture to the public.\n\nIn addition to the Vermont and Massachusetts exchanges, CGI also built federal exchange HealthCare.gov, and five other state exchanges: Kentucky, Colorado, California, Hawaii and New Mexico.\n\nKentucky has been held up as a model of Obamacare\u2019s success, enrolling over 24,000 in private plans without any big hitches, while California has been portrayed as a success as well. Colorado\u2019s CGI-built exchange didn\u2019t experience drastic tech failures either, but even with a well-functioning site has struggled to sign up enough consumers even to meet officials\u2019 \u201ccatastrophic\u201d projections.\n\nBut Hawaii\u2019s exchange launched several weeks late and may not be financially sustainable after enrolling just 683 customers. New Mexico\u2019s small business exchange (the individual exchange was put in the care of HealthCare.gov until October 2014) didn\u2019t fully launch until December.\n\nWhile some states are happy with CGI\u2019s performance, Vermont and Massachusetts officials have started talking about legal action against the company. Massachusetts\u2019 exchange director Jean Yang blamed CGI for not committing enough resources to building the website, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
