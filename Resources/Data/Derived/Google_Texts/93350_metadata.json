General Assembly \u2014 a speech that pundits described as \u201cWilsonian\u201d and \u201cthe most liberal foreign policy address\u201d of his career \u2014 President Obama acknowledged that despite its claim of global leadership, the United States sometimes falls short of living up to its self-professed values. \u201cI realize that America\u2019s critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri,\u201d Obama continued, \u201cwhere a young man was killed, and a community was divided.\u201d\n\nThis was the geopolitical equivalent of a boss trying to prove to her employees she\u2019s relatable by noting that even she sometimes makes mistakes. And if they noticed this moment at all, most people likely saw it for what it was: a harmless act of genuflection, delivered by a U.S. president in service of his ultimate goal, rallying global opinion behind another American war in the Middle East. In other words, nothing to see here, folks; keep it movin\u2019.\n\nBut as we now know all too well, neoconservatives are not like most people; their response to Obama\u2019s Ferguson remark was nothing short of apoplectic.\n\n\u201cI was stunned,\u201d neocon hero and former Vice President Dick Cheney said of the Ferguson reference during an appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show later that night. The president\u2019s rhetorical pairing of the turmoil in Ukraine and the Levant with that in Ferguson, Cheney said, was simply unacceptable. \u201cIn one case, you\u2019ve got a police officer involved in a shooting, there may be questions about it to be sorted out by the legal process, but there\u2019s no comparison to that with what ISIS is doing to thousands of people throughout the Middle East,\u201d Cheney said, before huffing: \u201cTo compare the two as though there\u2019s moral equivalence there, I think, is outrageous.\u201d\n\nWashington Post columnist and fellow neoconservative Charles Krauthammer hit a similar note in his response (also delivered on Fox News, naturally) by dusting off a circa 2009 anti-Obama talking point and describing the speech as \u201ca continuation of the apology tour.\u201d Echoing Cheney, Krauthammer declared Obama \u201cintended [to draw] a moral equivalence\u201d between ISIS and America. He then snarked about the silver lining of having Obama \u201ctalking about our sins\u201d at the U.N. in New York City, rather than doing so while on foreign soil. (Like, say, Montreal, where Krauthammer spent his childhood.)\n\nLast \u2014 and considering this is the man who helped organize the smear campaign against Bowe Bergdahl \u2014 very much least, there was Richard Grenell, former top aide to every neoconservative\u2019s fantasy presidential candidate, ex-U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Writing at, yes, Fox News\u2019 website, Grenell argued the president\u2019s mentioning Ferguson was \u201ca big mistake.\u201d Grenell conceded that \u201chumility and self-reflection are admirable leadership qualities\u201d but nevertheless warned how Obama\u2019s speech \u201cgives foreign diplomats from Arab countries and Russia the excuse they need to dismiss America\u2019s condemnation of their actions.\u201d Because they were otherwise so primed for genuine cooperation\u2026\n\nTo state the obvious, it is not surprising to find neoconservatives blasting the president, even if he\u2019s currently launching a war against ISIS that, in significant respects, justifies itself intellectually through neoconservative-friendly arguments. Dedicated neoconservatives tend to be rigid partisans when it comes to politics, uninterested in compromise and focused primarily on controlling U.S. military power. What\u2019s striking about the neocon attack isn\u2019t its churlishness, therefore, but rather its transparency. Think of the characteristic emotional tics of neoconservatism \u2014 its paranoia, its insecurity, its obsessive fear of looking weak \u2014 and look back again at the words of the president\u2019s neocon critics. They\u2019re all there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president's noting the turmoil in Ferguson during a speech at the U.N. has got Cheney and friends livid", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The president's noting the turmoil in Ferguson during a speech at the U.N. has got Cheney and friends livid", "title": "Neocons\u2019 Ferguson freakout: Why their latest attack on Obama makes them look so silly", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/25/neocons_ferguson_freakout_why_their_latest_attack_on_obama_makes_them_look_so_silly/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/krauthammer_cheney_grenell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president's noting the turmoil in Ferguson during a speech at the U.N. has got Cheney and friends livid", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/krauthammer_cheney_grenell.jpg", "title": "Neocons\u2019 Ferguson freakout: Why their latest attack on Obama makes them look so silly", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Neocons\u2019 Ferguson freakout: Why their latest attack on Obama makes them look so silly", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bowe Bergdahl, Charles Krauthammer, Dick Cheney, ISIL, isis, Islamic State, michael brown, neocons, Neoconservatism, neoconservatives, Richard Grenell, United Nations", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6df\"", "article_summary": "The president\u2019s rhetorical pairing of the turmoil in Ukraine and the Levant with that in Ferguson, Cheney said, was simply unacceptable.\n\u201cI realize that America\u2019s critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals,\u201d Obama said.\n\u201cI was stunned,\u201d neocon hero and former Vice President Dick Cheney said of the Ferguson reference during an appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show later that night.\nBut as we now know all too well, neoconservatives are not like most people; their response to Obama\u2019s Ferguson remark was nothing short of apoplectic.\nDedicated neoconservatives tend to be rigid partisans when it comes to politics, uninterested in compromise and focused primarily on controlling U.S. military power."}
