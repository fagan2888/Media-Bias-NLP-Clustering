Syracuse, N.Y. -- Upstate University Hospital made a $17 million profit in 2014, the second year in a row it finished in the black.

Upstate posted a $1 million profit in 2013, after losing about $35 million in 2011 and 2012.

Dr. John McCabe, president and CEO of the SUNY hospital, attributed the financial improvement to several factors, including efforts to make sure Upstate collects all the money it is owed and carefully manages the growth of its workforce.

"It's exciting to see this turnaround," he said.

Upstate had revenue of $854.4 million and expenses of $837.4 million last year.

At the end of 2014, the hospital had 4,914 full-time employees, an increase of 256 from the previous year.

The hospital received $22 million in state support in 2014, $1 million more than it got in 2013. Since 2009, the state has cut funding to the hospital by nearly 50 percent.

The hospital admitted 28,753 inpatients in 2014, 90 fewer than 2013. Hospital admissions have declined nationwide because many services that used to require a hospital stay can be done on an outpatient basis, McCabe said.

Upstate's emergency room was busier than ever last year. The ER cared for 96,411 patients in 2014, up from 90,268 in 2013. Upstate has seen a 28 percent increase in ER visits since 2011.

McCabe said part of the increase has occurred because more people have health insurance now under Obamacare. "Some of it is also because we have a generation of people who want their care now instead of waiting to see their doctor tomorrow.
