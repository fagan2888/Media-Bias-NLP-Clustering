They can be fiscally conservative and socially liberal, or the other way around, but they are turned off by partisan rhetoric and ideological extremes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel you can have an intelligent conversation about [politics] without it turning ugly,\u201d said Fuller, a 42-year-old communications consultant from Ashburn who is undecided about whom to support in the 10th District. Fuller used to be a Republican and thinks that extremism on both sides is driving women like her to become independents. \u201cThe older I get, the more moderate I get.\u201d\n\nBev Kronthal listens to Republican Barbara Comstock speak to veterans as she campaigns for election to Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District seat on September 27. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAll of that explains why women have emerged as the most crucial target group in the bitter and expensive race between Republican Barbara J. Comstock and Democrat John W. Foust, who are battling to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Frank R. Wolf. Consider these recent nuggets from the campaigns: \u201cBarbara Comstock wants to make abortion illegal.\u201d \u201cJohn Foust said being a working mother is not a real job.\u201d \u201cCosmopolitan Endorses John Foust for Congress.\u201d\n\nThe campaigns, in other words, are chasing after women with an unprecedented intensity this year. Both sides are working on the assumption that the candidate whose message resonates with more women is the candidate who will win on Nov. 4.\n\nRich with unaligned voters\n\nVirginia\u2019s 10th District is a bellwether in a vote-rich swing state. In addition to its wealth and education levels, the district is increasingly diverse: about 22 percent Asian and Hispanic. More than half of adults have bachelor\u2019s degrees; over 60 percent of women older than 16 work full time.\n\nThough the district tilts slightly Republican, it is full of voters like Fuller who switch parties from one race to the next. President Obama won the district in 2008 but lost it in 2012, even as the same voters helped send Democrat Timothy M. Kaine to the U.S. Senate. Republican Ken Cuccinelli II eked out a victory in the 10th over Terry McAuliffe in the 2013 gubernatorial race. Yet the Democratic candidate for attorney general won, too.\n\nIn the House, Wolf (R) has represented the district for 30 years, winning with large margins as he developed a reputation for looking after such local interests as highway construction, Metro funding and even combatting Lyme disease.\n\nWolf\u2019s retirement offers Democrats a rare chance to win a Republican seat in an otherwise challenging electoral year. It also provides both parties an opportunity to figure out how to adapt to the changing landscape of American politics \u2014 where exploding populations of immigrants and professionals have altered the electorate, and where disgust with Congress and distaste for extremism tend to frame the views of the voters who decide close races.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s narrow win statewide was driven in large part by women, who favored him by nine points in a race where Democrats highlighted Cuccinelli\u2019s social conservatism. But married women favored Cuccinelli by the same margin; unmarried women went for McAuliffe by a whopping 42-point gap. The 10th District, where 60 percent of residents older than 15 are married, will test whether Democrats can expand their appeal.\n\nDemocrat John Foust campaigns on September 27. Foust's wife, Dr. Marilyn Jerome, is at left. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nBoth candidates see a clear set of battle lines when it comes to the female vote.\n\nFoust has seized the opportunity to portray Comstock as an ideological warrior. He has hammered her for her position on abortion \u2014 notably, her vote as a state lawmaker in 2012 for a controversial bill that roiled the state and country and that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an invasive procedure known as a \u201ctransvaginal ultrasound.\u201d\n\nOne of Foust\u2019s sharpest weapons has been a dramatic TV ad featuring a well-dressed, middle-aged woman sitting in a darkened home.\n\n\u201cBarbara Comstock wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, just like the right-wing Republicans in Congress,\u201d the woman says in the ad. \u201cThey want to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 so does she. . . . Barbara Comstock even voted with right-wing Republicans to require women seeking an abortion to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds. That\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d\n\n(Comstock did support the ultrasound bill, but she does not support an abortion ban in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is in jeopardy.)\n\nAdditionally, NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia held a rally last month \u201cto highlight Comstock\u2019s history of voting against the women and families of Virginia.\u201d After a recent debate focused entirely on economic concerns, Foust used his closing statement to argue that a successful local economy \u201cinvites women into their community and doesn\u2019t tell their doctors how to practice medicine.\u201d\n\nComstock is playing down her social conservatism and trying to connect with voters on pragmatic issues, such as the economy and health care, that independent voters tend to respond to.\n\nShe has attacked Foust\u2019s support for the Affordable Care Act. She often mentions her support for tougher human trafficking penalties. Inspired by Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s feminist \u201cLean In\u201d campaign, she started a \u201cYoung Women\u2019s Leadership Program\u201d last year.\n\nAnd in an attempt to appear responsive to women\u2019s health needs, she has pushed for birth control to be made available over the counter. It\u2019s a policy that Republicans have rallied around this election cycle \u2014 and that Democrats have pounced on to argue that Republicans are ignoring the question of cost and fairness in health-care plans, some of which pay for erectile dysfunction drugs and vasectomies but not contraception.\n\nComstock has also tried to neutralize her opposition to abortion, an unpopular position among many independent women, by saying that she does not think her views on Roe v. Wade are relevant in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court handles these issues,\u201d she said in a recent radio interview. \u201cWhat we can do in Congress is circumscribed by what the Supreme Court says we can do.\u201d\n\nIdeological balancing act\n\nComstock is also exploiting an advantage that has nothing to do with policy \u2014 the fact that she\u2019s a woman herself. She speaks regularly of the juggle of being a mother with a career. And she pounced on a stumble by Foust at a public appearance last month, when he said of Comstock, a married mother of three who has worked as a congressional aide, opposition researcher, Justice Department spokeswoman, crisis management consultant and lobbyist: \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s even had a real job.\u201d\n\nFoust said later that he was not referring to Comstock\u2019s gender, but to her career as a political operative and lobbyist. But Comstock seized on the remark as evidence of Foust\u2019s insensitivity to women. One of Comstock\u2019s recent ads called the attack \u201csexist\u201d and \u201cbizarre.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee has its own ad that ends with: \u201cJohn Foust said being a working mother is not a real job. Just imagine what John Foust thinks about you.\u201d\n\nThe message: The 1950s throwback isn\u2019t Comstock, it\u2019s Foust \u2014 whom the NRCC has called the 10th District\u2019s \u201cDon Draper,\u2019 the sexist main character in the TV show \u201cMad Men.\u201d\n\nVirginia 10th District Democrats, meanwhile, exhibited their frustration that Comstock\u2019s gender may be giving her an advantage in a tweet.\n\n\u201cIf [Comstock] were a man, she\u2019d be down 20 [points with] women. Her record & policies are horrible for women. But voters assume . . . \u201d\n\nThere is risk for both Comstock and Foust of going overboard portraying their opponent as the extremist warrior \u2014 and winding up looking too ideological themselves. Past challengers to Wolf, for instance, have tried and failed to make his opposition to abortion an issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about abortion, because I don\u2019t think the laws are going to change. I think it\u2019s a lot of back and forth that I don\u2019t care about,\u201d said Jennifer Walsh, 41, another soccer mom and a part-time nurse practitioner. She cares more about electing someone who votes his or her own mind.\n\nSeveral women echoed Walsh\u2019s words. They didn\u2019t want abortion to be illegal, they said, but they had more pressing concerns.\n\nJennifer Horner, 47, recalled the ultrasound bill with a derisive chuckle.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t go through,\u201d she said over a table of dinner plates as her husband shepherded their two daughters to their car from a restaurant in Ashburn \u2014 one of the heaviest concentrations of independent women in the 10th District, according to both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would.\u201d\n\nAs a woman, Horner said, \u201cthe Republican Party, in the long run, doesn\u2019t work in my favor.\u201d But she when she thinks about Comstock, she doesn\u2019t think about transvaginal probes. She recalls that the delegate was responsive to her concerns about new development in the area. Local issues are on the top of her agenda, along with global trade and manufacturing \u2014 not abortion.\n\nAn international trade consultant and self-described Republican, Horner said she was still undecided.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Independent women in the 10th District are turned off by partisan rhetoric and ideological extremes.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Independent women in the 10th District are turned off by partisan rhetoric and ideological extremes.", "title": "In Northern Virginia congressional race, independent women hold the keys to victory", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/in-northern-virginia-congressional-race-independent-women-hold-the-keys-to-victory/2014/10/05/82f1a07e-3cf4-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/24/Others/Images/2014-09-24/_%20debate%20251411594270.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rachelweinerwp"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Virginia 10th District, 10th Congressional District, barbara comstock, john foust, northern virginia, frank wolf, women voters", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner"}, "eomportal-uuid": "82f1a07e-3cf4-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Virginia 10th District, 10th Congressional District, barbara comstock, john foust, northern virginia, frank wolf, women voters"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2da8\"", "article_summary": "The 10th District, where 60 percent of residents older than 15 are married, will test whether Democrats can expand their appeal.\nRich with unaligned votersVirginia\u2019s 10th District is a bellwether in a vote-rich swing state.\nRepublican Ken Cuccinelli II eked out a victory in the 10th over Terry McAuliffe in the 2013 gubernatorial race.\nBut married women favored Cuccinelli by the same margin; unmarried women went for McAuliffe by a whopping 42-point gap.\nFuller used to be a Republican and thinks that extremism on both sides is driving women like her to become independents."}
