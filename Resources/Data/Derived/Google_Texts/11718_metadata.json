On the books in 24 states and being considered in New Mexico, Missouri, Wisconsin and elsewhere, right-to-work laws allow workers to choose whether to pay unions.\n\nRight-to-work laws do nothing to prevent workers from forming, joining, or bargaining through a union, so union officials are stuck fabricating reasons Americans should be forced to pay unions for their own good.\n\nIn a particularly silly attempt to defend forced unionism, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees recently promoted a graphic blaming right-to-work for workplace deaths. Here is a Watchdog.org take on that graphic, which was originally created by union front group We Are Ohio:\n\nUnlike the infographic AFSCME pushed to supporters earlier this month, which did not cite the 2002 AFL-CIO news release its \u201cfacts\u201d came from, this graphic is based on the latest available data from the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nHundreds of labor union officers and employees in Washington, D.C., are paid with money taken from workers who must contribute to unions as a condition of employment. Unions can take mandatory fees from private-sector workers in 26 states, and from government workers in 23 states.\n\nAFSCME President Lee Saunders, paid a total of $350,058 in 2013, was one of 17 AFSCME headquarters officers and employees who received more than $200,000 from the government union. AFSCME took forced dues from 130,920 nonmembers in 2013, based on its annual report to the Department of Labor.\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union, paid its president, Randi Weingarten, a total of $557,875 in 2014. Weingarten\u2019s gross salary alone was $375,174, and she was one of 19 AFT officers and employees paid more than $200,000.\n\nLily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, was paid $345,728 as the union\u2019s vice president in 2014. Union officers and employees in NEA\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters were paid an average of $127,620 last year.\n\nOutgoing NEA president Dennis Van Roekel was paid $541,632 with money taken from teachers and other school staff. Van Roekel and Eskelsen Garcia were among 45 NEA headquarters officers and employees paid more than $200,000 while NEA took forced dues from 90,255 nonmembers.\n\nAlthough NEA, AFSCME and AFT \u2014 all public-sector labor unions \u2014 are three of America\u2019s largest unions, other labor bosses are paid even more. Terry O\u2019Sullivan, president of Laborers International Union of North America, was paid $663,981 and Transportation Communications Union President Bob Scardelletti was paid $641,215 in 2013.\n\nContrary to agitated union claims that right-to-work is \u201cwrong,\u201d backed by union-funded research and colorful graphics from front groups like Jobs With Justice and We Are Ohio, unions are big businesses looking out for their own interests.\n\nNEA headquarters took $362 million from educators last year, while AFT headquarters took $169 million. AFSCME headquarters collected $179 million from government workers in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When labor unions insist right-to-work laws are \"wrong,\" what they really mean is right-to-work laws are wrong for union bosses.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "When labor unions insist right-to-work laws are \"wrong,\" what they really mean is right-to-work laws are wrong for union bosses.", "title": "Right-to-work is wrong for union bosses - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Michigan-RTW-Protest-AP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-21T10:23:23+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/194238/rtw-union-bosses/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "When labor unions insist right-to-work laws are \"wrong,\" what they really mean is right-to-work laws are wrong for union bosses.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Michigan-RTW-Protest-AP.jpg"}, "title": "Right-to-work is wrong for union bosses - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-01-22T04:00:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-21T10:23:23+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Lee Saunders, Randi Weingarten, Lily Eskelsen Garcia, right-to-work, right to work, forced unionism, AFSCME, NEA, AFT"}, "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgWhen labor unions insist right-to-work laws are \u201cwrong,\u201d what they really mean is right-to-work laws are wrong for union bosses.\nTerry O\u2019Sullivan, president of Laborers International Union of North America, was paid $663,981 and Transportation Communications Union President Bob Scardelletti was paid $641,215 in 2013.\nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union, paid its president, Randi Weingarten, a total of $557,875 in 2014.\nUnion bosses have a financial interest in fighting right-to-work.\nUnion officers and employees in NEA\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters were paid an average of $127,620 last year."}
