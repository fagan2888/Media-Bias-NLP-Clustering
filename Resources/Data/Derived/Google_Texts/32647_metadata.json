A recent political ad shows Dems calling Republicans everything from \u201clegislative arsonists\u201d to \u201chostage-takers.\u201d\n\nFormer Congressional candidate Mia Love argued that such dialogue is all about political posturing and has \u201cnothing to do with the future of our children.\u201d She cited that with the government takeover of healthcare and education, her 12-year-old daughter will be looking at an average annual tuition of $150,000. \u201cAll of this that\u2019s happening is throwing our kids under the bus and we have got to do what we can to preserve their opportunities.\u201d\n\nFormer Miss America Kirsten Haglund said that both Democrats and Republicans are simply appealing to their base. \u201cThey\u2019re more concerned with winning the political war and winning public opinion than actual consequences.\u201d\n\nAri Fleischer argued that the real responsibility lies with the president. \u201cThe tone he\u2019s setting has been a divisive one almost from the start. But Republicans have contributed to it as well, Sean. I think it\u2019s incumbent on all to figure out how to get out of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "10-08-13", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "10-08-13", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2013/10/08/%E2%80%98hannity%E2%80%99-studio-audience-debate-can-dc-get-beyond-hyper-partisan-rhetoric", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/TownHall_Hannity100813.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Hannity\u2019 Studio Audience Debate: Can D.C.
