But it appears that Methodist will join Mayo\u2019s expanding network of affiliates across the country. Affiliates can consult with Mayo specialists, share Mayo know-how and get advice on improving operations.\n\nOn a national level, there are no stronger health care provider brands than the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. Both organizations are aggressively trying to extend their reach in a rapidly changing industry.\n\nMayo, for example, has embarked on a multibillion-dollar expansion in its Rochester, Minn., headquarters. Eventually, there may be only a handful of providers with national scope. Clinic officials are determined to be in that group.\n\nNorth Texas is an especially attractive market because of its rapid growth.\n\nJohn McWhorter, a Baylor Scott & White senior vice president and president of Baylor University Medical Center, said his organization\u2019s agreement with the Cleveland Clinic will run at least three years.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has contracts for cardiac care with large, self-insured national employers, such as Lowe\u2019s and Boeing Co., to cover their employees wherever they work.\n\nBaylor\u2019s agreement is expected to give it exclusivity in much of Texas and parts of Oklahoma and Louisiana, said Joseph Cacchione, chair, operations and strategy, of the Cleveland Clinic Heart & Vascular Institute.\n\nFinancial terms were not disclosed. Co-branding and co-marketing plans are still being developed, Baylor said.\n\n\u201cThe Cleveland Clinic is the undisputed leader in heart care,\u201d McWhorter said.\n\nThe Baylor hospitals included are the Heart Hospital Baylor Plano, Baylor University Medical Center and Baylor Jack and Jane Hamilton Heart and Vascular Hospital. The latter two are near downtown Dallas.\n\nMcWhorter said the Cleveland Clinic approached Baylor. He said it was an endorsement of Baylor\u2019s quality because participating facilities and physicians must meet Cleveland Clinic standards for experience and outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe knew the product they are delivering there is outstanding,\u201d Cacchione said of Baylor. He said a due diligence review over the past nine months or so confirmed that expectation.\n\nCacchione said that Baylor should be included in the Cleveland Clinic network by early next year. He hoped that patients here would have their procedures done here. But he acknowledged that some may choose to go to Cleveland for surgery and have their after-care provided here.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to help patients coordinate the bundling of their care,\u201d McWhorter said. He said the arrangement will bolster efforts to prepare patients for what to expect before and after surgery. It will also facilitate second opinions, which are especially important in more complicated cases.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic Heart & Vascular Institute has already partnered with the MedStar Heart Institute in the Washington, D.C., area, Cadence Health in Illinois and North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System in the New York metro area.\n\n\u201cWe want to cover the country,\u201d Cacchione said. He estimated that there could eventually be 25 to 30 hospitals or organizations in the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s cardiology network.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic, in addition to its Rochester facilities, has large operations in Arizona and Florida. It also has dozens of small community clinics and other facilities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Georgia.\n\nIt is rapidly expanding what it calls the Mayo Clinic Care Network throughout the U.S., even into Puerto Rico and Mexico.\n\nOn its website, Mayo says its Care Network members are selected \u201cbased on a rigorous set of clinical excellence, patient care and quality criteria.\u201d\n\nWith full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, some longtime health care executives have said they\u2019ve never seen more rapid change in the industry. Outright mergers and acquisitions continue. And other types of alliances are emerging.\n\nRecently, Baylor and Arlington-based Texas Health Resources announced agreements with drugstores that involve in-store health clinics.\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking for creative ways of expanding their footprint and taking advantage of scale,\u201d Trevor Fetter, CEO of Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp., said this week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three Dallas-area Baylor hospitals will team with Cleveland Clinic, and Methodist will ally with the Mayo Clinic.", "og": {"description": "Three Dallas-area Baylor hospitals will team with Cleveland Clinic, and Methodist will ally with the Mayo Clinic.", "title": "Baylor, Methodist hospital systems aligning with elite", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140829-baylor-methodist-hospital-systems-aligning-with-elite.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140829-people_randy_travis_32099424.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/PEOPLE_RANDY_TRAVIS_32099424.JPG", "height": 431}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-30T04:21:43Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-30T04:09:49Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Baylor, Methodist hospital systems aligning with elite\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140829-baylor-methodist-hospital-systems-aligning-with-elite.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140829-people_randy_travis_32099424.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/PEOPLE_RANDY_TRAVIS_32099424.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1888925\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-30T04:09:49Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"GARY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140829-people_randy_travis_32099424.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/PEOPLE_RANDY_TRAVIS_32099424.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-08-30T04:09:49Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The Baylor hospitals included are the Heart Hospital Baylor Plano, Baylor University Medical Center and Baylor Jack and Jane Hamilton Heart and Vascular Hospital.\nIt is rapidly expanding what it calls the Mayo Clinic Care Network throughout the U.S., even into Puerto Rico and Mexico.\nOn a national level, there are no stronger health care provider brands than the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic.\nCacchione said that Baylor should be included in the Cleveland Clinic network by early next year.\nRecently, Baylor and Arlington-based Texas Health Resources announced agreements with drugstores that involve in-store health clinics."}
