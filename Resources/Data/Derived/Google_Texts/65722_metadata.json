(AP) - The Kentucky women are at home in Rupp Arena, too.\n\nEvelyn Akhator scored 18 points to help No. 8 Kentucky beat No. 13 Duke 71-61 on Sunday night in front of 17,150 fans, the fourth-largest women\u2019s crowd in school history.\n\nAkhator scored eight of Kentucky\u2019s first 10 points and the Wildcats (10-0) built an early lead and never trailed. The game was team\u2019s second of the season at Rupp.\n\nKentucky coach Matthew Mitchell said the team\u2019s point of emphasis was producing a presence in the post. Sparked by Akhator, the Wildcats outscored the Blue Devils 38-34 in the paint.\n\n\u201cYou must establish a paint presence and you have to go right at them,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cYou have to attack the paint early. It was on the board all week. Something that was emphasized all week long. It was a great, great accomplishment for us to outscore them in the paint.\u201d\n\nOkhator listened to her coach\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cThey (my teammates) believe in me,\u201d Okhator said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let them down. I had to do well in the paint.\u201d\n\nJanee Thompson and Makayla Epps each added 17 points for the Wildcats, who ended a two-game losing streak to the Blue Devils. Epps, who didn\u2019t have a field goal in the first half, scored 11 points in the final two quarters. She also had eight assists.\n\nThompson said the presence of Akhator helped the Wildcats keep and the lead throughout.\n\n\u201cA good start in the paint is always important for us,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe have to establish a post presence so all other areas of our game can become open. Evelyn was key to the way we started. She was almost unstoppable (and) almost automatic that every time we gave her the ball she was able to score in the first half.\u201d\n\nAkhator made 8 of 14 shots from the field and the Wildcats shot 48 percent from the floor. They also made 10 of 11 free throws. Thompson made three of Kentucky\u2019s five shots from long range, including a 3 at the buzzer to end the first quarter.\n\nAzura Stevens led Duke (9-3) with 17 points, and Crystal Primm had 15.\n\nKentucky led by 11 in the second quarter, but Duke rallied to cut it to 26-25 with 6 minutes remaining in the half. The Wildcats responded by scoring eight of the next nine points and pushed it to 34-26 with 4 minutes remaining in the half and held a 38-30 halftime lead.\n\nDuke struggled against Kentucky\u2019s pressure and committed 17 turnovers, including 10 in the first half. The Blue Devils shot 37 percent from the field and were just 2 of 13 from 3-point range.\n\n\u201cIt was a great, great performance by our defense,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe were really able to affect them with our defense.\u201d\n\nDuke coach Joanne McCallie agreed.\n\n\u201cObviously, that was a significant impact,\u201d McCallie said. \u201cThey play very physical basketball. They play really hard. Our turnovers, we had some really crazy turnovers. You have to give credit to the defense for causing some of those (miscues).\u201d\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nDuke: The Blue Devils fell to 5-2 overall against the Wildcats. \u2026 Guard Rebecca Greenwell, a graduate of Owensboro Catholic and the runner-up to Epps for Miss Basketball in 2013, missed all six of her field-goal attempts and scored just one point. \u2026 Two of Duke\u2019s three losses this season have been on the road.\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats have won their first 10 games for only the fifth time in school history.\n\nNEXT UP:\n\nKentucky hosts Tennessee State on Dec. 28.\n\nDuke hosts Western Carolina on Dec. 29.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kentucky women are at home in Rupp Arena, too.", "Author": "KEITH TAYLOR", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Kentucky women are at home in Rupp Arena, too.", "title": "No. 8 Kentucky women beat No. 13 Duke 71-61", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/20/no-8-kentucky-women-beat-no-13-duke-71-61/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/20/duke_kentucky_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/20/duke_kentucky_basketball.jpeg", "title": "No. 8 Kentucky women beat No. 13 Duke 71-61", "description": "The Kentucky women are at home in Rupp Arena, too.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "It was a great, great accomplishment for us to outscore them in the paint.\u201dOkhator listened to her coach\u2019s message.\n\u201cIt was a great, great performance by our defense,\u201d Mitchell said.\nThe Blue Devils shot 37 percent from the field and were just 2 of 13 from 3-point range.\n13 Duke 71-61 on Sunday night in front of 17,150 fans, the fourth-largest women\u2019s crowd in school history.\nEpps, who didn\u2019t have a field goal in the first half, scored 11 points in the final two quarters."}
