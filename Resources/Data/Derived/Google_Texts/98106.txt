Not to be overlooked, on the same Friday the 13th that the Obama administration ordered schools to allow students to use restroom and locker room facilities matching their chosen "gender identity," they also issued a directive that can pressure Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare marketplace providers to cover sex change procedures.



An HHS spokesperson says it will bar excluding or limiting coverage for all gender transition-related services using Obamacare's Section 1557 concerning discrimination. You know, one of the parts of that 50-pound document no one read before passing it. And undoubtedly have still not read.



It is discrimination to refuse breast implant surgery, hormone therapy and sex change surgery for gender transition. Individuals must be treated consistent with their gender identity including access to facilities. On and on it goes.



HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell is thrilled. Finally, she says, a civil rights law that doesn't discriminate on the basis of sex. They do have a gender of course. It's the one God Himself assigned them at their birth. And to equate such things as gender reassignment surgery to civil rights is just crazy.



We are going at break neck speed ... in the wrong direction ... and in nearly every area. Remember when we used to think Sodom and Gomorrah were sinful?



And again, if you take a good look, most of Obama's "directives" are illegal but he gets away with it anyway.
