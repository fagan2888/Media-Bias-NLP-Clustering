Firefighters put out the flames at a home on Bahamas Drive in Tucson Sunday morning.

No one was hurt at the home, near the intersection of Kolb and Broadway, according to Captain Barrett Baker with TFD.

He said investigators learned that the flames were sparked by something the homeowner left on the stove.

Baker said firefighters also found zero working smoke alarms after the smoke cleared.

The Southern Arizona Chapter of the American Red Cross reports that relief teams are helping one woman displaced by the fire.
