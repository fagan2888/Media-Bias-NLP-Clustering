St. Luke's Health System, an Idaho-based, not-for-profit health system, would purchase the Saltzer Medical Group in Nampa--the state's largest independent physician practice.\n\nThe acquisition, which took place in December 2012, would allow the entities to transform healthcare in the region by offering integrated care across all settings. But the deal quickly became more complicated than St. Luke's ever imagined, said Christy Neuhoff, St. Luke's chief legal counsel told FierceHealthcare in an exclusive interview.\n\nSt. Luke's and Saltzer have yet to fully realize that vision because the health system's main competitor, Saint Alphonsus Health System in Boise--as well as the Boise surgical center Treasure Valley Hospital, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Idaho attorney general--are suing St. Luke's in an effort to undo the purchase, which they claim is illegal and will reduce competition for primary care in the Nampa area.\n\nBoth sides recently wrapped up their closing arguments of a four-week trial and are awaiting a judge's ruling.\n\nThe case, according to U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill, was \"undoubtedly one of the most difficult\" he's had to preside over, because the \"stakes are extremely high not only for the entities here, but for the community,\" the Idaho Statesman reported.\n\nThe case has national repercussions as it is the first to go on trial to challenge a health system acquisition of a physician practice since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSt. Luke's argues that its goals are consistent with the ACA and with the objectives that health policy experts believe is the best way to deliver higher quality at a lower cost, Neuhoff told FierceHealthcare.\n\n\"So if we are to address the healthcare crisis the country has found itself in then we can't deliver care in a fragmented way as we have done in the past,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The case of St. Luke's Health System \u00a0vs. the Federal Trade Commission and St. Alphonsus Health System is the first to go on trial to challenge a health system acquisition of a physician practice since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
