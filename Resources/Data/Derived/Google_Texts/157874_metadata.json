And these days, both goals are looking further out of reach: a new CNN/ORC public opinion poll shows a clear majority of the public isn\u2019t feeling great about Obama\u2019s strategy to defeat the Islamic State. That\u2019s not a good look when Obama\u2019s trying to win approval of his Authorization of Use of Military Force amid some rough headlines \u2013 including last week\u2019s death of Kayla Mueller, a 26-year-old aid worker and the Islamic State\u2019s first known female American hostage, and the beheading of more than 20 Egyptian Christians over the weekend.\n\n[READ: ISIS' Perceived Expansion Yields New Power]\n\nWholly Not Holy: Obama\u2019s refusal to define the Islamic State group in religious terms may be a way of avoiding giving the extremists what they want: an all-out Christians vs. Muslims holy war framed by the Koran, and not by what the president has called \u201ca bankrupt ideology\u201d based on the idea of a sociopathic, stone-age caliphate:\n\nHouse of Saud Cards: At times the spiraling conflict in the Middle East \u2013 Syria vs. rebels vs. Islamic State vs. Iraq vs. Iran vs. Jordan and now vs. Egypt \u2013 seems about as simple to solve as a six-sided Rubik\u2019s Cube, and it\u2019s almost as difficult for anyone this side of the door on the White House Situation Room to put things in context. And that\u2019s even before folding the Charlie Hebdo Paris attacks and the weekend shooting in Copenhagen into the mix. But along with a piece we recommended from the Atlantic this morning, here\u2019s another good place to start: an easy-to-digest piece on Saudi Arabia from Vox. The article popped up a few weeks ago when Saudi monarch King Abdullah died, but it\u2019s got a ton of useful information about how Saudi Arabia is among the common denominators in the unrest \u2013 and why we should be very afraid if oil prices continue to collapse.\n\n[MORE: White House Terror Summit Missing the Mark on Islamic Threats]\n\nDrone On: The Obama administration announced Tuesday it will allow U.S. defense contractors to sell military-grade drones to overseas allies, a new market for a tool that\u2019s been the cornerstone of the White House\u2019s war on terrorism. Lest you imagine the Islamic State purchasing officer putting in bids for a $12.5 million Reaper (Hellfire missiles extra), the administration has sought to assuage our fears: sales, they say, will be approved on a case-by-case basis, and purchasers must pinky-swear that they\u2019ll abide by \u201cproper use\u201d principles, whatever that means. Seriously: we don\u2019t know, because those principles are classified. One assumes it means raining death from above only on mutual adversaries, and keeping them out of enemy hands. But if past is prologue \u2013 and with a billion-dollar global black market in arms sales \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine the drones won\u2019t follow a well-worn path of previous weapons systems that have ended up on the wrong side of a conflict.\n\nDrawn Conclusion:", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call, War on Extremism Edition: Rubik\u2019s Cube Conflict Turns Again", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Holder says Fox News cares more about semantics, Obama watches his language and drones for sale, missiles not included.", "title": "Last Call, War on Extremism Edition: Rubik\u2019s Cube Conflict Turns Again", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/02/17/last-call-war-on-extremism-edition-rubiks-cube-conflict-turns-again", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/0b/82/fca0f11d4056840e31dfdd5c50a3/150217-ericholder-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Holder says Fox News cares more about semantics, Obama watches his language and drones for sale, missiles not included.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Last Call, War on Extremism Edition: Rubik\u2019s Cube Conflict Turns Again"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Feb. 17, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
