While not all of the mentions of \u201cjurist\u201d were in the context of the US Supreme Court, most were, and journalists (and others) often hear a word they like and run with it elsewhere.\n\nHere are some examples of how \u201cjurist\u201d was used:\n\n\u201cRegardless of the \u2018legal gymnastics\u2019 that five of the nine jurists performed, none change what marriage really is,\u201d said one report, quoting a local bishop.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Justice Antonin Scalia, staking out his ground as a relic, like jurists and politicians who a half-century ago tried to block the movement for racial equality,\u201d an editorial said.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act ruling, another editorial said, \u201cThe majority opinion argued that democracy demands that the court allow lawmakers\u2014not jurists\u2014to set policy.\u201d\n\nIn Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court ruled against a display of the Ten Commandments, the attorney general spoke: \u201cThese Supreme Court justices are nothing more than politicians in black robes, masquerading as objective jurists,\u201d he is quoted as saying. \u201cIt is time that the people chose jurists,\u201d instead of the bar association.\n\nSo \u201cjurist\u201d is just another word for judge, right?\n\nNotsofast.\n\nA \u201cjurist\u201d is \u201ca person who has a thorough knowledge of law,\u201d Merriam-Webster says.\n\n\u201cDespite journalistic usage, jurist is not a synonym for judge, Theodore M. Bernstein wrote in The Careful Writer, way back in 1965.\n\nIn an \u201cAsk the Editor\u201d answer, The Associated Press Stylebook says: \u201cWe prefer \u2018judges\u2019 or \u2018justices.\u2019 The term \u2018jurist\u2019 usually connotes a scholar or writer in the field of law.\u201d\n\nBut Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary, used by the AP, gives these definitions: \u201can expert in law; scholar or writer in the field of law\u201d and, um, \u201cjudge.\u201d\n\nIt may be true that all \u201cjudges\u201d are \u201cjurists,\u201d in that they need enough expertise on the law to qualify as judges, but it\u2019s also true that all \u201cjurists\u201d are not \u201cjudges,\u201d or possibly not even lawyers.\n\nGarner\u2019s Modern American Usage says that British English reserves the word \u201cjurist\u201d for \u201cone who has made outstanding contributions to legal thought and legal literature.\u201d But in American English, \u201cit is loosely applied to every judge of whatever level.\u201d (Note the use of \u201cloosely.\u201d)\n\nBryan A. Garner, the author of said book, is also the editor of Garner\u2019s Dictionary of Legal Usage and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. He\u2019s a lawyer as well as a lexicographer, and has a distinguished career in both fields.\n\nBut does he qualify as a \u201cjurist\u201d? You be the judge.\n\nMerrill Perlman managed copy desks across the newsroom at The New York Times, where she worked for 25 years.
