Orrin Hatch Orrin HatchGOP senator reacts to Garland meeting before it happens Senate amendments could sink email privacy compromise Overnight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo MORE (R-Utah), the chairman of the Finance Committee and a campaign backer, wrote a letter on Tuesday arguing that the Obama administration is breaking the law with another \u201cbailout\u201d of insurance companies.\n\n\u201cWe are again disappointed with the Administration\u2019s willingness to unlawfully direct money to health insurers at taxpayers\u2019 expense,\u201d they write.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTheir letter concerns ObamaCare\u2019s \u201creinsurance\u201d program, designed to protect insurers against high costs for sicker enrollees in the early years of the law. Under the program, the government collects money from insurers and then redistributes it to those with high-cost enrollees.\n\nObamaCare required that in its first year, 2014, the reinsurance program would collect $10 billion to redistribute to insurers, and another $2 billion to go to the Treasury Department. But not enough money was collected to cover those totals, so the administration, through regulations put forth in 2014, prioritized giving money to insurers over the $2 billion to the Treasury.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d Hatch and Rubio write. \u201cThe statute in question is unambiguous, and the [Health and Human Services] regulation and recent practice violates its clear directive.\u201d\n\nThey point to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service to back up their claim that the administration is violating the law. The CRS report found that the administration\u2019s interpretation \u201cwould appear to be in conflict with a plain reading\u201d of the healthcare reform act.\n\nThe text of ObamaCare states that the $2 billion \u201cshall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used for the program established under this section [i.e. the payments to insurers].\u201d\n\nAsked about the issue at a Senate Appropriations hearing last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell noted that her department put forward public regulations laying out its approach and the same complaints were not raised at the time.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we have the authorities and as I mentioned [earlier], we actually published for comment and notice the approach that we were going to take to use those authorities, and did not have any of the concerns raised as part of that public process,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nTim Jost, a health law expert at Washington and Lee University who supports ObamaCare, said that he found the administration\u2019s interpretation \u201creasonable\u201d given that it did not collect enough money to cover all the costs and the primary purpose of the section is the payments to insurers, not \u201cgeneral tax collection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the continuing struggle of the administration to make the statute work,\u201d Jost said, noting that ObamaCare is a complicated law concerning a complicated health system, and Republican opposition has made tweaking it difficult.\n\n\u201cThere's no possibility of amending to try to fix the statute, so they just proceed in trying to read the statute in a way that makes it actually work,\u201d he added. \u201cSo that's what they're doing here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rubio is decrying another \"bailout\" of insurance companies.", "description": "Rubio is decrying another \"bailout\" of insurance companies.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Rubio is decrying another \"bailout\" of insurance companies.", "title": "Rubio opens new front in war on ObamaCare", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/272276-rubio-opens-new-front-in-war-on-obamacare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/rubiomarco_022816gn3.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-08T18:28:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-08T18:28-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/272276-rubio-opens-new-front-in-war-on-obamacare", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-08T17:55-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Orrin Hatch, Marco Rubio,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-08T17:55:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T18:28:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/272276-rubio-opens-new-front-in-war-on-obamacare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Rubio is decrying another \"bailout\" of insurance companies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rubio opens new front in war on ObamaCare"}, "dcterms.title": "Rubio opens new front in war on ObamaCare"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are again disappointed with the Administration\u2019s willingness to unlawfully direct money to health insurers at taxpayers\u2019 expense,\u201d they write.\nSen.
