[WATCH] ‘SNL’ gives 28 reasons to hug a black guy … and 27 are slavery

Need a reason to hug a black person today? Saturday Night Live gave 28 reasons this week — and 27 of them were slavery.

In honor of Black History Month, SNL‘s Jay Pharoah, Kenan Thompson and Sasheer Zamata played students giving a musical class presentation on 28 reasons to hug a black guy today, one for each day in February. Kate McKinnon played the school teacher, awkwardly dancing on the side of the room.

As Thompson and Pharoah rapped, with Zamata singing background, the trio gave the first reason to hug a black guy today: “We deserve a chance!”

Reasons 2 through 28? Slavery.

The rest of the song poked fun at white guilt and black oppression in the funniest ways possible. The three black students listed off white people they aren’t mad at — like singers Daryl Hall and Michael McDonald. Then they asked all of the white students to put their hands in the air if they were down for the cause, but then flipped it on them and said, “Keep ’em up if your ancestors owned us.”

Bobby Moynihan’s character, a student in the class, stood up during the song to try to defend white people and play “devil’s advocate,” but was immediately asked to sit back down by the McKinnon.

“When I say ‘slavery,’ you say ‘sorry,'” Thompson rapped at the class. “Slavery!”

“Sorry,” the students begrudgingly responded.
