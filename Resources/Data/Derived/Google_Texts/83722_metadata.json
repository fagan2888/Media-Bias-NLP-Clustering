Susan Collins\u2019 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act during a Thursday morning news conference in Portland.\n\nThe event took place the same day the Bellows campaign took to the airwaves to play up one of its star supporters, native Mainer and bestselling author Stephen King. In the latest campaign television advertisement, King, a longtime donor to liberal candidates and causes, calls Bellows a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d and said he has \u201cnever worked so hard or hoped so strongly for a change in leadership.\u201d\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s news conference, Bellows sought to differentiate herself from Collins on the topic of health care, saying Maine\u2019s senior senator \u2014 who has a wide lead in fundraising and polling \u2014 fell in line with her party in votes to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act.\n\nBellows also criticized Collins for endorsing Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who five times has vetoed efforts by Democratic lawmakers in Maine to expand federal Medicaid coverage in the state as allowed under Obamacare.\n\nFor her part, Bellows said she believes the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cgood first step\u201d but said Congress should take steps toward the type of universal, government-run health care program used in Canada and many other developed nations.\n\n\u201cPartisan politics have stopped too many Mainers from getting the health care they need,\u201d said Bellows, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. \u201cNo matter which way the political wind blows, I will stand up for universal health care for all.\u201d\n\nLance Dutson, spokesman for Collins\u2019 campaign, cited Canadians traveling to Maine for medical treatments as an indication of flaws in the universal health care model.\n\n\u201cA Canadian-style government-run system leads to excessive delays in care, prevents people from seeing the health care providers of their choice and stifles innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen in Maine the number of Canadians who come to Fort Kent and Bangor for treatments because they cannot get the care they need in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the expansion of Medicaid, which is distributed in the state under the MaineCare program, say doing so would take advantage of federal dollars to provide coverage to 70,000 Mainers who can\u2019t afford it and don\u2019t qualify for aid.\n\nThe argument for expansion holds that it would help more Mainers stay healthy and drive down costs for hospitals, who might otherwise need to treat the uninsured through emergency room visits and never recoup the costs.\n\nThe LePage administration has argued that, while the expansion would be covered by federal funds to start, administrative costs would not, and a percentage of the additional MaineCare costs eventually would shift to the state budget, which can\u2019t absorb any more increases.\n\nPhil Caper, a board member with organization Maine AllCare, said at the Thursday news conference that establishing a universal health care system would save Maine $1 billion in annual health care costs, which would free up more money to rebuild roads, expand broadband Internet or tackle other pressing infrastructure needs.\n\nState Rep. Linda Sanborn, D-Gorham, said at the event a 2010 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study found that 109,000 Maine adults went without needed medical care that year because it was too expensive.\n\n\u201cLetting people suffer to make an ideological point is not leadership,\u201d said Sanborn, who has practiced family medicine for 25 years. \u201cAs a Mainer, as a doctor and as an elected official, I can\u2019t stand by while tens of thousands of Mainers are left without the health care coverage they should have gotten years ago.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Collins on Thursday countered, arguing while health care reform was needed, Obamacare is riddled with problems.\n\nGreg Dugal, president of the Maine Innkeepers Association and the Maine Restaurant Association, said provisions in the law defining the work week as 30 hours, seasonal employees as working just 120 days and large businesses as having just 50 employees have ensnared many small Maine businesses in Obamacare\u2019s complicated and potentially expensive regulatory net.\n\n\u201cI can certainly see all kinds of things that are not right about the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Dugal said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Shenna Bellows touted her support for a universal health care program and decried incumbent Republican Sen.
