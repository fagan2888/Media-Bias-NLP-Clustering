Yellen also cautioned against brinksmanship over raising the debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cI believe it is the responsibility of Congress to pass a budget, to fund the government, to deal with the debt ceiling so that America pays its bills,\u201d Yellen said at a press conference on the Fed\u2019s decision to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged. \u201cWe have a good recovery in place that is really making progress. To see Congress take actions that would endanger that progress -- I think that would be quite unfortunate.\u201d\n\nYellen insisted that fear of a government shutdown and the harm it would cause the economy had not influenced the Fed\u2019s decision to maintain near-zero interest rates. \u201cIt played absolutely no role in our decision,\u201d Yellen said.\n\nHouse Republicans are refusing to pass legislation to fund the government, if it provides money to Planned Parenthood. President Barack Obama has vowed to veto any measure that doesn't include funding for the reproductive health care provider, setting up a confrontation that could shutter the federal government if a resolution is not reached before Sept. 30.\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s estimated that the last GOP-led government shutdown in October 2013 cost the economy $24 billion in lost GDP. That shutdown, which lasted 16 days, was precipitated by House Republicans\u2019 refusal to provide funding for the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Fed chair said a shutdown would \u201cendanger\u201d economic progress.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-18 18:23:37 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Fed chair said a shutdown would \u201cendanger\u201d economic progress.", "title": "Janet Yellen Warns Against Government Shutdown", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janet-yellen-government-shutdown_us_55fb376ae4b08820d9180e54", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55fb38f51c00002e00757511.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Fed chair said a shutdown would \u201cendanger\u201d economic progress.", "creator": "@danielmarans", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55fb38f51c00002e00757511.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Janet Yellen Warns Against Government Shutdown", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-17 18:23:37 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55fb376ae4b08820d9180e54", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "janet yellen government shutdown,Janet Yellen,Government Shutdown,federal reserve,Interest Rates,GDP,Unemployment", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "janet yellen government shutdown,Janet Yellen,Government Shutdown,federal reserve,Interest Rates,GDP,Unemployment", "published_time": "2015-09-17 18:23:37 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-09-17 18:23:37 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd061\"", "article_summary": "Fed Chair Janet Yellen addressed the prospect of a government shutdown at a Thursday press conference on the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday called on Congress to fund the government, warning that a government shutdown would jeopardize the country\u2019s economic health.\n\u201cIt played absolutely no role in our decision,\u201d Yellen said.\nThat shutdown, which lasted 16 days, was precipitated by House Republicans\u2019 refusal to provide funding for the Affordable Care Act.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s estimated that the last GOP-led government shutdown in October 2013 cost the economy $24 billion in lost GDP."}
