Police arrested 44-year-old Bryan Powell at his Edmond home early Friday morning. His arrest came as part of an investigation stemming back to August 2013.

According to a police report, a detective with the Stillwater Police Department, who was also a member of the Oklahoma Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force, used a file sharing program to directly connect with Powell's computer on multiple occasions.

Over the course of the investigation the detective was able to download a number of video files depicting explicit acts of child pornography directly from Powell's computer.

Investigators issued a court order to AT&T for internet subscriber information, where it was determined the IP address was in fact Powell's.

Around 7 a.m. on Friday investigators served a warrant at Powell's home in Edmond. Police then say Powell was Mirandized and, after being questioned, admitted to using the internet to download child pornography.

Police say Powell also admitted that he knew he was sharing parts of the videos while he was downloading the files. He is facing one count of distributing child pornography, one count of possessing child pornography, and one count for violating the Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act.
