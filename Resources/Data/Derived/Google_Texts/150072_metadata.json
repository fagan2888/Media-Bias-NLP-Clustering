Clearly news executives are shaping coverage plans with audience sensibilities in mind.\n\nChannel 9 posted a video online, narrated by anchor Kyle Clark, advising the audience the station will not carry graphic images from the trial, will not go wall-to-wall on days when nothing unexpected happens. The goal, Clark said, is to keep viewers informed, not overwhelmed.\n\nSetting the gentlest tone, Channel 9 warned about \u201ccomplex and often mundane psychological issues and terms\u201d that will make the trial difficult to follow. Mundane? That\u2019s difficult to believe ahead of this intensely scrutinized case. Sanity evaluations will be at the heart of the trial.\n\nCompetitors took a more direct, less cushioned approach.\n\nKMGH-Channel 7 promised live coverage everyday on the 7News app and livestream. The station posted, \u201c7NEWS\u2019 decision to livestream the movie theater shooting trial and provide daily context is driven by a similar, fundamental belief: Justice deserves to be transparent.\u201d\n\nKCNC-Channel 4 News Director Tim Wieland said in a staff memo (published online), the station will use sensitivity in approaching coverage decisions, including the use of the defendant\u2019s name (only sparingly).\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that some elements of this trial will be difficult for us to report,\u201d Wieland wrote, \u201cand for you to watch. While we will absolutely take care not to unnecessarily report gory or inappropriate details, our job at the end of the day is cover the news. I suspect that view won\u2019t assuage the feelings of some of our viewers, but I do want you all to know that every decision that goes into our coverage is not made capriciously.\u201d\n\nRegarding the \u201cno notoriety\u201d request from families of victims, asking that the media avoid using the name of the defendant, KDVR-Channel 31 responded with awareness but no promises. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking it lightly,\u201d said News Director Holly Gauntt on the station\u2019s website, \u201cwe can\u2019t make the promise that we\u2019re not going to say his name because I think in reporting this story inevitably we\u2019ll need to do thorough coverage and we will limit as much as we can and we will certainly be aware of their concerns.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aurora theater shooting trial,CBS4,journalism,KCNC-Channel 4,KDVR-Channel 31,KMGH-Channel 7,KUSA-Channel 9,Kyle Clark,media,philosophy", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "On the eve of what could be a four-month media marathon covering the Aurora theater shooting trial, Denver TV stations alerted viewers about what to expect.
