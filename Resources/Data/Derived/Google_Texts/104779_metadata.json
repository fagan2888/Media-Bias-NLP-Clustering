If approved, Colorado would become the first state to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a health care plan paid for by a payroll tax.\n\n\u201cIt will save you money, it will cover everyone, and it\u2019s designed in Colorado by Coloradans\u201d, said state Sen. Irene Aguilar, a doctor and the chief architect of what will be on the 2016 ballot as Amendment 69. \u201cIt simplifies greatly the administrative complexities of our health care system.\u201d\n\nUnder ColoradoCare, employers would have to pay a new tax of about 7 percent of workers\u2019 wages. Employees would have a payroll tax of about 3 percent. There would be no deductibles or co-pays. The funds would be transferred into a separate authority run by an elected board of directors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stated that they absolutely need to allow you to pick your primary care provider. It\u2019s encouraged that you be given as much choice as possible,\u201d said Aguilar.\n\nWhen asked if the quality of health care will stay the same, Aguilar said, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to get better health care.\u201d\n\nOpponents say not true.\n\n\u201cColoradoCare is a killer tax hike and experiment in health care that will ration care, scrap the Hippocratic oath, and throw away all the progress we\u2019ve made in health care reform,\u201d said Jonathan Lockwood, Executive Director of Advancing Colorado, a conservative free market advocacy group. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have everybody forced into a system that has no guarantees.\u201d\n\nThe debate is just beginning.\n\nLINK: ColoradoCareYES Campaign\n\nKathy Walsh is CBS4\u2019s Weekend Anchor and Health Specialist.
