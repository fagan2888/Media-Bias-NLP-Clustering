Levin\n\nThreshold Editions, $27, 256 pages\n\nOne would think that to succeed in today\u2019s political world one must be intimately familiar with what we know as social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or the newest Internet gadget along with the latest app du jour. Trendy techies and an insulated inside-the-Beltway clique of consultants and candidates vying to master various internet widgets are prone to dismiss conservative talk radio as irrelevant. To do so is a mistake of unimaginable proportions as talk radio reaches more people and has vastly more influence on the politically active than most imagine even if it doesn\u2019t seem as hip to a younger generation seemingly superglued to computers and cellphones.\n\nMark Levin is a talented and dedicated conservative attorney turned nationally syndicated radio host with an unerring ability to connect to a devoted, ever-growing audience of millions who eagerly turn their radio dials in his direction on a daily basis. There they can enjoy his unique, charismatic and provocative takes on news of the day and \u2014 in a noisy media echo chamber \u2014 the truth.\n\nBut since so many of today\u2019s young people generally choose other means of connecting with their favorite political personalities, it is encouraging to see that Mr. Levin wants to reach a generation of young Americans more likely to be addicted to reality television and Harry Potter movies, but that still reads books.\n\nIn his latest book, \u201cPlunder and Deceit,\u201d Mr. Levin predicts a grim future for today\u2019s 18- to 35-year-olds if current political, economic and social trends continue. Bluntly and honestly, Mr. Levin expresses doubts that these young people can look forward to a future as bright as the one their parents and grandparents enjoyed. At his best, Mr. Levin is part philosopher, part oracle, seamlessly moving from Madison\u2019s \u201cFederalist Papers\u201d (particularly Federalist No. 51, \u201cThe Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments\u201d) to Edmund Burke and Montesquieu. He shines a light on a republic in decline and visualizes the long-term impact of today\u2019s mass dependence on unfunded government entitlements.\n\nMr. Levin\u2019s style is direct and acerbic. It\u2019s his shtick. Fans of his radio show will recognize the railing against the \u201cruling generation\u201d and the absolute refusal to engage in the sociologist-speak of boomer/Gen X/Gen Y/millennial classifications. The decision to refrain is a subtle one, with a profound outcome: One really gets a sense of Mr. Levin\u2019s worldview. He sees a nation he loves in peril; undermined by a dysfunctional system of government run by those who seek to enrich the few at the expense of the many. It\u2019s a world divided between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2014 the \u201cstatists\u201d versus the rest of us.\n\nFrom chapter to chapter, Mr. Levin details the consequences of decades of government largesse, of the skyrocketing federal debt, Obamacare, education and the environment, which he sees as being visited on these young people. They may not have initiated the ruinous policies that he believes are destroying their future prospects, but suggests that to a large extent they have only themselves to blame, noting the irony of a generation of young people in love with the very things that will lead to the financial and cultural difficulties they will wrestle with in middle age.\n\nOn education, Mr. Levin speaks directly to young people, addressing the many problems facing a system that puts pensions, tenure and deals with textbook companies above actual education. He cites statistics on how education dollars get spent and he explains how the young are manipulated by teachers\u2019 unions and school administrators more interested in social engineering than readying students for the real world. He takes on the massive education debt shouldered by today\u2019s young people as they start their careers and notes that many are paying far more for an education than can be justified by future earnings.\n\nUltimately though, his message to young people is a positive one, because he is convinced they have it within themselves to avoid the coming catastrophe. This book is a clarion call to today\u2019s youth, who if they understand the problems they face and are willing to do the hard work, they can set the nation back on the right course and secure their futures.\n\nIn \u201cPlunder and Deceit,\u201d Mark Levin ably diagnoses the problems at hand and provides a cure for those willing to listen. It is a book worth reading and taking to heart.\n\n\u2022 Ian Walters is a musician and longtime communications director for the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).", "article_metadata": {"description": "One would think that to succeed in today's political world one must be intimately familiar with what we know as social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or the newest Internet gadget along with the latest app du jour.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "One would think that to succeed in today\u2019s political world one must be intimately familiar with what we know as social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or the newest Internet gadget along with the latest app du jour.", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018Plunder and Deceit\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/5/book-review-plunder-and-deceit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/05/8_5_2015_bkplunder-lg8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/05/8_5_2015_bkplunder-lg8201.jpg", "description": "One would think that to succeed in today's political world one must be intimately familiar with what we know as social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or the newest Internet gadget alon", "card": "summary", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018Plunder and Deceit\u2019"}, "Author": "Ian Walters", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Mark R Levin"}, "article_summary": "In his latest book, \u201cPlunder and Deceit,\u201d Mr. Levin predicts a grim future for today\u2019s 18- to 35-year-olds if current political, economic and social trends continue.\nAt his best, Mr. Levin is part philosopher, part oracle, seamlessly moving from Madison\u2019s \u201cFederalist Papers\u201d (particularly Federalist No.\nIn \u201cPlunder and Deceit,\u201d Mark Levin ably diagnoses the problems at hand and provides a cure for those willing to listen.\nOn education, Mr. Levin speaks directly to young people, addressing the many problems facing a system that puts pensions, tenure and deals with textbook companies above actual education.\nBluntly and honestly, Mr. Levin expresses doubts that these young people can look forward to a future as bright as the one their parents and grandparents enjoyed."}
