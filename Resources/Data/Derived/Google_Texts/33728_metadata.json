Here's a look at what experts think next year will hold for financial matters close to home: Raises, rent, gas, food and health.\n\nWill you get a raise next year?\n\nMaybe.\n\nWage growth has been perhaps the job market's biggest weakness since the recession ended. Pay increases have been both slow and uneven, highly dependent on your field of employment. And for many, it has not been enough to keep pace with the cost of living.\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings climbed 2.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the government's most recent report. But that is only about two-thirds the roughly 3.5 percent typically seen in a strong economy.\n\nMany economists are optimistic Americans' pay will start growing faster soon because hiring has been good and layoffs have been low. But that's been the case for a while, and wages haven't taken off yet.\n\nJoseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, is not expecting major gains ahead. He notes that measures that include a broader mix of compensation beyond hourly wages show there's even less growth in pay than it seems.\n\n\"I'm not convinced things are going to grow as much as I would like them to,\" he said.\n\nClick ahead for a look at what experts forecast for rents, gas prices, food, and health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wondering how you will fare financially in 2016?
