Now that the Fed\u2019s big decision is temporarily behind us \u2014 and good for them for making the right call and not yet raising rates\u2014let\u2019s give monetary policy a rest and look at fiscal policy.\n\nTrigger warning: what follows ain\u2019t pretty.\n\nDefining terms, monetary policy is what the Fed does with the benchmark interest rate it controls\u2014a critically important \u201cprice\u201d that affects the cost of borrowing throughout the economy\u2014while fiscal policy represents the taxing and spending policies by the federal government.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s become a bit of clich\u00e9 to say we have a dysfunctional government, so let me be specific. We live in a $17.9 trillion economy, with a federal government sector that will spend about $3.7 trillion this year. Is it feasible that we can adequately manage such magnitudes with a political system that can\u2019t agree on spending priorities such that with the end of the fiscal year less than two weeks away, they\u2019re still not sure whether they\u2019ll pass yet another budget patch that gets us to the next deadline or shut down the government?\n\nTrue, more than half of those government outlays are on automatic, going to health programs (24 percent), Social Security (24 percent), and interest on the debt (7 percent). And before anyone freaks out, the 21 percent of spending as a share of GDP is precisely the historical average since 1979.\n\nThe ironic part is that while many politicians and pundits chafe at the automatic parts, they\u2019re the only ones that reliably work these days. The success stories are Social Security, Medicare, safety-net programs like nutritional and wage supports, and most recently, Obamacare, which has been remarkably successful in lowering the rate of Americans without health coverage. And as regards interest on the debt, credit spreads reveal that global investors consider U.S. government debt among the safest in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress\u2019s inability to adequately fund highways and transit system means that problem will soon loom large again. And fear not, adrenalin-addicts: once the excitement of the government shutdown is behind us, we\u2019ll turn right to the debt ceiling debate. As noted, thus far the madness of suggesting that we could default on our sovereign debt hasn\u2019t infected markets, but in this election cycle, how confident are you that the bevy of Republican presidential candidates will handle this\u2026um\u2026maturely?\n\nMeanwhile, the mindless spending caps\u2014\u201csequestration\u201d\u2014are still in play and are, along with the conservatives\u2019 drive to defund Planned Parenthood, one reason why Congress may not be able to resolve their difference before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Members on both sides want to break through the caps, but they can\u2019t get there without working together, and so far that\u2019s not happening (recall that Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), managed to negotiate some sequester relief in late 2013).\n\nSo, what does all of this have to do with the economy? Can\u2019t the Fed just pick up the slack and do all the heavy lifting on its own?\n\nNope. It take monetary and fiscal policy to close the output gaps we face in GDP and reduce the slack remaining in the job market.\n\nThe figure at the top of this post, by Goldman Sachs researchers (GS), shows the impact of changes in fiscal policy on GDP growth. When the Great Recession was at its worst, stimulus helped partially offset the demand contraction, adding to GDP growth in 2009-10. But the pivot to austerity, circled in the graph, while not of European dimensions, was still severe, particularly in 2011 and 2013.\n\nToward the end of the figure, you see that \u201cfiscal impulse\u201d \u2014the impact of changing fiscal policy on growth \u2014 has been neutral of late and is predicted to be either flat, slightly negative, or slightly positive if policymakers can pull off another Murray/Ryan, break-through-the-caps deal. Neutral is better than negative, and in fact, job growth accelerated once fiscal policy moved to at least \u201cdo-no-harm\u201d mode.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s all we can ask from this Congress. No unforced errors. Keep your hands off of the recovery.\n\nBut that\u2019s a terribly low bar. Accommodative Fed policy and flush capital markets will keep the cost of borrowing low, but cheap credit must be met by stronger demand from consumers and investors or capital will sit on the sidelines.\n\nDeep investment in public infrastructure, in clean energy, a robust highway and transit bill, implementing ideas like the Fix America\u2019s Schools Today (FAST!) bill\u2014such ideas would move that fiscal impulse line into positive territory while taking advantage of borrowing rates that remain low, courtesy of the Fed.\n\nThat\u2019s the one-two punch of monetary and fiscal policy working together.\n\nInstead, we face the specter of another series of punches at the economy from policymakers who seem to have almost completely forgotten how to work together for the greater good. It\u2019s a testament to the resiliency of our economy that given the dysfunction, we\u2019ve continued to post decent growth rates. In fact, the consensus is that markets will just shrug off another shutdown as par for the course these days.\n\nProbably so, but how long can we run an $18 trillion economy with one key branch of government so badly broken? I\u2019d love not to have to find out the answer to that question.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monetary policy by the Fed is on track for now.
