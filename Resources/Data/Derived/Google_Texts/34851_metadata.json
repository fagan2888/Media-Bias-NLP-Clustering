This is an opportunity to restore the ecosystem in an area that has historic value \u2014 and make it better,\u201d said Marcus Selig, regional director of the National Forest Foundation, which led creation of a 50-page master plan. \u201cOur goal is to put the area on a trajectory to be natural. We\u2019ll engineer the floodplain. We\u2019ll design it so that high flows in spring can restore a balance.\u201d\n\nBut historic preservation of scattered concrete foundations of the Army base looms as a hurdle. And water pressures complicate restoration. Colorado Springs and Aurora own rights to groundwater under the headwaters, within a 30,700-acre watershed, and to snowmelt trickling down surrounding rocky peaks.\n\nA project proposal put forth this month by the U.S. Forest Service preserves the option of cities drilling into a re-engineered valley to reach groundwater and building a reservoir above wetlands to supply residents along Colorado\u2019s increasingly populated Front Range.\n\nIf the project survives bureaucratic review and gets funding, it would rank among the nation\u2019s most ambitious feats of ecological restoration. It reflects a growing interest among restoration ecologists in \u201cnovel ecosystems\u201d \u2014 recognizing that exact replication of nature before it was altered may be unfeasible, while embracing the role of revived natural processes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re restoring it to its current potential,\u201d Forest Service fisheries biologist Matt Grove said. \u201cWe have to look at the stream we have now. We don\u2019t have the unaltered thing.\u201d\n\nThe plan incorporates post-war recreational uses of the area such as camping and skiing to backcountry huts that 10th Mountain Division war survivors built in memory of slain comrades. And it calls for state-of-the-art historical interpretation at sites around what became Camp Hale, which once had a population of 17,000.\n\nAll that remains of the camp are foundations of an ammunition depot, firing range, field house and a \u201cNazi village\u201d where recruits endured training scenarios of what military planners imagined they\u2019d face during combat. Asbestos and unexploded bombs still are spread around the watershed.\n\nWorld War II veterans initially bristled at ecological restoration, fearing it would erase too much of Camp Hale. The 10th Mountain Division\u2019s representative, Gary Burton, part of a 40-member planning group, conferred with veterans nationwide.\n\n\u201cSome just wanted the land left alone,\u201d Burton said. \u201cBut most said, \u2018It has performed its function for us. Let\u2019s preserve our history, but let\u2019s also put it back into some form of ecological function.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn 1845, Gen. John Fremont led explorers through the area, which then was rich in deer, elk, foxes, bears, songbirds and native trout. A government survey crew in 1873 set course for 14,009-foot Mount of the Holy Cross, towering over the Eagle River, and photographer William Jackson documented the beauty for the world.\n\nA railroad was built in 1881, and gold and silver miners followed. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt declared a Holy Cross Forest Reserve, trying to keep habitat untrammeled.\n\nBut after Japan\u2019s World War II attack on Pearl Harbor, U.S. leaders announced they\u2019d build a base in Colorado to train special new soldiers to fight Nazi forces in the European mountains. Recruits at Camp Hale learned to move through blizzards and scale cliffs. The 10th Mountain soldiers later played a key role in Italy dislodging of Nazi forces from Riva Ridge. The CIA later used the camp to train Tibetan fighters.\n\nBuilding the base, however, snuffed delicate wetlands. Songbirds and native trout vanished. Once-wild Eagle River headwaters, forced into a straight ditch, no longer formed pools. Willows disappeared. Nonnative yellow toadflax, Canadian thistle and musk thistle invaded, water temperatures spiked, stream banks eroded and wildlife diversity diminished from stone flies on up the food chain.\n\nA Forest Service notice last week launched a public-comment period on the project. Agency planners said reviews should be done by June 2016. Current plans say the project would not prevent water rights holders from developing new supplies for diversion to cities.\n\nAurora and Colorado Springs are exploring options for building a reservoir above re-engineered wetlands and possibly using underground aquifers to store water, Aurora Water spokesman Greg Baker said. Restoration of the wetlands could help water utilities offset environmental harm elsewhere by contributing to the project, he said, and timed releases from a reservoir could help sustain a remade valley.\n\nLocal landowner Lee Rimel, a planning group member, characterized the past 18 months of multiparty discussions as immensely cooperative.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an overall agreement that there will be a reservoir somewhere in that area,\u201d Rimel said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we re-establish the wetlands that existed before 1942 \u2014 because the habitat, as it is now, does not support natural native wildlife, fish or animal.\n\n\u201cThere are very few opportunities elsewhere with this kind of acreage readily available for restoration to native condition.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "$30 million may flow into Mountain Valley restoration project", "title": "$30 million may flow into Mountain Valley restoration project", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/28/30-million-may-flow-into-mountain-valley-restoration-project/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__20150329_B1_CDXXEAGLEVALLEY1p2.jpg", "height": 526}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__20150329_B1_CDXXEAGLEVALLEY1p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T18:16:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T16:11:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TENNESSEE PASS \u2014 Federal land managers have embarked on a $30 million project to remake a Colorado mountain valley that during World War II was transformed into an elite military training base.\nIf the project survives bureaucratic review and gets funding, it would rank among the nation\u2019s most ambitious feats of ecological restoration.\n\u201cThere are very few opportunities elsewhere with this kind of acreage readily available for restoration to native condition.\u201dBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce\nCurrent plans say the project would not prevent water rights holders from developing new supplies for diversion to cities.\nRestoration of the wetlands could help water utilities offset environmental harm elsewhere by contributing to the project, he said, and timed releases from a reservoir could help sustain a remade valley."}
