There aren\u2019t a lot of data yet\u2014and the facts that do exist are subject to more political spin than usual. Still, two casualty actuaries and a veteran medical malpractice underwriter were able to use demographic and health industry trends to predict how the medical malpractice world could change over the next decade.\n\nThey gave their forecasts at the Casualty Actuarial Society\u2019s Seminar on Reinsurance in New York, in a session titled, \u201cThe Impact of the Affordable Care Act on Medical Professional Liability \u2013 an Update.\u201d\n\nThrough early April, seven to eight million people had signed up for health care through insurance exchanges, noted Elke Kirsten-Brauer, executive vice president and chief underwriting officer of MGIS, -a leading national insurance program manager for medical professionals. She said about one-fourth did not have insurance before; within a few years, more than 22 million people will gain health insurance.\n\nThe mere presence of more insureds will increase the number of medical malpractice claims, Kirsten-Brauer said. Compounding the issue is the fact that they are largely unfamiliar with the health care system.\n\n\u201cThese are people who have never gone through the system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to educate them\u201d on matters that will seem trivial.\n\nAn example she shared: A patient visits a medical office for the first time. The patient is escorted to an examining room where a nurse checks her blood pressure and leaves. The patient thinks that is the end of the visit and goes home. The doctor never sees her.\n\nAbsent any help understanding the system, Kirsten-Brauer predicted, patients like that will be more likely to sue.\n\nAnother important trend: The doctor-patient relationship is becoming diluted. The old model of a single doctor diagnosing a patient\u2019s problem, then participating heavily at every step of treatment is giving way to expanded care teams.\n\nThis is best seen with a new sort of doctor: the hospitalist. As casualty actuary Kevin Bingham of Deloitte Consulting explained, the term was coined in 1996 and is just now coming into vogue. These are doctors who monitor the hospital stays of patients, a job that the patients\u2019 physician would have taken on in the past.\n\nThe hospitalist is part of the new paradigm, with some parts looking familiar but other less so. The physician still diagnoses outside the hospital, the surgeon still operates. But nurses are taking on larger roles in the doctor\u2019s office and the hospitalist picks up medical center duties. The physician re-enters for out-of-hospital follow-up.\n\nUnder this new model, patients are far less likely to be treated by a single professional. The series of professionals they move through are part of an accountable care organization, often referred to by the acronym ACO.\n\nThanks in large part to Affordable Care Act, ACOs are growing rapidly. Hospitals are buying small physician practices countrywide, hiring the doctors and nurses, and blending them all into ACOs.\n\nThe new model bears a new set of risks for medical malpractice insurers, Bingham said. There is no continuity of care, as patients are handed off from professional to professional. They lose the personal connection to the medical community.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how most med mal claims start,\u201d Bingham said, \u201cwith a loss of connection with the patient.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, as hospitals buy up practices, the market for med mal for physicians shrinks. The exposure shifts to the hospitals that employ them.\n\nHospitals, being much larger than a physicians\u2019 practice, will absorb more of that risk, said Brian Ingle, an executive vice president at Willis Re and Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society, leaving insurers to compete harder for malpractice premiums.\n\nMeanwhile, the ACO will standardize treatment methods. Usually the standardized method will be sound. Occasionally, Ingle noted, it will not be. Responsibility could trace back to the deep-pocketed hospital. Suddenly, med mal insurers could be facing a mass tort\u2014at an extreme, the \u201cnext asbestos\u201d the property/casualty industry dreads.\n\nIn response, Ingle said, insurers are considering expanding their medical malpractice coverage to handle exposures usually left to errors and omissions or directors and officers policies.\n\nWhile the ACA plays out, important demographic trends also will affect medical malpractice.\n\nAmericans are aging, as the baby boom generation reaches retirement age. Older patients often have more complaints, which translates into more care needs in an already overburdened system and an ever growing provider shortage.\n\nPhysicians are getting older, too, and want to enjoy a better work-life balance, moving down from a 60-hour work week to 45 or so.\n\nAmericans are getting heavier, leading to more cases of diabetes and more joint ailments like bad knees and hips.\n\nAll of these trends portend higher med mal exposures, Bingham pointed out.\n\nTaken together, the changes mean risk management is more important than ever, Kirsten-Brauer said. Insurers need to use data to promote quality and patient safety and satisfaction. They must adjust their knowledge of the past to meet the exposures of the future.\n\n\u201cWe need to train our underwriters and actuaries,\u201d she said, \u201cto challenge them to look at the actual risk exposure\u201d and not just rely on the tools of the past. We have to listen to our insureds to meet our challenges.\u201d\n\nSource: Casualty Actuarial Society", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together like", "og": {"site_name": "Claims Journal", "description": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together like", "title": "Actuaries Consider ACA Impact on Medical Malpractice Insurance", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/img/claimsjournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2014-06-12T13:03:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2014/06/12/250180.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together like", "title": "Actuaries Consider ACA Impact on Medical Malpractice Insurance", "image": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/img/claimsjournal-square.png", "creator": "@cjournal", "site": "@cjournal", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 76828913880}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/app/uploads/2015/12/cropped-claimsjournal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "medical malpractice", "published_time": "2014-06-12T08:15:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T13:03:22-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together likely effects at an insurance conference for actuaries in late-May in New York.\nStill, two casualty actuaries and a veteran medical malpractice underwriter were able to use demographic and health industry trends to predict how the medical malpractice world could change over the next decade.\nThe new model bears a new set of risks for medical malpractice insurers, Bingham said.\nThe mere presence of more insureds will increase the number of medical malpractice claims, Kirsten-Brauer said.\nWhile the ACA plays out, important demographic trends also will affect medical malpractice."}
