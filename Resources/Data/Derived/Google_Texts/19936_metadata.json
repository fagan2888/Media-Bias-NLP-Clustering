When a group of conservatives deputized by the lieutenant governor pinned the words \u201cGodless\u201d and \u201csocialistic\u201d to Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s pre-kindergarten plan, Abbott was quick to slap Dan Patrick\u2019s hand. That was the start to the general airing of grievances at last week\u2019s leadership breakfast in Austin.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to kill a piece of legislation just by calling it the wrong thing (or the right one, if you\u2019re the assassin). Try to gin up the votes in Texas for anything related to \u201cObamacare\u201d or \u201cslot machine\u201d or \u201cTrans-Texas Corridor.\u201d\n\nOr \u201cvouchers.\u201d\n\nThe new proposal in the Senate is a tax credit, backers say, and not the kind of voucher program that seems to merit automatic dismissal from lawmakers.\n\nAnd it is a tax credit. Senate Bill 4, approved by the Senate and now waiting for action from the House, includes a section that would let businesses count contributions to approved scholarship funds as credits against their state franchise tax. Those funds would be used to help pay private school tuition for qualified kids. That money would never be in state coffers. The state would never write a check to the private schools on behalf of those students. And it\u2019s not a classic voucher.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re taking money from a public school,\u201d said Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, when the legislation passed the Senate. \u201cThis is not a voucher bill.\u201d\n\nIt is, however, a mechanism for giving a state benefit to businesses that will subsidize the private school educations of kids who would otherwise be going to public schools. And those businesses are using money for the scholarships that would otherwise be state tax revenues; you can argue, as some do, that money that would be going to state purposes \u2014 schools, for instance \u2014 is instead finding its way to private schools.\n\nOthers, like Patrick, call it school choice, because it allows some families to choose private school over public school, including families without the financial means to do that without state or corporate help.\n\nRaise Your Hand Texas, an education advocacy group, opposes the bill, and semantics play a big role in its argument: \u201cNo matter what you call it, it\u2019s still vouchers,\u201d the group says in an online video attacking the proposal.\n\nThis whole idea is problematic for Texas lawmakers. Years of efforts to start voucher programs have failed, whether they were statewide in scope or just pilot programs. It went from a popular to unpopular idea quickly \u2014 particularly in some of the state\u2019s rural areas, where small school districts also serve as community centerpieces.\n\nIf you want to shoot down legislation that\u2019s getting money to private schools \u2014 whatever your reason \u2014 labeling it as a voucher program is a good start.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of money that doesn\u2019t go to the private sector,\u201d said Jeff Patterson, executive director of the Texas Catholic Conference. Patterson doesn\u2019t believe the tax credit proposal is a voucher program. In fact, his group has opposed straight-up voucher programs, which use taxpayer money to pay for private school tuition. In the tax credit program, no public money is used; instead, it diverts money that\u2019s on its way to public accounts into scholarships. The government gives a tax credit, but never touches the funds.\n\nThe legislation got out of the Senate on an 18-12 vote that fell mostly along party lines, and it\u2019s not clear that it would get out of the House \u2014 or even out of the Public Education Committee there \u2014 with or without the \u201cvoucher\u201d label. Abbott told Patrick in that breakfast meeting last week that he didn\u2019t want his pre-K bill\u2019s fortunes tied to other legislation \u2014 like the school choice proposal.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell whether opponents use the label because they want to kill it, because they just don\u2019t like it, or both. It obviously hurts.\n\nPatterson thinks it\u2019s pejorative, and he has been making the rounds with lawmakers and news reporters trying to make a distinction between the tax credit program and a straight-up voucher program.\n\n\u201cAt least the opponents should call this what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re using the term as a dirty word.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Raise Your Hand Texas is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
