That has created opportunities for some of the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees and displaced Iraqis who have sought refuge here.\n\n\u201cThe Kurdish girls are a bit conservative \u2014 no, a lot conservative,\u201d Abdullah said as she organized boxes of Middle Eastern sweets made of spun sugar, fruit, pistachio nuts and honey. \u201cTheir logic is that the women never have to work, they only have to go to school and then return home.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s civil war, now in its fifth year, has killed more than 220,000 people and created nearly 4 million refugees, according to the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are languishing in camps, relying on international aid or struggling to support themselves in host countries where jobs are scarce.\n\nBut in Iraq\u2019s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, where a quarter of a million Syrians are living among 5 million Iraqis, refugee women like Abdullah have found decent work.\n\nShe gets paid around $500 a month \u2014 five times what she says she would make in Damascus \u2014 to work at Family Mall, a vast shopping mall in the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil. Down the gleaming corridor from her sweets shop are stores selling familiar Western brands like Timberland and Clarks, and a branch of the French hypermarket chain Carrefour.\n\nThe mall was built in 2010 when the region was booming on promises of oil wealth that have yet to be realized. The Kurdish region has struggled to fully exploit its resources because of longstanding disputes with the central government in Baghdad, and since last summer Kurdish forces have been battling the Islamic State group, which came within 35 kilometers (22 miles) of Irbil last August.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Iraqi malls, Syrian women work jobs spurned by locals", "title": "In Iraqi malls, Syrian women work jobs spurned by locals", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Iraqi malls, Syrian women work jobs spurned by locals", "title": "In Iraqi malls, Syrian women work jobs spurned by locals", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/in_iraqi_malls_syrian_women_work_jobs_spurned_by_locals/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/mideast-iraq-syrian-women-workers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Iraqi malls, Syrian women work jobs spurned by locals", "title": "In Iraqi malls, Syrian women work jobs spurned by locals", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/mideast-iraq-syrian-women-workers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bram Janssen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaee1\"", "article_summary": "But in Iraq\u2019s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, where a quarter of a million Syrians are living among 5 million Iraqis, refugee women like Abdullah have found decent work.\nWhile the mall job is a rite of passage for teenagers in America, in Iraq\u2019s conservative and relatively well-off Kurdish region the idea of women working \u2014 particularly in menial or retail jobs \u2014 is frowned upon.\nThat has created opportunities for some of the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees and displaced Iraqis who have sought refuge here.\nThe mall was built in 2010 when the region was booming on promises of oil wealth that have yet to be realized.\n\u201cThe Kurdish girls are a bit conservative \u2014 no, a lot conservative,\u201d Abdullah said as she organized boxes of Middle Eastern sweets made of spun sugar, fruit, pistachio nuts and honey."}
