File/Grace Beahm/staff\n\nAs last-minute negotiations between Medical University Hospital and South Carolina\u2019s largest private health insurance company have seemingly stalled, Nikki Colwell doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll turn for treatment for her cystic fibrosis come Friday.\n\nThe 27-year-old Columbia woman currently receives all her health care through a specialty clinic at MUSC, but her new BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina plan, which kicks in on Jan. 1, won\u2019t cover any services at the Charleston hospital.\n\nColwell, who is insured by Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan through Thursday, was hopeful that her new insurance provider would work out some sort of agreement with MUSC that would allow her to continue treatment there. Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan announced in October that it will close this week and no longer offer health insurance coverage in South Carolina.\n\nEleven other health insurance cooperatives set up under the Affordable Care Act also failed this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very stressful,\u201d Colwell said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good and it\u2019s the end of the year.\u201d\n\nSome 67,000 South Carolinians are covered by Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan, and 4,500 of them receive health care services at MUSC. Many of these patients have been diagnosed with serious conditions, including cancer, cirrhosis and \u2014 like Colwell \u2014 cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that generates thick mucus in her lungs, making it difficult to breathe.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, Consumers\u2019 Choice was the only insurance plan on HealthCare.gov that covered services at MUSC. Now, Colwell can\u2019t find a single policy that will.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem other patients are facing, too. MUSC is the only hospital in South Carolina that even offers some of these specialty health care services.\n\nMUSC spokeswoman Heather Woolwine said Tuesday that BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina recently made the hospital an offer to cover specialty care and emergency care for patients formerly covered by Consumers\u2019 Choice. She said MUSC agreed to the insurance company\u2019s terms, but the deal hasn\u2019t been signed by either party and the negotiations may still fall through.\n\n\u201cWe have since followed up with them several times to finalize that agreement,\u201d Woolwine said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe were most recently told they would no longer do single-case agreements (which they had started doing) because it was \u2018getting out of hand.\u2019 At this time, we are unsure if BCBS has any plans to make provisions for patients needing specialty care only available at MUSC for 2016.\u201d\n\nPatti Embry-Tautenhan, a spokeswoman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, responded in a prepared statement:\n\n\u201cThe exit of Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan is unquestionably creating disruption in the marketplace. Nevertheless, its departure does not change our provider network. While MUSC is not in the exchange network, we do have a well-established provider network in whom we have great confidence and believe more than adequately meets the needs of members. Moreover, it is also important to note that emergency care services have always been covered regardless of network status.\u201d\n\nThese negotiations only affect BlueCross BlueShield patients who have purchased coverage through the federal health insurance marketplace or a individual plan purchased directly from the insurance company. For example, beneficiaries covered by BlueCross BlueShield through their employer may continue to use MUSC if the hospital is included in that network.\n\nDr. Patrick Flume treats 170 adult cystic fibrosis patients at the specialty clinic at MUSC. He estimates that 10 of them are covered by Consumers\u2019 Choice until the end of the year. He said he\u2019s worried what will happen in January.\n\n\u201cThey will end up in the hospital,\u201d Flume said.\n\nOther South Carolina hospitals only specialize in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients, he said.\n\n\u201cThese insurance companies need to recognize this is a service (the patients) can\u2019t get anywhere else.\u201d\n\nFlume, who treats Colwell, told her not to stress about all this too much \u2014 stress can make her condition worse \u2014 but she said she\u2019s having trouble thinking about anything else.\n\nColwell and her twin sister already attempted to find help for their cystic fibrosis symptoms closer to home, without much success.\n\n\u201cWe both had infections in our lungs, but they couldn\u2019t be identified,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody in Columbia could tell us what was wrong with us. We spent over a year wasting our money on all these different doctors.\u201d\n\nColwell has an appointment set up at MUSC in January. She may need to cancel it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go because I can\u2019t afford to go there out of pocket,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 843-937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Consumers\u2019 Choice patients caught up in hospital, insurance company negotiations, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina,Consumers' Choice,MUSC", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "As last-minute negotiations between Medical University Hospital and South Carolina\u2019s largest private health insurance company have seemingly stalled, Nikki Colwell doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll turn for treatment for her cystic fibro", "title": "Consumers\u2019 Choice patients caught up in hospital, insurance company negotiations", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151229/151229405/consumers-x2019-choice-patients-caught-up-in-hospital-insurance-company-negotiations", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151229/PC16/151229405/AR/0/AR-151229405.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151229/PC16/151229405/AR/0/AR-151229405.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As last-minute negotiations between Medical University Hospital and South Carolina\u2019s largest private health insurance company have seemingly stalled, Nikki Colwell doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll turn for treatment for her cystic fibro", "title": "Consumers\u2019 Choice patients caught up in hospital, insurance company negotiations", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151229/PC16/151229405/AR/0/AR-151229405.jpg?201512292046", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151229405}}, "keywords": "Consumers\u2019 Choice patients caught up in hospital, insurance company negotiations , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina,Consumers' Choice,MUSC", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-29T17:26:44Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-29T20:46:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "As last-minute negotiations between Medical University Hospital and South Carolina\u2019s largest private health insurance company have seemingly stalled, Nikki Colwell doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll turn for treatment for her cystic fibro"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4520\"", "article_summary": "Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan announced in October that it will close this week and no longer offer health insurance coverage in South Carolina.\nIn 2014 and 2015, Consumers\u2019 Choice was the only insurance plan on HealthCare.gov that covered services at MUSC.\nHe estimates that 10 of them are covered by Consumers\u2019 Choice until the end of the year.\nEleven other health insurance cooperatives set up under the Affordable Care Act also failed this year.\nFile/Grace Beahm/staffAs last-minute negotiations between Medical University Hospital and South Carolina\u2019s largest private health insurance company have seemingly stalled, Nikki Colwell doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll turn for treatment for her cystic fibrosis come Friday."}
