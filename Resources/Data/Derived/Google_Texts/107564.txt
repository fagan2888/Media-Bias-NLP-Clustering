But the dealership took exception, and fought back:

It probably seemed like a good idea at the time, for the United Brotherhood Of Carpenters And Joiners Of America Local 201 to put up a sign reading, “Shame on Subaru of Wichita” in front of a car dealer that had the audacity to accept the lowest qualified bid when putting up some wallboard while undertaking a $1.5 million renovation. The contractor chosen was nonunion.

Face it: unions have lostg the moral high ground. They are now seen as mostly greedy, thuggish organizations, out for themselves and nobody else.

Excuse me, but I am offended when our nation’s flag is depicted as rat food.

The union went a couple of steps too far when it posted this union flyer on its website :

The result has been an outpouring of comment on Twitter that can’t be pleasing to the union bosses. Twitchy has a round-up
