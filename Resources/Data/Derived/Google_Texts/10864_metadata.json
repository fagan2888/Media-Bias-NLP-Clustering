The cuts are meant to help bring down prices for customers and reduce costs overall as the company also invests in technology upgrades, according to a Whole Foods SEC filing.\n\nRelated: The 15 Worst Supermarkets in America in 2015\n\nThe layoff announcement comes just a week after PETA filed a lawsuit that alleges the grocer\u2019s attempts to monitor how its meat suppliers treat their animals are a \u201csham\u201d and customers are being duped into paying higher prices for meat that comes from farms that barely meet industry standards.\n\nWhole Foods has spent the past few years trying to shed its \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d image. The PETA lawsuit won\u2019t help in that regard, and it follows another massive setback in Whole Foods\u2019 attempts to repair its tarnished reputation. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs\u2019 found a few months ago that the chain was severely and systematically overcharging for prepackaged foods, using labels that listed incorrect weights. Some examples included vegetable platters that were overpriced by $2.50 on average (one by $6.50) and chicken tenders overpriced by an average of $4.13.\n\nThe overpricing controversy led to a federal lawsuit that was filed last month, claiming the company\u2019s top executives duped shareholders and inflated the company\u2019s value. Co-CEOs John Mackey and Walter Robb have admitted that overcharging did occur in some instances, but they denied that it was intentional or that the violations were systematic.\n\nRelated: The 25 Supermarket Products Americans Buy the Most\n\nIt might be a while before the company is able to regain customers\u2019 trust. Because of the overpricing scandal, now it\u2019ll be \u201cincreasingly difficult given the negative media attention,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Short told Supermarket News. \u201cIn fact, in the near term, Whole Foods may not get credit for any price reductions, given its tarnished image.\u201d\n\nWFM data by YCharts\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40 percent over the past six months, after a number of quarterly earnings disappointments. The grocer is also facing increased competition from specialty grocers, such as Trader Joe\u2019s, and traditional supermarkets, including Kroger\u2019s, that are expanding their organic food selection.\n\n\u201cIf trust is broken, it has to be rebuilt a step at a time,\u201d Co-CEO Robb told analysts in July. The 1,500 layoffs are meant to be another step toward luring back customers with lower prices, but Whole Foods likely still has a long path ahead of it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This has been a rough year for Whole Foods, and the latest news from the grocery chain", "title": "Why Whole Foods Is Facing a Whole Lot of Problems", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/28/Why-Whole-Foods-Facing-Whole-Lot-Problems", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Whole-Foods-Market.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/28/Why-Whole-Foods-Facing-Whole-Lot-Problems", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Whole-Foods-Market.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "This has been a rough year for Whole Foods, and the latest news from the grocery chain", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The PETA lawsuit won\u2019t help in that regard, and it follows another massive setback in Whole Foods\u2019 attempts to repair its tarnished reputation.\nRelated: The 25 Supermarket Products Americans Buy the MostIt might be a while before the company is able to regain customers\u2019 trust.\nWhole Foods has spent the past few years trying to shed its \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d image.\nThis has been a rough year for Whole Foods, and the latest news from the grocery chain suggests times won\u2019t be getting better anytime soon.\nThe 1,500 layoffs are meant to be another step toward luring back customers with lower prices, but Whole Foods likely still has a long path ahead of it."}
