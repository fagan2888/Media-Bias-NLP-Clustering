Twenty-five years.

552 episodes (and a movie).

$12 billion (that’s with a “B”) annually in merchandising.

There is no question that The Simpsons is one of - if not THE - behemoth of pop culture. Beloved internationally as a vicious mirror on American society, it is beloved domestically for the same reason.
