The only problem: Bass directed his 300,000 Twitter followers to the wrong website. He linked to a private website, Healthcare.org rather than the government-run exchange, Healthcare.gov.\n\n@LanceBass/Twitter\n\nUpon realizing the error, which was quickly pointed out to Bass on Twitter, he deleted the original tweet and reposted his photo:\n\nBrain fart!!
