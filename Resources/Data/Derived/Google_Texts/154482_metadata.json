They include getting married, losing job-based coverage, or giving birth. Becoming pregnant is not one of those reasons.\n\nIn their letter to Covered California on Wednesday, Feinstein and Boxer asked Covered California to add pregnancy to the list.\n\n\"Especially since having a child is a qualifying life event, it makes sense to ensure that access to care is granted prior to birth,\" the senators wrote.\n\nA Covered California spokesman said the agency is evaluating the senators' request.\n\nNicole Evans, a spokeswoman for the California Association of Health Plans, said granting the request could drive insurance costs up for everyone else.\n\n\"The goal is for all Americans to have coverage and if we start to provide exceptions for people to wait to get coverage until they have a need, you could be undermining the goals of the Affordable Care Act,\" Evans said.\n\nThat argument echoes one made by health plans nationally, as advocates have increased pressure on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to make a similar allowance for pregnant women to buy coverage through the federal marketplace.\n\nThough no decisions have been made, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell has said her agency is open to considering the issue.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Current rules allow women to buy coverage outside of open enrollment if they're giving birth, but not when they become pregnant.", "title": "Feinstein and Boxer: Let pregnant women buy health coverage anytime", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/03/11/50314/feinstein-and-boxer-ask-covered-california-to-let/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/55fbe15455c54d2ce5c0cf6f1a5d8186/45251-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 687}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
