News4's Scott MacFarlane reports. (Published Thursday, Jan. 1, 2015)\n\nWashington, D.C.-area public school districts have deployed more than 30,000 surveillance cameras inside school buildings, according to a review of security records by News4.\n\nThe rapid increase in camera usage \u2013 at least 1,300 were installed in recent months \u2013 comes in the wake of school shootings in other regions and concerns about student safety.\n\nThe cameras offer video footage for use in solving crimes or investigating security incidents inside buildings.\n\nBut the images have grown too numerous to regularly monitor by security staffs, the News4 review showed.\n\nNBC Washington's 25 Most-Clicked Stories of 2014\n\nSchool Security Cameras:\n\nD.C. Public Schools: 6,100\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools: 5,500\n\nLoudoun County Public Schools: 3,000\n\nHoward County Public Schools: 1,300\n\nFrederick County Public Schools: 1,200\n\nMontgomery County Public Schools: 5,000\n\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools: 6,000\n\nFairfax County Public Schools: 1,250\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools installed hundreds of new cameras in the past 12 months, a school official told News4.\n\n\u201cSchools can monitor the cameras from the school and we can monitor them from our central security office,\u201d spokesman Max Pugh said.\n\nMontgomery County Public Schools, which now has 5,000 cameras deployed in school buildings, also uses a central security hub to monitor the cameras\u2019 images. Inside the security hub, located inside the district\u2019s administrative office in Rockville, Maryland, security staffers can open and view live footage of any of its cameras with a click of a mouse.\n\n\u201cThis is something we planned, when we wired our buildings,\u201d Montgomery County Public Schools Security Director Bob Hellmuth said. \u201cWe wired them for the maximum number of cameras we could put in.\u201d\n\nD.C. Public Schools, which uses 6,100 security cameras, according to the News4 review, shares its camera images with the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n\u201cDCPS centrally monitors alarms and security cameras in partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department from a central security command center,\u201d DCPS spokeswoman Melissa Salmanowitz said.\n\nThe costs of cameras to local taxpayers are offset, in part, by government grant money. Hellmuth said recent school shootings nationwide sped the delivery of government grant funding for the purchase and installation of cameras.\n\nHellmuth acknowledged cameras are now too numerous for his staff to regularly monitor.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things we use a camera for, but it's not our primary security initiative,\u201d he said.\n\nJamison Adcock, an Aspen Hill resident who lives near an elementary school building, said school districts mustn\u2019t become overly reliant on camera equipment.\n\n\u201cI don't think it's going to prevent things,\u201d Adcock said. \u201cWe'd like to have people watching the cameras or on the ground (in the buildings).\"\n\nLoudoun County Public Schools, which has deployed about 3,000 cameras, is one of several local districts that deploy police officers, or school resource officers, inside school buildings.\n\n\u201cLoudoun County Public Schools have a strong partnership with all law enforcement partners and encourage their presence in and around the school environment,\u201c spokesman Wayde Byard said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington, D.C.-area public school districts have deployed more than 30,000 surveillance cameras inside school buildings, according to a review of security records by News4.", "title": "30,000 Surveillance Cameras Monitor D.C.-Area Public Schools", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4 Washington", "description": "Washington, D.C.-area public school districts have deployed more than 30,000 surveillance cameras inside school buildings, according to a review of security records by News4.", "title": "30K Cameras Monitor D.C.-Area Schools", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/30000-Surveillance-Cameras-Monitor-DC-Area-Public-Schools-287297041.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/school+surveillance+camera+010115.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington, D.C.-area public school districts have deployed more than 30,000 surveillance cameras inside school buildings, according to a review of security records by News4.", "title": "30K Cameras Monitor D.C.-Area Schools", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/30000-Surveillance-Cameras-Monitor-DC-Area-Public-Schools-287297041.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/school+surveillance+camera+010115.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcwashington", "site": "@nbcwashington", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 168641655540}, "keywords": "local news, washington dc news, maryland news, northern virginia news, breaking news, northwest washington, rockville, prince george's county, fairfax county, montgomery county, arlington county, metro, wmata, dc, nova, va, md", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcwashington"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfb0\"", "article_summary": "NBC Washington's 25 Most-Clicked Stories of 2014School Security Cameras:D.C.
