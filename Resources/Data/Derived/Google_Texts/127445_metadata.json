This is usually done in a well-marketed newspaper editorial or a speech at a think tank. We\u2019re seeing a flurry of politicians Laying Out Their Foreign Policy Visions right now, because some big foreign policy events are in the news and the myopic thinking is that 2016 will be a Foreign Policy Election. Well, probably not. People will forget about ISIS and Ukraine in short order and kitchen-table issues like \u201chaving no money\u201d will return(?) to dominate voters\u2019 minds.\n\nLaying Out a Foreign Policy Vision allows someone who hasn\u2019t spoken up much about foreign policy, or never knew much about it in the first place, to show off one\u2019s deep knowledge of international affairs, having been tutored by lobbyists and political consultants. To show that they\u2019ve got a firm grasp of this stuff. Think of Karl Rove teaching George W. Bush all of those foreign leaders\u2019 name, and him just rattling them off one after the other. That\u2019s when America knew it could trust George W. Bush to make wise foreign policy decisions.\n\nGovernor Rick Perry of Texas, now bespectacled, wizened, and ready to manage the United States government\u2019s foreign assets, laid out his foreign policy vision in an op-ed this summer. Senator Ted Cruz, of government-shutdown, anti-Obamacare fame, laid out his foreign policy vision recently and intends to run a presidential campaign centered on international affairs. And this week, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal \u2014 a looney toon who a few stray humans think could be a viable presidential candidate in 2016 \u2014 laid out his foreign policy vision in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe problem with these speeches, op-eds, and \u201cpositioning\u201d opportunities on the Republican side is that all of the Laid Out Foreign Policy Visions policies are more or less the exact same: hawkish. They want to bomb people, they want to increase the military budget, Obama is weak, Hillary Clinton is weak, our enemies pounce on weakness, bomb bomb bomb, Ronald Reagan. \u201cLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal argued for a stronger military defense and railed against both the president and secretary of state,\u201d MSNBC reports, \u201cin an address that positioned the Republican as a war hawk ahead of 2016\u2019s presidential election.\u201d You don\u2019t say?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana governor is latest presidential possibility to \"lay out his foreign policy vision.\" Hint: it's hawkish", "author": "Jim Newell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Louisiana governor is latest presidential possibility to \"lay out his foreign policy vision.\" Hint: it's hawkish", "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s foreign policy farce: Inside a dopey pre-presidential routine", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/08/bobby_jindals_foreign_policy_farce_inside_a_dopey_pre_presidential_routine/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/bobby_jindal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana governor is latest presidential possibility to \"lay out his foreign policy vision.\" Hint: it's hawkish", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/bobby_jindal.jpg", "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s foreign policy farce: Inside a dopey pre-presidential routine", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s foreign policy farce: Inside a dopey pre-presidential routine", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 election, Bobby Jindal, bombs, Editor's Picks, Foreign policy, GOP, hawks, Louisiana, Middle East, Ted Cruz, The Right, War", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda08\"", "article_summary": "They want to bomb people, they want to increase the military budget, Obama is weak, Hillary Clinton is weak, our enemies pounce on weakness, bomb bomb bomb, Ronald Reagan.\nWe\u2019re seeing a flurry of politicians Laying Out Their Foreign Policy Visions right now, because some big foreign policy events are in the news and the myopic thinking is that 2016 will be a Foreign Policy Election.\nLaying Out a Foreign Policy Vision allows someone who hasn\u2019t spoken up much about foreign policy, or never knew much about it in the first place, to show off one\u2019s deep knowledge of international affairs, having been tutored by lobbyists and political consultants.\nThat\u2019s when America knew it could trust George W.
