The social hall was full of concerned individuals, including residents, family members, Keiro volunteers, and community activists. The crowd was a predominantly senior crowd.\n\nThere was an overwhelming sense of fear, anger and confusion in the room. An unspoken tenseness and helplessness, like the evacuation photographs lining the walls of the Japanese American National Museum. An abandoned people.\n\nThe Keiro management, under the leadership of President and CEO Shawn Miyake, and with the support of the Keiro Board of Directors, has entered into a conditional agreement to sell the facilities to Pacifica Companies LLC for $41 million. (Or, by one financial metric, $67,000 per head multiplied by 615 beds.)\n\nIn reviewing the documents provided to the state attorney general, it\u2019s a great deal for Pacifica, which already plans to outsource management of the Keiro facilities to two firms. Each firm will pay a monthly ground lease to Pacifica. Pacifica can place debt on the real estate while financing the acquisition based on the ground lease revenue generated by each facility.\n\nAs they say in the business, \u201cgreat upside potential for growth\u201d (i.e., greater revenue through increasing fees and rental rates). And it\u2019s likely that at some point in the future, Pacifica will sell out its interests to another firm, perhaps a real estate investment trust or fund manager for a pension fund with billions of dollars ready to deploy to acquire healthcare facilities on the West Coast.\n\nConcurrently, plans are already in the works for the \u201cNew Keiro\u201d to open offices in the medical office building located at Third and San Pedro streets.\n\nAssuming an annual 5% return on a portfolio composed of the net proceeds of $37 million, or $1.85 million, the \u201cNew Keiro\u201d will provide Mr. Miyake and those other fortunate senior staff members and board members with a sinecure, a stable stream of income, to support salaries, benefits, perks, executive offices, company cars \u2026 free of operating Keiro facilities or caring for elderly residents.\n\nWhile Mr. Miyake and the Keiro Board trumpet the deal as a great accomplishment, the contrasting feelings at the public forum were akin to the death of a loved one. No one was buying into the Keiro press release spin. Just the opposite.\n\nThere were many, many questions aired into a vacuum of silence. Mr. Miyake says in his Rafu Shimpo interview, \u201cIt\u2019s on the website.\u201d In response to requests for answers, Keiro management, rather than being welcoming, open and transparent, has taken on an adversarial and secretive posture.\n\nWhy? When did the relationship between Keiro leadership and the community decline into \u201cus versus them?\u201d\n\nIs there an assumption by Keiro leadership that a senior care operator from outside of our community can do a better job of taking care of our senior citizens? Had Keiro leadership exhausted every possible option before choosing, what many believe, is a step taken only if the corporation is on the verge of bankruptcy?\n\nEveryone knows that the cost of everything is subject to market fluctuations. Whether it\u2019s a loaf of bread, a cup of coffee or a gallon of gasoline, pricing is variable. This is especially true in the healthcare industry.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely no surprise that rising healthcare costs, combined with the reduction in Medicare and Medi-Cal reimbursements, have widened the financial gap between revenues and expenses. Fundraising via the annual dinner, golf tournaments or other donations barely covered the shortfall before the implementation of Obamacare. Apparently, the gap has now become a chasm.\n\nHowever, did Keiro management ever have an open discussion with the residents and family members about how the Keiro family could collectively cover the costs? Were price hikes ever instituted? If not, why not?\n\nWhile the Keiro/Pacifica deal may meet certain legal requirements under the state attorney general\u2019s conditional approval, the ethical and moral obligations of this decision impose a higher standard on the Keiro management and board. Most community members cited that access to the attorney general\u2019s Keiro file was difficult if not impossible to obtain, thereby greatly reducing any public input during the public comment period. (And, no, the files were not uploaded on the Keiro website.)\n\nOne could argue that the original intent of the founders of Keiro was to provide a safe and peaceful place for our Nikkei seniors to live out their golden years. Generations of Nikkei entrusted the care and welfare of their beloved family members to Keiro.\n\nThese same families have also provided the base of support for the hundreds of volunteers who donate their time, talents, funds and energies to ensure that Keiro truly honors our elders as they age, grow frail and pass away.\n\nDoes an implied moral and social contract exist that requires the Keiro management to either maintain the current facilities for the residents or provide new facilities in suburban areas such as the South Bay, the Valley, Orange County or Ventura County?\n\nIn a different scenario, let\u2019s say that the Keiro Board announced the sale of the old facilities. The net proceeds would go towards the purchase of new facilities and cover the relocation costs for all the residents. Under these conditions, the residents would see an upgrade in their living conditions and the general community would likely wholly support such a move.\n\nOr, in another hypothetical scenario, the Keiro Board holds an open community meeting. Mr. Miyake states, \u201c\u7533\u3057\u8a33\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002We are truly sorry. As you know, we\u2019ve implemented pricing hikes, we\u2019ve spun off some of our four facilities with great regret, we\u2019ve economized, we\u2019ve done everything possible to keep Keiro operations going. On behalf of the Keiro Board, I wish to thank everyone for their hard work and best efforts. We have tried our best.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is with great sadness that we have to announce that we are unable to sustain current operations. Yet, because Keiro Senior Health Care truly cares for each one of you and your family members, we promise to help each of our residents to find other facilities in the area, pay for your move and negotiate an agreement to ensure that your costs are kept within your ability to pay.\u201d\n\nWhile painful, the Keiro community would completely understand that every possible step had been taken by all hands to ensure the survival of the institution. Then, \u201cshikata ga nai.\u201d People would understand.\n\nWe have to believe that if Keiro leadership openly and clearly communicated both the financial challenges, laid out a clear path of action and gained a consensus from the residents and the community, we would not be faced with this current crisis of leadership.\n\nPerhaps, the reason why the Keiro Board has been playing \u201chide and seek\u201d with the community is their knowledge that, while the deal itself may be legal, the reasons for the sale fail to meet the moral and ethical obligations owed to the Keiro residents and family members.\n\nBack in the days when my maternal grandfather, Dr. Kikuwo Tashiro, worked out of the Japanese Hospital of Los Angeles located in Boyle Heights or out of his medical offices in Gardena, I heard many stories of how some of his patients, too poor to pay for his medical services, brought gifts of fruits, vegetables, fish and eggs.\n\nTypically, like other old-school doctors, he would either accept the gifts or wave them off, telling them next time would be fine. Everyone helped each other. From tanomoshi investment clubs to koden at funerals, the community pulled together.\n\nThose Issei and Nisei doctors would be absolutely shocked and appalled to see how Keiro Senior HealthCare, the successor to the Japanese Hospital and City View Hospital, has now \u201ccommoditized\u201d and monetized the elderly, taking the proceeds and leaving the residents behind.\n\nWhat will happen after the five-year \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d expires? It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see the writing on the wall. After all, the buyer is a for-profit corporation. If residents cannot pay the market rate for healthcare, an eviction notice will be forthcoming. We all know that Medi-Cal/Medicare reimbursements are insufficient to cover costs. Is the ultimate solution to cut them all loose?\n\nFor those elderly residents who have no living family members or children, what happens next? Is that when that 90-year-old senior whips out his/her smartphone from the wheelchair and clicks on the Keiro \u201cUmbrella of Care\u201d app? What about that $41 million? Any of that cash set aside as a reserve to cover any future resident funding shortfalls?\n\nMr. Miyake and the board have created their own \u201ccredibility gap\u201d with the community they\u2019ve been entrusted with protecting. Can Keiro management convince a mistrustful and skeptical audience that this deal is truly in everyone\u2019s best interest, while they see Mr. Miyake and a select few making off in a $41 million \u201clifeboat\u201d and abandoning a sinking S.S. Keiro?\n\nThe audience may be respectful and restrained for now; however, as the clock ticks down, questioners are stonewalled by legal counsel\u2019s talking points, and the probability of the deal closing grows near, frustration will lead to anger and community action.\n\nIf the deal closes in its current form, the event should be memorialized by a new term.\n\nInstead of \u201cKeiro no Hi\u201d (\u656c\u8001\u306e\u65e5) or \u201cRespect the Elderly Day,\u201d how about \u201cOyasute no Hi\u201d (\u89aa\u6368\u3066\u306e\u65e5) or \u201cAbandon the Elderly Day\u201d?\n\nIn ancient Japan, during times of famine, some villages took their elderly deep into the mountains or to a desolate place and left them there to die of starvation, dehydration or from exposure to the elements.\n\nMr. Miyake, how do you respond?\n\n\u2014\n\nJon Kaji is president of Kaji & Associates, a real estate firm based in Gardena.
