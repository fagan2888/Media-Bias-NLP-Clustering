And while Fazio admits that one of the toughest hurdles to overcome is the equally obstinate, if not reflexive, law and order theme that floats about the state, this is also a two-pronged conversation. Texas is a border state and the level of violence here from not \u201cjust\u201d domestic assaults on the War on Drugs, but federal soldiers enforcing international borders and laws caused by just the war on cannabis is one of the most enduringly bloody in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I am so passionate about what I\u2019m doing with moving drug reform forward is because of the absolutely devastating violence that we are seeing on the border because of the illegal drug trade,\u201d says Fazio. \u201cThe cartels are very, very obviously willing to secure their hold on profits using extreme violence which will continue unless legalization occurs. That will allow Texas farmers and Texas entrepreneurs to provide a product we know there is a market for -- Texas patients - of whom veterans are a huge community.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "The Lone Star State says you ain't seen nothin' yet with regard to pot legalization.", "author": "Marguerite Arnold", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "The Lone Star State says you ain't seen nothin' yet with regard to pot legalization.", "title": "Texas Puts Marijuana Reform on Legislative Agenda for 2015", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/texas-puts-marijuana-reform-on-legislative-agenda-for-2015", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana101-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana101-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "weed, marijuana, personal finance, texas, texas mpp, fazio, marijuana reform, medical marijuana", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "medical marijuana", "published_time": "2014-10-13T17:34Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1610774"}, "date": "2014-10-13T17:34Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 12912143, "twitter": {"description": "The Lone Star State says you ain't seen nothin' yet with regard to pot legalization.", "title": "Texas Puts Marijuana Reform on Legislative Agenda for 2015", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/texas-puts-marijuana-reform-on-legislative-agenda-for-2015", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana101-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana101-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "weed, marijuana, personal finance, texas, texas mpp, fazio, marijuana reform, medical marijuana"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1874\"", "article_summary": "That will allow Texas farmers and Texas entrepreneurs to provide a product we know there is a market for -- Texas patients - of whom veterans are a huge community.\u201d\nAccording to Heather Fazio, the new Texas political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, \u201cMedical marijuana will get an excellent hearing.\u201d The fact that significant reform bills are already slated for discussion when the State Legislature reconvenes in early 2015 is one significant sign of this.\nThe political coalition that she is part of as much as forming right now also reflects the strong libertarian streak Texas is known for.\n\u201cThe cartels are very, very obviously willing to secure their hold on profits using extreme violence which will continue unless legalization occurs.\n\u201cOne of the reasons I am so passionate about what I\u2019m doing with moving drug reform forward is because of the absolutely devastating violence that we are seeing on the border because of the illegal drug trade,\u201d says Fazio."}
