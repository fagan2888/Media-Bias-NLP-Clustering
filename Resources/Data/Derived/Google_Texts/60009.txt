With the Iowa caucuses just over a week away, another top Republican in the state appears to have snubbed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas: Sen. Charles E. Grassley.



Grassley, who has represented Iowa in the Senate for 3 1/2 decades, showed up Saturday at a Donald Trump rally at Central College here in central Iowa. Grassley introduced the New York billionaire and repeated Trump's campaign slogan but stopped short of endorsing him.

“We have an opportunity once again to make America great again,” Grassley told Trump’s audience.

Like Iowa’s popular Republican governor, Terry Branstad, Grassley has faulted Cruz for opposing government support of ethanol, the fuel made from corn that is a major part of the state's agriculture industry.

Grassley is also expected to introduce another Republican presidential candidate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, at a rally next week, according to his campaign.

Cruz, an unpopular figure among fellow Senate Republicans, told reporters Saturday that he was “a big fan of Chuck Grassley.”

“He’s a friend of mine,” Cruz said at a campaign stop in Ankeny. “He and I have worked side by side on a number of significant pieces of legislation.”
