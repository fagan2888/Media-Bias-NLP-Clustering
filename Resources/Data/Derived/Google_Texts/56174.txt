A setback Monday night for one town in the fight to get back a local hospital.

The mayor and his supporters asked for a loan from county commissioners, but the request was denied.

Belhaven Mayor Adam O'Neal says he went before the Beaufort County Board of Commissioners to request a $643,000 loan to gain imminent domain over the former Vidant Pungo Hospital. Vidant Health closed the hospital on July 1, 2014.

O'Neal also asked for a $22,000 building re-use grant, promising to creating 55 jobs with the opening of the hospital.

Commissioner Hood Richardson made a motion to approve the request, but that motion was never seconded and therefore never voted on.

Mayor O'Neal says they will continue to look for money to get the hospital back open.

"Beaufort County Commissioners sometimes forgets that Belhaven is a part of Beaufort County," says O'Neal. "We are Beaufort County taxpayers and citizens in this area, and we have no representation right now on that board."

County Commissioner Robert Belcher told WITN over the phone that he felt there were too many unanswered questions. Since the hospital doesn't belong to the county, he says taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it.
