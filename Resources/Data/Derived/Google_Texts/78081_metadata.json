It uses cross-training such as martial arts, yoga and weight training in addition to a diet plan. These types of high-intensity interval training are aimed mostly for people who are already fit and are looking for something more challenging. Workouts usually take less than 30 minutes to complete. These types of programs are popular due to the short time interval, but also have high injury rates.\n\nIn its eighth year of completing this survey, the American College of Sports Medicine asked over 3,800 fitness professionals working in clinical, commercial and corporate gyms what the top 20 fitness trends would be for the next year. They could choose out of 38 choices, and were made sure to understand the distinction between a fad and a trend. The survey defined a trend as \u201ca general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, popular fitness trends included mud runs and obstacle races like the Tough Mudder and Spartan Race, which include wall climbing, crawling through mud, and wading through ice cold water. Zumba, a form of dance workout, has been popular in recent years, as well as Pilates, spinning, and kickboxing. However, these workouts didn\u2019t make the top 20 list for 2014.\n\nHowever, Walt Thompson, the lead researcher and a professor of kinesiology and health at Georgia State University in Atlanta, warns of the potential risks of high-intensity interval training. \u201cIt could result in orthopedic injuries or cardiovascular complications for people who aren\u2019t accustomed to this kind of exercise,\u201d he told USA Today. \u201cThat\u2019s the danger of them which is why I was surprised this came in as No. 1.\u201d People with heart disease, arthritis or diabetes should first consult with their doctor before starting any high-intensity interval training, as they may be at more of a risk for an injury.\n\nDietician Nancy Clark told USA Today that high-intensity interval training won\u2019t last very long as a top fitness trend. \u201cIf Zumba has moved off the charts \u2014 and that is fun \u2014 how long will high-intensity exercise hang on?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out. Likely longer among Type A, time-pressed people who are dedicated to maintaining their health.\u201d\n\nOther trends that were ranked in the top 20 for 2014 include getting educated and experienced trainers, weight loss, personal training, group personal training, yoga, and fitness programs for older adults. The survey, however, didn\u2019t take into account the types of exercises that people do on their own, such as walking. Walking is the most common type of physical activity people undertake.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fitness trends, personal training, interval training, cross fit", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The trends to make the top 20 list for 2014 include high-intensity interval training, yoga, and group personal training.", "title": "The Top Fitness Trends For 2014", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/top-fitness-trends-2014-high-intensity-interval-training-popular-its-short-time-complete-261078", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/26/fitness.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The trends to make the top 20 list for 2014 include high-intensity interval training, yoga, and group personal training.", "title": "The Top Fitness Trends For 2014", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/top-fitness-trends-2014-high-intensity-interval-training-popular-its-short-time-complete-261078", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/26/fitness.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/26/fitness.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-10-26T23:19:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-26T23:19:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The trends to make the top 20 list for 2014 include high-intensity interval training, yoga, and group personal training."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9a4\"", "article_summary": "Dietician Nancy Clark told USA Today that high-intensity interval training won\u2019t last very long as a top fitness trend.\nThese types of high-intensity interval training are aimed mostly for people who are already fit and are looking for something more challenging.\nHowever, Walt Thompson, the lead researcher and a professor of kinesiology and health at Georgia State University in Atlanta, warns of the potential risks of high-intensity interval training.\n\u201cIf Zumba has moved off the charts \u2014 and that is fun \u2014 how long will high-intensity exercise hang on?\u201d she said.\n1.\u201d People with heart disease, arthritis or diabetes should first consult with their doctor before starting any high-intensity interval training, as they may be at more of a risk for an injury."}
