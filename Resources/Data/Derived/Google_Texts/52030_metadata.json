Just Look for Some Soldier Selfies\n\nAdministration officials, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, have expressed alarm at the recent activity, which reportedly involves the Kremlin using an air corridor over Iraq and Iran to bring in its military equipment and personnel into Syria.\n\nKerry has contacted his Russian equivalent, Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, a couple of times about the situation. This week Lavrov said the shipments would continue over American objections.\n\nOn Friday, during a global town hall meeting with U.S. troops at Fort Meade, MD, President Obama said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u201cis worried enough that he\u2019s inviting Russian advisers in and Russian equipment in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that won\u2019t change our core strategy, which is to continue to put pressure on ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but we are going to be engaging Russia to let them know that you can\u2019t continue to double-down on a strategy that\u2019s doomed to failure,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: As Putin Targets Dissent, U.S. Democracy Group Banned in Russia\n\nIn addition to the tanks now at the airfield near Latakia, an Assad stronghold, Russia has sent hundreds of naval infantry forces to the site and stationed more than 20 anti-aircraft missiles near the city, which will be operated by Moscow\u2019s forces.\n\nThe Kremlin has also shipped in combat vehicles and prefabricated housing for its troops, according to U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nMoscow already has a naval presence in the country at the port city of Tartus. Putin may indeed view boasting such a large military footprint in Syria as a path to peace, albeit one back up with steel and ammunition.\n\nRussia is under increased pressure from the international community to explain what exactly it is up to in Syria, something that could come to a head later this month when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York City. Putin is supposed to attend the meeting, the first time he will do so in ten years.\n\nRussia remains an ally in the fight against ISIS; it played a central role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled he would redouble his efforts to", "title": "Why Exactly Is Putin Sending Troops and Weapons Into Syria?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/Why-Exactly-Putin-Sending-Troops-and-Weapons-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Syria_Russia.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/Why-Exactly-Putin-Sending-Troops-and-Weapons-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Syria_Russia.png", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled he would redouble his efforts to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How Can You Tell There Are Russian Troops in Syria?\nPutin may indeed view boasting such a large military footprint in Syria as a path to peace, albeit one back up with steel and ammunition.\nThe Kremlin has also shipped in combat vehicles and prefabricated housing for its troops, according to U.S. intelligence officials.\nPutin is supposed to attend the meeting, the first time he will do so in ten years.\nRussia remains an ally in the fight against ISIS; it played a central role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal."}
