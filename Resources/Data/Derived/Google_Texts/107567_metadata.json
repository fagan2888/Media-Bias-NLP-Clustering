Sounding both aggressive and whiny, the billionaire investor warned that he and his overprivileged friends might withhold their millions from church and charity unless the pontiff stops preaching against the excesses and cruelty of unleashed capitalism.\n\nAccording to Langone, such criticism from the Holy See could ultimately hurt the sensitive feelings of the rich so badly that they become \u201cincapable of feeling compassion for the poor.\u201d He also said rich donors are already losing their enthusiasm for the restoration of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Manhattan \u2014 a very specific threat that he mentioned directly to Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York.\n\nLangone is not only a leading fundraiser for church projects but a generous donor to hospitals, universities and cancer charities (often for programs and buildings named after him, in the style of today\u2019s self-promoting philanthropists). Among the super-rich, he has many friends and associates who may share his excitable temperament.\n\nWhile his ultimatum seems senseless \u2014 would a person of true faith stiff the church and the poor? \u2014 it may well be sincere. And Langone spends freely to promote his political and economic views, in the company of the Koch brothers and other Republican plutocrats.\n\nStill, a pope brave enough to face down the mafia over his financial reform of the murky Vatican Bank shouldn\u2019t be much fazed by the likes of Langone.\n\nYet Langone has reason to worry that the Holy Father is in fact asking hard questions about people like him. Indeed, he could serve as a living symbol of the gross and growing economic inequality that disfigures the American system and threatens democracy.\n\nAs a leader of the New York Stock Exchange, he was largely responsible for the scandalous overpayment of his friend Richard Grasso, the exchange president who received nearly $190 million in deferred compensation when he stepped down. Although New York\u2019s highest court eventually upheld Grasso\u2019s pay package, it was a perfect example of the unaccountable, self-serving greed of Wall Street\u2019s elite.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Billionaires like Kenneth Langone threaten to withhold donations if Francis continues his war on capitalism's ills", "title": "Rich Catholics vs. the pope", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Billionaires like Kenneth Langone threaten to withhold donations if Francis continues his war on capitalism's ills", "title": "Rich Catholics vs. the pope", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/04/rich_catholics_vs_the_pope_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/pope_francis2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Billionaires like Kenneth Langone threaten to withhold donations if Francis continues his war on capitalism's ills", "title": "Rich Catholics vs. the pope", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/pope_francis2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joe Conason", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Catholicism, Kenneth Langone, Koch Brothers, pope francis, Religion, Vatican Bank", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dc1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Catholicism, Kenneth Langone, Koch Brothers, pope francis, Religion, Vatican BankIf anyone wonders whether Pope Francis has irritated wealthy conservatives with his courage and idealism, the latest outburst from Kenneth Langone left little doubt.\nYet Langone has reason to worry that the Holy Father is in fact asking hard questions about people like him.\nStill, a pope brave enough to face down the mafia over his financial reform of the murky Vatican Bank shouldn\u2019t be much fazed by the likes of Langone.\nWhile his ultimatum seems senseless \u2014 would a person of true faith stiff the church and the poor?\nAnd Langone spends freely to promote his political and economic views, in the company of the Koch brothers and other Republican plutocrats."}
