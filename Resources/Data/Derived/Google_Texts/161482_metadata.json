Important people have told her so.\n\nWhen the longtime CBS reporter asked for details about reinforcements sent to the Benghazi compound during the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack, White House national security spokesman Tommy Vietor replied, \u201cI give up, Sharyl . . . I\u2019ll work with more reasonable folks that follow up, I guess.\u201d\n\nAnother White House flack, Eric Schultz, didn\u2019t like being pressed for answers about the Fast and Furious scandal in which American agents directed guns into the arms of Mexican drug lords. \u201cGoddammit, Sharyl!\u201d he screamed at her. \u201cThe Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, The New York Times is reasonable. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s not reasonable!\u201d\n\nTwo of her former bosses, CBS Evening News executive producers Jim Murphy and Rick Kaplan, called her a \u201cpit bull.\u201d\n\nThat was when Sharyl was being nice.\n\nNow that she\u2019s no longer on the CBS payroll, this pit bull is off the leash and tearing flesh off the behinds of senior media and government officials. In her new memoir/expos\u00e9 \u201cStonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation, and Harassment in Obama\u2019s Washington\u201d (Harper), Attkisson unloads on her colleagues in big-time TV news for their cowardice and cheerleading for the Obama administration while unmasking the corruption, misdirection and outright lying of today\u2019s Washington political machine.\n\n\u2018Not until the stock split\u2019\n\nCalling herself \u201cpolitically agnostic,\u201d Attkisson, a five-time Emmy winner, says she simply follows the story, and the money, wherever it leads her.\n\nIn nearly 20 years at CBS News, she has done many stories attacking Republicans and corporate America, and she points out that TV news, being reluctant to offend its advertisers, has become more and more skittish about, for instance, stories questioning pharmaceutical companies or car manufacturers.\n\nWorking on a piece that raised questions about the American Red Cross disaster response, she says a boss told her, \u201cWe must do nothing to upset our corporate partners . . . until the stock splits.\u201d (Parent company Viacom and CBS split in 2006).\n\nOften [network executives] dream up stories beforehand and turn the reporters into \u201ccasting agents\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she notes, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d is airing blatant advertorials such as a three-minute segment pushing TGI Fridays\u2019 all-you-can-eat appetizer promotion or four minutes plugging a Doritos taco shell sold at Taco Bell.\n\nReporters on the ground aren\u2019t necessarily ideological, Attkisson says, but the major network news decisions get made by a handful of New York execs who read the same papers and think the same thoughts.\n\nOften they dream up stories beforehand and turn the reporters into \u201ccasting agents,\u201d told \u201cwe need to find someone who will say . . .\u201d that a given policy is good or bad. \u201cWe\u2019re asked to create a reality that fits their New York image of what they believe,\u201d she writes.\n\nReporting on the many green-energy firms such as Solyndra that went belly-up after burning through hundreds of millions in Washington handouts, Attkisson ran into increasing difficulty getting her stories on the air. A colleague told her about the following exchange: \u201c[The stories] are pretty significant,\u201d said a news exec. \u201cMaybe we should be airing some of them on the \u2018Evening News?\u2019 \u201d Replied the program\u2019s chief Pat Shevlin, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, don\u2019t you support green energy?\u201d\n\nSays Attkisson: That\u2019s like saying you\u2019re anti-medicine if you point out pharmaceutical company fraud.\n\nA piece she did about how subsidies ended up at a Korean green-energy firm \u2014 your tax dollars sent to Korea! \u2014 at first had her bosses excited but then was kept off the air and buried on the CBS News Web site. Producer Laura Strickler told her Shevlin \u201chated the whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s not pile on\u2019\n\nAttkisson mischievously cites what she calls the \u201cSubstitution Game\u201d: She likes to imagine how a story about today\u2019s administration would have been handled if it made Republicans look bad.\n\nIn green energy, for instance: \u201cImagine a parallel scenario in which President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney personally appeared at groundbreakings for, and used billions of tax dollars to support, multiple giant corporate ventures whose investors were sometimes major campaign bundlers, only to have one (or two, or three) go bankrupt . . . when they knew in advance the companies\u2019 credit ratings were junk.\u201d\n\nAttkisson continued her dogged reporting through the launch of ObamaCare: She\u2019s the reporter who brought the public\u2019s attention to the absurdly small number \u2014 six \u2014 who managed to sign up for it on day one.\n\nOne of her bosses had a rule that conservative analysts must always be labeled conservatives, but liberal analysts were simply \u201canalysts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany in the media,\u201d she writes, \u201care wrestling with their own souls: They know that ObamaCare is in serious trouble, but they\u2019re conflicted about reporting that. Some worry that the news coverage will hurt a cause that they personally believe in. They\u2019re all too eager to dismiss damaging documentary evidence while embracing, sometimes unquestioningly, the Obama administration\u2019s ever-evolving and unproven explanations.\u201d\n\nOne of her bosses had a rule that conservative analysts must always be labeled conservatives, but liberal analysts were simply \u201canalysts.\u201d \u201cAnd if a conservative analyst\u2019s opinion really rubbed the supervisor the wrong way,\u201d says Attkisson, \u201cshe might rewrite the script to label him a \u2018right-wing\u2019 analyst.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October 2012, with the presidential election coming up, Attkisson says CBS suddenly lost interest in airing her reporting on the Benghazi attacks. \u201cThe light switch turns off,\u201d she writes. \u201cMost of my Benghazi stories from that point on would be reported not on television, but on the Web.\u201d\n\nTwo expressions that became especially popular with CBS News brass, she says, were \u201cincremental\u201d and \u201cpiling on.\u201d These are code for \u201cexcuses for stories they really don\u2019t want, even as we observe that developments on stories they like are aired in the tiniest of increments.\u201d\n\nHey, kids, we found two more Americans who say they like their ObamaCare! Let\u2019s do a lengthy segment.\n\nFriends in high places\n\nWhen the White House didn\u2019t like her reporting, it would make clear where the real power lay. A flack would send a blistering e-mail to her boss, David Rhodes, CBS News\u2019 president \u2014 and Rhodes\u2019s brother Ben, a top national security advisor to President Obama.\n\nThe administration, with the full cooperation of the media, has successfully turned \u201cBenghazi\u201d into a word associated with nutters, like \u201cRoswell\u201d or \u201cgrassy knoll,\u201d but Attkisson notes that \u201cthe truth is that most of the damaging information came from Obama administration insiders. From government documents. From sources who were outraged by their own government\u2019s behavior and what they viewed as a coverup.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, though the major media can\u2019t mention the Fast and Furious scandal without a world-weary eyeroll, Attkisson points out that the story led to the resignation of a US attorney and the head of the ATF and led President Obama to invoke for the first time \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d to stanch the flow of damaging information.\n\nAttkisson, who received an Emmy and the Edward R. Murrow award for her trailblazing work on the story, says she made top CBS brass \u201cincensed\u201d when she appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show and mentioned that Obama administration officials called her up to literally scream at her while she was working the story.\n\nOne angry CBS exec called to tell Attkisson that Ingraham is \u201cextremely, extremely far right\u201d and that Attkisson shouldn\u2019t appear on her show anymore. Attkisson was puzzled, noting that CBS reporters aren\u2019t barred from appearing on lefty MSNBC shows.\n\nShe was turning up leads tying the Fast and Furious scandal (which involved so many guns that ATF officials initially worried that a firearm used in the Tucson shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords might have been one of them) to an ever-expanding network of cases when she got an e-mail from Katie Couric asking if it was OK for Couric to interview Eric Holder, whom Couric knew socially, about the scandal. Sure, replied Attkisson.\n\nNo interview with Holder aired but \u201cafter that weekend e-mail exchange, nothing is the same at work,\u201d Attkisson writes. \u201cThe Evening News\u201d began killing her stories on Fast and Furious, with one producer telling Attkisson, \u201cYou\u2019ve reported everything. There\u2019s really nothing left to say.\u201d\n\nReaders are left to wonder whether Holder told Couric to stand down on the story.\n\nNo investigations\n\nAttkisson left CBS News in frustration earlier this year. In the book she cites the complete loss of interest in investigative stories at \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d under new host Scott Pelley and new executive producer Shevlin.\n\nShe notes that the program, which under previous hosts Dan Rather, Katie Couric and Bob Schieffer largely gave her free rein, became so hostile to real reporting that investigative journalist Armen Keteyian and his producer Keith Summa asked for their unit to be taken off the program\u2019s budget (so they could pitch stories to other CBS News programs), then Summa left the network entirely.\n\nWhen Attkisson had an exclusive, on-camera interview lined up with Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the YouTube filmmaker Hillary Clinton blamed for the Benghazi attacks, CBS News president Rhodes nixed the idea: \u201cThat\u2019s kind of old news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.\n\nAttkisson is a born whistleblower, but CBS lost interest in the noise she was making.\n\nSensing the political waters had become too treacherous, Attkisson did what she thought was an easy sell on a school-lunch fraud story that \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d \u201centhusiastically accepted,\u201d she says, and was racing to get on air, when suddenly \u201cthe light switch went off . . . we couldn\u2019t figure out what they saw as a political angle to this story.\u201d\n\nThe story had nothing to do with Michelle Obama, but Attkisson figures that the first lady\u2019s association with school lunches, and/or her friendship with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host Gayle King, might have had something to do with execs now telling her the story \u201cwasn\u2019t interesting to their audience, after all.\u201d\n\nA story on waste at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, planned for the CBS Weekend News, was watered down and turned into a \u201cbland non-story\u201d before airing: An exec she doesn\u2019t identify who was Shevlin\u2019s \u201cnumber two,\u201d she says, \u201creacted as if the story had disparaged his best friend. As if his best friend were Mr. Federal Government. \u2018Well, this is all the states\u2019 fault!\u2019 . . . he sputtered.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she says, though no one confronted her directly, a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d began; \u201cIf I offered a story on pretty much any legitimate controversy involving government, instead of being considered a good journalistic watchdog, I was anti-Obama.\u201d\n\nYet it was Attkisson who broke the story that the Bush administration had once run a gun-walking program similar to Fast and Furious, called Wide Receiver. She did dozens of tough-minded stories on Bush\u2019s FDA, the TARP program and contractors such as Halliburton. She once inspired a seven-minute segment on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d with her reporting on the suspicious charity of a Republican congressman, Steve Buyer.\n\nAttkisson is a born whistleblower, but CBS lost interest in the noise she was making.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll sacrifice you\u2019\n\nIgnoring Attkisson proved damaging to CBS in other ways. When a senior producer she doesn\u2019t identify came to her in 2004 bubbling about documents that supposedly showed then-President George W. Bush shirked his duties during the Vietnam War, she took one look at the documents and said, \u201cThey looked like they were typed by my daughter on a computer yesterday.\u201d\n\nAsked to do a followup story on the documents, she flatly refused, citing an ethics clause in her contract. \u201cAnd if you make me, I\u2019ll have to call my lawyer,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody ever said another word\u201d to her about reporting on the documents, which turned out to be unverifiable and probably fake.\n\nAfter Pelley and Shevlin aired a report that wrongly tarnished reports by Attkisson (and Jonathan Karl of ABC News) on how the administration scrubbed its talking points of references to terrorism after Benghazi, and did so without mentioning that the author of some of the talking points, Ben Rhodes, was the brother of the president of CBS News, she says a colleague told her, \u201c[CBS] is selling you down the river. They\u2019ll gladly sacrifice your reputation to save their own. If you don\u2019t stand up for yourself, nobody will.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the book, you won\u2019t question whether CBS News or Attkisson is more trustworthy.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Sharyl Attkisson is an unreasonable woman.

Bush shirked his duties during the Vietnam War, she took one look at the documents and said, \u201cThey looked like they were typed by my daughter on a computer yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsked to do a followup story on the documents, she flatly refused, citing an ethics clause in her contract. \u201cAnd if you make me, I\u2019ll have to call my lawyer,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody ever said another word\u201d to her about reporting on the documents, which turned out to be unverifiable and probably fake.\r\n\r\nAfter Pelley and Shevlin aired a report that wrongly tarnished reports by Attkisson (and Jonathan Karl of ABC News) on how the administration scrubbed its talking points of references to terrorism after Benghazi, and did so without mentioning that the author of some of the talking points, Ben Rhodes, was the brother of the president of CBS News, she says a colleague told her, \u201c[CBS] is selling you down the river. They\u2019ll gladly sacrifice your reputation to save their own.
