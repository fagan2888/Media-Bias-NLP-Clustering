But little snow is expected in the high country.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or @kirkmitchell or denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Last week of 2015 will be cool and dry in Denver", "title": "Last week of 2015 will be cool and dry in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/28/last-week-of-2015-will-be-cool-and-dry-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151228__CD31MISSYCANCER_BL27369xp1.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151228__CD31MISSYCANCER_BL27369xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-28T07:00:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:18:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver residents can expect chilly but not extremely cold temperatures as the year ends and 2016 begins.\nThe normal high temperature for this time of the year is 43 degrees, Fredin said.\n\u201cThe cold air came in and there\u2019s nothing to push it out.\u201dThe low temperature so far Monday morning was 4 degrees at Denver International Airport.\nAlthough that\u2019s cold, it won\u2019t be threatening the record low of -12 degrees, Fredin said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to warm up any time soon,\u201d said Kyle Fredin, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder."}
