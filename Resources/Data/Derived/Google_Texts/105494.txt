John Catsimatidis, the New York businessman and long-time supporter of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said he has heard that if the election were held today, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren could beat her. Catsimatidis suggested to Bloomberg News that a Clinton nomination is by no means certain, and before thinking about a message on the economy that would appeal to voters in a general election, she would first have to win the primary."One of my staff members who's from Iowa called his friend in Iowa who's the Democratic chairman of Iowa, and if the election was held today, he said that our lady friend from Massachusetts would beat Hillary," said Catsimatidis, who has raised millions of dollars for the Clinton family."So is that scary? That's the Obama faction," he said.President Barack Obama defeated Clinton in the 2008 Democratic caucuses, which set him on the path to taking the nomination for president that year.Warren has repeatedly said, however, that she is not running for president in 2016.Last week, the resignation of David Brock from the Clinton organization Priorities USA triggered speculation that there was infighting in Clinton's camp between former Obama supporters and longtime Clinton allies.Observers said it was reminiscent of problems she had with unity during her 2008 campaign.
