Ryan Silvey.\n\nThe Kansas City Republican said on Friday that he believes he has the support he needs to pass a Medicaid expansion bill that addresses the concerns of his more conservative colleagues.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are coming to the realization that, while we don\u2019t necessarily like Obamacare \u2014 while we aren\u2019t the biggest fans of putting more people on Medicaid \u2014 that the way the current system is and the way the courts have continued to uphold it, it\u2019s going to be damaging to our hospitals if we don\u2019t do something,\u201d Silvey said at an Overland Park, Kan., event sponsored by the Mother & Child Health Coalition and other groups.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funds, which the federal government pays hospitals to offset the costs of charity care, will be reduced starting Oct. 1, 2015.\n\nThe ACA was designed to eliminate the need for DSH funding by providing insurance to those who receive charity care. But neither Missouri nor Kansas has expanded Medicaid, leaving hospitals with the worst of both worlds.\n\nAs envisioned under the health care reform law, Silvey\u2019s plan would expand Medicaid to those with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,104 in annual income for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four \u2014 and add about 300,000 more people to Missouri\u2019s Medicaid rolls. But it would also create additional requirements.\n\nMoney saved by expansion would go into a trust fund to fill funding gaps when federal support for Medicaid is reduced. If the trust fund runs out, Medicaid payments to providers would be reduced.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government has agreed to pay all Medicaid expansion costs for three years. After that the federal share will gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent, where it will remain.\n\nSilvey said his plan is supported by hospitals and other provider groups.\n\nHe said the compromise bill was close to being approved at the end of the 2014 legislative session but was blocked by a handful of influential legislators.\n\nNow that some of those expansion opponents, particularly Republican Sen. John Lamping of St. Louis County, are not seeking reelection, Silvey said he\u2019s more optimistic about the bill\u2019s chances.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Medicaid expansion may yet happen in Missouri, according to state Sen.
