The legislation, he said, will help improve physicians' quality of care \"because it starts encouraging payments based on quality, not the number of tests that are provided or the number of procedures that are applied but whether or not people actually start feeling better \u2026 it encourages us to continue to make the system better without denying service.\"\n\nObama's signature averted a 21 percent cut in Medicare payments set to take effect this month. Although some providers may still be subject to reduced rates, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services yesterday said it made payments at full rates ahead of Obama signing the bill, according to the AP. The agency will reprocess any lower-level claims to ensure providers receive full payment.\n\nFiscal conservatives have criticized the final bill, arguing too much of the $214 billion associated with the legislation is not paid for and will add to the federal deficit, and CMS this week argued its provisions don't go far enough.\n\nThe American Medical Association, however, dismissed these concerns, with AMA President Robert Wah, M.D., calling the CMS report \"illogical, flawed and dangerous for patient access to quality healthcare,\" according to Medscape. And while Robert Wergin, M.D., president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said the bill is not ideal, it serves a valuable purpose in stabilizing Medicare and physicians' revenue streams, which means doctors won't have to turn away Medicare patients while legislators and officials devise a longer-term solution.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the AP article\n\n- read the Medscape article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSGR repeal won't save all docs from Medicare payment cuts\n\nSenate set to vote on SGR bill amendments as CMS warns proposal is not enough\n\nSenate approves bill to repeal SGR\n\nPhysicians say good riddance to SGR, applaud Senate repeal vote\n\nIs the proposed SGR fix too vague to work?\n\nWhy healthcare providers can't back down on SGR repeal\n\nHouse passes doc fix; Obama pledges support\n\nLawmakers unveil $210 billion SGR fix\n\nWhat the SGR repeal means for value-based payment models", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama made it official and permanently repealed the sustainable growth rate formula by signing a bill passed by the Senate earlier in the week, the Associated Press\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "President Barack Obama made it official and permanently repealed the sustainable growth rate formula by signing a bill passed by the Senate earlier in the week, the Associated Press\u00a0reports.", "title": "Obama signs SGR repeal bill as medical groups react to CMS warning", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/obama-signs-sgr-repeal-doc-fix-legislation-medical-groups-react-cms-warning/2015-04-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Medical Association (AMA),Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,doc fix,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,President Barack Obama,sustainable growth rate (SGR)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0118\"", "article_summary": "Why healthcare providers can't back down on SGR repealHouse passes doc fix; Obama pledges supportLawmakers unveil $210 billion SGR fixWhat the SGR repeal means for value-based payment models\nObama's signature averted a 21 percent cut in Medicare payments set to take effect this month.\nTo learn more:- here's the AP article- read the Medscape articleRelated Articles:SGR repeal won't save all docs from Medicare payment cutsSenate set to vote on SGR bill amendments as CMS warns proposal is not enoughSenate approves bill to repeal SGRPhysicians say good riddance to SGR, applaud Senate repeal voteIs the proposed SGR fix too vague to work?\nPresident Barack Obama made it official and permanently repealed the sustainable growth rate formula by signing a bill passed by the Senate earlier in the week, the Associated Press reports.\nThe American Medical Association, however, dismissed these concerns, with AMA President Robert Wah, M.D., calling the CMS report \"illogical, flawed and dangerous for patient access to quality healthcare,\" according to Medscape."}
