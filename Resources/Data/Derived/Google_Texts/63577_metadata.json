WCSC-TV has been warning viewers about a potential DirecTV blackout during broadcasts in recent weeks. Talks have been underway for three months, Raycom said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charleston TV station blacked out on DirecTV over fee dispute, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, CBS,Charleston,DirecTV,Montgomery, Alabama,Raycom Media,Retransmission fees,Satellite TV,WCSC-TV", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A blackout blocked DirecTV subscribers from watching Charleston's CBS television affiliate on Monday after contractual talks hit an impasse.", "title": "Charleston TV station blacked out on DirecTV over fee dispute", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20140901/140909958/charleston-tv-station-blacked-out-on-directv-over-fee-dispute", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140901/PC05/140909958/AR/0/AR-140909958.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140901/PC05/140909958/AR/0/AR-140909958.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A blackout blocked DirecTV subscribers from watching Charleston's CBS television affiliate on Monday after contractual talks hit an impasse.", "title": "Charleston TV station blacked out on DirecTV over fee dispute", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140901/PC05/140909958/AR/0/AR-140909958.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 140909958}}, "keywords": "Charleston TV station blacked out on DirecTV over fee dispute , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, CBS,Charleston,DirecTV,Montgomery, Alabama,Raycom Media,Retransmission fees,Satellite TV,WCSC-TV", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01T12:05:27Z", "modified_time": "2014-09-01T12:05:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A blackout blocked DirecTV subscribers from watching Charleston's CBS television affiliate on Monday after contractual talks hit an impasse."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce965\"", "article_summary": "WCSC-TV has been warning viewers about a potential DirecTV blackout during broadcasts in recent weeks.\nA blackout blocked DirecTV subscribers from watching Charleston's CBS television affiliate on Monday after contractual talks hit an impasse.\nIt was not clear how long the WCSC-TV blackout will last.\nDirecTV is battling WCSC-TV over fees it pays the station's owner to carry CBS programming.\nWCSC-TV said affected viewers can still watch CBS shows with a free over-the-air signal, online or by switching pay TV providers."}
