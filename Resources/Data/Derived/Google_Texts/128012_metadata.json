But you see the problem here. If the ACA plainly prohibits subsidies in states that didn\u2019t set up their own exchanges, then there would be no subsidies in those states to claw back. And by April 2011, when the clawback passed, we already knew that multiple states were planning to protest ACA implementation and let the federal government set up their exchanges, including giant states like Florida, which now has a million beneficiaries. They would have needed a different, or additional, pay-for.\n\nObamacare\u2019s legal challengers might chime in here to insist that their case is impervious to revelations like these. CBO\u2019s analyses were premised on the idea that every state would set up its own exchange, and Republicans (and many Democrats) based their votes on what CBO told them. Other Democrats who actually understood the scheme may have simply pretended not to notice the problem. Nevertheless, they\u2019d say, the law was designed to withhold subsidies from people whose states didn\u2019t establish exchanges, and to ruin the individual and small-group insurance markets in those states, without providing any notice to either. In a perverse way, the absurdity of the challengers\u2019 argument is it\u2019s greatest strength. Because the scheme they insist Congress intentionally created was so far from Congress\u2019 mind, it\u2019s hard to find contemporaneous evidence that Congress absolutely didn\u2019t mean to condition these subsidies. In much the same way, we can\u2019t be sure that Congress didn\u2019t mean to denominate those subsidies in Canadian dollars. A $ isn\u2019t necessarily a $ after all.\n\nBut this familiar line of defense crumbles here. It is facially plausible\u2014though incorrect\u2014to posit that at the time the law passed, CBO believed subsidies would be available everywhere because it simply assumed every state would set up an exchange. But that assumption didn't hold in April 2011. Something else must explain CBO's 1099-repeal score, and the Republican votes that followed it. What we have in the form of this bill is clear evidence that everyone who voted for it (including every single Republican, save the two GOP congressmen and one GOP senator who weren\u2019t present) understood the Affordable Care Act to provide subsidies everywhere.\n\nCongress repealed the 1099 provision at an important moment\u2014after multiple states announced that they would step back and let the federal government establish their exchanges, but before the IRS issued its proposed rule stipulating that subsidies would be available on both exchanges. The only thing Congress had to go on when it stiffened the clawback mechanism was its own reading of the Affordable Care Act, and Congress behaved exactly as you would expect. It operated with the understanding that subsidies were universal.\n\nToday, many Republicans will tell you that the law plainly forecloses subsidies through the federal exchange. Six senators\u2014John Cornyn, Ted Cruz, Orrin Hatch, Mike Lee, Rob Portman, and Marco Rubio\u2014and nine congressmen\u2014Marsha Blackburn, Dave Camp, Randy Hultgren, Darrell Issa, Pete Olson, Joe Pitts, Pete Roskam, Paul Ryan and Fred Upton\u2014have even filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court, which begins, \u201cThe plain text of the ACA reflects a specific choice by Congress to make health insurance premium subsidies available only to those who purchase insurance from 'an Exchange established by the State\u2026.' The IRS flouted this unambiguous statutory limitation, promulgating regulations that make subsidies available for insurance purchased not only through exchanges established by the States but also through exchanges established by the federal government.\u201d\n\nAll of them, save Cruz, who was elected in 2012, voted for 1099 repeal.\n\nIn its brief, the government argues that \u201cit was well understood that the Act gave \u2018States the choice to participate in the exchanges themselves or, if they do not choose to do so, to allow the Federal Government to set up the exchanges.\u2019 And it was abundantly clear that some States would not establish their own Exchanges.\u201c It was more than well understood.
