The audience was treated to \u201cthe world according to Joe.\u201d\n\nBiden spent much of the time offering a ringing defense of the Obama administration\u2019s policies, including the $862 billion stimulus in the depths of the Great Recession. He also insisted that the U.S. and its allies were beginning to \u201cmake genuine progress\u201d in isolating and taking out ISIS.\n\nRelated: Liberal Economists Challenge Sanders\u2019 Economic Math\n\nWhile some were expecting him to make a pronouncement on the course of the Democratic presidential campaign \u2013 a race he decided against entering last October in the wake of his 46-year-old son Beau\u2019s death from brain cancer \u2013 Biden steered clear of critiquing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or taking sides.\n\nHowever, he did make some news before his time was up. Among the more interesting morsels:\n\nOn the prospects of Republican Donald Trump winning the GOP nomination. President Obama said earlier this week that he couldn\u2019t imagine Americans electing Trump president. Biden sees it a little differently:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very possible he can be nominated and depending on how this all plays out I would take him seriously in terms of being able to win,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s appealing to fear\u2026. I am not very good at prognosticating, but I would not be surprised if he is the nominee. I would be surprised if he got elected.\u201d\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Health Care Plan Would Cost $13.8 Trillion Over a Decade\n\nOn Trump\u2019s calling Pope Francis \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for suggesting Trump wasn\u2019t a Christian because he favors building a wall along the southwestern border. Biden, a Roman Catholic, said it wasn\u2019t a \u201chard choice\u201d in siding with the Pope against the billionaire businessman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a theologian nor am I a priest or a minister, but I think building walls is fundamentally contrary to what made this country what it is,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOn whether he would accept a recess appointment to the Supreme Court to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Biden, grimacing and smiling, replied:\n\n\u201cYou never say to a president for certain you wouldn\u2019t do anything, but I have no -- look at me now -- I have no desire to sit on the Supreme Court\u2026. It would be a great honor but I have no desire.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a warmup to the latest Democratic presidential town hall meeting in Nevada Thursday", "title": "Biden Won\u2019t Rule Out the Possibility of a Trump Victory", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/18/Biden-Won-t-Rule-Out-Possibility-Trump-Victory", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-biden_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/18/Biden-Won-t-Rule-Out-Possibility-Trump-Victory", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-biden_4.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a warmup to the latest Democratic presidential town hall meeting in Nevada Thursday", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "President Obama said earlier this week that he couldn\u2019t imagine Americans electing Trump president.\nIn a warmup to the latest Democratic presidential town hall meeting in Nevada Thursday night, Vice President Joe Biden spent the better part of an hour in a taped interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow.\nBiden, a Roman Catholic, said it wasn\u2019t a \u201chard choice\u201d in siding with the Pope against the billionaire businessman.\nHe also insisted that the U.S. and its allies were beginning to \u201cmake genuine progress\u201d in isolating and taking out ISIS.\nAmong the more interesting morsels:On the prospects of Republican Donald Trump winning the GOP nomination."}
