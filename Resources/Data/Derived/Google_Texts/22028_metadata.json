CHELSEY LEVINGSTON/STAFF\n\nRendering of the future lobby of Jamestowne, a new medical facility under construction now near Main Street in Hamilton that once open in 2017, will provide short-term rehabilitative care and physical therapy for hospital surgery patients that aren\u2019t yet ready to go home. CONTRIBUTED\n\nBy Chelsey Levingston\n\nStaff Writer\n\nWhen, within the next year, Community First Solutions opens its newest health care facility in the city\u2019s west side, the expanded services could help further distinguish the nonprofit from other health care providers serving patients following a hospital stay, Community First leaders say.\n\nThat\u2019s because just like other nonprofit networks might operate multiple hospitals along with doctor groups and outpatient facilities, Community First is also a growing post-acute health system.\n\nThe new approximately $12 million medical center called Jamestowne will be focused on providing care to short-term, post-acute patients.\n\nConstruction continues on the new 42,000-square-foot medical building with 42 private rooms near the intersection of Main Street and Stahlheber Road. The new center would offer rehabilitation health care with modern amenities, according to Community First.\n\n\u201cThis is just another piece that we feel is going to make Community First that much stronger as a partner,\u201d said Jeff Thurman, president and chief executive officer. \u201cThe whole dynamics of care is changing very rapidly.\u201d\n\nServices will include overnight physical, occupational and speech therapies for knee, hip and other surgery or ill patients discharged from the hospital, but not yet ready to go home. Additionally, Jamestowne will offer outpatient therapy services, according to the Hamilton-based nonprofit.\n\nOnce open, the new center will join the list of other health care services Community First provides following a hospital visit including home health care and rehabilitation; outpatient and wellness services; and pharmacy, transportation and meal delivery services.\n\n\u201cRehabilitation is a process, you recover through something, so most people need not just the inpatient but the support at home. The types of services they need continues to change,\u201d said Danielle Webb, vice president of marketing for Community First. \u201cWe have all those services so we can ensure they get what they need to help that person recover faster.\u201d\n\nJamestowne will also expand the ways the nonprofit can partner with area hospitals needing help to prevent their patients from being readmitted due to a mix-up in medications or other preventable problem, according to Community First.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons this is so important right now, since the Affordable Care Act was passed\u2026 the acute care providers are being required to look at the entire episode of care, not just the time the individual is under their direct care at the hospital,\u201d said Rhonda Huber, executive vice president of corporate strategy for the organization. \u201cWe can help that acute care provider keep their eyes on the patient for those 90 days.\u201d\n\nCommunity First already offers rehabilitation and therapy services for older adults at its Berkeley Square and Westover senior living communities. The new center will be a third, off-campus location intended for a growing population of 50- to 70-year-olds.\n\nAdditionally, opening a third rehabilitation center will free space at the existing Berkeley Square and Westover sites to convert remaining semi-private patient rooms to more private rooms.\n\nOther expanding post-acute providers in Butler County include Arlington Pointe, a nursing home and short-term rehabilitation facility that opened this year in Middletown; and Hillandale Family of Communities, which operates retirement and health care facilities in Fairfield and West Chester townships, for example.\n\nCommunity First Solutions, which has grown to be one of Hamilton\u2019s largest private employers of nearly 700 workers, provides of health care, behavioral health, pharmacy, retirement lifestyle and community services.\n\nMeanwhile, Community First continues to have hiring needs for nurses and in-home caregivers.
