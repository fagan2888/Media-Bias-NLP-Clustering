Chelsea

In the past half-decade, the Blues have surpassed Manchester United as the winner that everyone hates. They skyrocketed from mediocrity when they were purchased by the richest man in Russia in 2003, and no one will let them forget that. Additionally, their style of playing, which emphasizes defense and capitalizing on the mistakes of their opponents, can be tedious to watch, if brutally effective. Finally, in Portuguese Manager Jose Mourinho they have both a tactical genius and a master media troll.

Stars: Belgian Winger Eden Hazard is considered to be one of the players who might supplant the now 30-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo as best player in the world. Brit John Terry is personally detestable, but has marshalled a rock solid defense for over a decade.
