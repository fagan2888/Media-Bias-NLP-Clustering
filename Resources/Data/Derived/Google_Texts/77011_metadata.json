Bush, Iran, Iraq war, lawrence wilkerson, Military-industrial complex, News, Politics News\n\nLawrence Wilkerson is a contradictory figure.\n\nWilkerson is a career military man, who served as chief of staff for Secretary of State Colin Powell; but he has also voiced reluctance to involve American forces in foreign conflicts, and slammed the Bush administration for its handling of the Iraq War. He is also a lifelong Republican who, far from just criticizing his party, has actually gone on the warpath against it at times.\n\nWhen Powell was attacked by conservatives in 2012 for endorsing Barack Obama for reelection \u2014 Mitt Romney surrogate John Sununu famously suggested that the endorsement was motivated by race \u2014 Wilkerson sprung to the defense of his former boss, saying that the Republican Party was \u201cfull of racists.\u201d\n\nWilkerson stands by those assertions. In a recent conversation with Salon, the retired U.S. Army colonel renewed his criticism of the GOP and the Bush administration. He also addressed recent saber rattling by Republicans on the issue of Iran. The following interview has been lightly edited.\n\nYou have been very critical of the Republican Party. Why do you stay?\n\nThere are sane and sober people in the Republican Party. The public persona of the Republican Party has changed since the days of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nIn the past you have said the Republican Party is full of racists. Do you stand by that and aren\u2019t you afraid of a backlash?\n\nI\u2019m not afraid of a backlash. The GOP has scores of racists. Under Richard Nixon\u2019s blessing, the GOP took advantage of disgruntled Democrats in the South. They are still there and their children are there. This is very much known in our party. This was a conscious strategy.\n\nYour boss, Colin Powell, helped move forward the Iraq War with his presentation to the United Nations. But that turned out to be wrong information. What happened?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Powell, he just said it convincingly. I helped him. It was everyone in the administration. [The information] was provided by 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and CIA director George Tenet. The Russians, French and British spy agencies all provided the same evidence. It was a political and intelligence failure. The politicians took advantage of that. They took the intelligence and cherry-picked it, reinforcing the idea that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSo if Iraq never had WMD, what were the real reasons behind the war?\n\nThere are several reasons. President George W. Bush wanted a stellar victory. Vice President Dick Cheney and Bush are both oil men and wanted to ensure 300 billion barrels didn\u2019t stay in Saddam\u2019s hands. The Israel lobby and [former Deputy Secretary of Defense] Paul Wolfowitz wanted to get rid of Saddam. There is no singular motivation. There are many, including wanting to send a message to all concerned after 9/11 that said, very forcefully, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with America.\u201d\n\nI have read that another reason for the Iraq War was to send a message to other Middle Eastern countries that America has the military might to overthrow their countries and reshape the region.\n\nThe opposite occurred. [The Bush administration] demonstrated we were incompetent. They destroyed the balance of power and we are living with the result. Iraqis will tell you that Iraq was a better country under Saddam. There was more freedom for women and a better economy. It shows you how bad the situation is today.\n\nWas the war partially about making money for defense contractors? The Financial Times states the U.S. government has paid contractors $138 billion. KBR, a subsidiary of Cheney\u2019s former company Halliburton, received about $40 billion in government contracts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colin Powell's former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, warns of the militarism & racism of Republican lawmakers", "title": "\u201cThe GOP has scores of racists\u201d: A former Bush official condemns modern Republican orthodoxy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Colin Powell's former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, warns of the militarism & racism of Republican lawmakers", "title": "\u201cThe GOP has scores of racists\u201d: A former Bush official condemns modern Republican orthodoxy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/10/the_gop_has_scores_of_racists_a_former_bush_official_condemns_modern_republican_orthodoxy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/lawrence_wilkerson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colin Powell's former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, warns of the militarism & racism of Republican lawmakers", "title": "\u201cThe GOP has scores of racists\u201d: A former Bush official condemns modern Republican orthodoxy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/lawrence_wilkerson.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Manny Otiko", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bush administration, Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, George W.
