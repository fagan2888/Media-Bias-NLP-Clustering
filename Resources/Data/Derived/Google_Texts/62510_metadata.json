Resnick Jr., MD, associate professor and vice-chair of dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, told the audience. \u201cWe really need to think about how would we design the perfect physician-led team to provide the best care. We let the market drive it instead, and we\u2019re playing catch up.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned teledermatology as having \u201chuge potential to do wonderful things.\u201d\n\nResnick, recipient of the Clarence S. Livingood, MD, award and lectureship, told the audience they must collect data, measure quality [and] demonstrate value.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we have in our favor is that we are highly valued by our patients. Our patients love dermatology, and that works well for us.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the world is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t adapt, we are at risk of being marginalized and commoditized.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever before have we faced such fundamental challenges in the way health care is delivered,\u201d Dirk Michael Elston, MD, AAD president, said.\n\nElston said AAD has worked with state and sister societies. \u201cBecause much of the action is at the states, and that\u2019s where the academy has to be partnering with state and local societies in their individual legislative societies.\u201d\n\nThe state societies are the first line of defense against limited provider networks, which have appeared in some states, including Florida and Connecticut, Elston said.\n\nBrett M. Coldiron\n\nBrett M. Coldiron, MD, who will assume the AAD presidency at the end of the annual meeting, outlined challenges facing dermatologists brought on by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe first detail for dermatology is the limited provider networks. \u201cIt\u2019s an unexpected consequence from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Coldiron reported.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also has pressure to create larger physician groups, Coldiron said.\n\n\u201cMost of us are in small groups and we like it that way,\u201d Coldiron said. \u201cIf we stay small, we risk the loss of access. If dermatologists join large multispecialty groups, they fear they will lose autonomy and control. \u2026 A better option might be to form a larger dermatology-only group where you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nColdiron also stressed motivating action, with dermatologists becoming more involved with their specialties and future. He said the organization needs to get more involved with the American Medical Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to join forces,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can no longer thrive as a small isolated specialty outside of organized medicine and politics in general. The forces of change are hard upon us. \u2026 Our work is cut out for us.\u201d \u2013 By Bruce Thiel\n\nFor more information:\n\nPlenary Session.
