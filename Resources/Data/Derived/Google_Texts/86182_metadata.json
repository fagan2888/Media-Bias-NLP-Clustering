For people with Alzheimer\u2019s and their families, needs for care typically far exceed the scope of Medicare coverage, leaving them with few options.\n\nThe disconnect between coverage and needs are part of the long-term care catastrophe looming for many in the U.S., where the current population of elderly is expected to double to an estimated 88 million by 2050. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that only 3 in 10 people ages 65 and older won\u2019t need long-term care. And for those afflicted with a disease like Alzheimer\u2019s, the need for that kind of care is even more critical.\n\nOne possible option to bridge the coverage gap, long-term care insurance, only pays for 12 percent of those costs nationwide. People without long-term care insurance largely look to Medicare to pick up the costs when a disease like Alzheimer\u2019s leaves a loved one unable to take care their daily needs.\n\nThe problem? Much of the care provided at long-term facilities isn\u2019t covered by Medicare.\n\n[Read: What to Consider When Shopping for Medicare Coverage]\n\nAn Issue of Custodial Care\n\nThe basics of Medicare coverage confuse many people. If care isn\u2019t deemed \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d then Medicare won\u2019t pay for it, according to Linda Adler, founder and CEO of the patient advocacy group Pathfinders Medical.\n\n\u201cThe part that people have a challenge with is understanding what constitutes a medical issue and what constitutes assistance or custodial care,\u201d she says. Adler and others who represent patients are seeing growing demand as people, like those with Alzheimer\u2019s, are faced with mounting costs, limited resources and often confusing insurance coverage.\n\nCustodial care is often what Alzheimer\u2019s patients need most. The nonmedical care \u2013 either at home or in a long-term care facility \u2013 makes day-to-day life more manageable. Medicare doesn\u2019t cover assistance with bathing, dressing, eating and preparing meals, changing bed linens and help using the toilet.\n\nOften, in the case of Alzheimer\u2019s, a patient will become physically ill and require hospitalization for something like pneumonia or a broken hip. After inpatient treatment at the hospital, Medicare will cover some of the costs for a limited period of skilled nursing and custodial care at a nursing or rehabilitation facility. But when this period, usually 100 days, runs out, the patient is no longer covered.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when the family could come together and care for elders at home,\u201d Adler says. \u201cBut families now are different in many ways, and often when patients are in need of basic care, they are unable to get it from traditionally available sources.\u201d\n\nMost families depend on all working-age adults to contribute to the household income, so when a debilitating illness strikes, few can quit their jobs to care for a loved one. With Alzheimer\u2019s, however, putting an elderly family member in long-term care \u2013 without the help of long-term care coverage \u2013 can be a near impossibility.\n\n[Read: Dealing With Parkinson\u2019s Disease-Related Depression]\n\nCosts of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n\nIn 2014, costs associated with Alzheimer\u2019s care are expected to reach $214 billion, making it the most expensive condition in the country, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. The amount needed to provide care for one Alzheimer\u2019s patient ranges from $21 an hour for a home health aide to $239 a day for care in a nursing home.\n\nWithout insurance coverage for these costs, families can easily go into medical debt. Or they could try to reduce the patient\u2019s assets in an effort to qualify for Medicaid, which has more liberal coverage for long-term care of low-income Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nAdler says people must consider their options and make plans before it becomes an emergency. Talking with older family members about their wishes before they are incapacitated by a disease like Alzheimer\u2019s is crucial.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand Medicare, long-term care insurance, the different types of coverage available and the different housing options within their communities,\u201d she says.\n\nWaiting for a crisis will only make it more difficult to find the right services when it\u2019s crunch time.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of great educational support out there and services that can help you find available senior housing, the right coverage for your needs and other options for additional assistance,\u201d Adler says.\n\nFamily history may indicate an increased risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s, but there is currently no way to know for certain if your parent, your spouse or you will develop the disease. Planning for the possibility of Alzheimer\u2019s may not be near the top of everyone\u2019s to-do list, but playing the wait-and-see game could be a costly gamble, particularly if you\u2019re counting on Medicare to cover long-term care costs.\n\n[Read: How to Protect Against Alzheimer's Disease]", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart failure occurs when the heart can\u2019t pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in the body.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "It's the most expensive condition in the country, and without insurance, families can easily go into medical debt.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Elizabeth Renter", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "It's the most expensive condition in the country, and without insurance, families can easily go into medical debt.", "title": "An Alzheimer\u2019s Complication: Some Care May Not Be Covered by Medicare", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/10/15/an-alzheimers-complication-some-care-may-not-be-covered-by-medicare", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d1/56/be588fe848a29b0d2ea03986c465/140310-alzheimers-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "An Alzheimer\u2019s Complication: Some Care May Not Be Covered by Medicare - US News", "description": "It's the most expensive condition in the country, and without insurance, families can easily go into medical debt.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],HWBucket-Aging [Consumer Advice],Alzheimer's disease,Medicare,senior health,health insurance,Elizabeth Renter", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3juw8", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-10-15", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-10-15"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/9cc5184/2147483647/crop/331x331%2B103%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fd1%2F56%2Fbe588fe848a29b0d2ea03986c465%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140310-alzheimers-editorial.jpg", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "Alzheimer's, Medicare, medicare open enrollment, medical debt, long-term care, Medicaid, Alzheimer\u2019s Association"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0382\"", "article_summary": "With Alzheimer\u2019s, however, putting an elderly family member in long-term care \u2013 without the help of long-term care coverage \u2013 can be a near impossibility.\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that only 3 in 10 people ages 65 and older won\u2019t need long-term care.\n[Read: What to Consider When Shopping for Medicare Coverage]An Issue of Custodial CareThe basics of Medicare coverage confuse many people.\nThe nonmedical care \u2013 either at home or in a long-term care facility \u2013 makes day-to-day life more manageable.\nFor people with Alzheimer\u2019s and their families, needs for care typically far exceed the scope of Medicare coverage, leaving them with few options."}
