Sometimes it's Mary Lee. Other times it's Katharine. This time, according to OCEARCH, both great whites sharks recently checked in near the South Carolina coast.

Katharine pinged in at 9:40 a.m. while Mary Lee last pinged in Thursday morning.

That's exciting news for fans of the sharks, both of which have their own Facebook pages.

Mary Lee, at 16-feet-long, 3,500 pounds (and nearly 32,000 Facebook fans) is still the big fish in town. But Katharine, a 14-foot, 2,300-pound great white has become more popular after multiple visits.

Both sharks were tagged by OCEARCH, a nonprofit organization studying the sharks. You can track all of the sharks here.
