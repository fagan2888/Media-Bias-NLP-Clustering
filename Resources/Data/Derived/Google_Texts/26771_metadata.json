It's horrible,\" Janssen told Reuters Health.\n\nThat feeling - known as gender dysphoria - may increase the risks of suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, depression and anxiety for some transgender and gender-nonconforming children, said Janssen, who wasn't involved with the new paper.\n\nWriting in Pediatrics, Dr. Elyse Pine and colleagues report on 36 patients, ages seven to 17, who were treated at two health clinics between 2010 and 2015. On average, the youths were at an early stage of puberty known as Tanner stage 3 - when the penis or breasts begin to enlarge.\n\nThe irreversible changes that come with puberty can be detrimental to the psychological and general well-being of people whose bodies don't match their gender identities, Pine and colleagues wrote.\n\n\"Puberty blockers allow those changes to be put on hold and gives kids and families time to think through the consequences, benefits and alternatives of their choices and options,\" Janssen said.\n\nIn their essay, Pine and colleagues say 89 percent of their patients eventually received puberty blockers, and insurance ultimately covered the cost in 72 percent of cases.\n\nIn some cases, insurance carriers approved puberty blockers right away, some cases were approved after an appeal and another patient coverage after a state discrimination appeal.\n\nTwo of the most popular puberty blocking treatments involve either injections or a small device implanted under the skin. Depending on the patient\u2019s age and the brand of treatment, the costs can range from approximately $3,500 to more than $20,000, Pine\u2019s team reports.\n\n\"A lot of people have heard the message that these medicines are expensive and out of reach; don't even try,\" she said.\n\nBut in fact, \u201cthis treatment can be obtained through advocacy,\" said Pine, who is affiliated with Chase Brexton Health Care in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and several states now say a gender non-discrimination clause in the 2010 Affordable Care Act covers transgender and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nHealth care providers, the authors say, should know that appealing insurance denials can succeed.\n\n\"We have a responsibility as physicians caring for these children to know a way around the insurance appeals process to know the legal routes we have available to us,\" Janssen said.\n\nPine said parents and guardians of transgender and gender-nonconforming children without health insurance should apply for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, she said, they should know that some pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs to help cover the costs of treatments.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
