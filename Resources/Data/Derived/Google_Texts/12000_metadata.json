Salon & Spa on Eddy Street, relays tenant excitement about the hotel.\n\n\"Everyone is thrilled to see what Embassy Suites will bring to our area,\" Stancombe says. \"It's so important that every business that comes to Eddy Street realizes that it's part of something special and it can be an amazing move for the company, like it has been for us.\"\n\nNicholas J. Salon is adding stations and stylists to accommodate the growing demand for its services.\n\n\"We employ 18 and are looking to add four to five new stylists. I know several businesses on Eddy Street are hiring,\" Stancombe says. \"We underestimated the amount of traffic Eddy Street would bring.\"\n\nMall updates\n\nWhat child doesn't enjoy a bounce house?
