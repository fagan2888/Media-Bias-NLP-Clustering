His body had been there for at least several days, said Officer Mike Sullivan, a Chicago police spokesman.\n\n\u201cIt is being treated as a death investigation,\u201d said Sullivan, who said police do not suspect foul play. His autopsy results are pending toxicology studies, which take four to six weeks, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.\n\nThe university had little to say about why Barnes' body remained undetected for so long.\n\n\u201cUniversity staff are making every effort to gather information on all the circumstances surrounding his passing. Until we have something more definitive from those inquiries, I can't comment on the time line,\u201d said Steve Kloehn, associate vice president for news and public affairs at the university.\n\nBarnes was a 2011 graduate of Shady Side and grew up in the Fox Chapel area, said Jennifer Roupe, a spokeswoman for the school.\n\nBarnes' family is planning a funeral in Pittsburgh, the university said. Relatives could not be reached.\n\nUniversity officials and those who knew Barnes in high school said they were saddened by his death.\n\n\u201cNick will be painfully missed. He was an excellent student, admired by faculty and peers alike,\u201d said Susan Art, the university's dean of students.\n\nAt Shady Side, Barnes ran cross country and was a member of the speech and debate team, Roupe said.\n\nHe was inducted into Cum Laude, an academic honor society.\n\nHe was an Advanced Placement scholar and a National Merit commended student.\n\n\u201cHe was passionate about English, history and math, science, language, everything. His English teachers raved about the way he could read and analyze anything, particularly Shakespeare,\u201d said Tom Colt, Barnes' college counselor and cross country coach.\n\nAlthough not a top runner, Barnes worked hard. \u201cHe went all out in every race,\u201d Colt said.\n\nBarnes was the son of William and Linda Barnes and the brother of Clara Barnes, Colt said.\n\nIn Chicago, Barnes studied at the university's Vienna program in the fall quarter of 2012, Art said. He was involved with the school's literary publication, Sliced Bread.\n\nRick Wills is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
