We've all heard about the dangers of drunk driving and this week on Inside KELOLAND, we're looking at the problem from all sides.

After a family lost their daughter to a drunk driver, they are pushing South Dakota to strengthen its laws on drinking and driving.

Then, the issue not only takes a toll on families, but on law enforcement as well. We hear from officials who are fighting drunk driving on several different levels.

And finally, drunk driving can be the consequence of a bigger issue. We talk to people from Face It Together Sioux Falls about addiction and the hope that can come with recovery.
