Meade Grigg issued the order to Florida\u2019s 60 local health department directors, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nAlthough Grigg didn\u2019t comment, agency spokeswoman Ashley Carr said the order\u2019s purpose was to promote \u201cclarity\u201d and \u201ca consistent message\u201d across the agency.\n\n\u201cNavigators are not acting on behalf of the Department of Health and this program has raised privacy concerns due to the consumer information that will be gathered for use in a federal database,\u201d Carr said in a statement.\n\nAt least one person was elated.

MT Florida Bans Obamacare Nagivators From Helping Uninsured At County Health Departments #DontFundIt http://t.co/SQmfl9XRk1 \u2014 Heather Ann Searfoss (@searfoss70) September 12, 2013\n\nHealth and Human Services Department spokesman Fabien Levy blasted the directive, calling it \u201canother blatant and shameful attempt to intimidate groups who will be working to inform Americans about their new health insurance options and help them enroll in coverage, just like Medicare counselors have been doing for years.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act navigator program has been heavily criticized by conservatives for its excessive costs, paltry attempts at vetting and inadequate training of the program\u2019s applicants.\n\nBut states like Florida, with laws in place to ensure certain restrictions are placed on navigators, are heavily criticized by liberals for attempting to \u2018block\u2019 or \u2018hinder\u2019 Obamacare enrollment.\n\nWithout such restrictions, navigators will be privy to our most personal medical and financial information because in an effort to save time in rolling out the program, the Obama administration will not require navigators to undergo any background checks, Investors.com reported.\n\nThe Investors.com article also noted that all the navigators will have assistants, who won\u2019t be vetted or properly trained either, yet they\u2019ll be privy to the same personal information.\n\nEach navigator and assistant will be paid $20 to $48 an hour, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe training, vetting and privacy concerns were aired at a Cabinet meeting in August attended by Gov. Rick Scott, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the information that people will provide to give navigators assistance is safe,\u201d the Miami Herald reported McCarty as saying. \u201cThe information given by applicants will be shared by the Health and Human Services and other federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, Homeland Security and the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d\n\nCoverage under the Affordable Care Act is scheduled go into effect Jan 1.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The state of Florida issued a directive late Monday prohibiting the so-called Obamacare navigators from working on the premises of county health departments.
