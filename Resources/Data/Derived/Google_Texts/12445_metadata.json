She already has discussed with her children and her doctor how she wishes to spend her last days.\n\nSeventy-three-year-old Arlene Krejci said talking to her adult children about how she wants to die reminded her of the conservation she had with them years ago about the birds and the bees.\n\nFor more info The Lowcountry Senior Center on James Island routinely offers classes to help members and nonmembers develop end-of-life plans. For more information, call 762-9555 or visit the center\u2019s website lowcountryseniorcenter.org for a schedule. For a packet of information to initiate this conversation with a doctor or your family members, visit agingwithdignity.org or call 1-888-594-7437.\n\n\u201cIt was the same thing as talking to your children about sex. ... You don\u2019t wait until your child is 15 to have the conversation. You have the conversation as they\u2019re coming up. It\u2019s easier,\u201d said Krejci, who lives on James Island and volunteers at the Lowcountry Senior Center. \u201cWe had the conversation (about death) while I\u2019m fine and healthy. Don\u2019t wait until I\u2019m sucking on the oxygen tank or whatever because then it\u2019s a shock.\u201d\n\nKrejci contends that this end-of-life discussion was necessary, but not very difficult. She\u2019s in the minority.\n\nVarious reports indicate only a quarter to a third of adults in this country have laid out their wishes in an \u201cadvanced care directive,\u201d a document that details, among other things, the health care interventions that they want in their final days.\n\nSix years ago, lawmakers tried to prioritize this type of end-of-life planning in the federal Affordable Care Act, but the debate quickly devolved into mudslinging as tea party politicians accused the law\u2019s proponents of sanctioning government-run \u201cdeath panels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe medical community was very frustrated at that time because this is a good thing, but it got demonized and politicized, and when that happened, you can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d said Dr. Pat Cawley, Medical University Hospital\u2019s executive director. \u201cYou have to retreat.\u201d\n\nNow, Cawley, and others, are hopeful that the country is ready to move past this inflammatory rhetoric. Medicare announced earlier this month that it will start paying doctors to provide \u201cadvanced care planning\u201d for beneficiaries on Jan. 1.\n\nThe appointments \u2014 during which physicians will basically discuss with their patients how they\u2019d like to spend their dying days \u2014 will be voluntary for some 55 million Americans who qualify for Medicare. The federal government technically already pays doctors to provide this service, but only during a patient\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Medicare\u201d visit.\n\n\u201cThey may not need these services when they first enroll,\u201d the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid acknowledged in a press release about the new policy. The upcoming change will allow patients and their doctors to discuss advanced-care planning when it\u2019s most convenient for both of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely ground-breaking,\u201d said Dr. Scott Lake, director of palliative medicine and post-acute care for Roper St. Francis. \u201cWe have traditionally paid for inventions like MRIs and chemotherapy and all these other kinds of things, and now we\u2019re saying having conversations about what the patients\u2019 wishes and goals are is equally as important as some of the other interventions we might do.\u201d\n\nThese conversations will likely cover the types of treatments patients want to forgo at the end; how long, if at all, patients want to survive on life-support; and whether they\u2019d like to die at a hospital, at a hospice center or at home.\n\nBetty Ochoa, 82, who lives in West Ashley, said she has seen friends die in all three settings.\n\n\u201cMost of them, though, have done it in hospice, which seems to me, in today\u2019s time, the ideal way \u2014 not to be hooked up to 10,000 medications and tubes and have that hospital bill just climb up exorbitantly,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I definitely don\u2019t want to have.\u201d\n\nOchoa wrote down her end-of-life decisions in a document that she shared with her daughter and her family doctor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very realistic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd having seen what had happened to different people, and living in Charleston alone, I made up my mind to make sure everyone who needed to be informed was duly informed.\u201d\n\nWhile her doctor was \u201cdelighted\u201d to have this conversation, Ochoa recalled, other physicians may be more reluctant. Some medical professionals aren\u2019t always comfortable talking about death with healthy patients \u2014 nor are all of them trained very well to do it.\n\nA report published earlier this year by the Institute of Medicine, called \u201cDying in America,\u201d explains that few medical educators teach the communication skills needed for physicians to provide \u201cgood end-of-life care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conversation, first of all, is a very, very hard conversation. ... Not every doctor at MUSC is good at that conversation,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cSome people are naturally gifted at it, but I would say the vast majority of people who do it \u2014 and do it well \u2014 have gotten training.\u201d\n\nLake said this may be one of the drawbacks to the new Medicare reimbursement policy. Just because the federal government is prepared to pay physicians to facilitate more of these end-of-life health care conversations with their Medicare patients, physicians may need time to catch up.\n\n\u201cThese conversations take time and the resulting document \u2014 or whatever you come out with \u2014 is only as good as the quality of the conversation that you have had,\u201d Lake said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that all physicians are ready to have an experienced conservation with the patient and their family members.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid have proposed reimbursing doctors $86 for the first 30 minutes of an \u201cadvanced care planning\u201d consultation with a Medicare patient, and $75 for every 30-minute block after that, Lake said.\n\nThe new policy is open for public comment at cms.gov.\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Debate over \u2018death panels\u2019 turns into Medicare end-of-life consultations, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid,end of life,Lowcountry Senior Center,MUSC,Roper St. Francis,seniors", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Seventy-three-year-old Arlene Krejci said talking to her adult children about how she wants to die reminded her of the conservation she had with them years ago about the birds and the bees.", "title": "Debate over \u2018death panels\u2019 turns into Medicare end-of-life consultations", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150719/150719443/debate-over-x2018-death-panels-x2019-turns-into-medicare-end-of-life-consultations", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150719/PC16/150719443/AR/0/AR-150719443.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150719/PC16/150719443/AR/0/AR-150719443.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seventy-three-year-old Arlene Krejci said talking to her adult children about how she wants to die reminded her of the conservation she had with them years ago about the birds and the bees.", "title": "Debate over \u2018death panels\u2019 turns into Medicare end-of-life consultations", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150719/PC16/150719443/AR/0/AR-150719443.jpg?201507192107", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150719443}}, "keywords": "Debate over \u2018death panels\u2019 turns into Medicare end-of-life consultations , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid,end of life,Lowcountry Senior Center,MUSC,Roper St. Francis,seniors", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T21:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-19T21:07:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Seventy-three-year-old Arlene Krejci said talking to her adult children about how she wants to die reminded her of the conservation she had with them years ago about the birds and the bees."}, "article_summary": "Medicare announced earlier this month that it will start paying doctors to provide \u201cadvanced care planning\u201d for beneficiaries on Jan. 1.\nJust because the federal government is prepared to pay physicians to facilitate more of these end-of-life health care conversations with their Medicare patients, physicians may need time to catch up.\nThe federal government technically already pays doctors to provide this service, but only during a patient\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Medicare\u201d visit.\nFor more info The Lowcountry Senior Center on James Island routinely offers classes to help members and nonmembers develop end-of-life plans.\nFor a packet of information to initiate this conversation with a doctor or your family members, visit agingwithdignity.org or call 1-888-594-7437."}
