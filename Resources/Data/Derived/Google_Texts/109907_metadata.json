Colorado next faces the Tampa Bay Lightning Sunday at 5 p.m. in the Pepsi Center.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why we\u2019re on the ice today is because we\u2019re not going to skate tomorrow morning,\u201d Patrick Roy said. \u201cIf it would have been a 7 o\u2019clock game, I don\u2019t think we would be here today. The fact that tomorrow morning, we\u2019re not even going to be going to the rink, so I thought it would be good for us to go for less than 30 minutes, 25 minutes, just move our pick, move our feet, to make sure we\u2019re ready for a strong game tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRoy is reluctant to look ahead, but I asked him what the 4-1 victory at Chicago Friday could mean for this team.\n\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, I was a little nervous for that game because we played so well against Los Angeles, and we haven\u2019t been rewarded (for) our effort,\u201d said Roy. \u201cLast night, we were. I was a little nervous in the way that I was hoping that we would not be discouraged \u2026 Actually, it was the opposite. The guys showed a lot of poise out there. They showed that they were not going to give up and that meant a lot.\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, the Avalanche (61 points) is seven points out of the final Western Conference wild-card playoff spot, which at this point would go to the San Jose Sharks. Realistically, Colorado\u2019s playoff chances are slim, in part because it\u2019s more than making up points. The Avalanche would have to pass Dallas, Minnesota, Los Angeles and one other team \u2014 with the most likely candidates being Calgary and Vancouver. And when all those teams play each other, somebody has to win and there will be some three-point games.\n\nRoy said he wouldn\u2019t change his recent lineup, so barring snow-shoveling mishaps in the next 26 hours, Daniel Briere and Stefan Elliott will be the healthy scratches and Semyon Varlamov will be in goal. And Paul Carey, recalled from Lake Erie for the third time this season on Feb. 13, will play his fourth consecutive game on the fourth line.\n\nIn the Avalanche briefs from Chicago, Roy cited Carey\u2019s speed as a helpful asset at this point.\n\n\u201cI try to bring some energy and use my speed as much as I can,\u201d Carey, who had a full four-season career at Boston College, said after Saturday\u2019s practice. \u201cWhether that\u2019s on the forecheck, backcheck, I\u2019ll try to create more space for my linemates if I can.\u201d\n\nCarey played 12 regular season games for the Avalanche last season, plus the first three playoff games against Minnesota when Matt Duchene was out. He said he wasn\u2019t disillusioned to end up back at Lake Erie for much of this season.\n\n\u201cI knew there were a lot of aspects of my game I needed to fine-tune,\u201d he said. \u201cI think sending me down just kind of gives me a kick in the butt and really puts me to work. I\u2019d obviously rather be here. It\u2019s not a good feeling to go down. There\u2019s two ways to take it. You can go to work or you can kind of give up.\u201d\n\nIn his third full pro season, Carey already is 26.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot in college, but it\u2019s just such a different schedule, such a different grind in general,\u201d Carey said. \u201cIn pro hockey, there\u2019s a lot more x\u2019s and o\u2019s and I had to learn a lot more \u2018D\u2019 zone. I had to be a lot more responsible with that stuff. You can\u2019t get away with it at this level.\u201d\n\nDoes he have hopes of becoming more than a fourth-line \u201cenergy\u201d guy?\n\n\u201cEvery time I come up, that\u2019s my goal, to work my way up in the lineup,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of on me and how hard I work and what I can bring to the upcoming games.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead: In the Sunday paper and online, I\u2019ll have a couple of pieces, filed Friday from Chicago, taking looks at Avalanche \u201cscooter\u201d defensemen of past and present. Coincidentally, both played major junior for the Kelowna Rockets, though their stays didn\u2019t overlap.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Avalanche,Patrick Roy,Paul Carey,Tampa Bay Lightning", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "As of Saturday afternoon, the Avalanche (61 points) is seven points out of the final Western Conference wild-card playoff spot, which at this point would go to the San Jose Sharks.
