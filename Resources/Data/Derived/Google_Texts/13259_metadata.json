But last week\u2019s stunning loss by the United Auto Workers at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., is a seminal event in the history of the labor movement. Union membership has fallen consistently over the past 60 years, and the UAW loss suggests there\u2019s no way for labor to reverse the trend \u2014 at least not in the private sector. But why?\n\nThe UAW blames Republican politicians and conservative groups \u2014 outside agitators, if you will. Sen. Bob Corker, a former Chattanooga mayor, weighed in on opposing unionization at the plant during the voting, claiming a vote against the union would enhance the chances that VW would give the plant the right to build SUVs, adding hundreds of jobs. But the bigger problem was that the union had little to offer prospective members. Workers get little in return for paying dues that equal two hours\u2019 pay monthly.\n\nThere was a time when the difference between a union job and a nonunion job paid off. Unions offered job protection, steady wage increases and, most importantly, generous benefits, including first-rate health insurance. Indeed, the reason most employees receive health insurance through their employers is that unions demanded the benefit in their collective bargaining agreements during World War II when the National War Labor Board imposed a freeze on wages. The new benefit \u2014 which was tax-free \u2014 was so popular with workers that even nonunion employers adopted it in order to attract employees.\n\nBut with the advent of ObamaCare, even that union advantage has disappeared. Not only is health insurance now available to everyone (though not everyone wants to pay for it), but unions can\u2019t bargain for the kind of Cadillac policies they once could. Even with union carve-outs granted by the administration, most employers will balk at gold-plated policies when forced to pay ObamaCare\u2019s 40-percent excise tax and can do so with impunity as long as the plans they offer meet the ObamaCare minimum requirements.\n\nWage differences between union and nonunion jobs are significant in some industries, but they often come with a price. Markets determine wages, no matter how hard unions and governments try to interfere.\n\nUnions can negotiate higher wages only if productivity also increases so that owners still make a profit worth the risk and investment it takes to stay in business. But union work rules often impede productivity. And even if productivity doesn\u2019t lag, competition from nonunion companies producing similar products or offering similar services at a lower cost may make union companies less profitable. If unionization pushes wages higher than the market will bear, those companies are forced to cut jobs or go out of business. A union card doesn\u2019t do you much good if your job disappears because of it.\n\nNo doubt all of these factors played a role in the decision by the majority of VW\u2019s workers to vote against the UAW. But politics also played a role, though not in the way the UAW alleges.\n\nThe UAW, like the rest of the labor movement, has spent increasing energy and resources on politics as its membership has shrunk. Unions now devote as much if not more time and money to electing Democrats than they do to organizing new members. Some 90 percent of union political contributions go to Democratic candidates, and union staff and \u201cvolunteers\u201d are the backbone of campaigns to elect Democrats at all levels of government. Yet 40 percent of union households voted Republican in the last presidential election, despite unions\u2019 unprecedented efforts to turn out their vote for the Democrats.\n\nMany of the Chattanooga VW workers, no doubt, felt a cultural rift between their values and those of the UAW. Unions have become little more than subsidiaries of the Democratic Party, promoting liberal policies with which many of their own members disagree. And union dues pay for bloated bureaucracies and entrenched union leadership not open to effective challenge.\n\nNo wonder fewer than seven in 100 private-sector workers choose to join a union.\n\nThe UAW and the rest of the labor movement can expect more disappointments like that in Chattanooga, and there\u2019s not a lot unions can do to change it.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s not often that a union election makes front-page news.
