The health department also established a state health insurance exchange under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nDepartment spokesman Bill Schwarz said the move has been in the works for weeks.\n\nShah's interim replacement will be Dr. Howard Zucker, the department's first deputy commissioner since last September. He was a clinical professor of anesthesiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and a pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.\n\nRepublican candidate for governor Rob Astorino earlier Wednesday called for Shah to resign, citing a news report about department delays inspecting abortion clinics and delays in the department's study on the health impact of deep drilling for natural gas by hydraulic fracturing, which is prohibited with the study pending.\n\nAstorino opposes abortion and supports fracking.\n\nCuomo administration officials say Shah's departure is unrelated to Astorino's comments or the press report on clinic inspections. Shah's new job will be as Kaiser's senior vice president, chief operating officer for clinical operations for the Southern California region.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "fracking, health commissioner, Nirav Shah, news", "title": "NY Health Commissioner Nirav Shah, a target of fracking critics, quits for Calif. job", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"NY Health Commissioner Nirav Shah, a target of fracking critics, quits for Calif. job\", \"link\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/ny_health_commissioner_nirav_shah_a_target_of_fracking_critics_quits_for_calif_j.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/news/photo/2014/04/nirav-shah-3ab9d0b955ce883f.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12627267\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-10T03:35:03Z\", \"author\": \"The Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"@topstory\",\"fracking\",\"health commissioner\",\"Nirav Shah\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@AP", "site": "@syracusedotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Health department spokesman Bill Schwarz said the move has been in the works for weeks."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, April 09, 2014, 11:51 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.syracuse.com/news/photo/2014/04/nirav-shah-3ab9d0b955ce883f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"syrapnews\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"1826437\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Central NY News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "syracuse.com", "description": "Health department spokesman Bill Schwarz said the move has been in the works for weeks.", "title": "NY Health Commissioner Nirav Shah, a target of fracking critics, quits for Calif. job", "url": "http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/ny_health_commissioner_nirav_shah_a_target_of_fracking_critics_quits_for_calif_j.html", "image": "http://imgick.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/news/photo/2014/04/nirav-shah-3ab9d0b955ce883f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "syracuse.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/APNews"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, April 09, 2014, 11:31 PM", "article_author": "The Associated Press", "Description": "Health department spokesman Bill Schwarz said the move has been in the works for weeks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8346\"", "article_summary": "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York Health Commissioner Dr. Nirav Shah will step down in June to take an executive position with Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California, the health department said Wednesday.\nThe health department also established a state health insurance exchange under the federal Affordable Care Act.\nDuring Shah's tenure as state health commissioner, he became a lightning rod for critics of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas because of the Cuomo administration's plan for an extended review of the technology.\nShah's new job will be as Kaiser's senior vice president, chief operating officer for clinical operations for the Southern California region.\nShah's interim replacement will be Dr. Howard Zucker, the department's first deputy commissioner since last September."}
