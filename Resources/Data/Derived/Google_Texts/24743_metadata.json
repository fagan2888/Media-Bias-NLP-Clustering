The DOE still hasn\u2019t agreed to any new deadlines.\n\nThe GAO blamed mismanagement and technology problems for the delays and cost overruns. \u201cContractor data indicate that significant, unresolved design issues remain, and recent internal and external reviews show that some facilities may require extensive and expensive rework,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nThe Hanford site, a 586-square-mile complex, was built beginning in 1944 as part of the Manhattan Project. It was home to nine nuclear reactors, including the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world, as well as five large plutonium-processing facilities.\n\nWhen the weapons production reactors were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War, tens of millions of gallons of high-level radioactive waste was left stored under the facility.\n\nRelated: Government Waste Gets a New Warrior\n\nNow, the Department of Energy has proposed building two more facilities to \"speed up\" the process. The agency estimates each would cost at least $1 billion and take potentially eight years to construct.\n\nHowever, the GAO\u2019s latest report warns that the two structures would likely be far more expensive than officials are estimating, pointing at the problems the current facility has already run into.\n\n\u201cDOE's preliminary cost and schedule estimates for constructing the two proposed facilities are not reliable because they do not meet industry best practices for reliable cost and schedule estimates,\u201d the auditors said in the report.\n\nThey added that the DOE failed to include some costs crucial to the project, which is being designed and constructed by Bechtel National Inc.\n\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s $90 Billion \u2018Slush Fund\u2019 Comes Under Attack\n\nBeyond the cost and schedule delays, auditors raised serious safety concerns.\n\n\u201cIn addition to cost and schedule overruns, the project has long faced technical and management challenges,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor example, over the past 10 years, we have found that DOE\u2019s Office of River Protection, which is responsible for managing the construction of the WTP, has been unable to successfully demonstrate the technology selected to prevent a nuclear accident.\u201d WTP is shorthand for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant.\n\nThis is not the first time the treatment project has been flagged for waste and mismanagement. In fact, the Energy Department has abandoned several approaches for disposing of the waste\u2014and it still hasn\u2019t figured out what will work.\n\nJust last month, Sen. Ron Wyden, (D- OR) asked auditors to probe into the Energy Department\u2019s contracting practices at the Hanford site, after receiving internal documents from Bechtel National, Inc, the contractor, revealing at least $277 million tax dollars had been spent on incomplete work orders.\n\n\u201cThe DOE has been mismanaging the cleanup at Hanford for three decades,\u201d Wyden wrote in a letter to the Energy Department\u2019s inspector general. \u201cI am outraged that the Department claims it doesn\u2019t have enough money to clean up Hanford yet allows such an egregious waste of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers deserve to know how their money has been spent and the citizens of the Pacific Northwest deserve to have this place cleaned up.\u201d\n\nThe Hanford site isn\u2019t alone. Other nuclear clean-up sites across the country have been flagged for management and oversight issues that have catapulted their cost far over budget.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For nearly 25 years, the federal government has struggled to clean up a massive stockp", "title": "$19 Billion Later, Clean-up of WWII Atomic Waste Site Still Stalled", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/19-Billion-Later-Clean-WWII-Atomic-Waste-Site-Still-Stalled", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Hazardous%20Waste%20%28REUTERS%20Ina%20Fassbender%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/19-Billion-Later-Clean-WWII-Atomic-Waste-Site-Still-Stalled", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Hazardous%20Waste%20%28REUTERS%20Ina%20Fassbender%29.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For nearly 25 years, the federal government has struggled to clean up a massive stockp", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "For nearly 25 years, the federal government has struggled to clean up a massive stockpile of World War II era nuclear waste.\nIn fact, the Energy Department has abandoned several approaches for disposing of the waste\u2014and it still hasn\u2019t figured out what will work.\nRelated: Government Waste Gets a New WarriorNow, the Department of Energy has proposed building two more facilities to \"speed up\" the process.\n\u201cIn addition to cost and schedule overruns, the project has long faced technical and management challenges,\u201d the report said.\nOther nuclear clean-up sites across the country have been flagged for management and oversight issues that have catapulted their cost far over budget."}
