But those same positions threaten to become her undoing in November.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes her candidacy so interesting.\n\nAs the national Republican Party looks for ways to expand its appeal without compromising its principles, Marilinda Garcia will provide a case study of how a GOP hardliner -- who doesn\u2019t look anything like the caricature that label calls to mind -- can fare in a tough race.\n\nThree days after her 22-point Republican primary thrashing of former state Sen. Gary Lambert -- who started the campaign as the clear favorite -- Garcia sat down with RealClearPolitics here in her hometown at a Barnes & Noble just a few hundred yards from the Massachusetts border.\n\nThat she arrived to the interview without a single aide accompanying her was unusual for a general election candidate seeking a U.S. House seat, but Garcia exudes a calmness about being on the record that is rare in high-level politicians.\n\nShe purports to have developed a thick skin but acknowledged that nothing she has done in state politics will have prepared her for the onslaught that Democrats are about to foist upon her.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a morbid curiosity,\u201d Garcia said when asked if she is ready for the deluge of negative ads. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to say about me. I mean, look, they\u2019ve already done \u2018the extremist,\u2019 so I know there will be all of that silliness. But otherwise, who knows? It\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nIn their efforts to paint her as out of the mainstream in this largely secular and moderate district, Democrats have plenty of fodder from which to cull. Two years ago, for instance, when the Republican-controlled New Hampshire House voted overwhelmingly to keep same-sex marriage legal in the state, Garcia was among the dissenters.\n\nBut it was the manner in which she expressed her opposition that would likely draw the most scrutiny in the \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d state -- where a recent poll showed that 60 percent of voters now support legalized same-sex marriage, while only 29 percent oppose it.\n\nIn an interview at the time with the Concord Monitor, Garcia expressed her belief that gay couples should not be allowed to marry since they cannot \u201cunite biologically.\u201d\n\n\"A same-sex couple cannot thus unite, therefore the state has no interest in regulating their relationship,\" she continued. \"The symbolic message of inclusion for same-sex couples in an institution that makes no sense for them would be coupled with another message: That marriage is about the desires of adults rather than the interests of children.\"\n\nDemocrats also are jumping at opportunities to paint Garcia as a proponent of extreme partisanship. During a debate earlier this year, the candidate was asked if she would vote to impeach President Obama.\n\n\u201cI would,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has many, many impeachable offenses, it seems to me, such as his disregard for our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThese days, Garcia is strumming a softer tune, telling RCP that while she is inclined to believe that Obama has indeed overstepped his constitutional authority, her vote to impeach him would depend \u201con what the outcome of the process was.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she would vote in favor of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s spending plan, Garcia sidestepped the question entirely.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sort of old news at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I have to look at it.\u201d\n\nAnd in the interview, Garcia emphasized that she is not \u201cat all\u201d running on social issues, adding that the only reason they ever come up is when liberals use them as a political wedge.\n\n\u201cThey like to paint everyone as crusading extremists when they\u2019re the ones that actually push the envelope and want to drag that into the debate,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to be a one-issue voter, that\u2019s your right. But overall, I\u2019ve never met a candidate that I agree with 100 percent either.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, suffice it to say, are not buying this more moderate version of Garcia, as they highlight her opposition to the Violence Against Women Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and abortion rights.\n\nThe Kuster campaign\u2019s first attack ad of the general election showcased footage of Garcia hugging Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who traveled to New Hampshire to campaign on her behalf the weekend before the primary.\n\n\"No amount of post-primary misdirection or Koch Brothers coaching changes the fact that Marilinda Garcia is a dangerously extreme, conservative candidate who is to the far right of her own party,\u201d said New Hampshire Democratic Party spokesperson Julie McClain. \u201cAcross the board, she supports fringe Tea Party policies that would be devastating for New Hampshire women, seniors, students, and their families.\u201d\n\nGarcia\u2019s general election campaign got off to a shaky start late last week.\n\nA staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act, she generated local headlines by initially declining to say in an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio how she receives her own health insurance coverage. (Her campaign later clarified that Garcia is covered through a short-term plan that is outside the ACA\u2019s network.)\n\nState Republican officials acknowledge privately that Garcia\u2019s occasional unsteadiness under fire could be her undoing. But on the whole, GOP power brokers seem more impressed with Garcia\u2019s promise than they are nervous that she could implode.\n\nOne longtime New Hampshire GOP strategist told RCP that while Garcia is \u201cvery young\u201d and \u201ckind of acts it sometimes,\u201d her generally unflappable demeanor has worked to her benefit.\n\n\u201cShe is mature beyond her years, yet with this naivet\u00e9 that lets her come into this without any preconceived notions of how the campaign should be,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to get under her skin.\u201d\n\nAmong Garcia\u2019s fans is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who met her for the first time during his trip to New Hampshire last week and may soon be ringing her phone off the hook to seek her support in his all-but certain 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn an interview with RCP, Paul called Garcia a \u201cwonderful, new young face to the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that so much of what blocks us to certain populations is that we haven\u2019t appeared open enough, and I think when you have a candidate who is Hispanic and young and a woman, I think all of that\u2019s great,\u201d Paul said.\n\nWhether or not she tops Kuster in November, national Republicans are likely to hold Garcia up as a model when it comes time to recruit the next round of candidates.\n\nAs for her own career advancement in national politics, Garcia denies having any grand ambitions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one of those ladder-climbers that plans everything out, because I think, one, it sets you up for disappointment,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo, I think it makes you sort of myopic about something and you miss out on a lot of opportunities that could come up.\u201d\n\nBut for the next seven weeks, at least, the task in front of Garcia is clear.\n\nWith more tough ads to withstand and one-on-one debates against a seasoned national legislator on the horizon, the final general election sprint will test her like never before.\n\nAs she took a few more sips of her venti herbal tea, Garcia said she intends to avoid the always-on-message approach that party graybeards in Washington no doubt want her to take.\n\n\u201cDo you really want everyone running for office talking in the same sound bite, using the same talking point?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s frankly disillusioning about politics. So to the extent I can get my message across and be myself, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALEM, N.H. -- If a Republican political operative were to dream up an ideal GOP congressional candidate for 2014, the image might look something like Marilinda Garcia. \nRunning for a U.S. House seat...", "title": "In N.H., Marilinda Garcia Offers Test for New-Look GOP | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/09/16/in_nh_marilinda_garcia_offers_test_for_new-look_gop_123981.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/259600_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "SALEM, N.H. -- If a Republican political operative were to dream up an ideal GOP congressional candidate for 2014, the image might look something like Marilinda Garcia. \nRunning for a U.S. House seat...", "title": "In N.H., Marilinda Garcia Offers Test for New-Look GOP | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "In N.H., Marilinda Garcia Offers Test for New-Look GOP | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "marilinda garcia,Election 2014,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10e5\"", "article_summary": "By Scott Conroy - September 16, 2014SALEM, N.H. -- If a Republican political operative were to dream up an ideal GOP congressional candidate for 2014, the image might look something like Marilinda Garcia.\nOne longtime New Hampshire GOP strategist told RCP that while Garcia is \u201cvery young\u201d and \u201ckind of acts it sometimes,\u201d her generally unflappable demeanor has worked to her benefit.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s frankly disillusioning about politics.\nTwo years ago, for instance, when the Republican-controlled New Hampshire House voted overwhelmingly to keep same-sex marriage legal in the state, Garcia was among the dissenters.\n(Her campaign later clarified that Garcia is covered through a short-term plan that is outside the ACA\u2019s network.)"}
