Today at the TCA press tour Amazon made a first appearance, acting less like an online shopping mall than a TV studio. Amazon Prime offers a slew of new shows with a lot of big-name talent, compounding the notion that TV is everything and everywhere. (Amazon exec Joe Lewis jokes that they’ll deliver via drone soon.)

“I feel very honored in bringing forth this subject,” Jeffrey Tambor said of his transitioning trans- character in “Transparent.” All 10 episodes of the dark, provocative comedy will be released simultaneously at the end of September.

Working for an emerging online network makes no difference for the actor. “The revolution has been here for some time,” Tambor said of the network/distributor as opposed to working in broadcast TV.

“I really don’t think of it as a lesser TV series,” said filmmaker-writer-director Jill Soloway (“The United States of Tara,” “Six Feet Under”). The actors are paid the equivalent of a network TV series. And “budget-wise, I’m working with more money than I’ve ever had before,” Soloway said.

She shopped the script around to the premium cable networks. “It was a risk to be part of a brand or slate” like Amazon. As a writer, she said, she got more instant feedback from Amazon than the usual lengthy uncertainty she faced at the networks. She doesn’t think the Amazon platform makes this a “webseries,” but rather sees the streaming service as the next evolution in independent filmmaking.

As for the transgender content: “As a feminist,” Soloway said, “I think a lot about what it means, to explore the feminine within the feminist…what it means to think about a wounded father replaced by a blossoming femininity… The ideas about gender freedom…It’s fertile ground.”
