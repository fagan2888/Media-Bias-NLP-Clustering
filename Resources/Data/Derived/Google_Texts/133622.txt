The Wine Dog hosted its annual Toast for the Paws event Friday night.

About 300 people enjoyed a night of music, food, and of course wine. Along with admission, those who attended the event had to bring some type of item for the shelter to use; like dog food, paper towels or a toy.

Proceeds from the event benefit the Humane Society of Bay County.

Visitors had a chance to sample more than 70 different wines and craft beers. This is the largest third-party fundraiser for the humane society each year.

"It's always a shock to us that we have a great giving community," explained Sean Brosnan, a Board Member for the Humane Society of Bay County. "We put the event out there, we put it on Facebook, we got our e-mail followers that we have, you can see the support. The second we opened the door, it was flooded with people, so we love that because we wouldn't exist without the community and the support from the community"

Managers with the Wine Dog say they expected to raise more than $10,000 for the humane society.
