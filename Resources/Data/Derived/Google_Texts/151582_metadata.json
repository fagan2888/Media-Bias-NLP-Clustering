Tom Corbett and his challenger, Tom Wolf.\n\nThat was demonstrated in the two debates that have taken place, encounters in which social issues barely registered. Mr. Corbett continues to defend his record on school funding against Democratic attacks while trying to portray a Wolf administration as a recipe for higher taxes.\n\nThe Wolf campaign has been clear in its call for a 5 percent severance tax on natural gas drilling. More than content to keep the race a referendum on the poll-challenged incumbent, the Democrat has been sparer in providing specific details of his plans in other areas, such as his call to overhaul the personal income tax, or to address the state's unfunded pension liabilities.\n\nThe Corbett campaign's efforts to raise questions about Wolf proposals, however, have been repeatedly blunted by the setbacks and distractions. Those include the governor's continuing tension with a GOP controlled Legislature, an awkward relationship that ended the administration's record of enacting budgets on time. The summer broght repeated downgrades to the state's bond rating and upticks in unemployment at a time when the administration was trying to highlight its economic progress. Then came the administration's difficulty in documenting the duties or work product of Ron Tomalis, the former education secretary who remained on the state payroll until the controversy over his work emerged. Next came the Wolf campaign chortling over some embarrassing job postings on a state web site, and, of course, the continuing scrutiny of pornographic emails exchanged my members of Mr. Corbett's current and former staffers.\n\nOn the school budgets issue, Mr. Wolf added his voice to the complaints that began with Mr. Corbett's first budget, contending that he had stripped $1 billion from the state's education funding. Mr. Corbett counters that he's actually added more than $1 billion to school funding, bringing the state's total to record levels. The difference lies in which dollars are used in the competing partisan equations.\n\nFrom the point of view of the school districts \u2014 and the Democratic critique \u2014 the fact is that the amount of aid they received from the state was cut sharply beginning with the first Corbett budget. But the administration accurately points out that the state's education spending had been buttressed by federal stimulus dollars in the final two years of the Rendell administration.\n\nMr. Corbett and other administration officials have also said that schools were unwise in using the federal dollars in the basic operating budgets, suggesting that the funds should have been used for long-term capital projects. In fact, however, that portion of the federal stimulus was designed to shore up operating budgets, to at least temporarily ward off layoffs.\n\nThe Corbett administration clearly inherited a huge fiscal problem in the loss of the federal dollars. And it can be argued that the decision not to replace that funding stream with state tax dollars was the least unpalatable budget choice officials could have made given alternatives such as raising taxes in an economic downturn or making deep cuts in other areas of the budget. But it was a choice, not an inevitable result of actions by the prior state administration or the federal government\n\nMr. Wolf argues that the cutbacks could have been countered by the revenue from the 5 percent severance tax he has advocated. That, he estimates, would yield roughly $1 billion annually to start, and still more as the industry grows. Mr. Corbett contends that the impact fee on gas wells is a more reasonable way to capture revenue from a new industry.\n\nMr. Wolf hasn't detailed his severance tax plan but says that its revenue would replace the current impact fee's aid to municipalities in the Marcellus region. Part of it would also go to environmental protection and regulation. But that would still leave a substantial portion for education.\n\nHe has also proposed a restructuring of funding for charter schools that would free up roughly $365 million for traditional public school districts.\n\nOther elements of his platform are murkier, however. The Democrat holds out an overall goal of raising the state's share of school costs to 50 percent from its current level of a little more than a third, a development that in theory would allow schools districts to lower property taxes. But he hasn't spelled out how much or how long that would take.\n\nHe has also called for a structural overhaul of the state's personal income levy designed to make it more progressive. The state has a flat tax rate of 3.07 percent. The state Constitution has a so-called uniformity clause that bars the graduated rate structure used by many state as well as the federal government. Mr. Wolf would get around that requirement by creating a substantial personal deduction and combining that with a new, higher tax rate. That would mean that most taxpayers would pay less while the more affluent would pay more, since a higher proportion of their income would be above the exempt level.\n\nBut the proposal remains more of a concept than a detailed plan, as Mr. Wolf has studiously resisted spelling out either the deduction level or the new tax rate. Without those details, it's impossible to know whether the proposal would help or harm individual taxpayers.\n\nThe two contenders regularly criticize one another's plans for dealing with the state's pension issues. At the rhetorical level, Mr. Corbett calls it a pension crisis and contends that Mr. Wolf is putting his head in the sand in terming it a problem, which, if neglected, will become a crisis.\n\nMr. Corbett has yet to produce any progress on the issue. He's urged the Legislature to enact a plan offered by state Rep. Mike Tobash, R-Schuykill Haven, which would create a hybrid of a defined benefit and a defined contribution plan for future retirees. How much that would help the state's future finances is a subject for debate. Mr. Corbett acknowledges, however, that it would not address the massive and growing unfunded liability the state faces for the pensions of current and past state and school employees. Mr. Corbett said he would call a special session of the Legislature to meet that challenge.\n\nMr. Wolf says he supports a continued defined benefit plan. He has not offered any concrete proposals for dealing with the unfunded liability, although he has said that a pension obligation bond \u2014 borrowing to take advantage of currently low interest rates \u2014 could be part of the solution. Despite that vagueness, the Democrat has repeatedly pledged that he will work with Legislature to tackle the issue.\n\nMr. Corbett achieved a significant policy victory earlier this summer when the federal government agreed to a modified form of his proposal to expand Medicaid through private insurers rather than the straightforward government paid model originally envisioned in the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Wolf criticized him for costing the state money in the short term by not simply agreeing to the standard Medicaid expansion. He has said that if elected he wold consider rejecting the Corbett plan reverting to that standard model.\n\nAnother accomplishment for the Corbett administration was the long-sought transportation agreement, funded by tax changes that included the lifting of a cap on the wholesale price of gasoline. Mr. Wolf called the legislation \"a good start.'' But it won the votes of many Democrats, that didn't stop them, along with some conservative Republicans, from portraying the law as a repudiation of the no-tax pledge that Mr. Corbett ran on in 2010. Mr. Corbett resists the characterization of the bill as a tax hike, instead saying that it lifted \"an artificial cap,'' on the wholesale tax. In a bit of luck for an administration that often seem short on that commodity, the effects of the revenue increase have been shielded from consumers by an overall decline in gasoline prices.\n\nEarlier in the administration, it seemed likely that Mr. Corbett's re-election campaign would spark renewed battles over hot-button issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Early on, Mr. Corbett had voiced support for a bill that would have mandated invasive ultra-sound testing for women seeking abortions. But the measure died in the Legislature without reaching his desk. The administration also went to court to defend the state's same-sex marriage law, a controversy that prompted a much criticized observation from the governor comparing same-sex marriage to incest. But the administration muted that debate when it declined to appeal a court ruling voiding the same-sex ban.\n\nA similar legal retreat on a ruling against the state's enacted but never enforced voter ID bill lowered the temperature of the debate on that issue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Education funding and taxes continuing to dominate the policy argument between Gov.
