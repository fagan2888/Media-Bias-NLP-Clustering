Friday night’s all right for bill actions: Gov. Andrew Cuomo went down to the wire on more than 70 bills that required his signature or veto by midnight.

Among the more notable vetoes were two measures meant to enhance the public’s understanding of the inner workings of government: As the TU’s Rex Smith recently wrote, one of the measures would have heightened the potential consequences for government entities that ignore state Freedom of Information Law by commanding that a judge “shall” award legal fees to plaintiffs seeking documents. The other would reduce the amount of time government can delay release by appealing a court ruling.

In his veto message, Cuomo called the bills “myopic in their scope” because as currently structured, FOIL law is more rigorous on the executive branch than on the Legislature. (This point was part of Cuomo’s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I? response to legislative criticisms of his administration’s expansion of a 90-day automatic email deletion policy across executive agencies; under withering pressure, the administration dropped the policy last spring.)

“As I stated repeatedly, any reform to the state’s FOIL laws must apply uniformly and equitably to all parties, and ensure that both legislative and executive branches of state government are subject to the same FOIL provisions,” Cuomo wrote. “To that end, I will be advancing comprehensive FOIL reform in the next legislative session that applies equally to the Executive and the Legislature, improves transparency, and increases accountability.”

The governor also argued that both bills would have impeded judicial discretion in transparency cases.

Cuomo also vetoed a bill that would restrain the State Liquor Authority from taking disciplinary action against a New York licensee for violations of other states’ liquor laws until regulators in those states had completed their own disciplinary actions against those violators. The measure was inspired by SLA’s pursuit of the Colonie retailer Empire Wine, which is August 2014 was cited for shipping to consumers in more than a dozen states where such shipments are illegal.

“I am fully committed to advancing and promoting New York’s alcoholic beverage industry,” Cuomo wrote in his veto message. “However, signing this bill would jeopardize the State’s achievements by sending a clear signal that New York is a haven for entities intent on breaking other states’ laws, avoiding other states’ legitimately imposed taxes and regulations, and selling to minors with impunity.”

” … However, I have consistently stated that portions of (state Alcoholic Beverage Control Law) need to be amended for modern-day business practices, specifically regarding E-commerce. Accordingly, I am directing representative, interested stakeholder, and advocates to review and suggest changes to the law. I am also directing SLA to work collaboratively with liquor authorities in other states to address these issues and propose recommendations for legal interstate sales.”

Assemblyman Phil Steck of Colonie, who sponsored the bill with Long Island Republican Sen. Phil Boyle, expressed his disappointment in a statement.

“I had hoped that our Governor would join me in recognizing the need to guard against excessive accumulation of power by our administrative agencies,” Steck wrote. “Businesses should not have to spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees fighting agencies that have overstepped their bounds. This is destructive of democracy and of people’s faith in their government. While corruption may inspire more headlines, this problem should also be the focus of reform efforts.”

Cuomo also vetoed a bill that would have swapped out the word “failing” for “struggling” in the definition of the schools across the state that are, uh, challenged in terms of students’ performances.

Cuomo noted that the bill failed to amend the terms in the $75 million appropriation for the program meant to deal with “failing” schools, which could lead to inconsistent definitions. Also, “I do not believe in making isolated changes outside of a larger conversation about our State’s commitment to maximizing student achievement at these schools,” the governor wrote.

In pet-related legislation, the governor vetoed a bill that would have exempted hunting dogs from the definition of pets illegally “running at large,” a change that Cuomo said could create hassles for property owners confronted by hunting dogs on their land and local law enforcement who would have to respond to such cases.
