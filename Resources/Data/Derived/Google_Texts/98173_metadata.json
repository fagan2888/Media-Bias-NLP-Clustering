But for non-profits, it has issued new rules, effective now, and has gone full steam ahead with its litigation.\"\n\nAs the Little Sisters' lawsuit continued to progress, the federal government revised its rules on granting accomodations for non-profits.\n\nOriginally, HHS allowed for non-profits to be exempted provided they sign a form and send it to a third party that would provide the contraceptive coverage.\n\nGroups like Little Sisters found this to still be in conflict with their beliefs, arguing that approving a form still involved them in supporting practices they find morally objectionable.\n\nThe new rules, released last month, added an additional layer, giving nonprofits the option of contacting HHS about their objections and then HHS being the entity that contacted the third party. But HHS is still requiring Little Sisters to sign a form that could activate the coverage that they find morally objectionable.\n\nLast September, the Little Sisters of the Poor filed a suit against HHS over the controversial \"preventive services\" mandate, arguing that it violated their conscience to be connected to providing birth control coverage.\n\nWhile the mandate exempts churches under the \"religious employers\" category, the Little Sisters did not receive an automatic exemption.\n\n\"We believe the government's attempt to coerce us in this manner is wrong, and that it violates our religious liberty,\" stated the Little Sisters last year.\n\n\"So, like many other Catholic and religious institutions around the country, we felt the need to seek legal recourse.\"\n\nIn January, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted the Little Sisters a temporary injunction, protecting them from having to conform to the mandate as their case continued.\n\n\"\u2026 respondents are temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\" ordered Sotomayor.\n\nDuring the summer, the Tenth Circuit scheduled oral arguments for the appeal in the Little Sisters lawsuit for Monday, September 29.\n\n\"All sides have asked the court to keep that oral argument date, and we are waiting to hear from the court about whether it will do so in light of the government's new rules,\" said Keim to CP.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The federal government has decided to continue its legal action regarding a lawsuit from a Catholic order seeking an exemption from the Health and Human Services Department's contraception mandate.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "After Losing to Hobby Lobby, Obama Fighting Nuns Over Birth Control Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "The federal government has decided to continue its legal action regarding a lawsuit from a Catholic order seeking an exemption from the Health and Human Services Department's contraception mandate.", "title": "After Losing to Hobby Lobby, Obama Fighting Nuns Over Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/after-losing-to-hobby-lobby-obama-fighting-nuns-over-birth-control-mandate-126134/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/73768/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "author": "Michael Gryboski", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/73768/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "description": "The federal government has decided to continue its legal action regarding a lawsuit from a Catholic order seeking an exemption from the Health and Human Services Department's contraception mandate.", "site": "@ChristianPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "After Losing to Hobby Lobby, Obama Fighting Nuns Over Birth Control Mandate"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/after-losing-to-hobby-lobby-obama-fighting-nuns-over-birth-control-mandate-126134/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "nuns,Catholics,Little&20Sisters&20of&20the&20Poor,court&20cases,lawsuit,HHS,government,lawsuit,appeal,Tenth&20Circuit,brief,supplemental&20brief,birth&20control,The&20Becket&20Fund,new&20rules,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2014-09-09T15:55:00-04:00", "modDate": "2014-09-09T15:55:00-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "nuns, Catholics, Little Sisters of the Poor, court cases, lawsuit, HHS, government, lawsuit, appeal, Tenth Circuit, brief, supplemental brief, birth control, The Becket Fund, new rules,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11bf\"", "article_summary": "During the summer, the Tenth Circuit scheduled oral arguments for the appeal in the Little Sisters lawsuit for Monday, September 29.\nWhile the mandate exempts churches under the \"religious employers\" category, the Little Sisters did not receive an automatic exemption.\nAs the Little Sisters' lawsuit continued to progress, the federal government revised its rules on granting accomodations for non-profits.\nBut HHS is still requiring Little Sisters to sign a form that could activate the coverage that they find morally objectionable.\nThe Little Sisters are being represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is overseeing dozens of lawsuits against HHS over the \"preventive services\" mandate."}
