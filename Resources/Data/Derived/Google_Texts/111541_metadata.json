In regular driving, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times more pollution.\n\nVolkswagen has admitted to the accusations, and its U.S. CEO offered a \"sincere apology\" to lawmakers during a testy hearing on Capitol Hill last week.\n\n\"On behalf of our company, and my colleagues in Germany, I would like to offer a sincere apology for Volkswagen\u2019s use of a software program that served to defeat the regular emissions testing regime,\" Volkswagen's CEO for North America, Michael Horn, said during a Thursday hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel.\n\n\"These events are deeply troubling,\" he added. \"I did not think that something like this was possible at the Volkswagen Group. We have broken the trust of our customers, dealerships and employees, as well as the public and regulators.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The company is under fire for cheating federal emission standards.", "description": "The company is under fire for cheating federal emission standards.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The company is under fire for cheating federal emission standards.", "title": "Volkswagen recalls 2K Chinese cars due to emissions scandal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/256680-volkswagen-recalls-2k-chinese-cars-due-to-emissions-scandal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/vw1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-13T08:37:34-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-13T08:37-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/256680-volkswagen-recalls-2k-chinese-cars-due-to-emissions-scandal", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-12T13:56-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Volkswagen, VW, Volkswagen emission scandal, VW emission scandal,Michael Horn,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-12T13:56:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T08:37:34-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/256680-volkswagen-recalls-2k-chinese-cars-due-to-emissions-scandal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The company is under fire for cheating federal emission standards.", "card": "summary", "title": "Volkswagen recalls 2K Chinese cars due to emissions scandal"}, "dcterms.title": "Volkswagen recalls 2K Chinese cars due to emissions scandal"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde91\"", "article_summary": "China's environment minister is launching an investigation into cars that Volkswagen has sold there, according to the report.\nADVERTISEMENTThe BBC reported that Volkswagen is recalling 1,950 cars that have been sold in China, which are mostly its Tiguan model.\nVolkswagen is recalling nearly 2,000 cars that were sold in China amid a growing scandal over its efforts to circumvent federal air pollution emission standards, BBC News reports.\n\"I did not think that something like this was possible at the Volkswagen Group.\nVolkswagen has been under fire since it was revealed that the company programmed vehicles to trick emissions testers into believing its diesel cars released a much lower volume of nitrogen oxide than they actually do."}
