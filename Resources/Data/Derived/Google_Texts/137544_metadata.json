The man who nominated Garland was elected by the American people, as were the senators who would have to confirm him. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) refuse to hold a hearing on the nomination. They have also relied on a supposed \u201cprecedent,\u201d woven from whole cloth that says Supreme Court nominees are not confirmed in a president\u2019s final year in office.\n\nRelated: As Trump Turns to the General Election, He Flip-Flops on Policy\n\nBut in general, the argument has been that Barack Obama should not be allowed to select another Supreme Court Justice -- that job should be passed on to his successor.\n\n\u201cThe American people may well elect a president who decides to re-nominate Judge Garland,\u201d McConnell wrote in a USA Today op-ed last month. \u201cThe next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, we can continue to work on legislative solutions, and the American people can continue the national conversation about the type of justice who should serve on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday, though, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona dropped a hint that what critics of the GOP\u2019s strategy on Garland have been arguing all along is true: The decision to block his nomination has nothing to do with letting the American people choose the person who will appoint someone to fill the seat of recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIn fact, if the American people choose a president who might nominate someone more liberal than Garland, Flake said, they ought to be ignored.\n\nRelated: Trump Fallout is Alienating More Conservatives from the GOP\n\n\u201cRepublicans are more than justified in waiting,\u201d he told host Chuck Todd. \u201cThat is following both principle and precedent. The principle is to have the most conservative qualified jurist that we can have on the Supreme Court, not that the people ought to decide before the next election. I\u2019ve never held that position. If we come to a point\u2013\u2013I\u2019ve said all along\u2013\u2013where we\u2019re going to lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him quickly, because I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination.\u201d\n\nYes, well, so much for the people.\n\nMeanwhile Garland, an almost universally admired figure who is current chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has been waiting to have his nomination considered for nearly two months, with no end in sight.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The supposed principle on which Senate Republicans have been refusing to consider President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court has been that the American people should have a \u201cvoice\u201d in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice.", "title": "GOP SCOTUS Stalling Has Nothing to Do with \u2018The People\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/09/GOP-SCOTUS-Stalling-Has-Nothing-Do-People", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05092016_Supreme_Court.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/09/GOP-SCOTUS-Stalling-Has-Nothing-Do-People", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05092016_Supreme_Court.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The supposed principle on which Senate Republicans have been refusing to consider President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court has been that the American people should have a \u201cvoice\u201d in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "They have also relied on a supposed \u201cprecedent,\u201d woven from whole cloth that says Supreme Court nominees are not confirmed in a president\u2019s final year in office.\nThe man who nominated Garland was elected by the American people, as were the senators who would have to confirm him.\nRelated: As Trump Turns to the General Election, He Flip-Flops on PolicyBut in general, the argument has been that Barack Obama should not be allowed to select another Supreme Court Justice -- that job should be passed on to his successor.\nYet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) refuse to hold a hearing on the nomination.\nThe principle is to have the most conservative qualified jurist that we can have on the Supreme Court, not that the people ought to decide before the next election."}
