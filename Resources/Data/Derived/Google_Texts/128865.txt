An unknown number of people were evacuated for approximately four hours Friday evening as a result of a house fire on the 700 block of Sherrill Place.

At about 5:46 p.m., the Penrose Fire Department was dispatched to the home on a report of a porch fire. When they arrived, they found it to be "fully involved," and asked for fire assistance from Florence, the department stated.

One person who lived in the home was treated by emergency medical personnel at the scene, according to the department.

Four engines were used to fight the blaze.

The Fremont County Sheriff's Office said they will be releasing more information when more details are available.

Investigators were seen at the residence Saturday morning. The house was surrounded by crime scene tape.
