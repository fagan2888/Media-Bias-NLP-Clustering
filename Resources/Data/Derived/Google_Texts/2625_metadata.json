SEPTA also asked the union for a three-month extension.\n\nTWU Local 234 President Willie Brown said in the statement that the union is \"willing to go the extra mile to reach a fair agreement,\" but didn't want a long contract extentsion.\n\nSeparate contracts with other union divisions expire next month. Discussions regarding those contracts are also under way, and any strike would involve all the divisions whose contracts are being negotiatied, Brown said.\n\nSticking points between SEPTA and the City Transit Division include discipline, surveillance cameras, pension changes and the Affordable Care Act, according to the union.\n\nThe divison employs 4,700 operators and mechanics and carries an average of 825,000 passengers each weekday.\n\nTWU workers last went on strike in 2009. That six-day walkout also involved the City Transit Division, shutting down bus, trolley and subway service within Philadelphia.\n\nSEPTA spokeswoman Jerri Williams said this morning that negotiations with the City Transit Division had been slated to resume this morning at the Sheraton Downtown Hotel, but the union notified the transit agency that it wouldn't be coming to the hotel today or over the weekend.\n\nHowever, Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the union, said no meeting had been scheduled, and TWU officials needed time to review the transit agency's counter-proposal.\n\nSEPTA also outlined contingency plans Friday morning in case of a strike.\n\nSome riders had been worried about that possibility.\n\n\"I don't drive,\" Faith Burdick said while waiting for a bus in Center City Friday morning. \"I rely on SEPTA for everything.\"\n\nThe South Philadelphia resident said she didn't know what she would do if the buses, trolleys and subways she uses stopped running.\n\n\"It shuts the city down,\" she said.\n\nContact Emily Babay at 215-854-2153 or ebabay@philly.com.
