Despite President Obama’s repeated claims that Americans’ insurance rates would decrease, once again we see just the opposite as health insurers are seeking yet another massive hike in Obamacare premiums.

Every year since the passage of Obamacare, insurance premiums have risen, sometimes nearly 50 percent, quite despite that Obama claimed at least 19 times that he’d save every American $2,500 a year on their insurance. Far from saving Americans money, the average cost has soared to over $5,000 a year.

Early in March it was reported that Obamacare customers were going to see a significant hike in their premiums.

As June dawns, more sources are claiming that the hikes may even be higher than expected.

Some states are seeing 15 to 20 percent hikes. But other states are seeing hikes as high as 50 percent.

Obama’s prevarication about how much premium payers would save isn’t the only claim he made. Obama was famously awarded the “lie of the year” for saying we all could keep our insurance and doctors if we “liked” them.
