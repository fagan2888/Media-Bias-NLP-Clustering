Bone-A-Patreat, a pet food, treat and toy store, has opened a store at 9250 University Ave. in West Des Moines.

This is the second location for owner April Lawrence. Her original Bone-A-Patreat is in the Uptown Shopping Center, 4110 University Ave. in Des Moines. The new shop, which is in West Des Moinesâ€™ Hawthorne Plaza, is about twice the size of the first store, she said.

Both shops offer all-natural pet food and treats, toys, collars, coats, beds and wild bird feed and supplies.

Hours at the West Des Moines store are 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday; and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.
