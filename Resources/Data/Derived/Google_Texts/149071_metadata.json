C. \u2013 During your holiday shopping, you may have bumped into your child\u2019s teacher working in a seasonal retail job.\n\nAccording to many teachers, in most cases it\u2019s not just to earn mad money or take advantage of an employee discount. The average teacher\u2019s salary in North Carolina is slightly more than $45,000 a year, with some making as little as $30,000.\n\nChristina Burchette, a science teacher at a North Carolina school, said she has to work at a retail job to pay her bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to spend more time doing things for my students \u2013 spend more time tutoring them, spend more time on lesson plans and things like that,\u201d Burchette said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not able to, because I do have to work a second job in order to pay my bills.\u201d\n\nBeginning teachers recently received a small pay raise, but many others got a one-time $750 bonus in lieu of a 2 percent pay raise.\n\nThis year, the state had a $400 million surplus.\n\nNorth Carolina now ranks 47th nationwide when it comes to teacher pay. Burchette says while many citizens claim to value the state\u2019s teachers, few people are willing to fight for action.\n\n\u201cI have a Master\u2019s degree and I don\u2019t feel like I should have a second or third job with that, if it\u2019s something that North Carolina, or our country, really values,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Public Instruction, the teacher turnover rate for last school year was almost 15 percent. That\u2019s up for 11 percent in the 2010-2011 school year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The average teacher\u2019s salary in North Carolina is slightly more than $45,000 a year, with some making as little as $30,000.\nNorth Carolina now ranks 47th nationwide when it comes to teacher pay.\nChristina Burchette, a science teacher at a North Carolina school, said she has to work at a retail job to pay her bills.\nAccording to many teachers, in most cases it\u2019s not just to earn mad money or take advantage of an employee discount.\nBurchette says while many citizens claim to value the state\u2019s teachers, few people are willing to fight for action."}
