You can buy beer that comes in bottles.\n\nYou can even buy beer that comes in kegs, in cases, in six-packs and in fancy bottles with cork-stoppers. You can buy beer that is poured from a tap at a bar.\n\nBut if you buy beer in a 64-ounce reusable container known by beer connoisseurs as a \u201cgrowler,\u201d you would be breaking state law.\n\nYou can buy a 32-ounce beer jug or a larger growler, but the most popular size\u2013the 64-ounce bottle\u2013is off limits.\n\nYes, it makes no sense. And that\u2019s why Florida\u2019s odd and illogical ban on 64-ounce containers of beer is being challenged in court by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian law firm that loves taking on the nanny state.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the health or safety rationale for telling consumers that a half-gallon jug is off-limits, but two quarter-gallon jugs are fine? Clearly, the ban isn\u2019t to help the public,\u201d said Mark Miller, an attorney for PLF.\n\nGrowlers are legal in 47 other states (Idaho and Mississippi also ban them), and they have become the industry standard for many small craft breweries. Making them illegal in Florida, Miller said, is meant to protect major brewers who are afraid of losing market share to the craft guys.\n\nMany times, nanny state laws are nuisances. But the growler ban in Florida is actually doing damage to craft brewers such as The Crafted Keg, a bar in Stuart, Fla., where you can get 58 varieties of beer.\n\n\u201cWe want to give everyone great service, but the Florida growler restrictions are a barrier to that,\u201d co-owner Alex Piasecki said in a statement. \u201cPeople from out of state will come in and ask to have their half-gallon growlers filled, but we say that we can\u2019t, and that they\u2019d have to buy a new growler in a different size.\u201d\n\nThe owners of The Crafted Keg are suing the state, with PLF\u2019s help, in U.S. District Court. The lawsuit, filed late last month, aims to overturn the growler ban.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "You can buy a 32-ounce beer jug or a larger growler in Florida, but the most popular size--the 64-ounce bottle--is off limits.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You can buy a 32-ounce beer jug or a larger growler in Florida, but the most popular size--the 64-ounce bottle--is off limits.", "title": "In Florida, You Can't Buy 64 Ounces of Beer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Growler.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-12T11:50:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tUT9Xl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You can buy a 32-ounce beer jug or a larger growler in Florida, but the most popular size--the 64-ounce bottle--is off limits.", "title": "In Florida, You Can't Buy 64 Ounces of Beer", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Growler.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulations", "published_time": "2014-11-11T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-12T11:50:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "florida, beer, craft breweries, growlers"}, "article_summary": "You can even buy beer that comes in kegs, in cases, in six-packs and in fancy bottles with cork-stoppers.\nYou can buy beer that is poured from a tap at a bar.\nBut if you buy beer in a 64-ounce reusable container known by beer connoisseurs as a \u201cgrowler,\u201d you would be breaking state law.\nIn Florida, you can buy beer that comes in cans.\nYou can buy beer that comes in bottles."}
