Nearly 30 percent of all Harris County residents are without insurance. Hundreds of thousands without insurance live in Cook County, Ill., Miami-Dade County, Fla., and Dallas County, Tex., the third, fourth and fifth-largest pools of uninsured.\n\nFederal officials are focusing on 25 metro areas, the AP said, including Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, northern New Jersey, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland and Indianapolis. The feds are less concerned with cities like Los Angeles and New York, where states are running their own health-care exchanges.\n\nThe University of Minnesota Center\u2019s data shows the lowest number of uninsured Americans live in the Midwest and the Northeast, where many states have expanded Medicaid to cover additional low-income residents under the Affordable Care Act. But even before those expansions, the American Community Survey showed low rates of those without insurance in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont.\n\n\n\nPercentage of Americans without health insurance by county.
