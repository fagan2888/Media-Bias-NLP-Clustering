Marco Rubio sought to discredit the national security record of his Republican colleague Sen. Ted Cruz by claiming \u201cthe only budget that Ted has voted for is a budget that (Kentucky Sen.) Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s claim harkens back to a 2013 amendment introduced by Paul that would have set defense spending levels at what, on paper, was a lower level than in previous years.\n\nPaul, who has warned against big government and overspending, did tout the measure as a way to shrink the military.\n\nThe budget \u201cseeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment,\u201d he wrote at the time.\n\nBut the bill came after mandatory across-the-board cuts, known as \u201csequestration,\u201d were enacted that slashed defense spending. Taking into account the lower levels under the sequester, Paul\u2019s plan actually increased spending on the military.\n\nRubio\u2019s claim that the 2013 vote is the only budget Cruz has supported also begs scrutiny. When Rubio made a similar claim in a Fox Business debate, Cruz fired back that he supported one of Rubio\u2019s own budget amendments that increased military spending to $697 billion.\n\nCruz was right: he voted for the measure in March 2015, though it ultimately failed to garner enough support for passage.\n\nRubio\u2019s claim that Cruz supported Paul\u2019s budget \u2014 which was advertised as reducing the size of the military, but which actually increased defense spending \u2014 is true. But his assertion that Cruz hasn\u2019t supported other measures is false, since he supported Rubio\u2019s own bill that increased spending.\n\nReality Check: Rubio claims he \u201cnever\u201d supported cap-and-trade\n\nAsked about environmental policy, Rubio said he has never supported cap-and-trade, a policy designed to drive down pollution by creating a regulated market for carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it,\u201d Rubio said, referring to efforts in Florida to create a cap-and-trade program. \u201cI have never supported cap-and-trade, and I never thought it was a good idea, and I was clear about that at the time.\u201d\n\nHis record at the time is clear \u2014 but it\u2019s not what he claimed Thursday night at the debate.\n\nIn March 2008, Rubio told a local TV station that he believed cap-and-trade was \u201cinevitable\u201d on the federal level, and therefore, Florida should act quickly to become \u201can early complier\u201d so it can \u201chelp influence what that cap-and-trade looks like.\u201d\n\nHe went on to propose giving the Florida Department of Environmental Protection a mandate to \u201cdesign a cap-and-trade, or a carbon tax program, and bring it back to the legislature for ratification.\u201d Months later, Rubio presided over a unanimous vote in the Florida House to do just that, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nSo, Rubio\u2019s claim at the debate that he never supported cap-and-trade is false. He might not support the idea now, but he helped pave the way for Florida to create a cap-and-trade system when he was a state lawmaker.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nReality Check: Cruz on Obamacare as a job-killer\n\nBlasting Obamacare fell to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cIt is the biggest job-killer in this country,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cMillions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Founation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015.\n\nThe report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn\u2019t qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. Kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.\n\nAn ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers\u2019 hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.\n\nAs to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it\u2019s nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nReality Check: Cruz on naval power\n\nClaiming that the United States military has been \u201cdramatically downgraded\u201d during the administration of President Barack Obama, Cruz said that when the first Gulf War began in 1991, the United States \u201chad 529 ships. Today, we have 272.\u201d\n\nThat figure appears to be correct, according to the Navy\u2019s Naval History and Heritage Command website, which tracks the size of the navy going back to the 19th century.\n\nUnder the section \u201cU.S. Navy Active Ship Force Levels,\u201d the site says there were 529 active ships in the Navy as of September 30, 1991. The Gulf War took place in January 1991. For the record, the site claims there were 570 active ships as of September 30, 1990, less than two months after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and launched the international crisis that eventually led to the war.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s website keeps tabs on the current force structure and says there are currently 273 deployable ships in the U.S. arsenal.\n\nAccording to the Navy, the Navy decommissioned many older ships after the end of the Cold War in 1991, a decision that led to a smaller overall fleet. Ship levels also were not greatly increased in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks as older surface warships have been replaced at a less than one-to-one ratio.\n\nWhile the numbers Cruz cited of naval power are correct, the decline of ship power took place over the course of two decades and multiple presidential administrations, and not just the past seven years, as Cruz posited.\n\nVerdict: True, but misleading.\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nReality Check: Huckabee on manufacturing jobs\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the nation has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000.\n\nThat\u2019s true. There were 12.3 million manufacturing workers in the U.S. last month, down from 17.3 million at the start of 2000, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHuckabee went on to say he visited Newton, Iowa, where workers lost their jobs in 2007 after Maytag\u2019s washer-dryer facility went out of business. \u201cAll those jobs went to Mexico,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not so true. Maytag, which was headquartered in Newton, was bought by Whirlpool in 2006. Whirlpool shuttered the Maytag factory and shifted production to Whirlpool\u2019s existing factories in Mexico and Ohio, according to a 2007 New York Times story.\n\nVerdict: True on the loss of manufacturing jobs, but false on all of Newton\u2019s Maytag jobs going to Mexico.\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nReality Check: Fiorina on Planned Parenthood\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood engages in partial-birth abortion, in late term abortion,\u201d former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said. \u201cThey alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts, they have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.\u201d\n\nOver the summer, a conservative group called the Center for Medical Progress released undercover videos and accused Planned Parenthood of performing partial birth abortions and selling fetal tissue.\n\nPartial birth abortions are illegal, and Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied that it performs partial birth abortions, or that it has participated in any illegal activity. On Monday, a Texas grand jury investigation into Planned Parenthood cleared the group, instead indicting two members of the Center for Medical Progress who secretly recorded Planned Parenthood members.\n\nOfficials in 11 states have cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing, according to the organization. Officials in another eight states declined to even investigate the accusations made by the Center for Medical Progress.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has said that money it accepts for fetal tissue is used to cover costs, not to generate profit. In October, the group announced that it would no longer accept any reimbursements for fetal tissue used for research.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not engage in partial birth abortions, and they do not sell tissue for any profit (although they have now said they will not accept any reimbursement whatsoever).\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nReality Check: Fiorina on the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nFiorina said, \u201cThe American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. For dereliction of duty, when we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. Handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performances.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unpack her statements:\n\nThe bill to which Fiorina is referring, the Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014, would give authority to the secretary of the VA to fire about 400 senior executives for poor performance. The bill passed the House in May 2014 but has since been sitting in the Senate.\n\nSo Fiorina\u2019s claim that the bill has passed through Congress is false.\n\nThe 307,000 number comes from a Veterans Affairs report released last September and it represents the number of pending records that belonged to veterans who had died in previous months. However, that number does not necessarily represent veterans who were actively seeking treatment in VA health care, according to the VA\u2019s inspector general.\n\nDue to problems with the VA database, some of those records include people who died before the VA had even started its health care enrollment system, or people who did not apply for health care benefits specifically. To say definitively that 307,000 people \u201chave died waiting\u201d for health care may be a stretch, so we rate her claim as it\u2019s complicated.\n\nAnd in November 2015, USA Today reported that the VA had given out $142 million in bonuses to employees in 2014, as incentives or tied to performance reviews. That claim is true.\n\nRick Santorum\n\nReality Check: Santorum on Americans without college degrees\n\nPresenting himself as a working class advocate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said the other candidates are ignoring a large swath of the populace. He declared that 74% of Americans don\u2019t have college degrees.\n\nSantorum, who has two postgraduate degrees, mentioned the same stat during the last debate two weeks ago, and our verdict was false.\n\nBut let\u2019s check our numbers again. There are 209.3 million Americans aged 25 and older, according to the 2014 Census, and 142.4 million of them have not attained a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. That\u2019s 68% of Americans, not 74%.\n\nDuring an appearance on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in April, Santorum said that he would champion the \u201c70% of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree.\u201d That was close enough to the Census figure to earn Santorum a true rating from Politifact.\n\nUnfortunately, the Penn State graduate changed his calculation to 74% and has repeated the same incorrect stat at two debates in a row. Perhaps it\u2019s a Pennsylvania hat tip to Groundhog Day or maybe he needs a math refresher.
