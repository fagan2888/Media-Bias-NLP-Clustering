In 2009 and 2010, the agency used terms like \u201cTea Party\u201d to scrutinize conservative groups\u2019 applications for tax-exempt status, which lead to resignations and Congressional inquiries. In 2015, the agency announced that hackers had accessed its taxpayer information databases, comprising the returns of more than 300,000 people. Meanwhile, the IRS has also been working to combat corporate inversions \u2014 transactions in which American companies merge with smaller companies based abroad to legally avoid tax liability \u2014 and improve tax compliance through artificial intelligence.\n\nThese stories have all come against the backdrop of budget cuts and personnel reductions at the IRS, which had $1.2 billion less funding in 2015 than in 2010. The cuts came as the IRS\u2019 workload increased due to changes from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Affordable Care Act. As a result, over 8 million phone calls from taxpayers went unanswered during the 2015 tax season, and the Treasury Department has estimated that each dollar cut from IRS funding results in $6 lost from tax collections. The nation\u2019s taxpayer advocate wrote in 2013 that the agency \u201cdesperately needs more funding.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the political process on IRS funding and operations was the subject of a 2015 study published in the Journal of Public Policy, \u201cThe Political Economy of Tax Enforcement: A Look at the Internal Revenue Service from 1978 to 2010,\u201d that looks at the effect of the current President\u2019s political party on the level of resources available to the IRS and their allocation within the IRS. Sutirtha Bagchi, assistant professor of economics at Villanova University, used IRS budget and personnel figures over time to examine whether presidential administrations use executive power to affect IRS resources and priorities and thus influence the effective tax rate to support their larger policy goals.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings include:\n\nNeither the President\u2019s party nor the party in control of the House has a statistically significant effect on the size of the overall IRS budget or the size of its overall workforce.\n\nDemocratic control of the Senate is correlated with an increased IRS budget and workforce.\n\nThe President\u2019s party has a statistically significant impact on the number of IRS enforcement personnel when both houses of Congress are controlled by Democrats.\n\nThe President\u2019s party has a statistically significant impact on the number of corporate income returns audited by the IRS, with 5 percent more on average performed under Democratic administrations. The party in control of the houses of Congress has no such statistically significant impact.\n\nThe President\u2019s party has a statistically significant impact on the number of individual income returns audited by the IRS, with 4 percent more on average performed under Democratic administrations. The party in control of the houses of Congress has a mixed impact of smaller magnitude.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings suggest that while the President is unable to control the overall budget of the IRS, he or she can change the agency\u2019s direction within its budget by shifting employees from or toward positions as criminal investigators and revenue officers, Bagchi explains. And, because Democratic presidents are more likely to favor strong tax enforcement, these changes then result in more audits of corporations, individuals and estates under Democratic administrations.\n\nRelated research: A 2014 study in the Journal of the American Taxation Association, \u201cThe Effect of Tax Authority Monitoring and Enforcement on Financial Reporting Quality,\u201d looks at the relationship between tax enforcement and the accuracy of businesses\u2019 financial reporting.
