Mr. Galifianakis\u2019 embodies the awkward community television show host, often acting hostile towards his guests or asking strange and uncomfortable questions, usually with celebrities.\n\nThe interview with President Obama easily became the show\u2019s most notorious. Obama stays in character with the show\u2019s theme, trading insults and shifty glances with Galifianakis, like this response when he asks whether Obama is frustrated that he can\u2019t run for a third term.\n\n\"If I ran a third time it would sort of be like doing a third \u2018Hangover\u2019 movie,\u201d said the President to the star of the popular \u201cHangover\u201d movie franchise. \u201cDidn't really work out very well, did it?\u201d\n\nLater the interview switched to the health insurance exchange, with Obama pushing the importance of signing up and plugging both Healthcare.gov and the phone number people could call to find out more information.\n\nGalifianakis responded with equal gibes (\u201cWhy did you get the guy who created the Zune to create [the healthcare] website?\u201d) and by showing the President a wound from spider bites. Obama says \u201cYou gotta get that checked out.\u201d\n\nThe video was a hit, both for \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d and Healthcare.gov. \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d videos usually average 2 million views; by the next afternoon the Obama episode had over 13 million views. FunnyorDie.com was the number one referral website to Healthcare.gov, and traffic to the health care website was up 40 percent over the previous day.\n\nThat same day, however, February enrollment numbers came out and things hadn\u2019t improved for young people and health insurance: as of the end of February people ages 18 to 34 only made up 25 percent of enrollees overall with a month to go.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "be899631c0fa51e5be36fdc6e778bf43", "sailthru.author": "Karis Hustad", "description": "The Affordable Care Act needs young adults to sign up for the program to work, but getting their attention has proved difficult, and strategists are getting desperate.
