Unfortunately, radiation is everywhere and not where we would always expect it to be. Dr. Derek Muller, host of YouTube's Veritasium science channel, explains in the video \u201cThe Most Radioactive Places on Earth,\u201d when it comes to ionizing radiation protection, it\u2019s all a matter of its location and levels.\n\n\"It's not an all or nothing thing, we are constantly exposed,\" says Muller in the video. \"I wanted to let people know that their surroundings are radioactive, the soil, the air, food like bananas and Brazil nuts. We are radioactive.\"\n\nThe decaying of radioactive materials leads to the production of ionizing radiation, which has sufficient energy to strip away electrons from atoms, or to break some chemical bonds. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says any living tissue in the human body can be damaged by ionizing radiation in a unique matter as the body attempts to repair the damage. However, this damage could be unrepairable or too severe or widespread to be fixed, which can lead to cancerous and non-cancerous health effects such as burns and radiation sickness.\n\nAlthough bananas and Brazil nuts are naturally radioactive as they contain potassium-40, which is a radioactive isotope of potassium, they are far from dangerous. Approximately 10,000,000 bananas would need to be consumed in a year to cause illness in a person. This is equivalent to nuclear reactor radiation leakage.\n\nMuller proves radioactivity is all about the levels of ionizing radiation. He sets off his tour with a Geiger counter to measure the world\u2019s most notorious nuclear sites including Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Marie Curie\u2019s lab among many others. However, to our surprise many of the world\u2019s most radioactive sites are actually found to be more benign than we thought. For example, under the denotation point of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, an hour in town is the radioactive equivalent of eating three bananas.\n\nThe most radioactive spot on the tour was found to be inside the Pripyat hospital near Chernobyl. The area is now a site of abandoned building complexes which previously served to treat firefighters who responded to the 1986 nuclear meltdown. The Pripyat basement was found to have the highest radiation levels on Muller\u2019s Geiger counter littered with highly contaminated gear and clothing from the firefighters.\n\nRadiation is everywhere and impossible to escape. Whether we\u2019re eating a banana or wandering the sites of Hiroshima, we\u2019ll be exposed to some degree of radioactivity. Exposure to small amounts of radiation over a long time does raise your risk of cancer, says Medline Plus, but brief exposures to abnormal levels of radiation only increase risk very slightly.\n\nWatch Muller\u2019s video to find out where the other most radioactive places on earth are located.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "prominent, hot, spots, earth, what, does, radioactivity, mean, your, health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Take a tour of the most radioactive places on Earth \u2014 from Chernobyl, Ukraine, to Marie Curie\u2019s lab in France \u2014 and discover how radiation affects your health.", "title": "The Most Radioactive Places On Earth [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/prominent-hot-spots-earth-what-does-radioactivity-mean-your-health-315448", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/23/prominent-hot-spots-earth-what-does-radioactivity-mean-your-health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Take a tour of the most radioactive places on Earth \u2014 from Chernobyl, Ukraine, to Marie Curie\u2019s lab in France \u2014 and discover how radiation affects your health.", "title": "The Most Radioactive Places On Earth [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/prominent-hot-spots-earth-what-does-radioactivity-mean-your-health-315448", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/23/prominent-hot-spots-earth-what-does-radioactivity-mean-your-health.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/23/prominent-hot-spots-earth-what-does-radioactivity-mean-your-health.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-23T15:42:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-23T15:42:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Take a tour of the most radioactive places on Earth \u2014 from Chernobyl, Ukraine, to Marie Curie\u2019s lab in France \u2014 and discover how radiation affects your health."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9cd\"", "article_summary": "Muller proves radioactivity is all about the levels of ionizing radiation.\nHowever, to our surprise many of the world\u2019s most radioactive sites are actually found to be more benign than we thought.\nThe Pripyat basement was found to have the highest radiation levels on Muller\u2019s Geiger counter littered with highly contaminated gear and clothing from the firefighters.\nWhether we\u2019re eating a banana or wandering the sites of Hiroshima, we\u2019ll be exposed to some degree of radioactivity.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says any living tissue in the human body can be damaged by ionizing radiation in a unique matter as the body attempts to repair the damage."}
