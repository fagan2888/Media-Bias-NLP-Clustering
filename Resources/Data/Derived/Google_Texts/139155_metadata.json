After three or four decades of working every day, it sounds nice to be able to follow your own schedule, travel, spend more time with family, pursue a hobby or launch a new vocation.\n\nWhether you hope to retire at 52 or 62, the key to successfully retiring early is planning ahead, otherwise known as \u201cretirement planning.\u201d Here are a few thoughts for those who have this dream:\n\n\u2022 Envision your future. Let\u2019s say you retire at age 58. The average man will live another 23 years, the average woman another 26 years, according to the Social Security Administration. That\u2019s a long time to spend making putts. How will you spend your time? Start a new business? Travel? Volunteer? Knowing what you plan to do will help you understand how much money you will need, a vital part of the financial planning process.\n\n\u2022 Retire your debt. Unless you are a multi-millionaire, going into retirement in debt is like jumping in the ocean with an anchor tied around your waist. Few people can afford to pay off debt from the money they earn in retirement through savings withdrawals, Social Security checks and other income sources such as rental property or part-time work. Set a goal to pay off all your debt before you retire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Cut your expenses now. Don\u2019t wait until retirement is in sight to start living below your means. Do it now, for two reasons. First, every dollar you save means your retirement savings will stretch over more years, and second, you\u2019ll get used to living more frugally, something you may need to do once you retire.\n\n\u2022 Understand your Social Security benefits. If you take your Social Security benefits before your official retirement age, you\u2019ll receive significantly less money over your retirement years. If a person whose normal retirement age is 67 retires at the earliest possible age, 62, they will receive 30 percent less. That\u2019s a huge penalty that will add up over the years. Of course, you don\u2019t have to start withdrawing from Social Security if you retire, and you\u2019ll receive more if you delay withdrawals to age 70.\n\n\u2022 Make a trial run. Figure out the budget you\u2019ll need to be on after you retire and spend a few months living within that budget. That means no credit cards or savings withdrawals. Can you do it?\n\nConsider health care carefully. You won\u2019t be eligible for Medicare until age 65, and even then it doesn\u2019t pay all your medical expenses. You must have a viable plan for health care coverage after you retire. That could mean coverage through a spouse or through Obamacare. Just remember, a major illness can torpedo the best-laid plans, so make sure your financial planning takes that possibility into account.\n\nEric Tashlein is a Certified Financial Planner professional\u2122 and founding Principal of Connecticut Capital Management Group, LLC, 67 Cherry St. in Milford.
