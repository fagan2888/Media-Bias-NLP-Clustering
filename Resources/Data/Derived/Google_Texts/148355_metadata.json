(AP) - Even though Max Muncy hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of opportunities at third base, he knows he should have been better when given the chance.\n\nMuncy\u2019s error helped key a three-run inning for Kansas City and the Royals went on to sweep the Oakland Athletics with a 5-3 victory Sunday.\n\nMuncy made just his eighth start of the season at third base as manager Bob Melvin wanted to get as many lefty hitters in the lineup as possible against Jeremy Guthrie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse to use,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cWhen your name is called you need to go in there and make the play. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\n\nJesse Chavez (4-7) was unable to bail out Muncy in the three-run sixth and Oakland dropped its third straight following a season-long five-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cWe were playing really good ball lately and this happens,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating that we had good momentum going as a team and we were playing really good ball.\u201d\n\nJeremy Guthrie struck out a season-high seven batters to top 1,000 for his career and Salvador Perez homered for his 500th career hit to help Kansas City complete its first sweep against Oakland since 2008.\n\nGuthrie (6-5) allowed two runs in six innings and reached 1,005 career strikeouts in his 12th big league season.\n\nPerez took much less time to reach his big number, getting there in his fifth season with a homer in the eighth inning off Edward Mujica that provided insurance for the Royals.\n\n\u201cWe had two big milestones today, which I think are big,\u201d manager Ned Yost said. \u201cSo they got that behind them and now they just keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nOmar Infante hit a tiebreaking single in a three-run sixth inning for the Royals, who have won five of six to open a nine-game road trip.\n\nThe Royals bullpen did the rest with Wade Davis pitching the ninth for his ninth save in as many chances as Kansas City swept the A\u2019s for the first time since 2008.\n\nBilly Burns helped spark a two-run third inning for Oakland when he led off with a single to extend his hitting streak to 16 straight games.\n\nBen Zobrist drove in the first run with a sacrifice fly and Josh Reddick made it 2-0 when his popup to shallow left fell between shortstop Alcides Escobar and left fielder Alex Gordon for his 500th career hit.\n\nA poor defensive play by Oakland helped the Royals take the lead in the sixth. With runners on first and third and one out, Perez hit a slow grounder to third base. Muncy charged and his throw home was high. Mike Moustakas scored on the fielder\u2019s choice and the runners advanced to second and third on Muncy\u2019s throwing error.\n\nAlex Rios tied the game with a sacrifice fly and Infante gave the Royals their first lead with his two-out hit that knocked out Chavez.\n\n\u201cI got to stop the bleeding and make a pitch,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go our way. I made a pitch to the next hitter for what would have been the third out. I\u2019ve still got to stop the bleeding there. There\u2019s no excuse for it. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRoyals: OF Lorenzo Cain did not start after tweaking his hamstring stealing a base Saturday. He pinch hit for Eric Hosmer in the eighth and singled. Hosmer, who was moved to DH from first base, sprained his left ring finger on that same double steal Saturday and left Sunday\u2019s game early. He is day to day. \u2026 Escobar was also removed in the eighth inning for precautionary reasons with a split nail on his right index finger, but Yost said he thought Escobar would be able to play Monday.\n\nAthletics: Burns (hip flexor) returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nBurns had two hits and is one game away from tying the Oakland rookie hitting streak record of 17 games shared by Mike Edwards (1978), Luis Polonia (1987) and Terrence Long (2000).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals: Joe Blanton (2-0) takes the mound at Houston in the opener of a three-game series between first-place teams. Lance McCullers (3-2) pitches for the Astros.\n\nAthletics: Kendall Graveman, who is 3-2 with a 2.31 ERA in seven starts since being recalled from the minors, starts the opener of a three-game series against Colorado.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even though Max Muncy hasn't gotten a lot of opportunities at third base, he knows he should have been better when given the chance.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Even though Max Muncy hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of opportunities at third base, he knows he should have been better when given the chance.", "title": "Athletics lose 5-3 to Royals to cap series sweep", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/28/athletics-lose-5-3-to-royals-to-cap-series-sweep/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/28/2cfa0325d35cb61c7a0f6a706700aac0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/28/2cfa0325d35cb61c7a0f6a706700aac0.jpg", "description": "Even though Max Muncy hasn't gotten a lot of opportunities at third base, he knows he should have been better when given the chance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Athletics lose 5-3 to Royals to cap series sweep"}, "Author": "JOSH DUBOW", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Muncy\u2019s error helped key a three-run inning for Kansas City and the Royals went on to sweep the Oakland Athletics with a 5-3 victory Sunday.\nUP NEXTRoyals: Joe Blanton (2-0) takes the mound at Houston in the opener of a three-game series between first-place teams.\n\u2026 Escobar was also removed in the eighth inning for precautionary reasons with a split nail on his right index finger, but Yost said he thought Escobar would be able to play Monday.\nA poor defensive play by Oakland helped the Royals take the lead in the sixth.\nGuthrie (6-5) allowed two runs in six innings and reached 1,005 career strikeouts in his 12th big league season."}
