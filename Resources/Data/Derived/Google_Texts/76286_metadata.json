For some, the shift may be more a matter of tone than substance as the GOP tries to attract new voters ahead of the midterm elections. Nonetheless, it is dramatic turn for a party that has long been defined by social conservative values.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Republican Party is fighting it,\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s Republican Gov. Scott Walker said of gay marriage. He spoke with The Associated Press during an interview this weekend at the National Governors Association in Nashville.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not important,\u201d continued Walker, who is considering a 2016 presidential bid should he survive his reelection test this fall. \u201cBut Republicans haven\u2019t been talking about this. We\u2019ve been talking about economic and fiscal issues. It\u2019s those on the left that are pushing it.\u201d\n\nWalker, like other ambitious Republican governors, is trying to strike a delicate balance.\n\nHis comments come just days after he formally appealed a federal judge\u2019s ruling striking down Wisconsin\u2019s ban on same-sex marriages, a ban he supported. But after his party\u2019s disastrous 2012 election, the Republican National Committee commissioned a report calling for more \u201cinclusive and welcoming\u201d tones on divisive social issues \u2013 particularly those \u201cinvolving the treatment and the rights of gays.\u201d\n\nWalker explained his court appeal as simply as his obligation as governor to defend the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nOther Republican governors, however, including New Jersey\u2019s Republican Gov. Chris Christie, opted against appealing a similar ruling in his state, clearing the way for gay marriage to become legal there.\n\n\u201cThat is a very controversial and divisive issue,\u201d said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, suggesting that Republicans are better served by focusing on economic issues. \u201cI\u2019m a religious conservative, I\u2019m a Catholic, I\u2019m pro-life. (But) I think the people of Iowa look to me to provide leadership in bringing good jobs and growing the Iowa economy.\u201d\n\nA Gallup poll found in May that national support for same-sex marriage reached an all-time high of 55 percent. That includes 30 percent of Republicans and nearly 8 in 10 young adults from both parties.\n\nCourts across the nation repeatedly have struck down gay marriage bans in recent months. The latest such ruling came Wednesday in Colorado, but it\u2019s on hold pending an appeal. At least 20 states now allow gay marriage, although the issue may be headed for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe high court\u2019s landmark ruling last summer allowed married same-sex couples to receive the same federal benefits as other married people but did not specifically address whether gay marriage is a constitutional right.\n\nDemocratic governors serving in Republican-leaning states that have banned gay marriage also appear to have softened their stands on the issue. Many said they were looking to the Supreme Court to resolve the issue once and for all.\n\nLike Walker, Kentucky\u2019s Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear is appealing a recent court ruling that struck down his state\u2019s gay marriage ban.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to get that issue to the United States Supreme Court and get a final decision that will tell us all what the law is going to be in the future, and then Kentucky will abide by it,\u201d Beshear said.\n\nWalker, too, said that Republican governors would be \u201clegally obligated\u201d to support gay marriage should the Supreme Court rule in its favor.\n\nFor now, the Republican Party\u2019s official platform, as adopted in 2012, calls for a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as \u201cthe union of one man and one woman,\u201d while formally supporting Republican-led campaigns to make the same change in state constitutions.\n\nAnd despite the softening rhetoric, several states are continuing to fight.\n\nTennessee, Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky are scheduled to present arguments against recent gay marriage rulings in their states before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati on Aug. 6.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Steve Peoples and Erik Schelzig wrote this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New signs emerged this weekend of an evolution among Republican governors on gay marriage, an explosive social issue that has divided America's families and politics for years.", "pubdate": 20140712, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "New signs emerged this weekend of an evolution among Republican governors on gay marriage, an explosive social issue that has divided America's families and politics for years.", "title": "GOP governors may be evolving message on same-sex marriage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/109982896.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/nations-bible-belt-gop-governors-shift-message-sex-marriage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "New signs emerged this weekend of an evolution among Republican governors on gay marriage, an explosive social issue that has divided America's families and politics for years.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/109982896.jpg", "title": "GOP governors may be evolving message on same-sex marriage", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Scott Walker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "gay rights, GOP, LGBTQ, same-sex marriage, Scott Walker"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf743\"", "article_summary": "Walker, too, said that Republican governors would be \u201clegally obligated\u201d to support gay marriage should the Supreme Court rule in its favor.\nIt\u2019s those on the left that are pushing it.\u201dWalker, like other ambitious Republican governors, is trying to strike a delicate balance.\nWhile the Republican Party\u2019s religious conservatives continue to fight against same-sex marriage, its governors appear to be backing off their opposition- in their rhetoric, at least.\nSteve Beshear is appealing a recent court ruling that struck down his state\u2019s gay marriage ban.\nOther Republican governors, however, including New Jersey\u2019s Republican Gov."}
