O-care\u2019s non-taxes were, in fact, taxes, the \u201csavings\u201d it would bring were, in fact, massive new costs, etc.\n\n\u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\u201d he instructs in one clip. \u201c[C]all it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nSome voters have indeed been taken in by claims that political magic would make all things medical better, cheaper, faster, stronger, bionic. I can\u2019t exonerate every member of our species from the accusation of \u201cstupidity.\u201d But ideology and wishful thinking are more fundamental explanations of why so many accepted the fairy tales. Many others, vindicating the \u201csapiens\u201d part of our Latin cognomen, did not.\n\nAdmittedly, a slim majority of bozos in Congress did buy into Obamacare. Whether they were incompetent dupes or corrupt dogs, they were all Democrats. Not a single Republican voted for the legislation. But to Gruber, members of Congress seem to be in on the scam. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s apologizing to them and not the public.\n\nHere is the big irony: the stupidly slandered Americans constituted the one demographic too smart to fall for the deceit at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Poll after poll leading up to Congress passing the ACA demonstrated that most folks opposed it, disbelieving Gruber\u2019s and Obama\u2019s distortions.\n\nSetting the standard for stupid, actually, is Prof. Gruber himself. It was he, after all, who spent an uncomfortable morning before a nasty congressional committee last week, thereby putting his multi-million dollar career as a paid government advisor in jeopardy. Jawboning has its costs.\n\nMore consequential to the rest of us, though, is the law Gruber has left behind: the Affordable Care Act. A Politico article on the big-talking MIT professor was headlined with the question: \u201cWill Jonathan Gruber Topple Obamacare?\u201d\n\nAnswer: He might.\n\nSlapping the word \u201cstupid\u201d around in place of \u201cAmerican people\u201d will likely only embarrass Gruber and ACA supporters, but Gruber\u2019s comments on how the law deals with federal government subsidies for individuals if their state does not set up a state exchange under Obamacare may prove as illuminating as a thunderbolt.\n\nOn film yet again (who\u2019s this guy\u2019s agent?), Gruber insists, \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this is that, if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits.\u201d\n\nThat very issue is the subject of a legal challenge to Obamacare, King v. Burwell, now in the queue to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The essence of the case posits that the federal government has no authority under the Affordable Care Act to provide subsidies to individuals in states, which have not set up Obamacare exchanges. Only 14 states have set up those exchanges, 36 have not.\n\nMoreover, without the direct taxpayer subsidy enticing individuals to sign up for the healthcare coverage, the whole scheme known as Obamacare falls apart.\n\nHmmmm. Perhaps this is why last year Gruber called this lawsuit\u2014you guessed it\u2014\u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nStupid is as stupid says. Over and over again.\n\nAsked point-blank by Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) to square his previous comments with the current legality of the Obama Administration giving subsidies to people in 36 states that have not established exchanges, Gruber stammered, \u201cWhen I made those comments, I believe what I was saying was reflecting uncertainty about the implementation of the federal exchange. I don\u2019t recall exactly what the law says.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope the High Court reads the law as if it were comprised of words with exact meanings and not feelings with ambiguous nebulosity, but one never knows.\n\nYet, Gruber\u2019s original, partial admissions and his current dishonest retractions certainly confirm what we already know about how political power is gained and gloated over by persons of his type. Now that he has delivered his object lesson, he is free to slither off the public stage.\n\nTake the money and run, Professor. That would be the smart thing. Accept your career for what you made it: a grifter\u2019s tale.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lying liars lie even about incidental lapses into truth..05/27/2016 7:48:29AM EST.", "author": "Paul Jacob", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Lying liars lie even about incidental lapses into truth.", "title": "- Stupid Is As Stupid Says", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauljacob/2014/12/14/stupid-is-as-stupid-says-n1931511", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/343/995a15bf-07f0-4913-ae7b-bd95827f041d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Lying liars lie even about incidental lapses into truth.", "title": "- Stupid Is As Stupid Says", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauljacob/2014/12/14/stupid-is-as-stupid-says-n1931511", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/343/995a15bf-07f0-4913-ae7b-bd95827f041d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Stupid Is As Stupid Says, Paul Jacob, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "More consequential to the rest of us, though, is the law Gruber has left behind: the Affordable Care Act.\nPerhaps this is why last year Gruber called this lawsuit\u2014you guessed it\u2014\u201cstupid.\u201dStupid is as stupid says.\nSetting the standard for stupid, actually, is Prof. Gruber himself.\nIn a double insult, economics professor and political hack Jonathan Gruber has now apologized\u2014not to us, to Congress\u2014for boasting about how clever was the opaque legislative process used to dupe us \u201cstupid\u201d voters about the true nature of Obamacare.\nA Politico article on the big-talking MIT professor was headlined with the question: \u201cWill Jonathan Gruber Topple Obamacare?\u201dAnswer: He might."}
