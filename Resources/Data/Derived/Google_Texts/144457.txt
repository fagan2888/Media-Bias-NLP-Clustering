The singer debuted the new single on streaming service Tidal after performing the new track at the March Madness Music Festival

Rihanna‘s new song “American Oxygen” debuted on Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal this week, following a performance of the single at the March Madness Music Festival in Indianapolis on Saturday.

The song calls the younger generation the “new America,” who “sweat for a nickel and a dime” and “turn it into an empire.”

Later in the performance, the singer took on Indiana’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which in its original language would allow business owners to refuse service to anyone on the basis that doing so is exercising their right to religious freedom. Many viewed the law as an attempt to legalize discrimination against the LGBT community.
