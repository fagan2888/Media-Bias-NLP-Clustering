We hope to finish everything as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBerlusconi, who was Italian premier three times, took over Milan in February 1986 and presided over its most successful era as the team won 28 trophies, including eight Serie A titles and five European Cups.\n\nHowever, Milan\u2019s form has dipped in recent years, with the team currently 10th in Serie A, having not won the title since 2011.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that Milan returns to the top in Italy, in Europe and in the world,\u201d Berlusconi said. \u201cI found Mr. Bee to be a very serious person who has respected all the technical parameters of the contract. We\u2019ve become friends and we think we can do good things continuing our rapport.\n\n\u201cThe deal will allow the brand of Milan, which is the most recognized football club in the world, to spread its marketing influence in Asian countries and we are working on that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi is exploring selling a stake to an investment group headed by a Thai businessman but the former Italian prime minister plans to retain control of the prestigious Serie A club.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi is exploring selling a stake to an investment group headed by a Thai businessman but the former Italian prime minister plans to retain control of the prestigious Serie A club.", "title": "Berlusconi in talks to sell stake in Milan to Thai investor", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/2/berlusconi-says-he-could-keep-majority-share-of-ac/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/02/43222967a5195513750f6a7067007cca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/02/43222967a5195513750f6a7067007cca.jpg", "description": "AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi is exploring selling a stake to an investment group headed by a Thai businessman but the former Italian prime minister plans to retain control of the prestigious Serie", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Berlusconi in talks to sell stake in Milan to Thai investor"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2568\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy concern is that Milan returns to the top in Italy, in Europe and in the world,\u201d Berlusconi said.\nBee Taechaubol, who runs the Thai Prime private equity group, held further talks in Milan on Saturday with Berlusconi, who has owned the 18-time Italian champions for almost 30 years.\nMILAN (AP) - AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi is exploring selling a stake to an investment group headed by a Thai businessman but the former Italian prime minister plans to retain control of the prestigious Serie A club.\n\u201cSoon we will meet again to be able to define every aspect of Milan\u2019s future,\u201d the 78-year-old Berlusconi said.\nThat contradicted recent reports that Bee could be buying more than 51 percent of Milan, although Berlusconi himself said on Saturday there was a \u201cpossibility\u201d he would remain the majority shareholder."}
