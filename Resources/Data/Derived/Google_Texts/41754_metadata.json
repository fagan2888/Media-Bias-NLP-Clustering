Nearly one third of respondents believe the Act will increase operational expenses and 40 percent aren\u2019t sure how it will impact their business. In addition, one in four respondents said they will halt any growth initiatives in the near future as a result of the Act.\n\n\u201cSmall business confidence is critical to the progress of the current recovery,\u201d said MCC CEO Stephen Sheinbaum. \u201cWhile we see that the economy is improving and our customers are charting growth, it is clear from the survey that continued confusion surrounding the rollout of Obamacare could potentially temper this positive momentum.\u201d\n\nJob Creation\n\nSurvey respondents also expressed concern about job creation and retention, with one in five saying that they will put new hiring on hold as they wrestle with increasing operational expenses. Of those who said their expenses would increase due to the Act, 29 percent said they will cut costs by decreasing number of hours worked for certain employees.\n\nEmployer Mandate\n\nThe survey also measured small business owners\u2019 views about the employer mandates under the Act. Taking advantage of the program will be a difficult undertaking for some small businesses to do because of coverage under personal health insurance plans and the lack of desire or incentive to provide it. The majority (70 percent) of respondents said they currently have personal health insurance and 40 percent don\u2019t currently offer health insurance to employees and don\u2019t plan to.\n\nSHOP Exchange\n\nThe survey revealed a small portion of small business owners who are already planning to sign up for the program. Nine percent of respondents said they don\u2019t currently offer insurance but plan to use the SHOP exchange to provide employees with coverage. And, 6.4 percent of respondents said they currently do offer health insurance to employees, but will switch to a new health insurance plan provided through the exchange. However, in total, less than 20 percent of respondents said they will plan to use the SHOP exchange to provide insurance for their employees.\n\nSheinbaum adds, \u201cThe large population of self-insured small business owners is reluctant to provide coverage through the SHOP exchange, as are the owners who offer insurance and don\u2019t offer insurance. These findings shed important light on the education and understanding needed around what Obamacare means for the future of small business confidence and growth.\u201d\n\nSurvey findings and the Affect of Obamacare on Businesses info-graphic data verified and audited by Premier Consulting Partners via First National Administrators.\n\n*Fielded prior to the delay of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation for small businesses\n\nAbout the survey\n\nMerchant Cash and Capital conducted the online survey of 542 small business merchants (revenues under $10 million annually) in November 2013.\n\nAbout Merchant Cash and Capital\n\nSince 2005, Merchant Cash and Capital, LLC, has been one of the nation's business cash advance funding leaders.
