The letter is attached for your reference. In summary, CMS has outlined a step back to the traditional (pre-2014) level of LIP funding. This $1 billion in total LIP spending authority represents less than half of the current year authority of $2.2 billion. Additionally, CMS believes allowing this level for the 2015-16 fiscal year will help Florida transition to a base level of $600 million in subsequent years. This news brings certainty to what we have known for over a year \u2013 the LIP program is changing and Florida needs a new way to address uncompensated care. Throughout the 2015 Regular Session, the Senate used a conservative approach to budgeting, setting aside funding to prepare for a decline in LIP. These additional state dollars allow Florida to mitigate the loss of LIP funding in the short term. However, as explained by our state economist Amy Baker, using state dollars to replace federal funding forces us to supplant other priorities and damages our economy. It remains clear that a sustainable long-term solution is needed. As you are aware, the Senate has proposed a Florida solution that will promote the well-being of our constituents and protect the fiscal health of our state. While the letter from CMS outlines a number of policy alternatives, none of these options will allow Florida to maximize both state and federal taxpayer dollars in a more effective manner than by reducing the number of uninsured Floridians seeking basic health care in hospital emergency rooms. Clearly, a conservative free-market expansion of health care coverage is the most fiscally responsible approach. While we may not agree with every policy decision that comes from the federal government, I do agree that coverage, rather than backend supplemental payments, is a better investment for our taxpayers. With today\u2019s direction from the federal government, we will continue to work towards a responsible long-term Florida solution. Special Session will give us the opportunity to address health care within the context of our budget. I look forward to seeing you on June 1.\n\nBasically, what has just happened is that the Florida legislature just received a one-year health care bailout and will have to address this problem next year.\n\nThis is \u201ckick the can down the road\u201d politics at its finest.\n\nState Senator Kelli Stargel (R-Lakeland), who supports taking federal Medicaid expansion dollars, seems to agree that the Florida legislature just \u201cpunted\u201d the Medicaid expansion football into next year, saying that a very serious \u201cconversation\u201d needs to be had to address this health care-covering problem that \u201cdoes not seem to go away\u201d:\n\nI am opposed to taking Medicaid dollars in a way that has a lot strings. I am very support of having a conversation, because the problem does not go away, whether we do the fixed program the Senate has proposed, or whether we do not make any proposal, we need to have a conversation. If we are not going to do any kind of a combo fix or otherwise, we still have the people in the state of Florida who fall where they can\u2019t afford health insurance, yet are too poor to be on Medicaid, or they are not getting health insurance. That problem exists.\n\nStargel went on to add that she firmly believes that federal dollars are taxpayer dollars being held hostage:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government bailed out Florida's embattled legislature by giving them more Low Income Pool (LIP) dollars to pay for health care.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The federal government bailed out Florida's embattled legislature by giving them more Low Income Pool (LIP) dollars to pay for health care.", "title": "Obama Bails Out Florida Legislature - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Florida-legislature-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/22/obama-bails-out-florida-legislature/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government bailed out Florida's embattled legislature by giving them more Low Income Pool (LIP) dollars to pay for health care.", "creator": "@THESHARKTANK1", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Florida-legislature-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama Bails Out Florida Legislature - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Andy Gardiner, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Florida, Kelli Stargel, Low Income Pool, medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Medicine, Rick Scott, steve crisafulli,Big Government, Obama, Obamacare,florida", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "steve crisafulli", "published_time": "2015-05-22T20:49:07-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e1a\"", "article_summary": "Stargel went on to add that she firmly believes that federal dollars are taxpayer dollars being held hostage:\nBasically, what has just happened is that the Florida legislature just received a one-year health care bailout and will have to address this problem next year.\nThese additional state dollars allow Florida to mitigate the loss of LIP funding in the short term.\nIn summary, CMS has outlined a step back to the traditional (pre-2014) level of LIP funding.\nSpecial Session will give us the opportunity to address health care within the context of our budget."}
