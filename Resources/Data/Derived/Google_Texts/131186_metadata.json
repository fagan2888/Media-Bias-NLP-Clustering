An insurance company can't turn you down based on a preexisting condition.\n\n\u2014 Many people who purchase on the exchange will be eligible for help.\n\nIf you are an individual earning up to $45,900 a year, or a family of four earning up to $94,200 a year, you might qualify for premium subsidies that could substantially lower your cost.\n\n\u2014 There are five types of plans - bronze, silver, gold, platinum and catastrophic, which are high deductible plans available for young adults and people with financial hardships.\n\nBronze plans tend to have the lowest premiums among the metal tiers. The lower your premium, the higher your cost sharing.\n\n\u2014 Regardless of the plan you choose, you will have a maximum out-of-pocket cost limit: no more than $6,350 for an individual plan and $12,700 for a family plan, so long as you stay in the plan's network.\n\nThat means no matter how high your health care costs are, your out-of-pocket expenses for covered benefits will be capped. Premiums do not count toward the cap.\n\n\"The fact that there is maximum out-of-pocket protection in the marketplace cannot be overstated,\" noted Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society.\n\n\"This is the economic security part of the law that people don't understand.\"\n\nNow that you have the basics, it's time to get to work.\n\nYou don't want to leave this big decision to the last minute, especially if this is your first time buying insurance.\n\nKeep in mind, exchange plans have some unique features that require your attention.\n\nIf you don't meet the deadline, you may not be able to buy a health insurance plan until the next enrollment period begins on Nov. 15.
